58e4b77ba3d24b281b1019ba,"In western UP, Muslim loyalty shifts to Akhilesh",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-western-up-muslim-loyalty-shifts-to-akhilesh/articleshow/56322927.cms,2017-01-04,"Mulayam's son and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav +Akhilesh is the creator of all things beautiful in Uttar Pradesh +TAWLI (UP): The unending 'dangal' or bout in the Yadav parivar has forced everyone associated with the Samajwadi Party to pick sides.Sitting near his home in the heart of West UP's sugarcane country and dragging deep on his hookah, Mohammed Yaqub Chowdhury talks unhesitatingly about his choice. The 75-year-old, better known as Yaqub Mukhia, left Congress about two decades ago and joined the Samajwadi Party. He liked its founder Mulayam Singh Yadav (""garibon ka saathi""), canvassed for the party, acted as a polling agent, and when required, loaded buses and tractors with supporters to MSY rallies in nearby Muzaffarnagar and in faraway Lucknow.But that was then. In recent times, Yaqub has switched allegiance and become a firm supporter of, describing him ""as good as Charan Singh""  the founder of Lok Dal, from Baghpat, now his son Ajit Singh's constituency.Yaqub's isn't a solitary voice. For decades now, the former village head has been influencing Muslim votes in Tawli. Located 10km from Muzaffarnagar town, the village has a population of over 13,000. Many are Muslims. That he owns 120 bigha land further enhances his clout. ""Most of us listen to him,"" chorused a bunch of his associates sitting nearby.What Yaqub is to Tawli, Ainuddin is to Nirmani and Nooruddin Hassan is to Kabirpur. Ainuddin, now 80, is still known as Ainuddin sarpanch although he doesn't hold the post any more. And Nooruddin, 55, is a village mukhiya. They are also SP workers who command respect and votes in their community. They too joined the party impressed by Mulayam, campaigned for him and have now decided to bat for Akhilesh. They are not bothered whether a father-son rapprochement comes about. And they are not losing sleep over who gets the cycle symbol or whether it is frozen. ""Nishan rahe na rahe, hum to Akhilesh ke saath hain (symbol or no symbol, we are with Akhilesh,"" says Ainuddin, once ""a half-hearted"" CPI worker who was drawn to SP by the word 'Samajwadi' (socialist). ""Our village has around 1,500 Muslim voters. If there's a split, about 90% will vote for Akhilesh,"" Ainuddin said.Yaqub too estimates that at least 90% Muslims from his village will vote for Akhilesh. Incredibly, even Nooruddin offers the same figure. Who are the remaining 10% of Muslims likely to vote for? The answer is BSP, largely. Only a handful might vote for Congress  that's the general view.For the trio and others around them,today. Yaqub calls him 'vikas purush' (man of development); ironically, a sobriquet first given to his father by SP supporters. An associate reels out a list of ""achievements"" by Akhilesh: waiving loans, distributing laptops and phones, improving PDS, and increasing duration of electricity. ""And if you dial 108 from any village, the ambulance reaches immediately,"" Yaqub says. Adds Ainuddin, ""Usme kisi kism ka daag nahi hai (Akhilesh is blemish-less)."" Nooruddin sums up the mood, ""No CM has done as much as him.""Every political battle has its own cast of heroes and villains, going by the viewer's perception and prejudices. For senior party workers, Mulayam is a ""good"" leader who has allowed himself to be surrounded by ""unworthy"" friends and associates. ""Uske ghar mein chor aa gaye hain (there are thieves in his house now),"" says Yaqub. Ainuddin feels that the 77-year-old should make way for his deserving son. ""If a son is surging ahead, his father should just let him take the lead,"" he says.They all accept the analogy that the senior SP politician is like a great batsman past his prime, unwilling to hand over the captaincy to a dynamic youngster. ""We don't know about Etawah and other areas which are Mulayam's stronghold. But here in West UP, Muslims are firmly behind Akhilesh,"" says Ainuddin. His kinsmen nod in agreement."

Another reason for the slow sale is the late start to the season.The dip in sales comes at a time during a season when sugar production has been hit due to less cane. Maharashtra, which produces 34 per cent of the countrys sugar, has reported 6.33 lakh hectare of cane and sugar production is estimated to be 445 lakh tonnes as compared to the 742 lakh tonnes of sugar produced last season.Watch What Else Is making NewsSanjeev Babar, managing director of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation said, demonetisation has played a major role in the dip of sugar sales. Retail customers constitute 25 per cent of the sugar consumption and that market has been hit the hardest. Many retail customers have curtailed their sugar purchases, he said. Cyclic nature of the business has resulted in sugar sales being affected across the supply chain, which leads straight to the sugar mills. In want of liquidity in the markets, consumers, Babar said, have been cautious in their buying and also have cut down on the monthly stock they normally kept.Another reason for the slow sale is the late start to the season. Babar said besides Maharashtra, states like Uttar Pradesh has also witnessed less sales. Sales might pick up as the season progresses, he said.Meanwhile, Sugar Commissioner Dr Vipin Sharma has called a hearing of millers who have failed to pay 100 per cent of the fair and remunerative price to the millers (FRP). Mills have paid Rs 3,041.80 crores to growers which amounted to 82 per cent of the total amount to be paid.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

His great-great-great-grand father from Uttar Pradesh was taken as an indentured labourer to the South American country to work in sugarcane fields.The 36-year-old leader said the Dutch hired labourers from India to work in sugarcane fields in its colony of Suriname to replace African workers, following the abolition of slavery.Today, 30% of Surinames population comprises people of Indian origin, besides Afro-Surinames and Japanese who immigrated from Indonesia, Adhin said."

They include Mauritius, Fiji, Guyana, Trinidad and Tobago and Suriname.Delivering the keynote address at the Youth Pravasi Bharatiya Divas, Suriname vice-president Michael Ashwin Adhin said: ""The transformation of India implies an 'influential India' at the global level. But the question is: Why do I need an influential India?"" Emphasizing greater economic and technological cooperation between India and Suriname, he said: ""Today, nearly 20% of Suriname's population comprises east Indians (referred to as Hindustanis). They started as labourers brought to Suriname from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar between 1873 and 1916. These people did not forget the cultural values they had brought with them from India. Now Suriname Indians have acquired key positions in the government."" Appealing to India to play the role of a big brother, Adhin said: ""Monopoly in business should be reduced and the rise of new nations should be encouraged to ensure balance of power. Technologies like artificial intelligence and robotics should be used to reduce the cost of living. India should emerge as superpower not only because it has potential but also because it has spirituality and values that define a vishwa guru (world leader). There should be mutual benefits for both the nations.""Stating that Suriname has rich deposits of gold and bauxite along with a vast forest cover, Adhin said, ""We are a green and a blue economy .With technology from India, we can also compete."""

A discussion with stakeholders connected to issues concerning Girmitiyas showed that it was not just scholarships that they wanted for their children, but a chance to play the quintessential Indian sports cricket and hockey. Girmitiyas are labourers of Indian origin who moved to foreign nations during the British rule.Ministry of External Affairs has now written to BCCI and Hockey India to see if they can offer training and they have to get back to us on the modalities, said Joint Secretary (Latin America and Carribean) Ashok Das.There are an estimated 8.5 million Girmitiya descendants across 25 countries. While their OCI cards, announced by PM Narendra Modi is the fulfillment of much wanted wish, attempts are being made to create archives of the original indentured labourers who travelled to Mauritius, Fiji, Guyana and Suriname as early as 1834.Minister for Culture and Arts and Social Integration and Economic Empowerment of Mauritius Prithvirasing Roopun said the first batch of 38 labourers came to Mauritius from Chota Nagpur area through Calcutta by ship to reach the Aapravasi Ghat or the Immigration Depot at Port Louis in Mauritius. Mauritius was the first place of the so called experiment by the British imperialists of the free contract system and they were recruited to work in the sugar fields. The Aapravasi Ghat was not just a stopping point, but was the transit point for British to transport labourers and an estimated 5 lakh Indian labourers are said to have passed this place, he said.Batting for preservation, the Minister said it was not just the sites, objects and old photos, but also the language. Mauritius now boasts of a 24-hour television channel in Bhojpuri, apart from being studied as a language. Many labourers who left were from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar."

Deeptiman Tiwary Khap leaders at the January 8 rally. Deeptiman TiwaryModi tere raj mein, munji gai byaj mein, aur prali gai sharam-lihaz mein (Modi, under your government, all my paddy crop has gone into paying off debts and the hay had to be donated). THIS ONE-LINER painted behind a tractor-trailer chugging towards the Shamli sugar factory with a load of sugarcane captures the mood among Jat farmers in the Shamli-Kairana-Muzaffarnagar belt of western Uttar Pradesh, which votes in the first phase of the Assembly elections on February 11.With payment from sugar factories sluggish, minimum support price for crops stagnant, crop loan debts on the rise and the rabi sowing season impacted by demonetisation, Jat farmers, the dominant votebase in this region, are up in arms against the BJP. So much so, that almost all Khap panchayats here have declared that they will vote to defeat the BJP, this time.Jats had voted overwhelmingly in favour of the party in the 2014 parliamentary polls and were instrumental in BJPs clean sweep in this part of the state. But, on January 8, around 35 Khap leaders and thousands of Jats from UP and Haryana gathered at Kharad in Muzaffarnagar, under the banner of Jat Arakshan Sangharsh Samiti, to declare that the community would not vote for the BJP again.The rally was significant for its presence of Muslim Jats and speeches in which the BJP was accused of spreading communal hatred. And, although the key concern expressed at the rally was the denial of reservation to Jats, much of the talk among community leaders is also about problems plaguing the farming sector, lack of visible development and the aftermath of the Muzaffarnagar riots.There is a lot of anger among Jats against the Narendra Modi government. Not only has it denied reservation to Jats, none of the development promised has come about. Just go out and see, has anything changed? The farmer is suffering. Modi promised so much that we ended up defeating our own Ajit Singh (Rashtriya Lok Dal). It wont happen again, says Chaudhary Subhash Baliyan, 48, Sarva Khap Mahamantri, which covers 365 Khaps in UP and Haryana.Baliyan says that the Muzaffarnagar riots in 2013 gave a lease of life to BJP in western UP, but the price had to be paid by Jats. Our children are in jails. Is the BJP helping them get justice? Once their leaders became ministers, no one came to visit us. Among Muslims, the poorest bore the brunt. Havent they contributed to Indias freedom struggle? The BJP just wants us to keep fighting among ourselves, he says.This sentiment is echoed by Chaudhary Harkishan Singh of Gathwala Khap, one of the bigger Khaps in UP, with 52 villages under it. They precipitated the riots. Once it was over, we were left to fend for ourselves. We are ruing our decision to vote the BJP to power. The Jats political identity is linked to Ajit Singh and thats where they will go this time, claims the 89-year-old, who admits that he is an accused in several cases related to the Muzaffarnagar riots. Harkishan was represented by his son Rajender Malik at the Kharad rally.Chaudhary Naresh Tikait, chief of Balyan Khap that holds sway over 84 villages in UP, is not as vocal as the others but does not hide his displeasure with the Centre. I dont want to say who should be voted for and who shouldnt. But it is not just Jats, the farmer community as a whole is not happy with the Modi government. We feel cheated. We had expected sugar exports to be eased and sugarcane prices to go up to Rs 450 a quintal. We are also not getting the right price for our crops. None of what we expected has been delivered and on top of that, demonetisation has reduced farmers to poverty. This government has completely ignored farmers.Most Jats say that even though they are not happy with the Samajwadi Party, which they accuse of playing a partisan role in the riots, they would go with it if there is an alliance of SP, RLD and Congress. The common refrain for going with RLD is: Ajit kam se kam shor to machaega kisano ke liye (Ajit will at least make some noise for the farmers).The idea is to teach the BJP a lesson. Jats will go with whoever can achieve that. In that sense, at least, Jats and Muslims are together in these polls, says Chaudhary Jeetender Singh Hooda of Hooda Khap, which has 10 villages under it.Khap leaders such as Chaudhary Sanjay Kalkhande, 55-year-old chief of Kalkhande Khap that has 12 villages under it, are ready to vote for an SP candidate if the RLD and SP tie up. We have to agree that (UP Chief Minister) Akhilesh Yadav has done some development work. At least, roads have been built. Mulayam Singh Yadav, too, has spoken for farmers. The BJP is only interested in dividing society. They did it in UP first, then in Haryana, says Kalkhande.Hooda, however, is the most vocal on farmers issues. The BJP had said in its manifesto that farmers would get a price that is one and-a-half times their input cost. While input cost has almost doubled since then, prices are stagnant. Demonetisation has severely impacted farm incomes. We were forced to sell our Basmati paddy at 60 per cent of what we usually get. Similarly, jaggery sold for Rs 2,200 a quintal against the expected price of Rs 3,400, he says.This Khap leader was also critical of the import-duty waiver on wheat when the country had a decent harvest. It was the time for Indian farmers to earn. But the government wanted to help foreign farmers. BJP will pay, he says.Chaudhary Surajmal, 81, of Battisa Khap, which covers 32 villages, is concerned  and angry. Modis concern for farmers is limited to his speeches. Nothing happens on the ground. Earlier, MSP would be increased every year. But ever since Modi has come to power, it hasnt increased even once. Same is the case with price for sugarcane, which has increased only once by Rs 25 in the past few years and, that too, thanks to Akhilesh Yadav, says Surajmal.These leaders say that Jat farmers were expecting an announcement on farm-loan waiver from the Prime Minister on December 31, 2016. That it hasnt come across and interest-free loans given to sugar mills has not translated into clearing of farmers dues has disappointed us, says Chaudhary Rajinder Singh, 80, chief of Deswal Khap, with sway over 60 villages stretching to Aligarh and Mathura.In his speeches, the Prime Minister says payment to sugarcane farmers has been cleared. We havent received anything. Where has the money gone? He is paying mills. No one is paying us. This government is that of industrialists, not farmers, claims Singh.The mood among Jats in these parts is so bitter that they are not even ready to credit the government for the cross-LoC surgical strikes. What has it achieved? Attacks by terrorists have continued. Under no government have so many soldiers died, says Surajmal.The other big fear here is the threat of Income Tax raids, post demonetisation. We are not well-read. We dont understand this cashless system. Anyone can fool us. For every transaction and payment now, PAN card has to be furnished. They will soon begin to ask for tax from us, says Singh.According to him, while the common man has suffered hardship, demonetisation has turned all black money into white. Tell me, has corruption ended. Go anywhere even today, no work is going to get done without paying a bribe, he claims. Almost in exasperation, this Jat leader closes the argument in quintessential style: Kisan ka na koi khata, na Modi se ab koi naata (Farmer has no bank account and he will now have no connection with Modi).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Oinam Anand Outside a bank in Sherkot, Bijnor, UP. Oinam AnandITS BEEN over two months since demonetisation happened, but the queues before banks and ATMs in Brush Nagari  as this town in the Dhampur Assembly constituency of western Uttar Pradeshs Bijnor district is called  are still long and winding. Sherkot has around 600 small-scale and cottage industry units that produce an estimated 70 per cent of the painting and drawing brushes in India. They employ between 25,000 and 30,000 people from in and around the Nagar Palika town, which had a population of 62,226, according to the 2011 Census, of which over 74 per cent were Muslims and another 9 per cent Dalits.Notebandi has hit us badly. Sixty per cent of our units have shut, as theres no cash to pay workers, says Mohammad Ajmal, owner of Oskar Brush Products. The small home-based units, each engaging 10-25 labourers, have stopped working. Even the bigger ones  the 25 or so having 100-150 workers each  are running for eight hours, as against 12 before November 8 (when the old Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 denomination notes were banned), says Satish Kumar, a local brushware trader.Two things strike any first-time visitor to Sherkot. The first is the streetlight poles fitted with LED bulbs dotting not just the main, but even interior roads. This is being credited to the towns young municipal board chairman Qamrul Islam, who is from the ruling SP. The second is the long bank and ATM lines.Out of the four ATMs here, only the one belonging to HDFC functions occasionally. The second (of Punjab National Bank) is non-functional, the third (Bank of Baroda) was shut from November 8 till January 11, and the fourth (State Bank of India) has no money most of the time. Even the banks mostly give only Rs 1,000 at a time, says Keshav Singh, from Balkishanpur, a village nearby.For the current Assembly polls, the BSPs candidate from Dhampur is Mohammad Ghazi, who has a family business of manufacturing paint and art brushes under the Sajan and Charminar brands. Other leading brush makers from Sherkot include names such as Wilson, Sunrise, Jainco, A One, Panama and Master. These firms basically source the raw material  PVC or wooden handles, bristles and tin ferrules, which hold the hair or filaments on the handle, and epoxy glue  from outside and assemble the brushes using local labour.The brushes are hand-assembled, requiring special labour skills that youll find in this town, says Ghazis father Mohammad Khursheed, who came from Gungoh near Saharanpur in 1976 to establish a brush-making unit at Sherkot. Those days, we used only natural bristles like hair from pigs or from cattle and buffalo tails. But in the last 15 years or so, synthetic nylon filaments are mostly used.The BSPs electoral strategy this time is focused around Dalit-Muslim consolidation and capitalising on discontent due to demonetisation. Bijnor district has 43 per cent Muslims and 21 per cent Dalits, apart from it being home to industries like brush-making in Sherkot, glass-bottle manufacturing in Kiratpur and handlooms in Nehtaur, all of which have been impacted by demonetisation.While the BSP was the first to announce candidates for all of Bijnors eight Assembly seats and seems most poll-ready, as of now, Dalit-Muslim consolidation isnt, however, easy to achieve on the ground. Our heart is with SP. Even if the party splits between father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) and son (Akhilesh Yadav), we may go with the latter. His government has done a lot of work, especially in improving electricity supply. If Akhilesh bhaiya ties up with Congress and Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal, it makes our choice easier, says Syedul Hassan, a truck-owner from Nindru Khas, a village near Dhampur town.The BSP, on its part, is going all out to woo Muslims. The party has fielded Muslims in six of Bijnors eight constituencies (Bijnor, Najibabad, Dhampur, Barhapur, Chandpur and Noorpur), and Dalits in the remaining two (Nagina and Nehtaur), which are reserved seats. It has also projected the internal feud in the SP as a reason for the community not to waste its votes that will only benefit the BJP.What nasbandi (forced sterilisation) did to the Congress in 1977, notebandi will do to the BJP and parivarbandi (family feud) to the SP this time, claims Rasheed Ahmad, BSPs candidate from Bijnor who is also chairman of the Nehtaur municipality. The BJP, which is facing the heat from demonetisation, fancies its chances on a split in the Muslim vote as well as a reverse Hindu consolidation  plus of course, Prime Minister Narendra Modis personal popularity. In a three-cornered contest, the BJP has the edge in at least five seats (Dhampur, Barhapur, Nagina, Nehtaur and Noorpur), says the chief general manager of a sugar company that owns two of the districts nine mills.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

His is one of the two Muslim families left in Phugana village of Budhana district in Uttar Pradesh after the riots in 2013. Photo: R.V. MoorthyR_V_Moorthy;R_V_Moorthy -Shakoor Ahmed, a blacksmith, sits on his haunches, covered in a thick blanket and hard at work, with one of his grandchildren hovering in the background. Today, his is one of the just two Muslim families left in Fugana. Other members of the community  once 4,000 strong here  fled this village in Budhana tehsil, one of the areas worst affected by the communal violence that devastated Muzaffarnagar district in 2013.A Jat family saved Shakoors family during the riots. So he stayed on. Why did the others leave? Terror, fear, he says, one wary eye on the group of Jats who loom over him as he talks. And then in a burst, he says, Its not easy, you know, to uproot yourself from the land of your ancestors and begin a new life in strange surroundings.But that is precisely what most of the roughly 45,000 Muslims had to do after fleeing their villages for the safety first of relief camps and then of new single-community settlements. Shakoor, I discover later, was allowed to stay on in Fugana as he performs an important function  repairing farming implements. If he was not there, his Jat neighbours would have had to trudge to the nearest town for their work. He is there on sufferance.If Shakoor, after some prodding, declares his allegiance to the Samajwadi Party, his Jat saviours are vocal about their continuing support for the BJP, pointing to its muscular approach to national security. But barely two kilometres away, another group of Jat farmers, who say they voted for the BJP in 2014, are now vociferous in their support for the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).Last time, there was a pro-BJP wave, thanks to the Hindu-Muslim divide that was created. We all got swept away, Bijendra Singh says. But now, notebandi [demonetisation] has hit us very hard. Not just that, the BJP government has done nothing for farmers  it hasnt increased sugar cane prices, diesel has become more expensive, our loans are not being waived. Farmers are in distress. We will vote for [RLD leader] Ajit Singh this time.What about the SP? The SP has done nothing for us either, he says firmly.So though there is a consensus  as one travels through western U.P.  that the Hindu-Muslim polarisation that helped the BJP sweep the State in 2014 has faded, the embers of the 2013 communal conflagration glow in some places.The tension between the two communities that were at the heart of that bloody conflict, Jats and Muslims, has not quite gone away, making it hard for each to vote for the candidates of the other, as they once did.This has made the SP and the Congress wary of allowing the RLD, a largely Jat party, to become part of a Bihar-style grand alliance, though the RLD will field Muslim candidates too.Lack of trustPramod Tyagi, SP candidate for Budhana, articulates this view. He says the continuing lack of trust between Jats and Muslims will ensure that the RLD will not be able to transfer its votes to the SP-Congress alliance around which his party hopes the Muslims will cluster.But there is a contrary view not just from the RLD but also from the Janata Dal(U) that has been promoting an extended anti-BJP alliance, though it has little at stake in UP. Senior JD(U) functionary K.C. Tyagi, who is from this area, says, Jats dont vote in isolation. They want to be on the winning side. If the RLD is not part of the alliance, Jats may be more inclined to vote for the BJP.Giving some perspective to the whole issue is a long-time political watcher and three-time Congress MLA from Muzaffarnagar, Somansh Prakash. The Jat-Muslim tension, he says, may be a factor in Muzaffarnagar and Shamli districts, but there are over 80 constituencies across 19 districts in which the Jat vote is influential: the impact of the 2013 communal violence does not exist there at all today. A SP-Congress-RLD alliance will definitely create a bigger impact, and even bring in a larger number of Jats, who will see this as a winning combination."

And though as households, we spend only 3% of our monthly food budget on sugar, eventually we also pay for the more expensive sugar in ready-to-eat foods, ice creams, sweets, snacks, cold drinks, confectionery, and restaurant meals. The food and hospitality industry, which buys 65% of the country's sugar, passes on the price increases to us.Maharashtra, which contributes a third of India's total supply, is expected to produce 40% less sugar in 2016-17. In Karnataka, production is down 44% due to the drought. Together, that is loss of sugar enough for two months consumption.Due to the acute water scarcity, farmers in these two states did not plant new sugarcane crop in 2016-17. The ratoon crop also yielded less juice. At least 45 sugar factories in Maharashtra shut operations early because no cane is available. The rest will shut in the next one-and-a-half months. Since the slack in Maharashtra and Karnataka will not be compensated by the increased production in Uttar Pradesh, India may fall short of sugar to meet demand. By September end, when the 2016-17 sugar marketing closes, we are likely to be left with stocks enough for only 47 days. This will be the lowest in several years.In Uttar Pradesh, mills have produced 10% more sugar than last year and sales are brisk. As a result, farmers are being paid at least 75% of their bill within the 15-day deadline. The delayed payments are mainly by corporate groups with high debt and poor cash flows.While farmers and mills are coping well, consumers are less fortunate. The tight supplies have pushed up retail prices to above Rs 45kg in the metros just four months into the new sugar marketing year. Industrial consumers are also paying more in the wholesale markets. Sugar was 28% more expensive in December compared to the same month in 2015, shows latest Wholesale Price Index data.Luckily, ample sugar is available in Brazil, the world's largest producer and exporter. If customs duty is removed, raw sugar can reach India at Rs 40kg. That should provide much-needed relief to consumers.But the window of opportunity to import affordable sugar is small since global prices have risen 15% in the last one month and 41% in last 12 months.These tactical actions will not, however, address the stark reality that India will remain in this hand-to-mouth situation for several years ahead due to the combined challenges of rising consumption, water scarcity and climate change. Political intervention has further queered the pitch by distorting market signals that would have otherwise ensured more efficient water, land and capital utilization. And consumers aren't the only ones affected. Sugar industry is a key source of rural income and jobs.So making the industry more competitive overall is the only way to spread sweetness and light."

The retail prices of loose sugar has increased by Rs 8 per kg in the past one year and by at least Rs 2 a kg in the past one month. Increase in prices of sugar has become a matter of concern for the government just before the state polls in Uttar Pradesh and Punjab Sources said food ministry has informally told representatives of sugar industry body, ISMA not to exploit the sentiment of low production of sugar this year to make a killing. ""We can assess the cost of production and whether they are artificially pushing the retail prices. This won't be allowed at any cost,"" afood ministry official said. Sugar production this year is estimated at 22.5 million tonnes, which is the least in the past five years. Sources said the government has an action plan ready to rein in prices if necessary. But this will be rolled out once the production of sugar for this year is re-assessed. In its report on ""State of Sugar Industry"", market research agency Care Ratings said all India output is expected to decline for the second year in a row and production is likely to stand at around 22.5 million tonnes in sugar year October 2016-September 2017. Centre has maintained there will be no shortage. There is already a carry-over stock of 7.71million tonnes of sugar and another 22.5 million tonnes fresh sugar is estimated to be produced this year, which will be sufficient"

The party also nominated the former Brahmin face of BSP Brajesh Pathak from the Lucknow (Central) constituency.Furthermore, it accommodated former Samajwadi Party legislators Nand Kumar Nandi and Sunil Singh.

Hence, keeping in mind the economic and social development of Punjab, we have come up with unified programmes in our manifesto. Our priority will be to carry forward works initiated by the coalition.

The high court had reserved its decision in the matter on December 13, 2016 after conducting final hearing in a slew of writ petitions filed by petitioner VM Singh on behalf of Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangathan. The decision is expected to be delivered before January 26.According to petitioner V M Singh, the provisions of UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953 and Sugarcane Control Order, 1966 relate to levy of interest applicable to sugar mills in case the cane price is not paid to farmers within 14 days from the date of physical supply of produce to mills. However, these provisions were made ineffective by state government which decided to waive this interest to be paid by mill owners. The government had claimed this was being done to ensure that mills continued to function, and long term interest of farmers were protected.While talking with TOI on phone, Singh said due to the state governments waiver, sugar mills were freed from their liability to pay interest to cane growers for crushing year 2012-13 and 2013-14 on May 19, 2015 and for crushing year 2014-15 in October 2016. The amount of this interest added up to nearly Rs 2,100 crore, he added.As his two petitions were already pending with HC for decision on cane pricing as well as rights of cane growers, Singh challenged the interest waiver decision of the state government by filing an amendment application in the HC in August, 2016.In this application, it was argued that the farmers had been forced to seek loans from banks to meet their financial requirements in cases of untimely payment of their cane price from sugar mills. As they were made to pay interest on respective loans at assigned rate, they had full right of getting interest on their held up or delayed sugarcane payments at the rate of 15% per annum in accordance with the provisions of Sugarcane Control Order, Singh explained.The petitioner said HC was to decide the powers of the state government to waive interest and was likely to deliver a judgment soon."

While Samajwadi leaders were not keen on the RLD at all, the Congress had wanted a grand alliance with smaller parties and offered Ajit 18 Uttar Pradesh seats from its quota. Both Rahul Gandhi and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav were in touch with Ajit's son Jayant Chowdhary but changed their mind after the veteran insisted on 30-32 seats. The dominant view in the Samajwadi was that any alliance with the Jats could send the wrong message to Muslims in the aftermath of the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. The Congress initially wanted Jat support to bolster its chances in western Uttar Pradesh. But in refusing to part with 30 seats, it later anticipated a major dent in the BJP support base if the RLD contests aggressively in the region. The Jats had overwhelmingly supported the BJP in the 2014 general elections and the Haryana polls later that year. But a senior RLD leader said today: ""The 2014 election was unusual; the Modi wave swept away all traditional logic. But things are normal now and the results will be reflected in this election."" The RLD leader added: ""Jat means kisan (farmer). Narendra Modi had promised MSP (minimum support price) at least 50% above the average production cost. He also promised adequate and timely payment for sugarcane, the lifeline of western UP. He did nothing. The Jats have vowed to support Ajit Singh."" The RLD, angry at being left out of the Samajwadi-Congress tie-up, has decided to rope in rebels, mainly from the Samajwadi, to slice away huge chunks of votes. Speculation has also swirled an RLD alignment with Asaduddin Owaisi's AIMIM. The aim: to cut into Muslim votes, the Samajwadi-Congress alliance's mainstay."

They were asked not rely solely on agriculture ministry's cane output data.""The states have been told to collect mill-wise sugar yields instead of taking the states' average while estimating the sugar output so as to check if mills are under-reporting, the official said.""There are possibilities that mills may be underreporting production figures... The mill-wise sugar yields will help get the accurate picture,"" the official added.Sugar production of India, the world's second-largest producer and biggest consumer, is estimated to be lower in 2016-17 due to a possible sharp drop in Maharashtra and Karnataka due to drought. The output stood at 25.1 million tonnes during 2015-16 marketing year."

It is a fact that people have left their villages in large numbers owing to communal tension, Shah added.

Shah did not mention cow slaughter, which is banned in the state, but promised that all slaughterhouses - including the mechanised ones that operate under licence from the government - would be closed immediately if the BJP came to power. Slaughter of buffalo and of bull or bullock over the age of 15 and unfit for breeding is permitted in Uttar Pradesh. In September 2015, Dadri resident Mohammed Akhlaque was lynched by a mob that stormed his house on suspicion that he had slaughtered a cow. For about a year after that there had been a spurt in incidents of cow vigilantism, but these have now abated. ""Chief minister Akhilesh Yadav had given laptops to the members of a particular caste. But we will give free laptop to the youths of all the castes and communities when they join a college, along with 1GB Internet data free per month,"" the BJP manifesto promised. The reference was to a scheme of the Akhilesh government under which laptops were given free to all eligible students who had passed the intermediate exams. Although the scheme was for students of all communities, the BJP has often alleged that only Yadav students got the laptops. The 25-page manifesto, titled Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra, also returns to the Ram temple promise. It says: ""The BJP repeats its view on Ram temple - all the possibilities under the preview of the Constitution would be found out for construction of Ram temple in Ayodhya."" Shah said: ""This is something everybody is waiting to hear from us."" Asked why the BJP takes up the issue, which is pending in the Supreme Court, during elections and forgets thereafter, Shah said: ""We don't forget it. The hearing of the case will be held there in the SC after two days. I am saying we are looking for every option available under the constitutional norms."" This was the only issue in the manifesto that did not spell out the BJP's plan -whether the Narendra Modi government would try to enact a legislation in Parliament to hand over the disputed Ayodhya land to the Hindus or wait for the court verdict. The manifesto also promises legal assistance to Muslim women who have been a ""victim of triple talaq"". ""The state government will provide legal assistance to those Muslim women who want to fight against triple talaq,"" Shah said. Trying to keep those in good humour who expect the BJP to stick to its Hindutva agenda, the manifesto has promised to develop a ""cultural tourist circuit"" covering the important religious centres of Mathura, Ayodhya, Prayag (Allahabad), Vindhyachal, Chitrakoot, Kushinagar and Varanasi. At the same time, the party also went all out to woo the youths, farmers and Scheduled Castes. It promised 70 lakh jobs, 10 universities of international standard, engineering or polytechnic college in every district, free Wi-fi in colleges and universities, and free education for girls up to graduation. The document has four pages of promises for farmers, including waiving of bank loans of small and marginal farmers and giving then interest-free new loans. They constitute 90 per cent of the farmers in the state. ""The farmers will get a cheque against their sugarcane the moment the mills buy it. Bank loans would also be provided to landless farmers,"" Shah said. The scholarship of Dalit students would be increased and they would be provided loan on low interest rates for higher education. Reacting to the manifesto, Mayawati said: ""It is a bunch of jokes against the people. The BJP, during 2014 Lok Sabha election campaign, had promised Rs 15 lakh in the bank account of every Indian and later on Shah dubbed it as mere jumla (idiomatic or empty statement). Modi has not fulfilled even one-fourth of the promises he had made to the people during parliamentary elections. Now they are promising moon to the people of the state."" Akhilesh said: ""I had said earlier that the BJP would imitate me in its manifesto and the same has happened. They have stolen from my manifesto of 2012 in which I had promised laptops to youths, free education to girls and empowering police helpline. I have fulfilled all these promises. The BJP should have spent some time in innovating new ideas instead of stealing my old ideas."""

Film producer Dr Satish Rai, a Girmitiya with roots in Uttar Pradesh, is all set to make a movie on the subject.This first-of-its-kind film, titled Awaaz  the Girmit Conspiracy, has already received clearance from the UP government.Rai is a Sydney-based film producer, academician, politician and community development worker who has been holding talks with the UP government on issues concerning Girmitiyas. It was in 2015, during the first ever Pravasi Diwas organised by the state government that the idea to shoot a movie on the subject first came to me, he said.A big chunk of the film will be shot in UP, the worst-affected state during the dreadful indenture system (1828 to 1916), under which millions of Indians were herded off to British colonies to work as bonded labourers in cane plantations - the most profitable business of those times.Rai said the movie will primarily focus on the movements that were launched to abolish the indenture system - a form of slavery. This film will cover the epic story of the international struggles that were launched to abolish the dreadful system of labour trafficking.

It was a sort of debt bondage in which around 1.2 million Indians were deported to Fiji to work in cane farms. The majority of these people were from UP - from places like Gonda, Basti, Faizabad, Sultanpur, Azamgarh, Gorakhpur, Rae Bareli and other districts, said Rai, who is also an active member of the International Girmit Association.While the movie will be a work of fiction, it will be based on historical research and will features characters of internationally renowned public figures such as Pt Totaram Sanadhya, Kunti, Mahatma Gandhi, Annie Besant, Madan Mohan Malaviya, Sarojini Naidu, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Winston Churchill, Edward Knox and Thomas Hughes. Pt Totaram Sanadhya and Kunti were two indentured Indians in Fiji who returned in 1914 to join the abolition movement and be at the forefront of the struggle, said Rai.The shooting will start after the UP assembly election.

Politics of nepotism and caste will be delivered a death sentence. It will be start of the politics of performance, Mr. Shah said.Months after BJP MP Hukum Singh claimed that bad law and order situation was causing Hindus to migrate from Kairana, adjoining Muzaffarnagar, the party has vowed to constitute a special department in the police and appoint a deputy collector in every district, especially in western Uttar Pradesh, to prevent migration due to communal tension.Demography changedDue to communal tension, villages were emptied and U.P.s demography changed... Mr. Shah further said. If a government follows politics of appeasement for vote banks, it cannot give justice to all citizens, he said while claiming that once his party comes to power FIRs would be lodged within 24 hours of a person filing a complaint, without any bias.The BJP reiterated its stand on the Ram Mandir, saying it will explore all possibilities within the purview of the Constitution to construct a Ram Mandir in Ayodhya.The party also referred to triple talaq, saying once in power in the State, it would push the case against it in the Supreme Court based on the opinion of Muslim women.Preservation of cowsPreservation of cows and promotion of dairy industry also featured prominently.The BJP promises to not only provide cows to landless farm labourers under the Godhan scheme but also shut down all illegal abattoirs and ban with immediate effect mechanised abattoirs in the State.Under the previous governments, there has been a fall in livestock. Due to illegal trafficking, the dairy industry is not growing in Uttar Pradesh, reads the manifesto. We want it to be like the times of Lord Krishna when rivers of milk and ghee flowed in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Shah said.The BJP also reached out to the peasant community, promising waiver of crop loans for marginal farmers, loan with zero interest rate for marginal farmers, and a system to ensure payment to sugarcane farmers within 14 days of sale and that their dues would be cleared within 120 days of the party coming to power."

It was in 2015, during the first ever Pravasi Diwas organised by the state government that the idea to shoot a movie on the subject first came to me, he said.A big chunk of the film will be shot in UP, the worst-affected state during the dreadful indenture system (1828 to 1916), under which millions of Indians were herded off to British colonies to work as bonded labourers in cane plantations - the most profitable business of those times.Rai said the movie will primarily focus on the movements that were launched to abolish the indenture system - a form of slavery.

(PTI) Jalalabad, Jan. 28: Rahul Gandhi today accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of backing the ""most corrupt person in the country"" - Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal. ""Corruption is most rampant in this state and Sukhbir Badal is the symbol of that. Modiji comes to Punjab and says he is against corruption, but backs Sukhbir - the most corrupt person in the country,"" Rahul claimed at a rally in Sukhbir's seat, Jalalabad. In the February 4 Punjab elections, Sukhbir is pitted against the Aam Aadmi Party's Bhagwant Mann and Congress MP Ravneet Singh Bittu, the grandson of slain chief minister Beant Singh. ""Every person in Punjab knows Sukhbir is corrupt, yet Modiji takes his side. Why is he by his side? This election will decide whether the people of Punjab are correct or Modiji,"" added Rahul. The Congress vice-president, on a three-day visit to Punjab, ends his campaign tomorrow in Lambi, the constituency of chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. Modi at a rally in Panaji on Saturday. (PTI) Modi is slated to address his second poll meeting in Moga's Kotakpura tomorrow. Yesterday, in Jalandhar, Modi had hit out at the Congress for aligning with the Samajwadi Party for the Uttar Pradesh polls. Congress sources said Rahul gunned for the ruling Akali Dal, the BJP's ally, to target Modi. ""Rahul questioned the reasons behind the BJP's courting the Akali Dal, which is corrupt and pursues a sectarian agenda,"" said a Congress leader. ""Be it running of TV channels or the transport sector, the Badals have a finger in every pie. Nobody sets up industry here because the Badals won't allow anyone to come without demanding a share."" Apart from Punjab Congress chief Amarinder Singh, cricketer-turned-politician Navjot Singh Sidhu was present at Rahul's rally in Jalalabad's Dana Mandi, around 278km from Chandigarh. Rahul told the people that some schemes the Akalis were tom-tomming as their own had been implemented because of the Food Security Act put in place by the Congress-led UPA regime and the funds provided to the state. After coming to power in 2007, the Akali regime had launched the atta-dal scheme to provide subsidised flour and pulses at Re 1 per kg and Rs 20 per kg respectively to people owning less than 2.5 acres and earning less than Rs 60,000 per annum. The scheme covers around 1.42 crore people at present. If returned to power, Sukhbir has promised to include sugar and ghee under the scheme. ""The atta-dal scheme happened because of the Food Security Act of the UPA government. The scheme is Manmohan Singh's but the Akalis carry their photo on the project,"" Rahul said. ""We also gave the right to rural employment. Unfortunately, the funds the UPA gave Punjab were misused by the Akali-BJP government."" Rahul also trained his guns on Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. ""Ask your relatives and friends who stay in Delhi whether they are happy, and they will tell you 'no'. The Delhi municipal corporation polls are approaching and the Aam Aadmi Party will get a battering,"" Rahul claimed."

The accused, Mathura resident Devendra Kumar, had been sacked for his involvement in criminal activities in 2007. UP Police had announced a reward of Rs 50,000 on his arrest.An STF team had been tracking Devendra for several days. Based on a tip-off, the team was sent to Kagrol in Agra for patrol checks. The accused arrived on a motorcycle.When the cops signaled him to stop for checking, he opened fire at them. The police returned fire and arrested him.Police seized a country-made revolver, two live cartridges and one TVS Apache motorcycle from his possession.Raj Kumar Mishra, deputy SP (Noida STF), said Devendra was a Class X passout and was selected as a UP Police constable in 1997. He was posted in Ambedkar Nagar after his joining, and was shifted to Agra next year. Devendra robbed a businessman of Rs 3 lakh in Mathura in 2000. He was arrested, suspended from service and put behind bars for nine months.Police said that he made contacts in jail and continued to be involved in criminal activities after he was released. Devendra formed a gang with Harkesh, Hariom, Dharmendra and Dabbu Pandit, whom he had met in jail. The gang started robbing cars, gold and silver jewellery in UP and sold them to unscrupulous buyers in West Bengal. The government terminated his services in 2007 for his involvement in criminal activities. This did not deter the accused. In 2008, Devendra conducted a heist and robbed of 550 kg silver from a Tata Sumo in Firozabad district. In 2009, he again robbed 50 kg silver from a businessman in Agra. Police said that Devendra and his gang members also killed a truck driver who resisted the robbery of a truck loaded with sugar in Madhya Pradesh in 2011.He was again arrested and imprisoned for two years in 2012. Devendra met Vinod Kumar when he was released from jail in 2014.

Photo: K. UmashankerK_ UmashankerA 50-member group of seven nomadic families from Madhya Pradesh, camping near the local sugar factory here, are attracting the attention of meat shop workers and farmers by selling products such as machetes, axes, grass-cutters, and farm equipment.They call themselves as blacksmiths of the Lohar community.Experts in making machetes and various kinds of kitchen knives, Lohars do not need any publicity. After finishing their trips in Kerala and Tamil Nadu, the families entered Chittoor a couple of days ago.Head of the group, 76-year-old Harishi, who hails from Bhopal, selected the Kanikalamma temple zone near the sugar factory. Temporary sheds were erected in no time. Work commenced on a war-footing, right from procuring iron material from gujrees (shops selling waste material), melting them, and casting iron sheets.Quick at knowing customer pulseThey would wind up the roadside business in a fortnight and proceed to some other destination.Members of the group are very quick in grasping the requirements of their customers, mostly meat shop workers and farmers. The implements would be made on the spot.Information about their arrival spreads like wildfire, hardly missing the ears of prospective customers in a radius of 20-25 km.Quality aspectLocal patrons say that they can purchase a very fine machete for Rs. 120 and an axe for Rs. 100.If we miss these people, we will have to shell down double the price for the implements that dont match the quality of those made by the Lohars, they say.Mr. Harishi said that he had come to Chittoor as a young man nearly five decades ago.Chittoor is the gateway to Tamil Nadu and Karnataka as we travel by South-bound trains. We remember our nomadic haunts and places of luck. We call it genetic memory. We keep going without rest. To lead our life with happiness, we have to compete with quality levels and, at the same time, win the confidence of patrons, he said. Their roadside business would run round the clock in shifts. Women, young girls, and children too join the job, hitting and shaping iron lumps and sheets. What all they earn would go for their food and travel expenses.Till five years ago, we used to make ticketless travel in general compartments of various trains. Now, we are afraid. We cant risk our entire amount to be taken away during checks, said Renuka Lohar, a young woman of the group.They admit that they never thought of educating their children.Senior men of the group said that nearly a hundred families of blacksmiths from MP and parts of Uttar Pradesh keep roaming the entire country, split into a number of groups.Thanks to mobile phones, all our families remain connected, said Balaji Lohar."

Both parties attacked the Narendra Modi government for pushing through the budget just before five States, including Uttar Pradesh, went to elections.By announcing the budget in the middle of the polls, the Modi government was trying to draw political and electoral advantage from it, BSP chief Mayawati said in her response. The Budget provides no immediate relief or facilities to 90 per cent of Indians affected by demonetisation, she said, predicting that it would further aggravate the problem of poverty and unemployment, especially in rural areas.The four-time CM of U.P. said the NDA budget neglected the poor, labourers and farmers and did not appear to be in public welfare, and accused the Modi government of only bringing in policies for the benefit of the corporates.Both the SP and BSP, however, did not comment on the cap on donation to political parties introduced in the budget.SP spokesperson Rajendra Chaudhary said the budget was a betrayal of the people of U.P., in particular farmers.He said that by releasing the budget right before the polls the Modi government had disrespected the suggestions of the Election Commission.Mr. Chaudhary said the Budget did not have any proposal for the waiver of farm debt and it was a betrayal of the farming community. He said the Modi government had nothing to offer to sugar cane farmers and those affected by natural calamities.Both parties accused the Centre oftrying to draw electoral advantage from the budget"

(Source: PTI photo) The crowd at Madhav Kunj Maidan cheered Modi every time he targeted his opponents. (Source: PTI photo)At his first election rally in Uttar Pradesh since polls were announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi attacked the Samajwadi Party and Congress, saying the corrupt had joined hands to bring him down.Saying he wanted to return UPs debt to him for making him the PM  the BJP won 72 of the 80 Lok Sabha seats in the state  Modi urged people to get rid of gangs and SCAM, so that development could be brought to the state, jobs could be provided to youths and security could be ensured for women. By SCAM, I mean S for Samajwadi (Party), C for Congress, A for Akhilesh (Yadav) and M for Mayawati. If you want to change UPs fate, change the government. You demolish the rule of SCAM with your votes, the PM said.He added, No matter how I try to help UP from Delhi, if the state government is not in our side, nothing can take place.In his hour-long speech at the meeting, dubbed Vijay Shankh Nad rally, corruption, nepotism, criminalisation and opportunism remained the main themes, with Modi talking of surgical strikes, demonetisation and the Union Budget sparingly. He also concentrated his attacks on the SP and Congress, and mentioned the BSP only twice.The crowd at Madhav Kunj Maidan cheered Modi every time he targeted his opponents.The BJP is facing a tough battle in western Uttar Pradesh, a region where it had made considerable gains in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls following the 2013 communal violence. BJP leader Chandra Mohan admitted the party campaign here would focus on law and order, alleged exodus of Hindus from the region, and the plight of sugarcane farmers.Invoking Meeruts link to the beginning of the 1857 mutiny against the British, the PM said he had chosen the city to start the war against poverty, corrupt forces and land-grabbers.It is the people of UP who made me the Prime Minister. And I have done everything in my capacity to bring honour to the state. Its been two and a half years. Is there any spot on me? However, I have not been able to repay my debt. I can repay my debt to the people of Uttar Pradesh only by joining hands with a state government that will work with me, he said.Only about Rs 2,800 crore of the Rs 7,000 crore the Centre had sent to UP for healthcare development in 2015-16 was spent and not even Rs 40 crore of the Rs 950 crore sent for Swachh campaign was used, the PM claimed. The funds could have been diverted by SP leaders, he added, but they could not do it because of him. Ye Modi hai, pai-pai ka hisaab manga hai (This is Modi. He accounts for each paisa).Modi went on to accuse Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav of using Central funds for particular communities for vote-bank politics. It (the SP government) believes if the money cannot be spent on those who are its vote bank, it will let the funds rot. Tell me if assistance to those who are ill should be based on vote-bank politics, he said.The PM also ridiculed the new SP-Congress alliance, after the Congress had spent years criticising the SP government. Raaton raat, aisa kya ho gaya (What changed overnight)? They are embracing each other. They are sitting on each others shoulders to help each other. But those who could not save themselves cannot save UP, the PM said as the crowd cheered him.Targeting the Mulayam Singh Yadavs familys internal fights, Modi said, The whole day the government is busy with uncle, son, papa, nephew If you want to change UPs fate, change the government.Addressing the note ban issue, the PM said his move had upset those who had accummulated wealth over 40 years and filled their rooms with currencies. Those who filled rooms with currency notes collected by selling party tickets are very anguished as I forced them to deposit their money in banks. I knew they would all gang up against me. They will kick up a storm because Modi has robbed them.He reiterated his commitment to eradicate black money. Modi will not sit in peace until the fight against corruption reaches a conclusion. I will not let the robbers rest.Modi also tried to evoke the nationalism plank, which had earlier kept the party upbeat, by referring to the border surgical strikes, One Rank One Pension issues, and the Diwali he spent with soldiers. Now countries across the world are studying as to how Indian forces did such an operation on Pakistani soil. We made them (enemies) account for everything, the PM said.Criticising those who had expressed doubts on the surgical strikes, he said, Some of them doubted the operation because no Indian soldier lost his life.He reiterated the partys promise to waive loans of small and marginal farmers and to pay the dues of sugarcane growers within 14 days of coming to power.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

He attacked the SP rule for encouraging mafias and goondaraj, and blamed the State government for lack of growth in the world-famous lock industry of Aligarh.After his acronym SCAM for the SP, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati on Saturday, Mr. Modi coined another at his rally on Sunday  VIKAS which, he said, stood for vidyut (electricity), kanoon (law and order) and sadak (roads).Lock industry ruinedAddressing a huge rally on the Numaish ground in Aligarh, Mr. Modi said, Here in front of me I can see a saffron sea. When a storm comes, everyone looks for a safe shelter. Similarly, in the storm of peoples support for BJP, the Chief Minister here has joined hands with anyone he found. But, the fact is, that wont save him from the storm.Mr. Modi accused the SP government of ruining the lock industry of Aligarh and said, The present government of the State has nothing to do with development. The Aligarh locks used to be world-famous, but the State government has made sure that the manufacturing units were shut down and the Aligarh locks were used to lock them. The lock industry is no longer in a great situation.The manufacturing units were shut down because the State government in Lucknow could not provide them with electricity. People at tea stalls and hotels talk how electricity came on specific days of a week. But the times have changed. We are working all day and night to ensure that electricity reaches every home. We are working for U.P.s VIKAS, Mr. Modi said.Accusing the entire Opposition of ganging up against him because of the Central governments moves against corruption, the Prime Minister said, These days some people are issuing fatwa against me because I have started tightening the screws. Through demonetisation, I asked for an account of the crimes they have committed for the last 70 years. These people have nothing to do with development. They came together only to ensure that Modi doesnt get a majority in the Rajya Sabha and he is unable to make laws to curb and expose their corruption.Recruitment scamHe raised the issue of allegations of corruption and discrimination in favour of youth belonging to the Yadav community in recruitment by the Akhilesh Yadav government and promised elimination of all kinds of corruption from the recruitment for government jobs in the State.Widows pensionExpressing shock at the reports of corrupt people withdrawing money out of a widows pension from banks, Mr. Modi said, the corrupt are flourishing under the present U.P. government. To stop this, we have, from the Centre, linked pensions to Aadhaar cards and bank accounts. Forty thousand crore of the treasury that these rats would have silently eaten, is now being saved.Mr. Modi told the gathering, many of whom were farmers: The Akhilesh government buys only three per cent of grains from farmers. But we gave Rs. 22,000 crore to sugarcane farmers. Give us an opportunity, we will change the situation completely.Touting shocking crime figures to underline his point of the goondaraj in the State being patronised by the SP government, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said, There are 24 rapes in Uttar Pradesh daily."

(Anupam Trivedi/ HT Photo)At Jaspur, the crowd goes berserk. BJP ko sabak sikha kar hi dam lenge sahab (well teach the BJP a lesson), they shout as the chopper lands. Having an experience of five decades in active politics, CM senses the public mood. He takes position atop an SUV and starts the roadshow, waving hands, and accepting sweets and garlands while moving through the narrow lanes of Jaspur, which has 1.3 lakh voters including 32,000 Muslims and 18,000 Chauhans.BJP thought we have gone bankrupt (after three-time local MLA joined the saffron party), says Rawat. He is hopeful that political greenhorn Adesh Chauhan has a good chance in this constituency, bordering Uttar Pradesh.The next stopover is Kashipur. In 2012 polls, a rebel had eaten into the Congress votes here, but this time it is the BJP that is facing the problem with its former MLA Rajeev Agarwal contesting as an independent. The constituency has a mix of Muslim, Kumaoni and Sikh voters. Congresss Manoj Joshi had lost last polls by 2,200 votes. He is again in the fray. Manoj lag jao, ye tempo banaye rakho (maintain the tempo), CM instructs.Rawat spends maximum time in Bajpur. BJP has fielded Congress turncoat Yashpal Arya from the seat.As Rawat speaks, Harvinder Singh, a Sikh farmer listens patiently. He nods his head when CM says, Bhajpa wale Congress mein sahara dhoond rahe hain (BJP is looking for support from Congress leaders).Bajpur, an SC reserved seat, is traditionally a Congress stronghold. Harvinder says he will stick with Congress. Rais Ahmad, a Muslim labourer, seconds Harvinder.The game-changerPeople used to say we have no chance in Bajpur but we proved them wrong. We have changed the rules of the game, Rawat tells HT.Congress has fielded Sunita Bajwa, wife of a Sikh BJP leader who joined Congress last month. Sunita hails from an SC family. This seat too has a mix of Muslims, Dalits, Sikhs and Tharus (tribals).Rawat stops every 50-70 meters. He exchanges greetings with the crowd near national highways. He is spending a good amount of time in two districts  US Nagar and Haridwar, which together have 20 seats. In 2012 polls BJP won 11 of these seats.Babuji (father) is full of energy. He never gives up. We want to become like him, Rawats son says as others try to keep pace with him.Its 9.30pm when CM addresses another meeting at Sultanpur Patti. He takes a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi referring him as Dilli wale Baba. I came to know that achhe din (good days) are stuck in Delhis traffic, Rawat says as the crowd cheers. He also talks about notebandi (demonetisation) here. Though demonetisation is not a political issue in the hills, it matters in the plains, where a large number of people survive on daily earnings.No breaks for CMCM refuses to take a break.

58ff18497be9e04136162600,"Get rid of SCAM, Modi tells UP voters; targets SP-Cong, Maya",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594755/get-rid-scam-modi-tells.html,2017-02-04,"Meerut, Feb 4, 2017, PTI: 16:58 ISTIn his first rally in Uttar Pradesh after polls were announced, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today alleged the corrupt he had ""robbed"" with note-ban have ganged up to bring him down and targeted the SP-Congress alliance, saying the two parties which abused each other till recently are now locked in an embrace to save themselves.Modi asked the people in Uttar Pradesh to ""rid the state of SCAM - S for Samajwadi (party), C for Congress, A for Akhilesh (Yadav) and M for Mayawati"", saying they have to choose between development agenda of BJP and those who give shelter to criminals, indulge in vote bank politics and encourage land and mine mafias.In his over-an-hour-long address, he spoke at length about corruption, law and order and nepotism allegedly prevailing in the state as he sought people's vote for BJP to change the state's fate. ""It is UP which made me the Prime Minister,"" Modi said, adding that he wanted to repay its debt and that he can do it only with a government that joins hands with the Centre to develop the state unlike the current dispensation which is a ""hindrance"" in its progress.Attacking Congress and Samajwadi Party, he said Congress ran a campaign against the Samajwadi Party government and wondered as to what happened that both have now joined hands. ""What happened that overnight they are embracing each. Those who could not save themselves cannot save UP,"" he said. Wooing farmers, he reiterated the party's promise of waiving loans of small and marginal farmers and paying the dues of sugarcane growers within 14 days of coming to power.Playing the pro-poor and pro-farmers card, a plank BJP has assiduously tried to claim for some time, Modi said the recent budget was all about them besides the middle class. Noting that the rebellion against the British rule in 1857 had started from Meerut, Modi said he has chosen this place to start the war against poverty, corrupt forces and land grabbers. The Prime Minister again attacked the opposition parties over demonetisation and surgical strikes to strike a chord with the audience as he said he was determined to cleanse the system at the top and was not interested in small fights.""Those who filled rooms with currency notes collected by selling party tickets are very anguished as I forced them to deposit their money in banks with an announcement at 8 PM on November 8.... ""I knew they will all gang up against me. They will kick up a storm because Modi has robbed them and they will bring him down.""Do you think that corruption should be ended and black money finished off? I have been doing this and will not rest nor will let these robbers rest. No matter how many of them gang up to oppose me, my fight will not stop. Modi will not stop,"" he said. Targeting Congress, he said a minister in the party-run Karnataka government has been found in possession of Rs 150 crore and but it has not taken any action against him.Targeting Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, he said first his concern was all about family, then about himself and now it is about the chair. Those accused of running mine mafia, patronising criminals, rapists and land-grabbers have been given tickets in SP, he alleged."
593ba7df7be9e0066b6f5e72,Litchi scientists scoff at study alarm,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170204/jsp/bihar/story_133849.jsp,2017-02-04,"Feb. 3: A national crop institution in Bihar has questioned suggestions by Indian and US government scientists that consumption of litchi on an empty stomach may have contributed to child deaths from encephalitis in Muzaffarpur among other sites. Senior scientists at the National Research Centre on Litchi (NRCL), Muzaffarpur, have challenged the findings of the Indo-US study that corroborated three-year old suspicions that the sweet litchi fruit contains certain compounds that may cause blood sugar to fall to dangerously low levels. They have described the Indo-US study as ""academic"" and said that it has relied on too small a sample of patients for general conclusions. They claimed the NRCL has also examined encephalitis deaths and not found any link to litchis. The study by the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) and India's National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), seeking to investigate the causes of recurrent and unexplained outbreaks of encephalitis in young children, had confirmed that the illness is associated with the consumption of litchi toxins. The CDC-NCDC scientists found that naturally occurring toxins in litchis caused blood sugar levels to fall, leading to the symptoms of encephalitis. It prompted them to recommend that children and other vulnerable individuals should avoid consuming litchi on an empty stomach. NRCL director Vishal Nath questioned the study. ""We do not believe these findings, they are academic in nature and far from reality,"" he said. ""We do not know how they arrived at their findings; the NRCL was never taken into cognisance at any time during the investigation."" The CDC-NCDC scientists questioned the family members of 390 patients with encephalitis, all below the age of 15 years, about litchi consumption and detected the presence of hypoglycin-A and another compound called MCPG - natural substances that can cause drops in blood sugar. Nath claimed the NRCL had itself carried out investigations on the deaths of children and could not establish any connection with litchis. ""Cases of encephalitis have also been reported from other districts, including Gaya, and Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, where litchi is not produced. The deaths include young children - one year and one-and-half years old; how much litchi can a year-old baby consume?"" Nath asked. He said the study may bring a ""bad name"" to a fruit high in nutritive value, adding that the findings appear to have been compiled ""in haste"" as the term of the team investigating the cause and risk factors was coming to an end. Bihar makes up 70 per cent of India's litchi produce and accounts for 54 per cent of the country's area under litchi plantation. Litchi is mainly cultivated in Muzaffarpur, Vaishali, Sitamarhi, West and East Champaran, Darbhanga and Samastipur. A senior diabetes specialist not associated with the Indo-US study has described it as significant enough to justify a public health advisory. ""This is a solid study; young children and adults on treatment for diabetes with insulin or multiple drugs should take care when consuming litchi,"" said Anoop Misra, chairman of the Fortis diabetes centre in New Delhi, and director of the National Diabetes Obesity and Cholesterol Foundation. Misra said the findings support recommendations that such vulnerable populations should avoid eating litchis on an empty stomach or after fasting. Consuming the fruit on a full stomach would compensate for the sugar-lowering risk of the toxins, he said. Indian public health authorities have for over five years been struggling to understand the cause of unexplained encephalitis - also labelled as acute encephalitis syndrome - in eastern Indian states. While some say encephalitis is caused by the Japanese encephalitis virus, doctors have been trying to determine the cause of the mystery encephalitis. In 2012, a local doctor had suggested that the disease may be caused by excessive heat and low blood sugar in children. In 2013, Indian virologist T. Jacob John and others had suggested the low blood glucose linked to litchi consumption may be causing the encephalitis."

He also made a reference to slaughterhouses, in a joke, juxtaposing it with a specific caste.An aggrieved elderly citizen belonging to the Jat community once visited our office to register his complaint. He told me that one morning, while he was carrying his sugarcanes in a bullock cart to the nearby market for sale, he stopped mid-way to buy guavas. When he came back with the guavas, his bull was missing. I told him to register a complaint with the police because the UP police was already tracking Azam Khans lost buffaloes. But then he revealed that his bull was stolen by the slaughterhouse people, Shah said.As the crowd cheered to his dog-whistle narrative, Shah announced that the BJP, when it is voted to power, will come down on slaughterhouses from Day 1. When BJP comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, we will ban all unregulated slaughterhouses on Day 1, Shah said.Shahs speech also evoked the Dadri lynching incident, in which an unruly mob had lynched a Muslim man to his death, over allegations of cow slaughter. Bisada, the village where the incident took place, is located around 20km from Noida.In 2016, several incidents were reported across the Hindi heartland, in which cow vigilantes had beaten up meat transporters. The Bisada lynching and the cow vigilantism had attracted nationwide attention and saw BJP on the back foot as the party, including the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had earlier campaigned heavily against bovine slaughter.Even in 2014, during the Lok Sabha elections, party president Amit Shah and BJP leaders Sangeet Som and Sanjeev Balyan had faced criticism for their inflammatory speeches in western UP belt, in the wake of the Muzaffarnagar riots. Around 60 people were killed in the riots and thousands have been displaced.Shah also attacked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav saying that he asks for the caste and religion of the people before giving them free laptops. He said that only his party will not discriminate people on their caste or religion.Akhilesh Yadav promised free laptops to the youth of UP but have the Noida youth received any? It is because Yadav asks for your caste and religion before handing out laptops. We will never ask your caste before giving free laptops, Shah said.In his thirty-minute speech, Shah discussed issues ranging from the development of the state, job creation for youth to cow slaughter and anti-Romeo squads to safeguard women.We will ensure that our girls are safe in the state from the Samajwadi Party goons. Every police station will have anti-Romeo squads, which will hang these SP goons upside down and teach them a lesson, Shah said."

The Congress party was going to every village saying the State has been looted. They were demeaning the SP and the State government. but the two have [now] embraced each other. What changed overnight that the two arch rivals embraced each other?The Prime Minister went on to accuse the two parties of having an alliance to save themselves.Those who could not save themselves and those who were removed by the people of the State, how can the same parties save U.P?, he asked to loud cheers from the crowd.Mr. Modi highlighted the alleged goondaraj in the State and slammed the incumbent SP government for political patronage of these elements. Addressing his first election rally for the State polls since Model Code of Conduct came into force, a day after a trader was looted and killed in Meerut, Mr. Modi said, The Samajwadi Party had encouraged the goondaraj in the State.

He nods his head when CM says, Bhajpa wale Congress mein sahara dhoond rahe hain (BJP is looking for support from Congress leaders).Bajpur, an SC reserved seat, is traditionally a Congress stronghold. Harvinder says he will stick with Congress. Rais Ahmad, a Muslim labourer, seconds Harvinder.The game-changerPeople used to say we have no chance in Bajpur but we proved them wrong. We have changed the rules of the game, Rawat tells HT.Congress has fielded Sunita Bajwa, wife of a Sikh BJP leader who joined Congress last month. Sunita hails from an SC family. This seat too has a mix of Muslims, Dalits, Sikhs and Tharus (tribals).Rawat stops every 50-70 meters. He exchanges greetings with the crowd near national highways. He is spending a good amount of time in two districts  US Nagar and Haridwar, which together have 20 seats. In 2012 polls BJP won 11 of these seats.Babuji (father) is full of energy. He never gives up. We want to become like him, Rawats son says as others try to keep pace with him.Its 9.30pm when CM addresses another meeting at Sultanpur Patti. He takes a jibe at Prime Minister Narendra Modi referring him as Dilli wale Baba. I came to know that achhe din (good days) are stuck in Delhis traffic, Rawat says as the crowd cheers. He also talks about notebandi (demonetisation) here. Though demonetisation is not a political issue in the hills, it matters in the plains, where a large number of people survive on daily earnings.No breaks for CMCM refuses to take a break. Sipping sugar free black tea while travelling, Rawat speaks to Congress strategists Kumari Shailja and Ambika Soni and central observers. He fixes a programme of party vice president Rahul Gandhi before switching back to local issues.He takes feedback on Sitarganj seat from where former CM Vijay Bahugunas son is contesting on a BJP ticket. Congress has fielded a Bengali local female candidate from this seat. At 11pm, CM visits the house of a former MLA Premanand Mahajan. After 20 minutes both come out happily.Life of a neta is like this, Rawat tells this correspondent with smile on his face.When its 15 minutes past midnight, his cavalcade reaches Haldwani.

58ff1a5e7be9e04136162772,Jats feel 'politically untouchable',http://www.deccanherald.com/content/595180/jats-feel-politically-untouchable.html,2017-02-06,"Jats feel 'politically untouchable'Dalip Singh, Feb 7, 2017, BAGHPAT (UP), DHNS 1:28 ISTAssembly polls 2017: Uttar Pradesh gears up for 1st phase on Feb 11As he takes turns to smoke the hookah at a chaupal (village square) in Bauli village of Badhot late Sunday afternoon, wrinkled-faced Rajpal Singh says the Jats want a resurgence of their political identity.Ahead of the first phase of polling in Uttar Pradesh on February 11, Rajpal thinks that the dominant agrarian community of western Uttar Pradesh is feeling politically untouchable in the absence of a strong leadership that it could relate to at the state level  whether in the BJP, SP or BSP.The veteran farmers views echo in the two adjoining Jat-dominated villages of Rustampur and Mahautpur, which account for 12,000 votes.Their once leader Chaudhary Ajit Singh of the RLD is fighting hard to regain his place in Jat politics after his partys humbling performance in the 2012 Assembly elections. His hold slipped further two years later, leading to the former Union minister himself losing Bagpat in the Lok Sabha polls.Adding to woes is RLDs inability to join the SP-Congress alliance with Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav putting his foot down.This has left the caste-based party to contest the triangular fight alone.The RLD, which has fielded 326 candidates for the 403-member UP Assembly, is out to inflict maximum damage to the BJP in whatever way it can, local party leader Arun Tomar, who is close to Ajits family, told DH.Given that Jats populate about 70 seats spread over some 19 districts in the state, a swing of a few percentage points in the communitys votes away form the BJP can alter equations in the election, which is being fiercely fought on caste equations.We will destroy the BJP game plan in western UP. How many seats we win is secondary, Tomar said.Though Mahautpur village pradhan Ajay Chaudhary claims that a large number of Jats would vote for the RLD to revive the party that was the undisputed flagbearer of agrarian politics during former prime minister Charan Singhs era, other community members vouch for the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Jats had voted en masse for the BJP after the communal polarisation following the Muzaffarnagar riots to help the party sweep the state with 71 out of 80 Lok Sabha seats in the 2014 elections.Ajit, in his address at a rally in Baghpat, cautions the community against the BJPs hate politics, hinting that they should not get involved in a communal flare-up, like the one which was reportedly used to garner their support in the last general election.The other thing that the farming caste feels is that the BJP has not done much with regard to the sugarcane issue  which Modi himself tried to address by saying in a Meerut rally on Saturday that he had cleared 99% of the Rs 2,200-crore compensation package due for 2014-15."

He also made a reference to slaughterhouses, in a joke, juxtaposing it with a specific caste.An aggrieved elderly citizen belonging to the Jat community once visited our office to register his complaint. He told me that one morning, while he was carrying his sugarcanes in a bullock cart to the nearby market for sale, he stopped mid-way to buy guavas. When he came back with the guavas, his bull was missing. I told him to register a complaint with the police because the UP police was already tracking Azam Khans lost buffaloes. But then he revealed that his bull was stolen by the slaughterhouse people, Shah said.As the crowd cheered to his dog-whistle narrative, Shah announced that the BJP, when it is voted to power, will come down on slaughterhouses from Day 1. When BJP comes to power in Uttar Pradesh, we will ban all unregulated slaughterhouses on Day 1, Shah said.Shahs speech also evoked the Dadri lynching incident, in which an unruly mob had lynched a Muslim man to his death, over allegations of cow slaughter. Bisada, the village where the incident took place, is located around 20km from Noida.In 2016, several incidents were reported across the Hindi heartland, in which cow vigilantes had beaten up meat transporters. The Bisada lynching and the cow vigilantism had attracted nationwide attention and saw BJP on the back foot as the party, including the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, had earlier campaigned heavily against bovine slaughter.Even in 2014, during the Lok Sabha elections, party president Amit Shah and BJP leaders Sangeet Som and Sanjeev Balyan had faced criticism for their inflammatory speeches in western UP belt, in the wake of the Muzaffarnagar riots. Around 60 people were killed in the riots and thousands have been displaced.Shah also attacked Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav saying that he asks for the caste and religion of the people before giving them free laptops. He said that only his party will not discriminate people on their caste or religion.Akhilesh Yadav promised free laptops to the youth of UP but have the Noida youth received any? It is because Yadav asks for your caste and religion before handing out laptops. We will never ask your caste before giving free laptops, Shah said.In his thirty-minute speech, Shah discussed issues ranging from the development of the state, job creation for youth to cow slaughter and anti-Romeo squads to safeguard women.We will ensure that our girls are safe in the state from the Samajwadi Party goons. Every police station will have anti-Romeo squads, which will hang these SP goons upside down and teach them a lesson, Shah said."

""Compared to the SP and Congress governments, not even a single charge of corruption has come to light since the Narendra Modi government came to power,"" he said yesterday while addressing a public meeting.The BJP leader was speaking in Tarauli village of Chhatta Assembly constituency in favour BJP candidate Laxmi Narain Chaudhary. Taking a dig at Congress-Samajwadi Party alliance, he said the cycle Rahul is using is already punctured and mocked the Congress Vice President's 'Khat Sabha' during the campaign quipping, ""Chunav se pahle hi Rahul ne pakari khat (Rahul has taken ill before the elections could even start)"".He said the loan of small farmers would be waived and interest on crop loan would also not be charged if BJP would comes to power in Uttar Pradesh. He termed demonetisation as a decision taken in the interest of country and said the Prime Minister has tried to bridge the gap between rich and poor. ""The backbone of terrorists and Naxalists has been broken through the note ban,"" he said.He also claimed that Pakistan has been given a befitting reply to its proxy war in the form ofterrorist activities by the surgical strike in September last year. Accusing SP and BSP of doublespeak, Singh said, ""More than 4,000 incidents of loot and 7,600 incidents of communal riots belie Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav's claim about better law and order situation in the state."" Singh also said the sugar mill in Chhatta would be made functional if BJP comes to power."

Some talk of social polarisation, others of social indifference and severance. The apocalyptic Muzaffarnagar model of 2013 continues to haunt people. It impacted the 2014 Lok Sabha elections but whether it would impact the 2017 polls to the assembly--no one can predict still.I was a party to a very passionate debate in the interiors of Muzaffarnagar at Lalukheri. In a tea shop at Sisauli tri-junction, I tried to probe the minds of a multitude of people sipping tea. It took a while for them to shake off their reservations and down their guard. But what followed was a pouring of their heart--the litany of their sufferings, their pain and suffocation just exploded.An elder said the normal trend in these parts has been to flow with the tide, but the last time people did that, the result was painful. I have undergone a bypass and I cant queue long enough to vote. I queued up before a bank for long hours to return without cash. My son is to be married. Now you tell me, what do I do next and how, he said.A young man who overheard the conversation reacted violently, My entire savings have been seized. We heard the bank had been replenished with cash after eight-ten days. I rushed there, only to find that the currency had run out. I do not have a penny in hand.Even before I could react, a third voice rose above the din, this time full of anger. What are you talking about? We are voting to elect an MLA. What you talk of is plain nonsense, first talk of the issues facing the state. My MLA never does reappear, once he wins it.What about the MP, I wonder and pat comes the reply. He too is absconding. Most people here debate in anguish how Netaji and his minions just gave up the people--whether they won, or lost.I thought the debate on demonetisation and its impact was over, when a gentleman challenged me, saying, Forget the banks. Lets visit an ATM. Dogs wallow in them. That set off a general commotion--some for demonetisation, some against. Demonetisation does shadow the general debate, wherever one goes, though whether it would colour this election is not a given.To take the debate off it, and further, I cautiously probed, whether they got the right price for their crops. The answer was cryptic, bitter.Farmers here have been drowned in debt. The state promises loan waivers and promises fresh loans. But most have been caught in a vicious cycle of banks and moneylenders. It would have been better had we got a good price to clear our debts and were able to add broad base farming activity, said one. This area of western UP is known for the vicious web of private money lenders and the trauma of those caught in their web.See the irony. This is the area which sprung the politics of late Chaudhary Charan Singh. Many still mistake him for just a Jat leader. Its true that the Jats constituted his major vote base but he was the first to raise the issues of farmers, and over generations--right from the streets up to Parliament. This is again the heartland of the towering kisan leader Mahendra Singh Tikait whose one call was enough to make people spill into the streets. The issues then were as complex, as they are now.Leaders have come and gone. Elections too have come and gone. The state is in for another election but it would seem there is nobody to debate the issues of farmers any more. I asked, why is it so?The invectives which followed stunned.Why dont you put the issues before people who ask for your votes with as much stringency? I asked. The answers were many, the summary of which largely was that politicians just care for their own community, caste and creed. They hardly have the time or patience to talk to the last man.Custodians of caste and religion are now out with different slogans of development, while dwelling on caste configurations or raising the bogey of faith in danger.How much does all of this impact the voters? To understand, I ventured to ask people how they personally reacted to religion, caste and development, and which of them mattered most.They reacted with intelligence--it has to be security, then development. It does not require much to understand that by security they emphasise caste and religion. That could only reinforce the Muzaffarnagar model of politics that so shaped the past elections in these parts.MEN WHO MATTER IN MEERUT-SAHARANPUR ARC5 REASONS WHY REGION MATTERS1.

We have no money after selling the crop for the last two years, making it difficult to run the family.Adding to his litany of woes are shortage of labour and lurking uncertainty due to communal tension in surrounding areas of his village.The farmers get Rs 300 per quintal of crop sold in the market. Only distance separates Sharma from other farmers like Rupender Tomar in Badhot and Tanveer Alam in Saharanpur but their worries are similar and constant in the last three years.Their gloomy story gets supplemented by the National Sample Survey Offices (NSSOs) 70th round survey conducted during July 2012 June 2013. It showed that the total income of an agricultural household per month was Rs 6,426. But, the total expenditure was Rs 9,502.That meant that each month a household, including that of farmers, is accumulating debts of little over Rs 3,000.Farmers have a feeling that the governments at the centre and in state have been offering packages to bail out factories but not to tillers of the crop. For the year 2016-17, sugar mills owe more than Rs 5,000 crore to farmers. Previous years dues of nearly Rs 360 crore also remain as Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself had stated in Meerut on February 4 that his government had fulfilled partys 2014 Lok Sabha election promise to farmers by releasing Rs 22,000 crore which was 99% of the amount pending for 2014-15.RLD state general secretary Rajendra Singh Chikara is of the view that farmers are distressed due to prevailing situations. They are losing interest in farming since they are not getting instant money for their produce which is a perishable item.There are 116 sugar mills operating in the state which account for over 40% of the total production of the crop in the country."

On the campaign trail in western Uttar Pradesh, however, it is his zestful recounting of his visit to Pakistan for the SAARC summit last August and the surgical strikes by the Army across the Line of Control last September that gets him the most applause.As Mr. Singh criss-crosses the region, from Agra to Aligarh and Dadri, he recounts how he did not want to visit Pakistan for the SAARC meet, but when I heard that anti-India groups who supported use of terror against us said they would not allow me or Prime Minister Modi to set foot in Pakistan, that is when I said that I would go and deliver a tough message against terror, and I did.When terrorists crept across the LoC and attacked our jawans as they slept, martyring 17 of them, our government gave a fitting reply, he says referring to the surgical strikes. India does not provoke anyone, but if provoked it doesnt leave any challenge unanswered, he says.In contrast, demonetisation and the campaign against black money does not draw quite as much applause, though when he links it to ending terror financing, there is a show of hands from the crowds in appreciation.The BJPs promise in its manifesto to write off agricultural loans and an undertaking to reduce interest rates to zero is again a crowd-pleaser. In Aligarh, Mr. Singh just makes a passing reference to illegal slaughterhouses and the need to close them down. A local BJP worker says on the sidelines that it is an issue for the party in the area. Cow slaughter is rampant here. Gai bhai son main dubka kar maar dee jaati hain [cows are slaughtered hidden among buffaloes], says Vineet Varshney Bunty, a local BJP man in the district.Mr. Singhs son Pankaj Singh is in the fray in Noida. As the rallies move closer to that seat but skirt it, he says he would not be campaigning for his son. He has been working there since he was 22. The voters know him and me too, he says.At Bulandshahr, the BJPs worries on the splitting Jat vote (the community voted en masse for the BJP in 2014) are apparent. Pictures of former Prime Minister Charan Singh dot the rally ground despite his party, the Rashtriya Lok Dal, fighting against the BJP. In Agra, a mention of local MP Ram Shankar Katheria draws jeers. These are the issues that the party needs to be wary of, the angry Jat vote, bogged down with worries over the dues to sugar-cane farmers and unpopular MPs.Mr. Singh, however, is determined to plough on, marking the enthusiastic response of the crowd to his oratorical style.

Some talk of social polarisation, others of social indifference and severance. The apocalyptic Muzaffarnagar model of 2013 continues to haunt people. It impacted the 2014 Lok Sabha elections but whether it would impact the 2017 polls to the assembly--no one can predict still.I was a party to a very passionate debate in the interiors of Muzaffarnagar at Lalukheri. In a tea shop at Sisauli tri-junction, I tried to probe the minds of a multitude of people sipping tea. It took a while for them to shake off their reservations and down their guard. But what followed was a pouring of their heart--the litany of their sufferings, their pain and suffocation just exploded.An elder said the normal trend in these parts has been to flow with the tide, but the last time people did that, the result was painful. I have undergone a bypass and I cant queue long enough to vote. I queued up before a bank for long hours to return without cash. My son is to be married. Now you tell me, what do I do next and how, he said.A young man who overheard the conversation reacted violently, My entire savings have been seized. We heard the bank had been replenished with cash after eight-ten days. I rushed there, only to find that the currency had run out. I do not have a penny in hand.Even before I could react, a third voice rose above the din, this time full of anger. What are you talking about? We are voting to elect an MLA. What you talk of is plain nonsense, first talk of the issues facing the state. My MLA never does reappear, once he wins it.What about the MP, I wonder and pat comes the reply. He too is absconding. Most people here debate in anguish how Netaji and his minions just gave up the people--whether they won, or lost.I thought the debate on demonetisation and its impact was over, when a gentleman challenged me, saying, Forget the banks. Lets visit an ATM. Dogs wallow in them. That set off a general commotion--some for demonetisation, some against. Demonetisation does shadow the general debate, wherever one goes, though whether it would colour this election is not a given.To take the debate off it, and further, I cautiously probed, whether they got the right price for their crops. The answer was cryptic, bitter.Farmers here have been drowned in debt. The state promises loan waivers and promises fresh loans. But most have been caught in a vicious cycle of banks and moneylenders. It would have been better had we got a good price to clear our debts and were able to add broad base farming activity, said one. This area of western UP is known for the vicious web of private money lenders and the trauma of those caught in their web.See the irony. This is the area which sprung the politics of late Chaudhary Charan Singh. Many still mistake him for just a Jat leader. Its true that the Jats constituted his major vote base but he was the first to raise the issues of farmers, and over generations--right from the streets up to Parliament. This is again the heartland of the towering kisan leader Mahendra Singh Tikait whose one call was enough to make people spill into the streets. The issues then were as complex, as they are now.Leaders have come and gone. Elections too have come and gone. The state is in for another election but it would seem there is nobody to debate the issues of farmers any more. I asked, why is it so?The invectives which followed stunned.Why dont you put the issues before people who ask for your votes with as much stringency? I asked. The answers were many, the summary of which largely was that politicians just care for their own community, caste and creed. They hardly have the time or patience to talk to the last man.Custodians of caste and religion are now out with different slogans of development, while dwelling on caste configurations or raising the bogey of faith in danger.How much does all of this impact the voters? To understand, I ventured to ask people how they personally reacted to religion, caste and development, and which of them mattered most.They reacted with intelligence--it has to be security, then development. It does not require much to understand that by security they emphasise caste and religion. That could only reinforce the Muzaffarnagar model of politics that so shaped the past elections in these parts.MEN WHO MATTER IN MEERUT-SAHARANPUR ARC5 REASONS WHY REGION MATTERS1. Farmers in this arc make the backbone of politics and commerce. Mangoes from this area are exported in large number to several countries2. Meerut is the hub of sports culture and has the biggest bullion market in the state. Jaggery and iron industry of Muzaffarnagar make for a region speciality3. The arc has a mixed population. Jats, Gujjars, Tyagi, Thakur and Muslim community are largely well to do4. The area is economically much ahead of Poorvanchal with roads and power linking every village5.

This year, a 10-kg lump cost Rs. 370 during the festival season. After that, much against market wisdom that the price might dip to Rs. 350 or Rs. 340, it had risen and touched an unprecedented Rs. 370 for lowest quality. For the best variety it went up to Rs. 400.Usually we get around 15,000 to 17,000 lumps a day on an average around this time of the season. But having never seen such a price, farmers are bringing in more and more quantities and at present it is 27,000 to 29,000 lumps, says president of the Anakapalle Merchants Association K.V. Sarat Kumar.For one pakam (traditional measure for nine lumps of 15 kg each), farmers used to get a take home profit of Rs. 1,500 but now it has more than doubled, he analysed, adding farmers had never seen such a high price.Crop failure inMaharashtraThe buying spree is attributed to the interest shown by traders from Krishna district. The reported sugarcane crop failure of almost 60 % in Maharashtra could be a contributing factor.However, as against the usual market condition of 50% each going to direct sale and storage, only 20 % is going to sale and 80 per cent to cold storage, he says. Stocks account for about 6750 tonnes so far at the Anakapalle market with an annual turnover of about Rs. 130 crore. Another reason for low direct sale is that the Uttar Pradesh market is quoting at about Rs. 60 less than that of the Anakapalle price. The gap generally used to be Rs. 20/Rs. 30, Mr. Sarat Kumar points out."

In the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, this dominant community  swept away by communal frenzy following the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013  had played a critical role in the BJPs stunning electoral victory.Today, two-and-a-half years later, vestiges of hatred lurk beneath the picturesque sugarcane and mustard fields of western U.P. that turn the landscape green and gold in this season. But passions have cooled and the Jats have had time to think. Angered by the BJP-led governments failure to grant the community reservation and devastated by demonetisation, they are now repenting deserting the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the family of their hero, Chaudhury Charan Singh.Failed effortsJats are so incensed that last Tuesday, BJP president Amit Shah was compelled to call a meeting of community leaders at the residence of Union Minister Chaudhury Birender Singh, a Jat leader from neighbouring Haryana. But the dinner diplomacy failed to pacify the guests. A day later, another BJP Jat leader and Union Minister of State and MP from Muzaffarnagar, Sanjiv Balyan, was asked to engage the community in Meerut. Reports suggest this effort, too, was unsuccessful.Pushpinder Choudhury, who heads the politically unaffiliated Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, says this development means that the RLD is back in business. Jats will vote tactically to defeat the BJP. They will vote not just for Jat candidates or RLD candidates but also for whoever can defeat the BJP, he told The Hindu.That may be an exaggerated claim as a small section of Jats, especially those affiliated to the BJP, younger men in particular, will remain with the party. Reports coming in from western U.P. say the BJP  and organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)  have, in the closing days of the campaign, attempted to reintroduce emotive Hindutva issues relating to the theft of cattle and molestation of Hindu girls. The promise to form anti-Romeo squads (another name for the love jihad campaign) is officially in the manifesto. As one farmer leader put, Once the official campaigning closes, electioneering will continue on WhatsApp and Facebook.Onkar Singh, an RSS functionary from the Dharam Jagran Samanway in Muzaffarnagar, told The Hindu : Its a straight contest between the SP-Congress combine and the BJP. But once people start seeing the long lines of Muslims, the Hindus will all vote BJP.RLD factorConversations with members of all political parties in the fray suggest that the RLD could win anything between four and nine of the 73 seats, spread across 15 districts, going to the polls on February 11. But the fact that the party is now a player means that it will be a four-way contest  the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress combine, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the BJP and the RLD  making the outcome that much harder to predict.Clear choiceAnother significant community in this part of the State, the Muslims, are squarely behind the SP-Congress combine, as the two parties are most likely to provide them security, something they currently prize above development. The alliance, too, has given the SP a boost, with joint rallies in the region receiving rapturous receptions.Muslims will, however, vote for the BSP wherever the alliance candidate is weak. This could place the latter party in a position of advantage in some seats, as the Dalit votes are sizeable here.The BJP will clearly do better than it did in 2012 when it won just 11 of these 73 seats, but it appears unlikely to be anywhere comparable to their performance in 2014, when they won two-thirds of the Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha seats here. The BJP, SP-Congress and BSP sources all claim they are leading in the first phase, but political observers agree that it will be a direct fight between the BJP and the SP-Congress combine, with the BSP at No. 3.The RLD has a fighting chance in four to nine seats in the first phase of the polls on February 11"
58ff2d577be9e041361633e5,"Be wary of families which looted UP,country: Modi to UP voters",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/595747/be-wary-families-looted-upcountry.html,2017-02-10,"Bijnor, Feb 10, 2017 (PTI) 16:01 ISTTaking up issues of dynastic politics and law and order to target Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance, Prime Minister Narendra Modi today called it a tie-up between two families who have ""looted"" Uttar Pradesh and the country, and mocked Rahul Gandhi saying no leader has as many jokes on him as he does for his ""childish"" acts.""When both families were separate, they caused so much destruction in the country and UP. What will happen when they have joined hands. If you want to save UP, you will have to save it from these families,"" he said addressing a rally here. With BJP locked in a tough fight in the state assembly polls, the Prime Minister dwelt at length on the ""family rule"" of the Yadav clan and cases of major crimes under its watch, besides ""corruption"" during the reign of Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati governments.Modi, who has been accused by Congress of using foul language and repeatedly humiliating opposition after his raincoat jibe against former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, persisted with his shrill attack on rivals saying they have only served their families. With Jats playing a key role in the two phases for which polling will be held tomorrow and February 15, he said a BJP government in the state will set up a farmers welfare fund named after Charan Singh, a noted Jat leader.Clearing the dues of sugarcane farmers and waiving loans of small and marginal farmers, both promises being part of the BJP's manifesto, will be a top priority for the state government if his party is voted to power, he said. It was, however, his attack on the SP-Congress alliance and the ruling Yadav family which was the focus of his speech. ""I do not know Akhilesh Yadav much. I have met him a few times in meetings and it seemed to me after reading various reports that he is an educated young man who is trying to learn. I was hopeful that a young man will be fit for politics in 5-10 years.""On the other hand there is a Congress leaders who does so many childish acts that if you do a search on computer, you will find that no other leader has as many jokes on him as he has. ""Even senior Congress leaders keep a distance from him. When the leader avoided by his senior party leaders was embraced by Akhilesh, then I began doubting his wisdom. One can make blunders but not of this kind,"" Modi said, targeting the Congress vice president.He said it is an alliance between two families, one of which ""looted"" the country and the other Uttar Pradesh. He noted that so many members of the extended ruling Yadav family are MPs, MLAs and serving in various other capacities in government. While Bijnor with about 2,000 villages has one MP, there are so many of them in Parliament, assembly and other government bodies from Safai, the family village of Akhilesh Yadav, he said. They made one caste (Yadav) as their vote bank but served only their family, he said.Accusing the Akhilesh Yadav government of suppressing rivals by lodging false criminal cases against them, Modi said poll results on March 11 will ""expose"" it and a BJP government will launch a probe into all such cases. Can any decent person without any political affiliation say that the UP government has been unable to protect good people, the Prime Minister said, adding that a wave of change was blowing across the state in his party's favour, forcing SP and Congress to come to each other's rescue after targeting each other for years.He cited several incidents, including the alleged Badaun gang rape, and subsequent insensitive comments of the ruling party leaders to allege that SP will not be able to protect women. Without naming them, Modi referred to SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav's remarks that ""boys make mistakes"" in reference to a rape case and also that of senior SP leader Azam Khan. Khan, he said, had to apologise in the Supreme Court.Targeting Congress and SP, he said both ruling families believe that running governments is their right and will not allow the common man to do it. Raising the corruption issue, he said those who ""looted"" the state under the rule of BSP chief Mayawati were given good positions by the current government and referred to graft cases involving Yadav Singh, who held senior positions in the Greater Noida Authority in the two governments and is currently behind bars.Without naming Singh, Modi said he was sent to jail after central agencies began probing him. Akhilesh Yadav government went to the Supreme Court to oppose handing over the prove to the CBI, he said."

Elections are a complicated logistical exercise that blends colorful pageantry with more serious political issues. A village fair atmosphere takes over rural India as people troop to the nearest voting stations. Five key states, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Goa, Manipur and Uttarakhand, are currently in the middle of elections to choose local legislatures. The voting began February 4 and ends on March 8. Votes from all the state polls will be counted on March 11. A look at some of the key election features:ELECTION SYMBOLSA bottle, an air conditioner, a television set, a lantern, an arrow, a bicycle, a loaf of bread: these are not shopping items but some of the many objects voters will see on the electronic voting machines as symbols for the dozens of political parties and independent candidates in the fray.More from Express:Symbols have been allocated to political parties since Indias first national election in 1951. Since barely a fifth of the population could read or write in the early 1950s, the symbols were introduced on ballot papers to help the unlettered cast their votes. Nearly three-quarters of Indians can now read but the icons remain evocative symbols of the major political groups.Indias best-known political symbols are the lotus flower for the governing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the outstretched hand or palm for the main opposition Congress party.The newest political party in the country, the Aam Aadmi Party, or the Common Mans Party, chose the broom as its election symbol, reflecting their claim that they mean to sweep clean the political system.The choice of symbols still available for selection with the countrys independent Election Commission includes an electric pole, cricket bat, pliers and even food items including a coconut and a cauliflower. Also available: a toothbrush and nail clippers.FREEBIESElection season in India is the time when political parties offer freebies in return for the votes.On offer this year are promises of laptops, smartphones, spice grinders, fans and loan waivers. The governing BJP is even offering sugar and clarified butter at low prices in northern Punjab state.In the past, farm workers got cows and goats in a southern state. Freebies are a fact of life in Indian politics. Some 270 million people, nearly 22 per cent of the countrys population, live in poverty, making giveaways particularly attractive to voters.The election-season freebies, however, raise questions about a fair playing field for smaller parties and independent candidates.In the absence of laws barring such campaign promises, the practice continues. In Indias northern Uttar Pradesh, Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav, the states top elected official, is promising free smartphones. In the previous 2014 election, he fulfilled his promise of free laptops for students after winning the vote.His main challenger, the BJP, also promised laptops, free internet and cooking gas to those who vote for them.ELECTION FUNDINGAnonymous cash donations to political parties, running into billions of rupees (hundreds of millions of dollars) are seen at the heart of Indias endemic corruption.Only a quarter of the annual income of the two main political parties, the BJP and the Congress party, comes from known sources and are declared in their tax returns. The rest is from anonymous donors, according to the Association of Democratic Reforms, a non-political group working for governmental and electoral reform.Corruption is a top issue in the elections, which came on the heels of a surprise Nov. 8 announcement by Prime Minister Narendra Modi eliminating the countrys highest denominated currency bills in what he called an attack on tax fraud and graft.The government also appears to have taken some steps to bring transparency to party funding.On February 1, Indias Finance Minister Arun Jaitley announced in his budget speech that political parties will not be allowed to accept donations of more than 2,000 rupees ($29) in cash from an individual donor, instead of the 20,000 rupees ($295) allowed at present.A powerful regional group, the Bahujan Samaj Party, showed all donations it has received so far to be anonymous, below the legal limit of 20,000 rupees per donor.But several economists say that if the government were really serious about transparency, it should ban all cash donations.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58f4d32060de470aa339c4bf,Homecoming call bites BJP in riot-hit zone,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170210/jsp/nation/story_135041.jsp,2017-02-10,"Ramesh (centre), a resident of Qutba village Muzaffarnagar/Shamli Feb. 9: Ghar wapsi (homecoming) may be music to the BJP's ears but in the sugarcane-rich Jat heartland of western Uttar Pradesh, it is giving the party sleepless nights. Veer Singh, a Jat in Qutba village, said: ""The Assembly election is like homecoming for us. In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, we had been taken in by the BJP's promises, which have remained unfulfilled. On Saturday, we are going to vote for the Rashtriya Lok Dal."" Taking a long drag from his hookah, the octogenarian paused and added with a smile: "" Subah ka bhoola agar shaam ko ghar laut aaye to usse bhoola nahin kehte (If one realises his mistake and makes amends, he should be forgiven)."" Qutba, the epicentre of the September 2013 communal violence in Muzaffarnagar district in which over 50 people were killed and 60,000 displaced, is the native village of Sanjeev Kumar Balyan, a riot accused who went on to become a minister in the Narendra Modi government. Singh said Modi had failed to deliver on his promises and farmers were suffering because of that. A note of repentance crept into his voice while he recounted the violence that soured the relations between Jats and Muslims, who had always coexisted peacefully. "" Ab yahan na riot hai aur na hi Modi ki lehar (Here is no riot now, nor a Modi wave),"" he said. ""But his speeches are very good,"" Singh added. The anger among Jats is palpable in several parts of the sugar bowl of India. The community is disappointed at Modi's ""broken promises"" - Jats are yet to get reservations, sugarcane prices haven't increased, farm loans have not been waived and mills still make irregular payments. The demonetisation drive has made matters worse for the dominant farming community. ""Other than delivering excellent pro-farmer speeches, Modiji has not done anything to fulfil his promises,"" said Ram Singh, a resident of the adjoining district of Shamli. He accused the BJP of engineering the riots for political gains. ""There is no politics of riot in this election and we have become wiser,"" he said. Veer Singh (right), a resident of Qutba village Traditionally, the Jats and the Muslims have voted for Ajit Singh's RLD and before him, for his father and former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh. But the 2013 violence changed the voting pattern as the Jats rallied behind Modi in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. Many Dalits, who have supported BSP chief Mayawati over the years, also sided with the BJP. But the caste arithmetic is back this election - the Dalits, Harijans and the Gujjars seem to have returned to Mayawati's fold. The Baniyas, the trading community, have said they will maintain a distance from the BJP because of the demonetisation. The BJP is banking on upper caste votes and a possible division of Muslim-Dalit votes. In some pockets of western Uttar Pradesh, the Jats are, however, divided and said they would vote for the BJP as they suspected Ajit Singh could join hands with the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance after the polls. ""Akhilesh Yadav is only concerned about Muslims. Some Jats lost their lives in the violence but he did not pay any compensation to their families. Modi thinks about everyone,"" said Chaudhury Bange Ram, a resident of Sisauli which was untouched by the riot. Rampal Singh, another Sisauli resident, said Modi was working for the development of all. ""He thinks about the country as a whole. What will happen if Ajit Singh joins hands with Akhilesh?"" he asked. The riot-displaced Muslims who are living in five camps said they would vote for chief minister Akhilesh. ""He is our saviour. It's only because of his compensation of Rs 5 lakh to each affected family that we rebuilt our lives,"" said Rukshana, the mother of three daughters. Seated on a charpoy inside her cramped settlement in Shahpur near Muzaffarnagar town, Rukshana said: ""We will be safe only when secular parties are voted to power."" In Shahpur town, the Samajwadi office was abuzz with activity on Wednesday. Only a few supporters were seen in the BSP office across the road. Muslims constitute 25-30 per cent of the voters in the 73 western Uttar Pradesh constituencies that will vote on Saturday. Dalits make up 19 per cent of the voters. Mayawati will stand to gain if they vote en block but that seems unlikely. Dalits in the area said they had suffered the most under Modi. ""We made a big mistake by voting for Modi in the Lok Sabha polls. We want to set things right this time. The Modi government only works for the rich and the upper castes. We don't figure in his scheme of things,"" said Ramesh, a Jatav. His son Aman, a graduate, works for a multinational company in Gurgaon. ""He applied for a job in the railways but they asked him to pay a bribe, which we could not. Only Mayawati works for the empowerment of the oppressed,"" Ramesh said. Many Dalits who worked in brick kilns and farmlands lost their jobs because of the demonetisation and said they would vote for the BSP. Chandrakant Sharma, a riot accused and Qutba resident, said upper caste Brahmins ""have always voted for the BJP and this time will be no different"". A group of Muslims sitting in a tea stall said Mayawati was a ""good administrator"" and recounted that no riots had taken place during her rule."

PTI Photo Rampur: UP CM and Samajwadi Party President Akhilesh Yadav addresses an election rally in Rampur on Wednesday. PTI PhotoWith 73 constituencies and the possibility of triggering a wave that may just affect elections across Uttar Pradesh, an estimated 2.6 crore people in its western region will cast the first votes in the state Saturday. Ground zero for the 2013 violence that killed at least 65 and rendered thousands homeless and an alleged Hindu exodus, the region accounts for the most sensitive polling booths  at least 600  where video cameras will be installed to maintain law and order. The region has witnessed hectic campaigning over the last two weeks as parties fielded star campaigners in a last-minute rush to garner support. Prime Minister Narendra Modi, UP Chief Minister and SP chief Akhilesh Yadav, BSP chief Mayawati, Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi and several cabinet ministers have addressed public meetings.At a rally in Muzaffarnagar last week, Akhilesh stressed the importance of being the first voters in UP. You are voting first in UP. You will set the tone for the rest of the state, he said. Sources in SP and BJP in western UP agreed. In such a phased election, the mood is very important. People can sense which way the wind is blowing and this is an advantage for everybody. To win UP, performance in western UP is a must, a senior BJP leader in Muzaffarnagar said. In the 2012 assembly polls, the SP and BSP won 24 seats each, followed by BJP (11), Ajit Singh-led Rashtriya Lok Dal (9) and the Congress (5).The contours of the region changed a year later when violence  Muzaffarnagar and Shamli formed the epicentre  spread across several districts. Over three days starting September 7, 2013, at least 65 were killed, hundreds injured and thousands displaced  most of the affected were Muslims  as they fled villages to escape the carnage. In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP swept all seats in western UP. While the BJP, SP and Congress have played down the 2013 violence in campaign speeches, it became the fulcrum for the BSP poll pitch. In her speeches, Mayawati has constantly referred to the riots and extolled her partys superior law and order track record. The region was also once a BSP bastion, where the party had enjoyed support from the combination of Muslims and Dalits.In 2017, Mayawati and BSP face stiff competition for the same electorate, particularly Muslims, after the Congress and SP announced an alliance and seat-sharing in UP. Other issues in the region include development of infrastructure and payment of sugar cane dues, the latter of which the RLD hopes to cash in on. There are 839 candidates in the fray in 15 districts where 26,823 polling stations have been set up. Among the electorate are 1.17 crore women and 1,508 belonging to third gender category. The largest constituency is Sahibabad, while Jalesar is the smallest.The maximum number of 26 candidates are in fray from Agra South, while the least number of aspirants are in Hastinapur with just six candidates. Prominent candidates include Pankaj Singh, son of Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh, from Noida; Congress Legislature Party leader Pradeep Mathur from Mathura; Mriganka, daughter of BJP MP Hukum Singh who raised issues of a Hindu exodus, in Kairana; and, controversial BJP MLAs Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana from Sardhana and Thanabhawan.The Election Commission of India said elaborate security arrangements had been made in all districts. Around 6,000 paramilitary personnel are being deployed in all 887 polling centres in Muzaffarnagar and neighbouring Shamli, particularly areas that witnessed communal riots in 2013. Districts going to polls in the first phase are Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Aligarh, Mathura, Hathras, Agra, Firozabad, Etah and Kasganj.

The SP-Congress combine had won 29 seats and the BSP had bagged 23 of the 73 seats in the region.Though the alliance hope to get the majority of Muslim votes, the BSP has sought to queer its pitch by fielding a large number of Muslim candidates. A division in Muslim votes will favour the BSP and the BJP, said a senior SP leader here.Firebrand Muslim leader Asaduddin Owaisis All India Muslim Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) has also put up its candidates on a number of seats, triggering apprehension of a division in their ranks.Muslim votes are decisive in Muzaffarnagar, which had witnessed large-scale communal riots in 2013, Bulandshahar, Hapur, Meerut, Baghpat, Ghaziabad and Shamli districts.The BJPs hopes hinge on the Jat support. Though there was no visible wave in its favour like in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the saffron party hopes the community will back it this time too.A perceptible anger in the community owing largely to the Centres handling of the Jat agitation in neighbouring Haryana, non-payment of sugarcane arrears and lack of assurance on reservation, however, has sent the alarm bells ringing in the BJP.BJP national president Amit Shah reportedly held a meeting with prominent Jat leaders in Delhi in a bid to persuade them to support his party."
58fc60baa3d24b44f322038e,First phase of polling in U.P. today,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/First-phase-of-polling-in-U.P.-today/article17286185.ece,2017-02-11,"Its a crucial day for Uttar Pradesh politics on Saturday as the State will see the first phase of Assembly elections in 73 seats in 15 districts.Most of the constituencies going to the polls fall in the communally sensitive western U.P., including the riot-hit areas of Muzaffarnagar-Shamli and cities which continue to be on the boil and see repeated communal clashes like Meerut, Kairana, Mathura, Agra, Bulandshahr and Aligarh.Saturday will also be the ultimate test of political strategies adopted by the BJP, BSP, SP-Congress alliance and the RLD to woo the voters.The BJP had won just 11 of the 73 seats in the last Assembly polls, but in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, it saw a complete swing in its favour and won all 15 seats from the 15 districts.Hindutva & developmentThis time the BJP is trying to appeal to Hindu voters by offering a mixture of Hindutva and development through promises such as shutting down of mechanised slaughter houses, forming anti-exodus task force to stop alleged departure of Hindus from Kairana, forming anti-romeo squads and promising to build the Ram temple.While Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the star campaigner of the BJP, has been harping on the deteriorating law and order in Akhilesh raj, lack of safety for women, and failure of the government to do enough for farmers and youths, the other party leaders have been making news with their controversial statements.The BJP fielded its Hindutva face, Yogi Adityanath, as its campaigner who repeatedly talked about alleged victimisation of the Hindus. In all his election meetings in western U.P., Mr. Adityanath said that western U.P., where Muslims constitute 25 per cent of the population, is being turned into Kashmir allegedly by forcing the Hindus to migrate from different towns.The party has tried to woo the farmers, who form the biggest vote bank in the agrarian region, by promising to waive loans of small farmers, implement several lucrative schemes for them and get sugarcane arrears paid within two weeks of coming to power in the State.The first phase would also be crucial for BSP supremo Mayawati who tried to experiment yet again with the Dalit-Muslim combination by fielding the largest number of Muslim candidates while being assured of getting the consolidated Jatav votes for the party.A major thrust of Ms. Mayawatis campaign, besides highlighting the SPs failure to maintain law and order and allow thousands of communal riots in the State, is that only she can prevent the BJP from coming to power in the State.The SP-Congress alliance has projected the vikas (development) aspect of the Akhilesh Yadav government and highlighted the negatives and ill-effects of demonetisation and the troubles it has given to the common public.The alliance has tried to woo Muslim voters by repeatedly projecting itself as the only political formation which can stop the BJP. The SP-Congress joint rallies saw display of camaraderie between Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and SPs chief Akhilesh Yadav."

Rooting for local BJP candidates in the UP assembly elections, the PM said that Badaun was among the least developed parts of the country despite being a VIP district.Badaun has been the base of Mayawati and now it is known to be the base of Samajwadi Party. It is a VIP district. Even then, it is one of the least developed districts, he said.The Prime Minister also rubbished the development plank of the SP-Congress alliance.

Badaun is also one of the five assembly seats that SP won in the 2014 Lok Sabha elections.Considering that the district has a considerable population of Hindu voters, the BJP is trying to make inroads here.

The polarised Jat voters of 2014 had partly helped the BJP win the massive mandate in the Lok Sabha elections, paving the way for Narendra Modi's national ascendancy.If the BJP manages to hold on to the seats of the Jat belt of western UP, there's a fair chance that it would be within a striking distance of power in Lucknow when votes are counted on March 11.But, if Ajit Singh's RLD bounces back on its slogan that the BJP has not kept its promise of giving reservation to the Jat community, then it could be a rather uphill task for the BJP.Ground-level reports suggest that the Centre's demonetisation move, in addition to the unsatisfactory minimum support price for sugarcane, has left the Jat community restive and divided, with the youth still rooting for Modi and the old generation returning to Ajit Singh.If the Jat community has a choice between the BJP and RLD, the Muslims -- the other big bloc of voters -- too have a choice, between the SP-Congress combine and the BSP.Law and order, which is an issue in this part of UP that has seen riots, has the minority voter talk about Mayawati's 'stern' administration with a tinge of nostalgia.Last Assembly elections, SP and BSP were equally placed with 24 seats each. But this time, the Muslim voters in West UP seem set for a decisive vote to either one of them, the SP-Congress or the BSP.The Congress does have a few pockets of influence in this region and to be fair, there's no strong anti-incumbency against its ally, Akhilesh Yadav.But Mayawati who has chosen her candidates carefully and has a better law and order record than Akhilesh is very much in the reckoning.Whether she or Ajit Singh will be a winner or a spoiler, will only be known when the votes are counted.Then come the Dalit voters, for whom BJP chief Amit Shah and BSP chief Mayawati are battling it out.If the Dalits come back to Mayawati en masse, and she gets a sizeable chunk of Muslim votes, then there's no stopping her. If Shah manages to restrict Mayawati to her core Jatav votes, then it will be harder for the BSP to balance the act in the other coming phases.In western UP thus, it's indeed a four-cornered contest with no clear wave in any one's favour. But it's also a straight fight for vote banks."

The SP has this time promised laptops to meritorious students and smart phones for all.BJP and Congress, which is fighting the polls in alliance with SP, besides parties like Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) have all promised free wi-fi internet services in all colleges and universities, apparently to cash in on the 'Digital India' wave.Like in the past, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), however, has stayed clear of coming out with a manifesto this elections, with its supremo Mayawati stressing that her party does not believe in making promises but ""acting"" on them.Congress has promised to provide free school education for every girl child and give free bicycles to girl students from Class IX to XII. BJP, on the other hand, has announced free school education to all students and extending it till graduation for the meritorious ones.Notably, to instill a technical approach and scientific attitude among the students who passed class XII the state government had launched a scheme to provide a laptop to them.In 2012-13 and 2013-14 fiscal years, Rs 3,43,009.91 crore were spent and 14,82,093 students covered in the scheme. In 2016-17, it was proposed to cover 39,600 students, according to an official UP government data on planning.With nearly 20 crore people, Uttar Pradesh remains a populous state. It sends 80 members to the Lok Sabha and it has a 403-member Assembly. The state, however, does not fare well in important sectors like education, health, industry, and agriculture engages over 70 per cent of its people.BSP has announced waiving farm loans of up to Rs 1 lakh, while BJP, Congress, SP and RLD have made a similar promise albeit without announcing any such upper limits.In a bid to woo farmers, parties including BJP and SP have promised round-the-clock power supply while Congress raised a similar pitch with its slogan ""karza maaf, bijli half"" (loan waiver and 50 per cent reduction in power bills).The BJP, in its manifesto called 'Lok Kalyan Sankalp Patra', has also promised lower rates of interest on loans to farmers, an assurance which the SP has retained from its 2012 manifesto.SP has promised to raise crop insurance scheme to Rs 7.5 lakh from present Rs 5 lakh, while also setting up a Treasury for Farmers.The issue of pending payments to sugarcane farmers in the state, particularly in western parts, has been simmering for quite some time now with parties highlighting it in their poll documents.BJP has promised clearing all such dues within 120 days of coming to power, while RLD has assured ensuring full payments in just two weeks' time.Almost all the parties invariably have promised modernisation of the mandis and have given assurances of connecting them with technology to ensure fair price to the farmers for their yield and facilitate its sale.Congress listed its thrust areas to boost infrastructure and promised to ensure food security by providing wheat and rice at Rs 3 and Rs 2 a kg, giving nutritious meal in Mid Day Meal scheme and revamping Public Distribution System.BJP said that on lines of the central government's decision, no interview will be held for Class III and Class IV UP government jobs to end corruption in recruitment if it comes to power.BSP said if it gets back to power, quota facility will continue besides reservation will also be extended to the poor among the upper castes, based on their financial condition, even as SP, which promised extra reservation to Muslims in 2012, stayed mum on the matter this time.Mayawati, who has alleged politics of vendetta, said minorities and Dalits were framed and sent to jail during the SP rule while promising that these cases will be reviewed and those found innocent will be freed, as she eyed her traditional vote bank.The Congress manifesto vowed to appoint a police ombudsman to handle cases of police oppression and set up a Criminal Injuries Compensation Board to ensure relief for victims of criminal oppression."

Photo Rajeev Bhatt: In the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, Lisaad presented an imagery of saffron  communal feelings were running high and the Bharatiya Janata Partys (BJP) flags dotted the village on polling day. The BJP went on to sweep the region, as it did the State.This time around, the dominant colour in this Jat-dominated village in Shamli was the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) flag  the hand pump on green and white. As the riot-affected village voted on Saturday  around 13 people were allegedly murdered here in September 2013  the change in political sentiments was remarkable. The Jats here are seen rejecting the BJP even though it fielded a candidate from their community  Tejinder Nirwal.The BJP is treating the Jats as if we are cabs meant for hire ( kiraye ki taxi). Without the Jats, the BJP is nothing in this belt, said Devinder Malik, a Jat farmer, resting on a cot near a sugarcane field.Multiple reasonsThe Jats anger against the BJP stems from many reasons  some economic, other emotional. If they blame the Modi government for failing to pay the dues of sugarcane farmers, in the same breath they also rake up the neglect and disrespect meted out by the BJP to former PM Chaudhary Charan Singh and his family, and the Jat reservation issue in Haryana.Chaudhary ji (Ajit Singh, RLD leader and son of Charan Singh) was thrown out of his kothi (official bungalow in Delhi). And now, when polling is near and the BJP sensed the Jat vote is slipping, Modi remembers Charan Singh ji in his Bijnore rally. Did he even mention him once before that... on his birthday, December 23? asks Shailendra Malik, one among the many Jat men gathered outside their homes after exercising their franchise.The village is in the heart of the sugar belt and there is anger among Jats for the BJPs failure to pay their dues. Demonetisation is also criticised here, but in patches.Mill owners got the interest rate waived while farmers are still waiting to get their dues. They got no relief. Some got nothing more than Rs. 20 or Rs. 30 from the cooperatives, said Dalbir Singh, former MLA from the seat and uncle of Brijendra Malik, who is in the running as the RLD candidate. Nobody has done good to us like the RLD  it created awareness among Jats, got awareness, chips in Arvind Chauhan.The Muslims of the village fled after the riots and now live in Kandhla, a kasba . If most of them sold their original homes, many Muslim homes remain untended, their doors locked. The communal divide has dissipated since 2013 but it looks unlikely that the alliance that Chaudhary Charan Singh nurtured would be restored any time soon as Muslims are not expected to return here. The Jats also deny that any lives were lost in the violence, claiming that the Muslims hyped up figures to get compensation from the government. They blame the BJP and the Samajwadi Party (SP) government for the riots. Many Jat youth were falsely arrested, is the common refrain.The Jats, however, remember the riots as unfortunate  as it has not only defamed the community but also broken the economic ties with Muslims, who provided them with a cheap labour force.Even today, around 150 Muslims come here daily to sell wood, or as labour. Before the riots happened, there was a deep bond between us. The polarisation destroyed that, said Arvind Chauhan, who works in a sugarcane factory.An audio recording of BJP president Amit Shah requesting Jats for their support has allegedly gone viral. When Jats in neighbouring Kiwana village are asked about it, they dismiss it as another gimmick.  Kuch farak nahi padega (nothing with change). The BJP is a party of liars, retorted a Jat elder.Travelling across the Jat belt in western U.P., the shift in mood is apparent. On this seat, the Jat votes are expected to be split among the RLD, the Congress and the BJP  all three have fielded Jats. The Congress Pankaj Malik is the incumbent."
58f6e5f77be9e031f13bdb04,Muslim voters hold the key to Rohilkhand title,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/muslim-voters-hold-the-key-to-rohilkhand-title/articleshow/57116491.cms,2017-02-13,"LUCKNOW: With seven out of 11 districts of Rohilkhand going to the polls in the second phase on February 15 having more than 30% Muslim population, it will be a real test for an aggressive minority outreach by both Samajwadi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party. On the other hand, Bharatiya Janata Party, facing an anti-demonetization sentiments among voters, would be banking on a split in minority votes as a consolidation may spell trouble for it in this phase.Rohilkhand has always been dominated by Muslims and a number of constituencies out of 67 foing to the polls in Phase 2 have more than 50^% population of the community. In districts like Rampur (50.6%), Moradabad (50.8%), Bijnor (43%) and Amroha (40.8%), the share of the community almost reaches the halfway mark. In 2012, when the Muslims voted en mass for SP, it won 35 out of 67 seats while BJP could win just 10. The BSP had 11 seats in this region and now if it has to return to power in Lucknow, it will have to consolidate its position among Muslims to form a winning caste chemistry of the Dalits and the Muslims.Both BSP and SP have started claiming support from Muslim clerics and ulema to send a message among the community voters that they are the best placed to defeat BJP. While Ulama Council, shia cleric Kalbe Jawad and Delhi Jama Masjid's Imam Maulana Bukhari pronounced their support for BSP, a large number of clerics and ulema, led by the principal of prominent seminary Nadwa-ul-Islam, Maulana Saeed-ur-Rahman Azami Nadwi and imam of Aisbagh Eidgah Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali met CM Akhilesh Yadav and extended their support to him.For BJP, this region is most difficult to win as it faces the distraught workers of small-scale and unorganised trades and Muslims united against the party. With thousands of poor working in the zari , wooden furniture and flute-making industries in dark and dingy lanes and bylanes to make two ends meet on one side and farmers prospering from paddy, sugar cane wheat and milk production on the other, Rohilkhand region, going to polls in the second phase of voting for the 2017 assembly elections presents a picture of contrast.Demonetisation has, however, hit the haves as well as have-nots of the region. If a large part of the manpower is sitting idle in the unorganised sector and the furniture and zari cottage industries, lakhs of farmers are hit hard too as they are finding no buyers for their farm produce. ""We have no orders though the marriage season is at its peak,"" lamented Suresh Agarwal, owner of a cane furniture shop, recalling how he had to hire additional workers to deliver the orders of furniture in the previous season.Badaun district in this region is a spot of prosperity for the white revolution being largest producer of milk in the region, while in Bareilly , Pilibhit, Saharanpur, Lakhimpur and Shahjahanpur, the impact of green revolution has over the decades changed the socio-economic condition. A good number of Sikh families of Lakhimpur and parts of Shahjahanpur have siblings in the US and Canada. The farm houses and resorts in this terai belt of the state have best of electronic gadgets and cars in their possession. More than two-third of 120 sugar mills are in this part and with highest production of sugar cane and paddy it is also called the rice bowl and sugar belt.But delving deeper, the economic condition of those making a livelihood out of zari work and kajal (kohl) manufacture has not improved in the past 40-50 years and they are still dependent on daily wages. This is the reason petty workers in the unorganised sector of Rohilkhand are worst hit by the demonetisation.For the ruling Samajwadi Party too, the challenge is to protect its citadel. The party has now allied with the Congress which won just three seats. The prestige of Dharmendra Yadav, Samajwadi Party MP from Badaun and cousin of chief minister Akhilesh Yadav is at stake in the region. Like in many places, the ruling party is facing stiff resistance from rebels.Captain Arjun Singh , who was well placed in US and a professional pilot was roped in by Akhilesh Yadav to join his party and contest election. But he was denied ticket because his father Narendra Yadav is a Mulayam loyalist. Now, Arjun Singh is contesting from the Dataganj assembly constituency independently and challenging the SP-Congress alliance.After Badaun, the party's prestige is at stake in Rampur a district represented by powerful minister Mohammed Azam Khan who is contesting this time along with his son, while Azam's wife is already a Rajya Sabha member. Azam is so tied up in his home district for his and his son's elections that even so close to the third phase of polls he has not yet stepped out of his home to campaign for other candidates of the party.Across Rohilkhand, the Congress hopes hinge on its firebrand leader Imran Masood of Saharanpur. Masood has worked hard in the district and adjoining constituencies and Congress had gave him free hand in ticket distribution. Former Union minister Jitin Prasada is also contesting from Tilhar assembly while the sitting MLA of the party Sanjay Kapoor is seeking his re-election."

The 200-odd families in Chauri village consider tyre tube and air pump essential commodity to keep them afloat. Chauri is among dozens of villages where life comes to standstill every year during monsoon.Located close to the forceful Sharda river, off the Palia-Nighasan state highway, lakhs of people are hit by floods every year. Cousin brothers Randheer and Balbir of Chauri have learned to tide over the strong currents that leave their village marooned . ""But we cannot think of surviving without tubes. It feels like spending four months on an island,"" said Randheer displaying the tyre tube outside his kutcha house.Like every election season, this time too netas have queued up in Lakhimpur villages promising to fix the problem by erecting concrete retaining walls. But villagers have stopped taking their promises seriously.During floods, district administration takes help of people who own boats and deploy them as per their discretion. ""Boats available with administration are few and we are forced to risk our lives and arrange for fodder for cattle and get groceries, oil and other sundry items from across the stream floating on the tube. Generally, we borrow stuff from relatives who stay on higher grounds and have access to the city,"" said Balbir.Thousands of residents of Chauri, Khalepurwa, Ballipur, Narosa, Laguan, Piparia, Ramnagar Kalan and Ghoom Pipara gram sabhas under Nighasan, Palia and Gola assembly constituencies have been forced to shift out of their original houses at least twice.Shri Krishna (42) from Ramnagar Kalan was forced to change three homes. ""I have become a voter of different constituency now. Earlier, I came under Palia. After the third instance in 2013, we decided to construct a pucca house far away from Sharda basin. Acres of agricultural land sank, unable to withstand the strong currents in July,"" said Krishna.Between Palia and Nighasan, the embankment raised to hold the river gets breached at several places. ""Excess mountain water is released in Sharda from Banbasa dam in Champawat district. As Uttaranchal government monitors the dam, we have little scope to do anything,"" said Sanjay Shukla, pradhan of the biggest gram panchayat Bhira in Lakhimpur Kheri district where 17,000 people live. Newly built pulias (small bridges) are the ones that wither away easily if monsoon is good, adds Shukla.A small breach leads to four months of flood-like situation in the adjoining village which lasts between July and October. Surjeet Singh, a sugarcane grower from Bhira has lost 9.5 acre of land in the past eight years. ""This year too, we had to employ JCB to clear the slush after flood water receded,"" said Surjeet, pointing at the sandbanks next to his fields which were green till 2013. Over the decades, villagers have learned to handle nature's fury, knowing there is little the elections would change."
593ba7ba7be9e0066b6f5e36,Maya plays divide and woo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170214/jsp/nation/story_135703.jsp,2017-02-14,"Lucknow, Feb. 13: Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati today claimed that Mulayam Singh Yadav had insulted his younger brother Shivpal Yadav, playing on the differences within the ruling family as she appealed to people not to waste their votes on a divided party. If the former Uttar Pradesh chief minister's apparent show of sympathy came as a surprise, her choice of location stood out too. Mayawati was speaking at a rally in Etawah, Samajwadi Party patriarch Mulayam's home district. ""Mulayam has been insulting Shivpal to establish his son and chief minister Akhilesh Yadav in the Samajwadi Party,"" Mayawati said. Earlier, Mayawati had often said she would put in jail wrongdoers in the Samajwadi, including Shivpal, when she came to power. Akhilesh and Shivpal had been locked in a power tussle last year before the younger man eventually wrested control of the party at a convention on January 1, where he took over as Samajwadi national chief from his father and removed his uncle as the head of the state unit. But there are many who believe that Mulayam secretly stood by his son during the power struggle. Although he has spoken out against his son and in favour of his brother, most of his actions suggest he supports Akhilesh. Mayawati's comments came days after some Shivpal loyalists - including Ambika Chaudhay and Narad Rai who were removed from Akhilesh's cabinet in September -joined the BSP. Asked recently whether she would also welcome Shivpal into her party, the BSP boss had said: ""I can think about it if he approaches me."" Shivpal has denied any such possibility. Shivpal is contesting as a Samajwadi candidate from Jaswant Nagar in Etawah district. A star campaigner for the party till the 2014 parliamentary elections, he has been confined to one Assembly seat now. ""The traditional vote of the SP will be divided between the uncle and the nephew as both are working against each other. I appeal to the people not to spoil their votes,"" Mayawati said. She was referring to the Yadavs who account for over 12 per cent of the votes in the three dozen Assembly constituencies in and around Etawah, where polling would be held on February 19, the third leg of the seven-phase elections in the state. ""I also appeal to minority voters not to waste their votes on the SP because the communal BJP can win in that case,"" Mayawati added. Mayawati also responded to Akhilesh's claim at election rallies that the BJP and the BSP together could try to form the government if the Samajwadi didn't have the numbers. ""The SP has forged a pre-poll alliance with the Congress on the direction of the BJP. The SP... and Prime Minister Narendra Modi... have been hatching a conspiracy to silence me,"" she said. Later, in Lucknow, the BSP boss said Modi's politics was unbecoming of a Prime Minister. ""The way the PM makes false allegations of corruption against the BSP doesn't suit his position. He stoops to this level for political mileage,"" she said. At a rally today in Lakhimpur Kheri, Modi had said there was a scam behind the divestment of several sugar mills in the state between 2007 and 2012, when Mayawati was in power. ""The Samajwadi had promised during the 2012 Assembly election campaign that an inquiry would be conducted against Mayawati if they came to power. But no probe was done after Akhilesh took over as CM,"" Modi said."

Frustrated, she said,  Notebandi (demonetisation) has ruined us. There has been extreme financial difficulty, and expressed support for Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav and his Samajwadi Party. Her husband came running, stood in front of her, and exclaimed, She has no idea what shes talking about. [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] is doing a great job, and he will rid this country of corruption. Notebandi hasnt been too bad. He will support the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) this time. The woman continued to mock her husband from behind: Cant you see? Clearly, Mr. Modi has given him so much money. A crowd gathered around, laughing at the jeers; even her husband cracked a smile.A young farmer seemingly threw his support behind the Congress: The Congress was clearly better for farmers. Another woman spoke highly of Mayawati and her Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP). Yet, in this jumble of party preferences, no one offered an identity-based reason for their inclinations even though everyone was from the Jat community.Economic preferencesThe sheer diversity and complexity of party preferences observed in discussions in the Jat neighbourhood is quite common. All across U.P., our conversations with homogeneous identity groups, whether caste or religion, often yield heterogeneous pronouncements of partisan support. Of course, identity still fundamentally structures social hierarchies and inequalities in daily life. However, the simplistic assignment of identity groups to particular political parties, a standard practice among political analysts in India, is far from the empirical reality. Worse yet, it is a form of analysis that robs the Indian voter of her personal agency and decision-making faculties; most voters are not a priori committed to a single party and weigh their options carefully. Even the Jatav community, which most believe is largely beholden to Ms. Mayawati and the BSP, displayed significant support for the BJP in 2014. It is precisely this perpetual churning in the electorate that makes elections unpredictable and results volatile; after all, no party has held on to the chief ministership of U.P. for more than a single term since the breakdown of Congress rule in 1989.In this election, close observers of U.P. politics have noticed a discernible shift in the Jat community, which seemingly overwhelmingly supported the BJP in the 2014 general election, to the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), a largely Jat party led by Ajit Singh. Yet, despite the optics of it, what is striking is that the most commonly cited frustrations in the Jat community are not framed in explicitly identity-based terms, but rather in economic terms. Jats expressed their anger with the BJP based on the impact of demonetisation and poor implementation of interest-free loans that were promised to local sugar cane farmers. Even when pushed on the Jat demand for caste reservations, a young Jat farmer told us that the most preferred system would be to have reservations based purely on economic need or not to have them at all. The Jats, like virtually every other identity group, are not beholden to a single party. As parties must compete for the sympathies of voters, they often resort to promises of economic delivery. This leads to an increased salience of economic preferences, whether in delivery of benefits or in large-scale development, in determining vote choice.Modis appealU.P. was the crown jewel in the Modi wave in the 2014 national election, with the BJP and its allies securing an incredible 73 out 80 Lok Sabha seats (more than a quarter of the seats the BJP won in the election). While the religious polarisation in Muzaffarnagar received media attention, U.P., like much of the country, was convinced of Mr. Modis promises of jobs and economic growth. As Prime Minister, he seemed well positioned to deliver given his tenure as the Chief Minister of the economically developed State of Gujarat and a stark contrast to the feckless Congress government that was ruling the country. But nearly three years into his term, Mr. Modis economic accomplishments are wanting. According to the Labour Bureau, the last two years of the previous government (2013 and 2014) produced at least four lakh new jobs a year, whereas the first two full years of the Modi government (2015 and 2016) yielded just one to two lakh new jobs a year. Voters may not vote on the basis of any macroeconomic indicator, but they can directly feel the impact of low economic and job growth.In our travels in Bihar during the Assembly elections campaign of late 2015, BJP supporters often mentioned Mr. Modi as the only person who could bring jobs to the country, but that sort of language has all but disappeared now in U.P. Mr. Modi has staked his appeal on being a decisive leader instead. A young Jatav woman we met weeks ago in Firozabad district made this point: Mr. Modi is a very good person. I like him. He is decisive and speaks well. However, she will be supporting the BSP in this election. Therein lies the problem for the BJP; State elections are more likely to be fought over the delivery of benefits and public goods, and these are the sort of appeals the BJP has all but abandoned. In Shamli district, a middle-aged Jat farmer was more direct: It is Modis government at the Centre. Doesnt he have the power to give us money?Akhileshs popularityMuch like Chief Minister Nitish Kumar in Bihar, Akhilesh Yadav has staked his reputation on enlarging the role of the state in the broad-based delivery of public goods and benefits while trying to shed the image of a standard caste leader. According to a report published by the Accountability Initiative analysing State budgets in India, U.P. was just one of four States that saw an increase of 5% or more between the last two Budgets in the share of social services as a share of State government expenditure. This also applies to investment in large-scale infrastructure, as, according to Budget estimates from the RBI, the proportion of the Gross State Domestic Product spent on capital outlays in development expenditure (5.8%) is second highest among non-special category States in India. The increased role of the state has produced tangible, visible outputs that have fuelled an undercurrent of popularity for Mr. Yadav. An upper caste driver from Kanpur told us, Near my home Akhilesh turned a one-lane road into a four-lane road. I am committed to the BJP, but I am hopeful that Akhilesh becomes the next Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh. Despite satisfaction with Mr. Yadavs work, the driver remains persuaded by Mr. Modis character and hopeful he can begin to make an economic impact in the future.As the polls in U.P. shift eastward, away from the religiously polarised western parts of the State, issues of economic delivery may become increasingly salient for voters. During the election, one tends to focus on local, nitty-gritty issues, but its important to remember that elections are won and lost on larger narratives. In this election, Mr. Yadav has built a formidable narrative as someone who can deliver benefits and public goods; it remains to be seen if this will translate to votes.Bhanu Joshi and Neelanjan Sircar are affiliated with the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) in Delhi. Ashish Ranjan, also with CPR, contributed to this article.State elections are more likely to be fought over the delivery of public goods, and these are the sort of appeals in which Akhilesh Yadav has invested"
58f5772d7be9e01a357a1328,Communal politics in name of ‘Holi ka Nawab’,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/communal-politics-in-name-of-holi-ka-nawab/articleshow/57155906.cms,2017-02-15,"SHAHJAHANPUR: Morning prayers at the Arya Samaj temple in Shahjahanpur's Town Hall end at 8.30am. After the chanting of the ritualistic shlokas, cries of 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' and 'Gau Mata ki Jai' rent the air. Locals say the chanting is routine, but the sloganeering is not. Yet, everyone goes about their business as usual.With polling for the second phase of UP elections to begin in less than 24 hours, corner store conversations almost all dwell on the political possibilities locally as well as in UP. In Shahjahanpur, one of the talking points is the fate of the town's traditional 'Holi Ka Nawab' procession, if the local SP candidate Tanveer Khan unseats BJP's seven-time MLA Suresh Khanna.The controversial procession is an annual affair on Holi for as long as the locals can remember. ""A Muslim man is appointed Nawab. He's dressed and fed by the organisers for two days. Then, the night before the procession, he is made to consume so much alcohol that he is driven nearly senseless. The next morning, the procession travels from Chowk through most of the old city, with the Nawab being beaten with brooms, sticks and shoes,"" says Rajesh, a bystander at a local sweetmeat shop in Town Hall.The tradition has faced considerable opposition from the city's minority population, not only as hurtful for the community, but also because it is inhuman that a man should be treated thus. With the event having triggered riots in the past, local mosques are covered with an oil cloth lest the riotous crowd throws ink or colour at the structure. To prevent an outbreak of communal tensions, large contingents of security forces are deployed to walk with the procession as it travels through the city.Masoom Raza Khan, a local, even went to Allahabad high court to put a halt to this tradition. However, his plea, filed on March 18 this year was turned down, with the court saying the matter fell within the jurisdiction of the district administration, and if they did not have a problem with it, the court could not intervene.Both SP's Tanveer Khan and BSP's Mohammed Aslam have not made any promises regarding discontinuing the tradition of 'Holi ke Nawab'. Even so, the population is beginning to be polarised on the back of a rumour that the procession will be discontinued if a Muslim legislator takes control of the city.In the run up to the polls, communal differences have suddenly entered drawing room discourse even though there has been no report of an untoward incident in the district. In Dadraul assembly segment, local BJP worker RP Singh says he's heard that a cow was slaughtered in Shahbad village of Dadraul. When TOI went looking to see whether the incident actually occurred, it turned out Shahbad is across the border in Hardoi, and that such an incident was never reported even over there. Yet, the rumour mills are already spinning.BJP leader and 'Hindu Hriday Samrat' Yogi Adityanath has played his part in inflaming passions in Shahjahanpur. At an election rally in Jalalabad on the last day of campaigning, he alleged the Samajwadi Kanya Vidya Dhan scheme was only open to Muslim girls. This is factually incorrect as the scheme can be availed by all girls who have passed Class XII and belong to BPL families. But Adityanath says it with such confidence that the crowds at the rally clap in agreement. In Jalalabad, where the BSP candidate Neeraj Maurya is a frontrunner for the seat, and BJP's Manoj Kashyap trails behind the SP contender, Adityanath also rakes up the anti-Romeo squads. The Muzaffarnagar riots could have been prevented if the anti-Romeo squads existed, he says.The bitterness has spread across the length and breadth of the sugarcane producing region. At a roadside dhaba a few kilometres short of Katra assembly constituency, Nathuram Dubey says he's heard 37 cows were found dead in neighbouring Lakhimpur Kheri. It is unfortunate, he says, that parties resort to communal politics to divide people. ""This does no one any good. The politicians will disappear the day after the polls. But we must live and work together. These divisions, once created, remain forever,"" he says."

The post-Partition face of the Indian Muslims, Maulana Azad, was keen to contest an election from a constituency with a sizeable Hindu population to prove his secular credentials when Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru insisted he contest from Muslim-majority Rampur district instead. Nehru didnt want to take a risk with the electoral fortunes of one of his key lieutenants. A reluctant Azad eventually agreed, and although he managed to have his way by contesting from Gurgaon in the 1957 elections, the die had been cast: a Muslim politician in UP was seen to need the crutches of his co-religionists to win an election.Azad at least had the stature to be seen as a genuine ambassador of Hindu-Muslim unity. Azam Khan, the Samajwadi Partys (SP) most-prominent Muslim face and its MLA from Rampur, typifies a dangerous brand of aggressive Muslim-first politics masquerading as secularism. His strident rhetoric is designed to consciously appeal to his Muslim constituency: Rather than speak of how he intends to lift the community from the morass of under-development, his focus is on stoking their worst fears and insecurities. In the Azam Khan worldview, the way to win elections is to portrait Narendra Modi as an ogre, someone Muslims should be very frightened of.Read: My India My Vote: Uttar PradeshAnd yet, despite his abominable public utterances (one of the worst was when he suggested that the Kargil war was won by Muslim soldiers), the SP has chosen to stick with Khan because it suits their political agenda of wooing the states 18% Muslim vote. The partys original vote bank was built in the early 1990s on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, with Mulayam Singhs shoot-at-sight orders against kar sevaks at the height of the Ram Mandir movement conferring him the honorific Maulana Mulayam. The standing joke in Lucknow was that if any influential Muslim cleric approached Mulayam, he would be rewarded with an official post.Truth is, the SP has failed to offer the UP Muslim genuine security or social uplift: Patronage of Muslim elites or donations to madrasas have had almost no impact on the lives of citizens. The numerous small and large riots that have occurred in UP in the last five years are indictments of the claim to have ensured communal peace: The worst example being the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots where the local administration clearly failed to act swiftly or in a non-partisan manner.Perhaps, sensing an opportunity, the BSP leader Mayawati has attempted to challenge the MY alliance with her own DM (Dalit-Muslim) social engineering. By giving tickets to 100 Muslims including mafia dons like Mukhtar Ansari, Mayawati has made an attempt to break the Yadav stranglehold over the Muslim vote. There have been previous attempts to create a Dalit-Muslim unity, most notably in Maharashtra, but never has it been tried on the scale that Mayawati is now seeking. It is this fear of a divided Muslim vote rather than any principled commitment to secular values that has spurred the Samajwadi-Congress alliance.Read: UP elections: Why a hung assembly cant be ruled out in this battleground stateThe BJPs response is even more troubling. Despite the PMs promise of sabka saath, sabka vikaas, on the ground there has been a concerted attempt by the local BJP leadership to identify issues that will create a Hindu-Muslim polarisation. If in 2014, the party exploited the Muzaffarnagar riots, this time, issues like a proposed ban on slaughter-houses, a national debate on triple talaq, the alleged flight of Hindus from Kairana in western UP, have been raked up on election eve with the sole intent of consolidating a Hindu vote. The pernicious love jihad campaign of Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and the hate speeches of BJP MPs like Sakshi Maharaj and MLAs like Sangeet Som expose their bigoted mindsets.Trapped then between the opportunistic politics of the so-called secular parties and the demonisation by Hindutva forces, the average UP Muslim voter is left feeling angry and frustrated. They dont want to embrace the self-appointed thekedars of the community like the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid who pops up just before elections despite his growing political irrelevance.They may be attracted to a more articulate leader like Asaduddin Owaisi but are also acutely aware that the Hyderabad MP is only a spoiler at election time. Indeed, if the Muslim voter prefers the SP-Congress alliance today, its because of a visible lack of options, and the fear that he will be soon left without any political voice in the state when confronted with the Sangh parivar juggernaut. Remember the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was the first when not a single Muslim was elected MP from UP.Read: Why UP matters: Can Indias most populous state decide the fate of Delhi?The answer to the Muslim dilemma does not lie in the growing radicalisation of the young who want to express themselves in more violent terms. Nor is it in seeking sops from the state, which are seen as token appeasement. It must lie, at the very core, in the recognition of the economic inter-dependence of communities: A Jat land owner in a sugarcane field in Baghpat must make common cause with the Muslim agricultural labourer as must a Muslim weaver in Banaras with a Hindu sari shop owner for mutual benefit. This can only be enabled by a leader with vision and credibility who enjoys the trust of both communities: Uttar Pradesh is crying out for a 21st century Azad and Nehru.Post script: In the aftermath of the post-Ayodhya riots, Lucknow was remarkably free of any bloody communal conflict. An elderly gent explained it to me with a poetic touch: In this city, Hindu and Muslim are like taala and chabi (lock and key), one cannot do without the other.What Lucknow thinks today, hopefully India will think tomorrow.The writer is senior journalist and authorrajdeepsardesai52@gmail.com"

Azam Khan, the Samajwadi Partys (SP) most-prominent Muslim face and its MLA from Rampur, typifies a dangerous brand of aggressive Muslim-first politics masquerading as secularism. His strident rhetoric is designed to consciously appeal to his Muslim constituency: Rather than speak of how he intends to lift the community from the morass of under-development, his focus is on stoking their worst fears and insecurities. In the Azam Khan worldview, the way to win elections is to portrait Narendra Modi as an ogre, someone Muslims should be very frightened of.Read: My India My Vote: Uttar PradeshAnd yet, despite his abominable public utterances (one of the worst was when he suggested that the Kargil war was won by Muslim soldiers), the SP has chosen to stick with Khan because it suits their political agenda of wooing the states 18% Muslim vote. The partys original vote bank was built in the early 1990s on a Muslim-Yadav (MY) alliance, with Mulayam Singhs shoot-at-sight orders against kar sevaks at the height of the Ram Mandir movement conferring him the honorific Maulana Mulayam. The standing joke in Lucknow was that if any influential Muslim cleric approached Mulayam, he would be rewarded with an official post.Truth is, the SP has failed to offer the UP Muslim genuine security or social uplift: Patronage of Muslim elites or donations to madrasas have had almost no impact on the lives of citizens. The numerous small and large riots that have occurred in UP in the last five years are indictments of the claim to have ensured communal peace: The worst example being the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots where the local administration clearly failed to act swiftly or in a non-partisan manner.Perhaps, sensing an opportunity, the BSP leader Mayawati has attempted to challenge the MY alliance with her own DM (Dalit-Muslim) social engineering. By giving tickets to 100 Muslims including mafia dons like Mukhtar Ansari, Mayawati has made an attempt to break the Yadav stranglehold over the Muslim vote. There have been previous attempts to create a Dalit-Muslim unity, most notably in Maharashtra, but never has it been tried on the scale that Mayawati is now seeking. It is this fear of a divided Muslim vote rather than any principled commitment to secular values that has spurred the Samajwadi-Congress alliance.Read: UP elections: Why a hung assembly cant be ruled out in this battleground stateThe BJPs response is even more troubling. Despite the PMs promise of sabka saath, sabka vikaas, on the ground there has been a concerted attempt by the local BJP leadership to identify issues that will create a Hindu-Muslim polarisation. If in 2014, the party exploited the Muzaffarnagar riots, this time, issues like a proposed ban on slaughter-houses, a national debate on triple talaq, the alleged flight of Hindus from Kairana in western UP, have been raked up on election eve with the sole intent of consolidating a Hindu vote. The pernicious love jihad campaign of Gorakhpur MP Yogi Adityanath and the hate speeches of BJP MPs like Sakshi Maharaj and MLAs like Sangeet Som expose their bigoted mindsets.Trapped then between the opportunistic politics of the so-called secular parties and the demonisation by Hindutva forces, the average UP Muslim voter is left feeling angry and frustrated. They dont want to embrace the self-appointed thekedars of the community like the Shahi Imam of Jama Masjid who pops up just before elections despite his growing political irrelevance.They may be attracted to a more articulate leader like Asaduddin Owaisi but are also acutely aware that the Hyderabad MP is only a spoiler at election time. Indeed, if the Muslim voter prefers the SP-Congress alliance today, its because of a visible lack of options, and the fear that he will be soon left without any political voice in the state when confronted with the Sangh parivar juggernaut. Remember the 2014 Lok Sabha elections was the first when not a single Muslim was elected MP from UP.Read: Why UP matters: Can Indias most populous state decide the fate of Delhi?The answer to the Muslim dilemma does not lie in the growing radicalisation of the young who want to express themselves in more violent terms. Nor is it in seeking sops from the state, which are seen as token appeasement. It must lie, at the very core, in the recognition of the economic inter-dependence of communities: A Jat land owner in a sugarcane field in Baghpat must make common cause with the Muslim agricultural labourer as must a Muslim weaver in Banaras with a Hindu sari shop owner for mutual benefit. This can only be enabled by a leader with vision and credibility who enjoys the trust of both communities: Uttar Pradesh is crying out for a 21st century Azad and Nehru.Post script: In the aftermath of the post-Ayodhya riots, Lucknow was remarkably free of any bloody communal conflict. An elderly gent explained it to me with a poetic touch: In this city, Hindu and Muslim are like taala and chabi (lock and key), one cannot do without the other.What Lucknow thinks today, hopefully India will think tomorrow.The writer is senior journalist and authorrajdeepsardesai52@gmail.com"

The saffron party leader said, ""It is an impious alliance, which is against ideology of Ram Manohar Lohia, who fought against Congress party all his life. Actually it is an alliance of two corrupt families. The moment Akhilesh formed the alliance, he accepted defeat.""Reacting to chief minister Alkhilesh Yadav's slogan 'kaam bolta hai (our work speaks for itself), Shah said, ""He says that his work speaks but UP tops in crime in the country and women in the state feel unsafe. Akhilesh inaugurated the Metro only for the sake of elections. Similarly, the Agra-Lucknow expressway is full of diversions and incomplete but was inaugurated for similar reasons. Do villages in UP get electricity for 24 hours? Is clean, drinking water available in villages? Are farmers selling wheat and sugarcane to the government getting paid timely? If not, then we can't term it as development.""Taking a dig at the law and order situation under the Akhilesh Yadav-led state government, the BJP national president said, ""Akhilesh remains silent on the rape and murder cases against his ministers. The Mathura violence was an open case of corruption and influence of land mafia in the state. Health, education, agriculture and industry all are in bad shape in the state.""When TOI raised the issue of weavers' decision to boycott elections over past governments' neglect towards their demands, Shah replied, "" Not only weavers but the party will also take care of the needs of all kinds of artisans. We have announced various measures for their cause in our vision document.""Shah also gave a lowdown on the saffron party's prospects in the state assembly polls in Uttarakhand, UP, Goa and Manipur. ""While west UP witnessed a BJP wave but in east UP there will be BJP tsunami and we will form the government in the UP, Uttarakhand and Goa. The mood of voters in Manipur is yet not clear and in Punjab it is a triangular contest between Congress, BJP and Aam Aadmi Party,"" he added.When asked about BJP giving tickets to family members of eminent politicians, Shah said, ""There is a lot of difference between Congress and BJP, as in BJP no one is guaranteed a ticket at birth but a candidate gets a ticket only on the basis of the work done by them."""

Shivajirao Nagawade Patil, president of the federation, reasoned the country will not face any sugar shortage as the crushing season 2017-18 is expected to start in the first week of October.Till Monday, the country produced 147 lakh tonne (lt) of sugar.Watch what else is in the newsSome mills are still operational in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat. Considering the present trend, the country will produce 215-16 lt of sugar by the end of season. The carry forward stock of last season is 77 lt so the country will have 293-94 lt of sugar stock at its disposal till the next season starts, he said.Even if one takes the national yearly demand as 250 lt, the next season will start with a carry forward stock of 43-44 lt, said Nagawade Patil. The festive season, which starts from the month of October, will also not see any sugar shortage as the crushing season will be starting early. The fresh stock of sugar will be available by October 15, he said.Import of raw sugar, Nagawade Patil said, will not achieve the price parity that the government is looking at but will impact the present prices of sugar in a negative manner. The landing cost of raw sugar at 10 per cent duty will work out to be Rs 38 per kg. Post processing, the ex factory price of the raw sugar will be around Rs 40 per kg and the retail price will be between Rs 42 and Rs 44 per kg, he said. The demand of sugar traders for import duty reduction, he said, will not help the farmers or the millers.Demands of some millers for lowering of import duty of raw sugar and allowing them to treat it during offseason was also not viable according to him. Once the boilers of the mills are switched off, Nagawade Patil said, it will be difficult for them to turn it on before season.Only mills that have crushed to their full capacity will have bagasse to use as fuel in off season. Rest of the mills would have already exhausted their bagasse in running their co-generation plants or as fuel during the season, he said. Most of the mills in Maharashtra had gone for under capacity crushing so barring a handful of private mills none of them have any extra bagasse. On the other hand mills from Uttar Pradesh had gone for full capacity crushing so they will be able to re-ignite their boilers using stored bagasse and process raw sugar, he said.At present, retail price of sugar in India is Rs 42 per kg, which Nagawade Patil said will not rise. We have asked our members to increase sales so that there is no shortage of sugar, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

So have been his references to local icons to connect with the masses during campaigns for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Beginning his election campaign from western UPs Meerut on February 4 ahead of the first phase of polling, Modi has addressed 10 election meetings so far.He set the tone of his poll campaign in Meerut by likening his partys war against poverty, mafia raj and goonda raj to legendary freedom fighter Mangal Pandeys revolt against the British in 1857.Though born in Ballia, Pandey is considered a local hero in Meerut which was the epicentre of Indias first war of independent 160 years ago.The next day in Aligarh, Modi underlined the plight of cottage industries by referring to the once-popular local locks. It is a pity that the very locks that made Aligarh famous are being used to shut the lock factories, he said.He also criticised rival political parties for misusing BR Ambedkars name while his government prevented the house where Ambedkar lived abroad from being sold. Aligarh district witnessed violence when an Ambedkar statue was damaged a few years ago.In Bijnor, Modi paid tributes to Dalit saint Ravidas on his birth anniversary and said BJP goes by his ideals. He warmed up to the dominant Jats in the area by recalling former Prime Minister Chaudhary Charan Singh and how the Congress defamed him.A farmers welfare scheme named after Charan Singh will be launched if BJP forms the government in UP, he said.At his next rally stop Badaun, Modi proposed a police battalion each named after three women freedom fighters  Jhaklari Bai, Uda Devi and Awanti Bai  for ensuring safety to women. Jhalkari Bai and Uda Devi are the Bahujan Samaj Partys symbols of Dalit pride.Badaun hit headlines three years ago when two Dalit sisters, allegedly gangraped, were found hanging from the branch of a tree.Modi sympathised with the sugarcane growers misery in Lakhimpur Kheri while his speech in Kannauj was peppered with references to potatoes and perfumes.On February 16, the PM recalled Hardois association with the mythical Prahlad, revered for his devotion to Lord Vishnu. He also referred to Vishnus avatar Krishna, who made Gujarat his karmabhoomi after being born in UP. Born in Gujarat, I am working in UP, he said.The same day in Barabanki, Modi paid obeisance to Baba Lodheshwar Mahadev (Shiva), a major pilgrimage in the area.There is nothing political in Modijis recalling local icons during his speeches. Its a way of giving our legendary leaders respect and acknowledging their contribution to our society, state BJP spokesperson Harish Srivastava told HT.SK Dwivedi, Lucknow Universitys former professor of political science, said: The Prime Minister tries connecting with the masses by citing the names of local icons and great leaders but what has pained us sometimes is his language. The words he chooses for his speech should reflect the dignity of the post he is holding."

The four - inspector of Bhojpur police station, a sub inspector and two constables - were convicted for gunning down four daily wagers in an encounter in Bhojpur in November 1996.The four cops were held guilty of murder, destruction of evidence and giving false evidence on February 20.During the alleged encounter, four youngsters - Jalaluddin, Jasbir, Ashok and Pravesh - were gunned down by cops, terming them as criminals, on the afternoon of November 8, 1996 - the day of Dhanteras festival.All four victims hailed from Vijay Nagar in Modi Nagar town and were daily wagers. They were from poor families and had gone to Pilkhuwa in search of daily wage job. They were sitting at a tea stall outside the Bhojpur police station when they were picked up by the cops inside the police station where they were tortured before being killed.Forensic investigations nailed the lies of the cops.After the investigation and trial which lasted more than two decades, CBIs Special Judge (anti corruption) Rajesh Chaudhary had on Monday held then station house officer Lal Singh, sub inspector Joginder Singh and two constables Surya Bhan and Subhash Chand as guilty for murder. The fifth accused Ranbir Singh died during the course of the trial.Initially, the Hapur Police investigated this case, but it gave a clean chit to the encounter team.The convicted cops initially maintained that they were travelling in their jeep along with several accused of a different case, but the four men opened fire at the police party near Machli Bazar, popularly known as Macheri ki puliya in Bhojpur.The convicts maintained that two of the four were shot in retaliatory fire by police while other two went into hiding in nearby sugarcane field and killed in police firing when more police force and senior officers arrived for help from Bhojpur, Modi Nagar, Niwari and Murad Nagar police station areas.However, the CBI took over investigation on April 7, 1997 and revealed that two victims, Jasbir and Jalaluddin were killed by Lal Singh and his colleagues on road while two others, Ashok and Pravesh, were killed in sugarcane fields even before the senior officers and police reinforcements could arrive.During the fake encounter, the cops used revolvers, pistols, rifles, stengun, carbines and AK-47s to open fire. The post mortem examination by Dr SC Aggarwal revealed that Jasbir sustained two bullets while Jalaluddin sustained five shots. The other two, Ashok and Pravesh, died after sustaining two and five bullet injuries, respectively.Interestingly, the CBI investigation also found that a bullet recovered from the body of victim Jasbir was allegedly fired from the official revolver of then IPS officer Jyoti Belur.It is not yet clear whether she had the possession of the weapon or not.Belur, who was posted as the Circle officer in the rank of assistant superintendent of police, was never charge sheeted by the CBI, but was summoned as an accused by the court on September 9, 2007.Belur is said be to living in United Kingdom and has failed to make a personal appearance in the case so far. Her petitions against the courts summon orders were rejected by the Allahabad high court and the Supreme Court.On the other hand, the case trial has been an ordeal for the poor families of the victims, who battled all odds and did not give up despite pressure from police to withdraw the case and lack of finances.After my brother was shot dead in the encounter, my father pursued the case in Dehradun but he died from a heart stroke in 2008. Then my aged mother took up the case and has pursued it till date. We had to sell our house and cattle to get money but we did not give up. The policemen visited us and told us to reach a compromise but we did not, Pushpa said, sister of deceased Ashok."

I am waiting to get my ration card for the last two years. Even the grains and items like oil and sugar [provided free by the Akhilesh government] are not supplied as promised. The administration eats up half, he says.Verma says he is voting for the BSP. The party candidate and incumbent MLA from the reserved seat (Naraini) is Gaya Charan Dinkar, the leader of the opposition in the Assembly and also a Jatav.It is late in the evening and Verma has come to a small kiosk near his village for a cup of tea. The shop is run by another Dalit, Manoj Kumar, 19.Manoj, who belongs to the Kori Dalit subcaste, disagrees with Verma. He supports the BJP and hopes the party fulfils its promise of providing free education to intermediate level and college-going boys and girls. Modiji works for the youth. Akhilesh also focuses on youth but my biradari is voting for BJP. Mayawati focusses too much on caste. She has taken care of goondaism but what development has she done? asks Manoj, a first-time voter.Incidentally, the BJP candidate contesting the seat, Raj Karan Kabir, belongs to his caste."

Lawyers in the case also said that after several summons being issued, a non-bailable warrant was issued against her.The chargesheet states that Belur was not present at the spot when (policeman) Lal Singh fired at Jasbir Singh, according to the eyewitnesses.It adds that Belur, along with then SP (Rural) O P Sagar and other police officers, reached the spot after receiving information from Lal Singh that two criminals had been shot while two others had escaped towards the sugarcane fields.Belur could not be reached for comments and Sagar, who has retired from police service, maintained he had not been in touch with her for at least 15 years. She moved to Dehradun after her posting in Ghaziabad. I was in touch with her till 2000, but I have not spoken to her since then. Her husband was also a civil servant. I came to know that both of them had taken a sabbatical from their jobs and they went abroad to study. Later, they settled abroad, Sagar said.In her book, Belur writes that she worked as an officer of the IPS in Uttar Pradesh and it was her experience as a police officer in UP, notorious for encounters of dreaded criminals in the late 1970s and 1980s, which led to her studying encounters.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
594045db7be9e024e45980f7,Bulk milk coolers: A cool way to chill for dairies and farmers,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/bulk-milk-coolers-a-cool-way-to-chill-for-dairies-and-farmers-bmc-4538749/,2017-02-23,"Dairy farmers at a milk procurement centre with a rapid chiller facility in a Tamil Nadu village. Dairy farmers at a milk procurement centre with a rapid chiller facility in a Tamil Nadu village.The near-quadrupling of milk procurement by dairy cooperatives in Gujarat over the last 15 years  from an average of 45 lakh litres to about 170 lakh litres per day  has been attributed no less to a single factor: 24-hour power in rural areas, including guaranteed three-phase supply for eight hours, enabling village-level societies to install bulk milk coolers (BMC). These, with capacities ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 litres, chill the milk to around 4 degrees celsius at the primary collection point itself, inhibiting microbial growth that can lead to undesirable quality/taste changes and expedite spoilage.But maintaining the freshness of raw milk sourced from farmers isnt all that the BMCs have done.In the pre-BMC era, the milk collected by the society had to reach the dairy plant by 8:30 am or so, before day temperatures rose. It required procurement to start by 6 am and farmers undertaking milking at least an hour earlier, so as to not miss the tanker. The sheer need to hurry through the process, moreover, limited the number of animals that could be milked. With BMCs, the milk was chilled at source and remained fresh, which gave farmers the flexibility to deliver even at 9 am. They could now afford to expand their herd size and supply more milk. Today, an estimated 80 per cent of milk collected by Gujarats dairy unions comes through BMCs and it is not difficult to see the link between these and higher procurement volumes.Watch What Else Is making NewsNot every state, unfortunately though, is Gujarat  where farmers have assured electricity supply allowing milk to be chilled not very long after it has left the udders of cows or buffaloes. In much of rural India, power supply is irregular, which means even BMCs cannot do without the backup of diesel generators.This is where an innovation by Promethean Power Systems, a Pune-based company founded by two men from Boston has made a difference. In 2011, Sorin Grama and Sam White built the final prototype of a Rapid Milk Chiller (RMC) based on a proprietary Thermal Storage System (TSS) technology. At the heart of it lay a thermal battery, which drew and stored electricity from the grid as and when available. This stored energy it then released to rapidly chill the milk collected from farmers at ambient temperatures  say, 35 degrees  to 4 degrees Celsius.The duo initially sought to establish the feasibility of a solar-powered milk chilling solution. While the trials were successful, their prospective customers, however, wanted a system that was less bulky (solar panels take up too much space), more cost-effective (which was not the case with solar technology in 2010), and easier to operate. Further, solar-based chilling wasnt seen to be necessary in places where there was at least intermittent power supply, even if unreliable. The thermal battery could be charged whenever electricity was available; the trick was to decouple supply of power from chilling. From this emerged the alternative TSS technology, which was more economical and better-suited to general Indian rural conditions.Grama and White launched the TSS-based RMC as a pilot project six years ago near Goa. In 2013, Promethean Systems began commercial operations in India. We have so far sold over 500 units in the country and these have already chilled more than 150 million litres of milk supplied by 25,000-plus farmers, says Jiten Ghelani, CEO of the company.The systems main advantage is the flexibility it gives for chilling milk at village level, even without consistent grid power or diesel generator backup. Typically, BMCs run on gen-sets for 50 per cent of the time, resulting in both high operational costs and 25-30 per cent more carbon emissions, notes Jofi Joseph, Director of Sales & Marketing.Chilling at source is a win-win for both dairy plants and farmers. Milk is a good medium for growth of microorganisms. Chilling within about an hour of milking basically prevents the build-up of bacteria converting the lactose or sugar in the milk into lactic acid, which curdles the proteins and causes souring. Dairies, then, get access to milk with less microbial load and spoilage possibility, while farmers, too, benefit from flexibility with regard to delivery time and increased herd size. Besides, they can expect to fetch a quality premium in terms of price per litre.The buyers of our RMCs arent individual farmers. The processors sourcing milk from them are the ones investing in the equipment, costing Rs 5-6 lakh each, and installing these in their respective village-level collection centres, explains Ghelani, whose company claims to have developed a customer base across Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh.Amul dairy currently has a collection centre at Pahad Dhara, a village in Punes outskirts, where it has put up an RMC. Earlier, we had a regular BMC that used to operate most of the time on diesel, entailing a monthly expense of Rs 35,000 a month. With the RMC, which was installed roughly a year ago, we are now spending only Rs 5,000 on electricity, notes Devadnya Dilip Wagh, a coordinator at the chilling centre that procures an average 600 litres per day of milk from 20 farmers in the village.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The documents in the case suggest that the convicts faked the second part of the encounter, for which they had sought police reinforcements through their internal communication system.The four victims, Jalaluddin, Ashok, Pravesh and Jasbir, were gunned down on the afternoon of November 8, 1996, the day of Dhanteras festival. The UP police, in the initial FIR, had stated that they gunned down two badmash (goons) on the road while two, hiding in the nearby sugarcane fields, were gunned down in retaliatory firing.According to the 1996 FIR, the encounter ensued near Machli Bazar, popularly known as Macheri ki Puliya, around 3.30pm when a police party led by Bhojpur station house officer (SHO) Lal Singh was on its way in a jeep accompanying four (different) accused for recovery of arms in a different case.Lal Singh had stated that the police party spotted four youngsters en route and asked them to stop, but they hid among trees and opened fire on the police party.They took cover in trenches and trees, and fired two rounds at the police with an intention to kill, but we were saved. We sat down and took up (attack) position despite the danger to our lives. The badmash (goons) fired twice and one bullet zoomed past my ear. Then, I crawled while moving forward and fired four shots from my revolver, Lal Singh had stated in the FIR.He had further stated that constables Ranbir fired five rounds from his carbine, Surya Bhan fired four rounds from his Sten gun and Subhash Chand fired three rounds from his rifle, which finally killed two.Hearing the firing, the jeep driver sent messages from the police radio-talkie set to the Bhojpur and Modi Nagar police for reinforcements. A team led by then Modi Nagar circle officer Jyoti Belur, and another team led by OP Sagar, superintendent of police (rural - SPRA), came to their aid.The FIR further states that around 5pm, the police force, on the directions of SPRA and the ASP entered the thick sugarcane fields nearly 9-10 steps when the badmash opened fire again. On this, the police party, despite peril to their lives, showed exemplary courage and opened fire in retaliation in the direction where movements of the goons were heard. The badmash fired again but the firing stopped after some time... the FIR stated.The police had claimed to have recovered weapons from the four persons. Nearly all the officials, including the SPRA, ASP, SHO, station officers and constables had fired rounds from their respective weapons, which included revolvers, rifles, carbine and deadly AK-47s.A total of five cases were registered that were investigated by MP Singh, then inspector of Hapur police station and a case closure report was filed on January 21, 1997, at the Ghaziabad court.However, under public pressure and political intervention, the case was transferred to the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The agencys investigation revealed that the four victims were in Pilkhuwa looking for jobs and were sitting at a tea stall opposite the Bhojpur police station. The four were called inside and were taken in a police jeep towards Modi Nagar.The jeep stopped near Macheri ki pulia around 3.30pm where Surya Bhan, Ranbir Singh and Subhash Chand pulled Jalaluddin from the jeep. Lal Singh pushed him and opened fire at him. Jalaluddin died after suffering a rifle shot, fired by Subhash Chand. Lal Singh then fired at Jasbir Singh.Meanwhile, Joginder Singh, a sub-inspector from Bhojpur police station, reached the spot on a scooter with countrymade weapons, kattas. These were planted near the bodies of Jasbir and Jalaluddin after firing one round from each.The police then entered the sugarcane fields and fired a few rounds. Chander Pal, a friend of Lal Singh from Bhojpur village, arrived at the spot and was allowed to enter the fields. He saw the dead bodies of two others, Ashok and Pravesh. He also found police breaking the sugarcane around the bodies.That before the arrival of Jyoti Belur, ASP and OP Sagar, SPRA, and other officers, the four deceased were thus found shot at, injured and dead, the CBI chargesheet stated.During the post-mortem examination, Dr SC Aggarwal found that Jasbir had sustained two shots, Jalaluddin, five, Ashok, two and Pravesh, five. All four had suffered injuries to their chest while Ashok, Jalaluddin and Pravesh had bullet marks on their heads as well, just above the ear."
594053f37be9e024e459837f,Ex-IPS wanted in fake encounter case teaching policing in UK,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cbi-court-ex-ips-wanted-in-fake-encounter-case-teaching-policing-in-uk/,2017-02-23,"Ironical it may sound but Jyoti Belur, a former IPS officer, wanted in connection with the extra-judicial killing of four labourers is giving lectures on policing at University College London. Belur, now a lecturer in the Department of Security and Crime Science of Faculty of Engineering Sciences, apparently has 34 publications to her name, as per the information available on the colleges website.WATCH WHAT ELSE IS IN THE NEWSAmong other publications dealing with policing-related issues, four published in 2009-10 are dedicated to encounters and the use of police force in democracies, it shows.Police use of deadly force: police perceptions of a culture of approval, why do the police use deadly force: explaining police encounters in Mumbai, police encounters in Mumbai, India and permission to shoot?, police use of deadly force in democracies are some of the titles that find place in various journals.A 1993-batch IPS officer, Belur was an Additional Superintendent of Police in Modi Nagar in 1996, probably on her first posting, when four youths in the area were gunned down by personnel of a police station under her jurisdiction on November 8, 1996 on Dhanteras, a festival preceding Diwali.It emerged in the probe that one of the bullets fired at one of the youths, Jasbir Singh, was from Belurs revolver, the CBI had claimed in the charge sheet.Though the agency did not name her in the charge sheet, claiming that she was in Ghaziabad on the day the incident took place, the Special Court, Ghaziabad, had treated her as an accused in the case and issued warrants against her in 2007.But how the service revolver of an IPS officer was with a junior officer could not be explained satisfactorily.Her attempts to get relief from inclusion in the charge sheet failed at the Allahabad High Court and also at the Supreme Court.Despite warrants, Belur, who was transferred from UP cadre to Uttarakhand cadre in 2000 after the new state was carved out, did not appear before the court for trial.The 48-year-old has been sacked by the Home Ministry, the cadre controlling authority of IPS officers, as she has been absent since 2001.The mail sent to her on her e-mail id, given on the UCL web page, did not elicit any response from her.Meanwhile, the special CBI court has awarded life sentence to four Uttar Pradesh Police personnel  Inspector Lal Singh, Sub- Inspector Joginder Singh and constables Surya Bhan and Subhash Chand of Bhojpur Police Station who had shot dead Jalaluddin, Jasbir, Ashok and Pravesh.They have been held guilty of murder, destruction of evidence and producing false evidence.The CBI probe found that the deceased were working as labourers and were picked up by the police officials. The accused had claimed that they were going in a jeep when the youths fired at them.The youths were killed in retaliatory firing in the nearby sugarcane field, the police personnel had claimed but the court did not accept their arguments.They were the only source of income for their families. They had gone to Pilkhuwa in search of a job and were killed while returning from there.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

In the soft glow of twilight, she tucks the pallu of her cream silk sari round the waist, wraps a scarf over her head, and spreads out a mat westward towards Mecca. With her arms on her chest, she bows her head in prayer to Allah, while the husband and two children sleep in a little longer.A feet away, as the sun emerges, Seema Chaudhari (43) grabs a plastic tumbler before the morning puja. As she heads out, Begum catches up with her. Friends for 14 years, the two women groggily make their way to the river, grumbling about the din from last nights neighbourhood wedding.Begum and Chaudhari live in the main market in the contested arena of the Babri Masjid-Ram Janmabhoomi site, where the destruction of a 16th-century mosque in 1992 sparked some of Indias worst nationwide riots. Considered to be one of Hinduisms seven holy centres, the region is now peppered with temples flooded by Hindu devotees. As the legal dispute, which began in 1950, enters its 24th year in the Supreme Court, the saffron-tinted market of 100-odd shops and adjoining homesselling scarves, prayer beads, toy maces and other religious paraphernaliamake do without regular electricity (since the area is contested), stealing it from outside the market area and using public toilets meant for pilgrims.The saffron-tinted market at Ayodhya has 100-odd shops selling scarves, prayer beads, toy maces and other religious paraphernalia.The availability of electricity, jobs and clean water are top voter concerns in one of Indias most backward states, according to a FourthLion-IndiaSpend survey, reported here in February 2017. However, as violence has grown over this decade, the strife has retarded development and citizens appear to find it harder to shrug off mounting tensions between communities, bringing identity politics to the heart of the battle for UP.As Begum and Chaudhari talked, there was no apparent sign of tension. Cups of chai (tea) surfaced during the lean afternoon hours of the market, as the two friends sat together at one or the others shop, children in tow, sharing food, recipes and more.When you live together for so many years, youre bound to become friends, said Begum, one of the few Muslims in this epicentre of Hindu religiosity. We share everythinghave dinner together, shop together, attend each others family weddings. The violence is a distant memory.Her family fled after riots in 1993, but with nowhere to restart life, returned after a month. When we did (return), said Begum, nobody troubled us.Mask drops from friendship and politics, as UPs schisms are revealedBegum and Chaudhari are indeed friends, but when talk turned to politics and religion, schisms soon emerged, illustrating how religious differences are the foundation of life and politics across Indias most populous state. With its 200 million people, 19% Muslim and 80% Hindu, these differences are exacerbated in the seven-phase, 26-day electionvoting for which ends on March 8, 2017as Prime Minister Narendra Modi embellished his development mantras with sectarian rhetoric.This is a Hindu-dominated area; thats why it is so peaceful now, said Chaudhari, who moved to the market in 2003. Begum dismissed her friends assessment. Muslim areas are also peaceful, she said.Chaudhari insisted the neighbourhood will vote exclusively for the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), as the ruling national party aggressively champions the Hindutva cause this election season with none of its 370 candidates a Muslim. Quiet thus far, Begum admitted allegiance to the Samajwadi Party (SP), UPs ruling party, known to woo Muslims and Other Backward Classes (OBCs).Friendships between Hindus and Muslims are not uncommon in UP, but they appear to be rarer than ever in western UP, still recovering from 2013 riots between Jatsa Hindu upper casteand Muslims in Muzaffarnagar, UPs sugar bowl, which witnessed its most violent Hindu-Muslim clashes since the Babri Masjid was brought down more than 24 years ago.We all live together now, said 35-year-old Zainab (she uses only one name), of Kawal, a Muslim-dominated Muzaffarnagar village. On August 27, 2013, two young Jats killed a Muslim from this village for allegedly harassing their sister. Muslims later beat the boys to death, sparking off a wildfire of violence in the region; more than 50,000 Muslims fled their homes and thousands still live in refugee camps.Zainabs assertion notwithstanding, the tension is apparent as we travelled between Kawal and Malikpura, a Jat-dominated village located a few kilometres ahead. On the day IndiaSpend visited, a 15-year-old boy had just been reported missing. We realised he is missing late last night when he failed to return from school all day, said Parmila Singh (40), the boys mother. A constable at her house said colleagues were scouring the countryside. This isnt the first time he has gone missing, the police officer said, which did not mean the search for him could be delayed, given UPs record of conflagrations from sparksor rumours.The newly laid detour that separates the Muslim-dominated village of Kawal (left) and the Hindu Jat-dominated village of Malikpura in Muzaffarnagar.As we moved out of Malikpura, using a newly laid detour that villagers said the BJP had constructed for them to reduce interactions and tensions with Muslims in Kawal, we came across one of 50 paramilitary companies (with 140-150 troopers in each company) stationed in Muzaffarnagar district ahead of the elections.At a time when UPs biggest concerns centre around education, jobs and healthcarewith the states indicators being among Indias worst (as we reported here, here and here)the latest data of communal violence explain why UPs politics continues to be driven by religion, caste and identity.As communal violence soars, BJP has its finger on states pulseBetween 2010 and 2015, communal violence in Muzaffarnagar rose five-fold, according to data sourced from the office of the director general of police for Uttar Pradesh, by 101reporters.com for IndiaSpend, reflecting a trend of tension evident across 90% of the state. Meerut reported over 200 incidents in 2015.The BJPs changing election narrative, from development to identity, has been evident in the speeches of Modi, BJP party president Amit Shah (here and here) and numerous other candidates who frequently talk of love jihadthe proposition that young Muslim men try to lure Hindu women into marriage and convert them to Islamterrorism and slaughterhouses, shorthand for Muslims.Meanwhile, the ruling SP, its ally, the Congress party, and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), play on the apprehensions of minorities and poorer Hindu castes.In 2010, UP registered nearly 600 crimes of communal violence across its 75 districts. By 2015, the state crime records bureau logged 3,601 such violent incidents. These data, however, do not find a place in the annual National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) statistics, which are compiled from state reports.Until 2014, the NCRB did not categorise riots as communal or otherwise (industrial, agrarian or caste related, for instance). In 2014, when it first had the heading communal riots, for UP, it listed 51 riots. In comparison, state data for 2014 counted 2802 communal violence incidents.UP officials also told IndiaSpend that many communal incidents were minorand mostly started over the assumed need to protect their womens honour.These things are more likely to happen because political parties with vested interests like to appease different communities, Amitabh Thakur, Inspector General for Rules and Manuals told IndiaSpend. In some parts of Western UP, even a small knock on the cycle can end in a fight between four or five persons.Minor incidents make neighbourhoods, districts and state tenseThe scale of these minor incidents and their petty triggers, which the state police record but do not pass on to the NCRB, reflect the tensions that run through UP.When a small incident occurs, we immediately send our forces in and douse the situation before it is given any chance to explode further, said deputy superintendent SKS Pratap at Jansath police station in Muzaffarnagar, less than 10 km from Kawal. We dont give netas a chance to exploit it for mileage. His confidence in curbing small incidents before they escalate into riots was echoed at other police stations IndiaSpend visited across western and eastern UP.The trivial start-stop nature of these incidents belies the significant bearing they tend to have on the psychology of the neighbourhood, district, and state at large.Over five years, except for eight of 75 districts, communal violence increased across UP.While Meerut district in western UP, with 234 cases, reported the most incidents, about 130 km to the east, Sambhal district reported the highest rate of increase in violence in five years.From registering just one incident in 2010, Sambhal district reported 192 cases of communal violence in 2015. Of the 20 districts reporting the largest increase in violence, 14 were located in western UP, according to our analysis. This rise in violence is apparent in villages, towns and cities.How polarisation fuels politicsand vice versaWe witnessed how the ferment, caused by the steady escalation in communal violence in the run-up to the assembly elections, was not restricted to the nationally known flashpoints of Muzaffarnagar or Ayodhya. From west to east, beneath the thrum of urban life and rural calm, the distrust between Hindu and Muslims is evidentin Ghaziabad, Gautambuddha Nagar, Shamli, Gorakhpur, Varanasi and Lucknow.In Varanasi, eastern UP, under a blanket of pollution (among Indias worst, as we reported in December 2016) smothering the sacred Hindu city, Bablu Singh (42), a restaurant-owner and member of the upper-caste Thakur clan, zeroed quickly into what he regarded as the fundamental issue between Hindus and Muslims: Gaay hamaari maata hain, aur woh log gaay khaate haintho kaise chalega? (The cow is our mother and they eat cowhow can that work?)Prayers being offered at Assi Ghat, on the banks of the river Ganga in Varanasi, Uttar Pradesh. From zero incidents of communal violence in 2010, Varanasi was witness to 31 incidents in 2015.The trivial start-stop nature of these incidents belies the significant bearing they tend to have on the psychology of the neighbourhood, district, and state at large.Over five years, except for eight of 75 districts, communal violence increased across UP.While Meerut district in western UP, with 234 cases, reported the most incidents, about 130 km to the east, Sambhal district reported the highest rate of increase in violence in five years.From registering just one incident in 2010, Sambhal district reported 192 cases of communal violence in 2015.

More than 50,000 Muslims fled their homes in the aftermath of the 2013 riots and thousands still live in refugee camps.Next to him, 67-year-old Bopal Singh Balyan slowly added: They left out of greedthe Akhilesh (Yadav, the states chief minister) government was handing out big compensation packages for people who claim to be riot-victims. Why would they want to return?In Bishada villagewhere in 2015 ironsmith Mohammad Akhlaq was lynched to death for allegedly eating beef, which is banned in UP, except for foreignersthe surface calm was quickly dispelled by a 25-year-old man, who did not want to be identified.Everybody loves Muslim victims: One dies, 100 people come flocking, he said. If a Hindu diesin police custody, that too nobody gives a damn.The BJP does not allay Muslim fears, upper-caste Hindus are comfortedBisada is a stronghold of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the BJPs ideological mentor, a right-wing Hindu nationalist organisation banned three times in post-colonial Indiathe first time in 1948 after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi.In the aftermath of the lynching, villagers said, only the national ruling party stood by them. Prior to the start of polling in February 2017, union home minister Rajnath Singh even held a rally here. This village always votes for BJPwere the only ones saving Hindustan and we will keep saving it over and over again, the young man said, animatedly.Bisada village in Dadri, Gautambuddha Nagar district, western Uttar Pradesh, where ironsmith Mohammad Ikhlaq was lynched to death in 2015 for allegedly eating beef.A deep resentment lurks here among unemployed youth. Septuagenarian Munnidevi said: After the (lynching) episode, whenever employers hear the applicant is from Bisada, they dont hire them. If the government cared for us, our children would not loiter here jobless and angry.In Lucknow, driver Nitin Patel (25), a Hindu moderate and BJP supporter from Sultanpur district, explained the psychology of upper-caste Hindus. The SP is mainly for the Muslims and OBCs (other backward castes), former chief minister Mayawatis BSP works for Dalits and OBCs, said Patel. Only the BJP listens to us, so what are we to do?The BJP has done little to calm Muslim fears.Not a single BJP candidate has come to this area, said Asif Saifi (23), an unemployed man, in Kaila Bhatta, Ghaziabad, a tinderbox of a town, known to explode whenever communal violence is reported elsewhere in UP. If they cared for our vote, they would have at least given one ticket to a Muslim. The lack of a Muslim candidate was an issue even the BJPs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, a Muslim from UP, referred to:It would have been better if BJP gave tickets to #Muslims for ongoing #UPpolls, says Union Minister @naqvimukhtar.  Press Trust of India (@PTI_News) February 27, 2017In the resettlement colonies of riot victims in Kandhla, 56 km west of Muzaffarnagar, home to over 300 rehabilitated Muslim families, there was unanimity in support for the SP. No other party has bothered to come here and help us in our plight, said 40-year-old Imrana (she uses only one name), a homemaker.Ateek Ansari, a local reporter in Varanasi, believed speeches by the Prime Minister and his colleagues on love jihad, cow-protection and Muslim personal law have further scared Muslims. We feel if we let them win the elections, there will be riots that threaten our very existence, he said. Its convinced Muslims across UP to think that come what may, we need to stop Modi.To do so, Ansari said, Muslims must fall back on negative voting, supporting the strongest contender who could defeat the BJP. While many consider the SP-Congress an obvious choice, this approach is also likely to split the BSP vote.Meanwhile, there are a few Muslims, such as Naru Ansari (32), a construction-site manager from eastern UPs Gorakhpurthe constituency of BJP MP Yogi Adityanath, head priest of a temple, he echoes a Hindu far-right and, often, openly anti-Muslim agendawho feel safe voting for the national ruling party. Yogi Adityanath has been an MP here since 1998, said Naru Ansari. He protects us. If politicians arent controversial, how will they stay relevant?Back at the Ram Janmabhoomi market in Ayodhya, sitting between puja wares of copper, silver and gold, shopkeeper Sarvankumar Pandey (55) twirled his fingers, as if spinning a ball of fruit. Have you ever seen an orange? he asked. Covered in a thick orange skin, it appears as one whole fruit, said Pandey. But peel off the leathery rind, and the segments come apart with ease.

Have you ever seen an orange? he asked. Covered in a thick orange skin, it appears as one whole fruit, said Pandey. But peel off the leathery rind, and the segments come apart with ease. This is exactly how Hindus and Muslims are in UP, he said.Shia Muslims Archan Haider, Afzal Haider and Naushad Ali in Hussainabad, Old Lucknow, espoused their unequivocal support for the Bharatiya Janata Party.Younger Shias in Hussainabad said they would vote for the BSP. Students Rahil (19) and Sharif (20) Mirza said they could not forget the terror inflicted on our people under Modis watch in Gujarat in 2002, more relevant to them than riots closer home.Shias are 10-13% of the world Muslim population, according to this 2009 Pew Research Institute report, and India is said to have the worlds second-largest Shia population after Iran.There are also sub-sect divides to consider, such as those between Barelvis, Deobandis, and Salafis, interwoven with caste differencesa remnant of the Hindu past, prior to conversion centuries ago.Aligarh city alone has 24 Muslim caste associations, according to historians Christopher Jaffrelot and Laurent Gayers 2012 book, Muslims in Indian Cities: Trajectories of Marginalisation. These differences play a significant role during elections, they wrote.This Shia-Sunni divide was clearest during the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots: Shias said they fought alongside Hindus against the Sunnis.In a Muslim ambush of Jats riding in on tractors, armed with sticks and scythes, Shias helped Hindus escape. We saw that if we did not intervene, the Hindus would die, Shah Alam Zaidi (50), a medical practitioner without qualificationsor quacktold IndiaSpend over telephone from the village of Jauli in east Muzaffarnagar. We hid them in our houses till the violence died down. He added that thereafterfor the first time in over 200 yearswith the support of Jats, Shias could hold a Muharram procession in the village.However, the Shias of western UP arent likely to vote for the BJP this season. Their reasons reflect the disillusionment evident among upper-caste Hindus, the BJPs traditional vote bank.Modis demonetisation policy, colloquially referred to as notebandi, pulled out of circulation 86% of Indias bank notes, on November 8, 2016, and its effects are still widespread. In this largely rural region bordering the national capital, western UPs farmers are angry. As they wait for the BJP to deliver on the promise of reservations for Jats and Gujjars, the Rashtriya Lok Dal has emerged as a favoured alternative.We have always supported the BJP, said farmer Rajeev Kashyap (45) of the Kashyap clan in Kutba, Muzaffarnagar, breaking from the Balyans, who have stayed loyal to the BJP. But where is the development we were promised?UP wants development but strife keeps it backwardUP is one of Indias least-developed states, with indicators worse than the national average and, often, among the countrys lowest, as IndiaSpend has reported (here and here). Since the 1990s, the gap between UP and other states has widened, as post-liberalisation economic reforms reduced the countrys capacity to spread investment across India, wrote Craig Jeffery in his 2014 book, Development Failure and Identity Politics in Uttar Pradesh. Corporations looking to invest in India tended to set up in states with good records in terms of crime and corruption, wrote Jeffrey. There has been some improvement since the 2000s, but this has mainly been in UP districts that are close to or form a part of the national capital territory of Delhi, Indias richest region, by per capita income.In this scenario of low-development, Muslims are further marginalised, observed both Gayer and Jaffrelot. However, with the 2011 census withholding religious data on development indicators, it is difficult to accurately ascertain the level of inequal development.The strife in UP has not helped. In countries with violence, economic growth falls, as does access to electricity and the Internet, and the school dropout rate rises, noted this 2017 World Bank report on governance and security.These trends are evident in UP, and they were particularly clear when we visited refugee camps in Shamli district, western UP. Girls were married early, and women were forced to stay at home for security.In the refugee camps, 42 months for a ration card that should take 30 daysWhile some colonies have received enough compensation from the state to start anew, they could not find employment. Our men dont get work as often as we used to in our old villagepeople here dont know us so they dont easily employ us, said 32-year-old homemaker Buriya (she uses one name) in the riot-victim colony of Hamza, at Kandhla in Shamli district.Land prices rose after riot victims received compensation money, and only 1,200 families among many thousand have received ration cards over 42 months, a process that should take less than 30 days.Thirty two-year-old homemaker Buriya, in the riot-victim colony of Hamza, at Kandhla in Shamli district, said it is harder for the displaced Muslims to find work in the resettled areas.Officials seem to forget these people have fled their villages, said Akram Akhtar of AFKAR India Foundation, a nonprofit helping Muslim riot-victims. He accused the Hindu-dominated administration of insensitivity. They stubbornly refuse to cooperate using statements like How do we know youre not actually from Pakistan?Despite these problems, victims arent willing to return to their native villages.We sometimes meet our old Hindu neighbours on the road, said Abdul Sattar, who fled Kutba village in Muzaffarnagar after his brother and nephew were killed. They speak to us nicely and even ask us to come back saying everything is peaceful now, but we wontshaking hands cant guarantee they wont stab us in the back again.So, the refugee camps continue without electricity, water supply, and education. We dont have the himmat (courage) to send our children to school, said Mohammed Ayub Sheikh, whose family fled from the village of Lisarh after the 2013 riots. Were barely surviving day-to-day.Back in the market of Ayodhya, shopkeeper Pandey said it was unlikely the area would erupt into another riot, irrespective of the outcome on the temple-mosque legal dispute. Bhagwan ke naam pe roti chalti hain (In the name of God, we are earning), he said, confident that residents would not dare let tensions get out of handeven if outsiders tried to ruffle feathers.We dont think that way anymorewe cant afford to, said Pandey. The last time we suffered so badly, we caught our ears and said, never again.(Saldanha is an assistant editor with IndiaSpend.

Endless cups of colas, Chinese fried rice, some chowmein and lot of sweetened tea follow, a theme that runs counter to 11 shut sugar mills of the neighbouring constituencies of Padrauna, Ramkola and Khadda.""BSP loves all religions and there can't be a better way to start or end a day with a tea at a spiritual place like this. The district and its seats have suffered a lot due to no development work despite it being a tourist site. Besides the farmers have suffered a lot due to lack of buyers for their sugar over the years after mills shut down,"" says BSP candidate Bunty Rao, ensconced on a chair with his supporters at the cafe.""It's the BJP government that has brought the airport here and PM will soon visit the temples here. Each Buddhist here is significant part of our state,"" says BJP's Rajni Kant Mani Tripathi.4,200 Buddhists in the neighbourhood villages of Sukharisapra, Dumari, Buddhnagri and Kasiya are a tiny yet crucial votebank. What heightens their significance is the fact that even Hindus approach them and other monks to oversee their auspicious ceremonies, shop inaugurations, or celebrate child births.The grievances for farmers, Buddhists and Hindus, are separate. While Hindus here want timely payment for their sugarcane yields and promote bank transfers that have only halted since demonetisation, the Buddhist want connectivity for the tourist from across the globe.""We respect all partymen and invite them for our functions and take part in their ceremonies. From President APJ Abdul Kalam to Sri Lankan President to Thai King everyone has visited here, yet we don't have an airport, rail connectivity or bus here,"" says Bhadant Gyaneshwar, Buddhist head priest of all temples, who migrated from Bhutan in 1950s to this place.""An acre of land only earns us a measly Rs 35,000 a year from sugarcane yield which too depends on variety and the mill purchase. The shutting of mills has forced us to compete on wheat and paddy produce,"" says Tajender SinghThough most of of the villagers are Dalit converts and swear by the BSP, it was chief minister Akhilesh Yadav, who, in August last year, gave 195 acres land to Maitreya Project Trust on a lease of Re 1 for hospitals, colleges, and rest homes for the Buddhists here."

The flame of communal tension, which began in Bulandshahr, has now reached Lakhimpur Kheri in Terai.There was a flare-up in Kehri after an objectionable video featuring gods and goddesses went viral on Thursday. Two persons were injured in skirmishes that followed and two main accused were held by the police. Lakhimpur Kheri is still under the curfew with a relaxation of three hours.Western UP has always been considered as a communally sensitive region, especially after the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013 and Dadri mob lynching in 2015.The manner in which a series of minor incidents took communal overtones in a recent couple of days is an indication that all is not well in the States sugar bowl.Since February 25, just before the fifth phase of polling, even small scuffles and altercations have brought the two communities face-to-face a number of times.The emergent post-poll scenario in the west, which remained relatively silent when the region went to vote, is sending not-so-good signals and is keeping the administration on its toes.Very much on the lines of Lakhimpur Kheri, a video showing a man using objectionable language against gods and goddesses also emerged in Bulandshahr.The clip went viral and triggered clashes in which three people were injured. The atmosphere in Muzaffarnagar was so charged with a communal passion that a minor altercation between a Dalit and a Muslim youth spiralled into an ugly scenario, with members from both communities indulging in stone pelting.Top cops in the State are seeing a design to the flare-ups and suspect a conspiracy. There were a couple of incidents when pieces of meat, probably of a bovine, were found outside a temple and at a farm, leading to tension, said a senior IPS officer, suspecting a conspiracy."

Overall the mill owners have managed to pay about 78% of the total money they owe to the farmers.In total, over 116 mills bought sugarcane worth Rs. 19,076 crore in the year 2016-17 but till February 2 they could pay back to the farmers only Rs. 13,091 crore.Cash crop on West U.P.More than 55 lakh farmers spread across forty districts of western Uttar Pradesh grow sugarcane which is the cash crop of the region.The grim situation of payment to farmers exists even as the turnover of U.P. sugar industry this yearis all set to top the country.The Indian Sugarcane Manufacturers Association, an all India body representing sugar mills from all sugar producing States, has set the target of 85 lakh tonne of sugar production in U.P., which is 40% of the total target of the country.Due to a variety of reasons, including lowering water level and drought-like situation, sugar production target in Maharashtra has gone down from 84.24 lakh tonne in 2015-16 to 46 lakh tonne, which is a little over half of last year production in the State.Bajaj group which owns 15 mills owe over Rs. 2000 crore to the farmers, while Modi group owes about Rs. 300 crores.Deepak Guptara of U.P. Sugarmill Owner's Association told The Hindu that the mills have paid over 78% of the total dues to the cane growers.The figure of Rs. 5,975 is the money which sugar mills owe to the farmers and would be the dues after 14 days but the actual dues stands at only Rs. 3,666 crore. We have already paid about 78% of the total dues and we are looking forward to pay back to the cane growers as soon as possible, Mr. Guptara said."
58f501e97be9e018510a1711,'Potato factory' keeps farmers in business,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170305/jsp/bengal/story_139079.jsp,2017-03-05,"Farmers cultivate process grade potato for PepsiCo in Anandapur village in Hooghly Anandapur (Arambagh), Mar. 4: Had Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi fought the farm-versus-factory debate over aloo (potato) in Anandapur village of Bengal, chances are that the Congress vice-president would have won by more than a wafer-thin margin. For the hundred-odd farmers working for US multinational PepsiCo, growing the right variety of potato is probably the most crucial step in a long process that culminates in factories churning out munchies. During an election rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh earlier this week, Prime Minister Modi had taken a dig at Rahul, who had in the past echoed farmers' demand to set up a potato factory for them. ""You are demanding a factory of aloo... but I am an Opposition leader. I can't take decisions. I can't put up an aloo factory,"" Rahul had said during his kisan yatra last year. Without naming Rahul, Modi said at a rally this week that potato grows in fields, not in a factory. ""You tell me whether aloo grows in the factory or field. You know but he does not know,"" the Prime Minister had said. But Rahul probably meant potato processing, which Pepsi is doing in Bengal. Bengal produces 112 lakh tonne of table grade potato compared with under 1 lakh tonne of process grade Growing the special process grade potato has saved at least 10,000 farmers this year from a price crash that the regular jyoti variety suffered because of a bumper crop. Compared to Rs 400 a sack (50kg each) for process potato that Pepsi is offering farmers at Anandapur in Hooghly, jyoti is selling at Rs 150 a sack from the field. That is because Pepsi had agreed on the price before the sowing season started in October. Last year, the jyoti variety had fetched a better price than the process variety. But Asim Choudhury, a farmer in Anandapur, stuck to the corporate because of his experience the year before. In 2015, he had decided to give Pepsi a break and gone back to growing the traditional variety. He lost Rs 18,000 a bigha. ""That taught me a lesson. I did not switch this year to jyoti even though there was a higher return in 2016. I have been proven right,"" Choudhury, who owns an acre, said. PepsiCo's chip factories need a potato with low sugar and high percentage of dry matter. The farmer is hoping to make a profit around Rs 18,000 a bigha on the crop he is harvesting now using a power tiller fitted with an attachment specially designed for potatoes. He has rented the machine, as he did in October last year to prepare the field and sow the seeds. The mechanical intervention, which almost turned the farm to factory, saved him at least Rs 2,500 a bigha. Chandicharan Mandal, a local handler or aggregator who has an agreement with Pepsi for cultivation of the process grade potato, had arranged the power tiller on rent with the company's help. According to Jaideep Bhatia, agri-director of Pepsi India, there are 117 such aggregators in Bengal who in turn work with farmers. Machines such as these can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. ""The state laws do not allow direct agreement with farmers like we do in Maharashtra. Even though a direct tie-up would have been more transparent, we are not complaining. We are working with the aggregators,"" Bhatia said. Mandal said he was looking after 150 acres in the area, about 90km from Calcutta. He gets the seeds from Pepsi, arranges pesticides and fertilisers, and then gets power tillers on rent as most small farmers cannot afford to buy them. ""Working for Pepsi has proved remunerative if somebody sticks to the company for 3-4 years. Now with the big power tillers, we are trying to move towards more mechanisation. It is almost like a factory,"" Mandal said, holding a pack of potato chips sold under the Lays brand by PepsiCo in India. His only grouse? ""We want more machines. Only a fraction of land can be harvested with this one. Please tell the company to get it next year. Everyone is asking for it,"" Mandal said, pointing to the tractor which can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. The correspondent's trip to Anandapur was sponsored by PepsiCo"

The Opposition party also alleged that he was taking anti-people decisions through the backdoor only to benefit private individuals and dubbed his government as Government of India Private Limited. He also said that the bias against the poor and the middle class is evident in the policies of this government which is privatising health, education and stopping HIV medicines for chidren in a conspiracy against the country. Amit Shah ji has told all the party MPs of Uttar Pradesh that if they get less than 2-3 seats, they will be held accountable and action will be taken against them.Watch What Else Is Making NewsSo, I believe the prime minister has also been told the same thing and he is responding to Amit Shah jis threat. He is also scared that he may not win those 2-3 seats from his own constituency, party spokesperson Ajoy Kumar told reporters when asked if there was a leadership deficit in the BJP as Modi was camping in Varanasi for days together.Modi ji is scared of Amit Shahs statement and is trying to save his pride by camping there, he said. He cited four recent announcements to accuse Modi of backstabbing and betrayal of countrys common people as such decisions are taken through backdoor in the din of electioneering.In this election season, where people are watching his blitz Modi ji is taking anti-people decisions through back door!. Modi jis new slogan is cashless cashless japna, janta ka paisa apna, he said. Hitting out at Modi over State Bank of Indias decision to impose penalties for non-maintenance of minimum balance in savings bank accounts, Kumar said, Modi ji has backstabbed the poor people of this country by levying charges on not maintaining minimum balance in bank accounts.He also said this is not the first time that the Modi government forced the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA) to increase third party motor insurance premiums. Pointing out the waiving Rs 1200 crore worth of loans to Vijay Mallya, who is absconding, he said on the one hand Modi is spreading the red carpet for the likes of Mallya and on the other, banks are levying transaction charges.He said the IRDA, which is a regulatory authority for insurance, has increased motor premium of third party insurance of vehicles from 40 per cent to 101 in two years.Kumar also cited the steepest hike in LPG rates and doing away of Rs 4,500 crore subsidy on sugar provided to the poor through PDS network as the two other anti-people decisions taken in the recent past in the din of electioneering. The Congress leader claimed that the Modi government has become synonymous with hoodwinking, jumlabaazi, backstabbing, deception, betrayal, treachery, duplicity and falsehood. The country continues to be befooled by issues of pseudo nationalism.

Adding milk to the boiling syrup, they deftly remove the rising scum to keep the liquid clean. Once the desired consistency is attained the hot mixture is poured into moulds and a cotton thread is placed over it, with portions of the thread dipped in syrup. The mixture cools down within minutes and sugar strings are removed and moulds are readied for another lot. The duo hails from Etawah district of Uttar Pradesh and make this trip to the city every year a fortnight before Shivratri.In the local lingo these strings are called gathi and they make an appearance in the market around Holi. ""We make one and a half quintals of these strings every day for which four quintals of sugar is used,"" says Mohd Imran. These strings sell for Rs65 per kg. ""We don't get local workers to prepare them though gathis are used in Shivratri puja, then again they are offered in the Holi fire lit on the eve of the festival and is in demand on Gudi Padwa day also,"" says Pintu Sahu, a wholesaler who calls Imran and his uncle every year to prepare gathi.Shops in the Rewadi Bazaar area of Itwari are loaded with these sugar strings as they are bought in bulk for sales across the city and even in the neighbouring areas up to Madhya Pradesh. ""The sales in the city have been dipping every year but we get buyers from rural areas like Pandurna and other small villages,"" Sahu informs.The gathi strings are presented to elders, newly-weds and young children on Holi to make them feel special. It is more of a social gesture than religious. With a political culture gradually evolving in the region now gathis are painted with edible colours and also decorated with plastic flowers and even mirrors. ""This is a part of the social milieu of this region,"" says Sanjay Gupta the owner of Jaganath stores in Itwari. ""But this has a certain medicinal value too as it prevents heat strokes,"" Gupta says and adds that though the strings can be used for consumption but they cannot be a substitute for sugar as they taste different."
58f507ab7be9e018510a1d78,Stepmom brings up Akhilesh 'promise',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170308/jsp/nation/story_139606.jsp,2017-03-08,"Sadhana Gupta Lucknow, March 7: Akhilesh Yadav has promised his father Mulayam Singh Yadav he would return ""everything"" to him in three months, the Uttar Pradesh chief minister's stepmother Sadhana Gupta has said, opening up on the feud within the ruling family ahead of the final round of polling. ""Let us see what he does. But Netaji is Netaji. He will remain a leader even if he (Akhilesh) doesn't return everything,"" she was quoted as saying to a section of the media in Etawah, Mulayam's home district, yesterday. The comments came two months after Akhilesh had taken over the reins of the Samajwadi Party, replacing his father as its chief at a party convention on January 1. ""Akhilesh ne kaha hai teen mahine mein sab kuchh lauta dega (Akhilesh has promised he would return everything in three months),"" Sadhana was quoted as saying. It was the first time Sadhana had made such a categorical statement since Akhilesh prevailed in the family feud that broke out into the open late last year. Sadhana did not specify what she meant by ""everything"" but it's possible she was referring to the post of party national chief. Earlier, in September, Mulayam had removed Akhilesh as Samajwadi state chief and handed the post to his younger brother, Shivpal Yadav. The chief minister, in retaliation, had sacked Shivpal from his cabinet. He took Shivpal back after a few days and later sacked him again. On January 1, Akhilesh replaced his father as Samajwadi national president after a show of hands. Sadhana said whatever happened on January 1 was unfortunate. ""We didn't sleep for many days and couldn't understand what was happening. Thereafter, we left things to God and time,"" she said, adding that from now on she wouldn't work from behind the curtain. ""I will come forward and work without any post or salary. I want Akhilesh to win and become chief minister again,"" she said. Asked about the future of her son, Prateek Yadav, she said: ""He will observe things and decide.... But we will never tolerate (any) insult to Netaji. He founded the party and took it to its present position."" Shivpal, she added, shouldn't have been insulted. ""He has done a lot for Netaji and the party.... He deserves a position in the party."" Sadhana had met Mulayam for the first time in 1989 and the Samajwadi patriarch had, in an affidavit in the Supreme Court in 2007, accepted she was his wife. That was four years after the death of Akhilesh's mother, Malti Devi. Some party insiders believe Sadhana has been trying to establish her son and daughter-in-law Aparna in politics. Aparna is the party's candidate from Lucknow Cantonment in this election. Sadhana kept returning to the ""insult"" Mulayam had faced. ""Netaji shouldn't have been insulted,"" she repeated, ""otherwise, everything was fine. But he shouldn't have been insulted. Nobody should have done this. He (Mulayam) had faced tremendous hardship in building the party."" Sadhana said she wanted everybody (in the family) to be together. ""I wanted all of us to sit together at festivals and talk. The incident of January 1 would not have happened had they done this."" She denied any role in the family feud and said she wanted everything to be all right between father and son. ""He (Akhilesh) may be misguided. He cares for his father and me. He often tells me to avoid having sugar,"" she said. ""We don't know what happened,"" she added. ""Everything was fine. He danced at Prateek's wedding and took Aparna's friend to see the Taj Mahal. I had never imagined that such things would happen."" Prateek and Aparna had got married in December 2011."

The Jats, who had overwhelmingly voted for the BJP in 2014, were seen to be returning to Ajit Singhs RLD.By the time the long-drawn seven-phase elections came to an end, the narrative had changed.

The other reason for the hung house possibility is the fact that it went from a triangular to a multi-cornered contest. While the ruling Samajwadi Party tied up with the Congress, the BJP is in alliance with Apna Dal and Bharatiya Samaj Party, and only BSP contested alone.In the final analysis, the Samajwadi Party, which banked entirely on the performance record of the Akhilesh Yadav Government, may have been pulled back by its alliance with the Congress and the family feud. Even a section of elderly Yadav voters may not have taken kindly to Akhilesh's fracas with father Mulayam Singh, who was mostly missing from the campaign.While the bitter, high-decibel campaign for five assembly seats in Varanasi overshadowed all other constituencies, the Naxal-affected districts Sonbhadra, Mirzapur and Chandauli too went to vote on Wednesday. The anti-terror operation in Lucknow too is said to have polarised the voters, both in the Muslim-dominated seats and the others.When the counting happens on March 11, the UP voters thrown up an expected result with a clear mandate for a single party or combine."

(PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Singh challenging the waiver of interest amount which the mill owners were supposed to pay to the farmers for the years 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15.Sugar mill owners are supposed to pay interest on cane arrears to the farmers in case of delay in payment.The interest amount for 2012-13 and 2013-14 of over Rs. 1,300 crore was waived by the State government on May 22, 2015, by accepting the request of mill owners that they were not in a position to pay interest for delay in payment of cane price to the farmers as they incurred losses allegedly due to reduction in the price of sugar. The State government, through an order in Oct. 2016, further waived over Rs. 700 crore for interest payment."

What does it mean? Jayant Patil, NCP Leader of the House in Legislative Assembly. The state government says it is not against loan waiver but will take a decision (on that) at an appropriate time. What does it mean? Jayant Patil, NCP Leader of the House in Legislative Assembly.Maharashtras Former finance minister Jayant Patil is of the opinion that no chief minister or finance minister will ever give consent to a crop loan waiver when the governments coffers are running empty. Patil, who is currently the leader of the NCP in the Legislative Assembly, had held the states finance portfolio for three consecutive terms in the Congress-NCP coalition government since 1999.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDiscussing the politics, economics and arithmetic of crop loan waiver both at the Centre and in Maharashtra, while speaking to The Indian Express, Patil put across the challenges for any government having to deal with financial constraints. The conservative estimate of crop loan waiver would work out to Rs 25,000 cr to Rs 30,000 cr approximately. Now, no wise chief minister or finance minister will give permission for the crop loan waiver. The task has become more challenging for the present government that has miserably failed in fiscal prudence, thus reflecting poor financial management, said Patil.He added: The overall budget spending shows 47 per cent, which means there is an undeclared cut in force. The series of mega-projects being pursued by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis in multiple sectors, like infrastructure, also makes us wonder how they would mobilise the funds.Speaking about the socio-politics behind the Oppositions demand for a crop loan waiver during the ongoing budget session, Patil justified it. He said: Our decision is not politically driven. It is our concern to bring immediate relief to the farmers across rural Maharashtra. In the last three to four successive years, farmers suffered due to drought. Last year, we had a good monsoon. There was good crop production. However, farmers earnings were badly affected because of the demonetisation policy imposed from November 8, 2016.Patil added: Farmers were forced to sell their vegetables, fruits and crops at much lower prices. Except for cash crops like sugarcane, all other crops fetched lower prices causing revenue loss to farmers.Taking a strong objection to the governments argument that the loan waiver had helped district cooperative banks and not farmers in the past, he said: I am not asking money for banks. The government can always directly transfer the cash into farmers accounts.The NCP leader said: If Prime Minister Narendra Modi can promise loan waiver to farmers in Uttar Pradesh, what stops the government from taking the decision in Maharashtra? This is our basic question at a time they boast of a robust economy, which is not the case. Therefore, as I said in the beginning, unless any state has surplus money it would be a difficult task to waive the crop loans completely.Reminding of former Union agriculture minister Sharad Pawars 2008 decision after discussion with then prime minister Manmohan Singh on a crop loan waiver of Rs 71,000 crore for the entire country, Patil said, There were no immediate elections. But the UPA government still went ahead with the decision to bring relief to farmers.He added: Today, the state government says it is not against loan waiver but will take a decision (on that) at an appropriate time. What does it mean?Commenting on the Shiv Sena trying to take credit for the demand for crop loan waiver, Patil said: They are a confused party. On one hand they are enjoying power in the government, and on the other they are trying to show that they are an Opposition party.Taking a dig at the Sena, he said: Now, all Opposition parties had taken a decision to protest at the footsteps of Vidhan Bhawan on the crop loan waiver issue. But just to show that they are different, the Shiv Sena sat a few feet away at the footsteps of Chhatrapati Shivajis statue. A section was protesting against the government and the other half is participating in the government.

58fb634fa3d24b44f321f0b9,The art of building majorities,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-art-of-building-majorities/article17459215.ece,2017-03-14,"The State elections of 2017 clearly demonstrate that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has replaced the Congress as the principal national party in the country. It won massive victories in Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and emerged as a big player in Manipur. In Goa it remained the single largest party in terms of vote share despite a hugely unpopular outgoing Chief Minister. The only disappointment is Punjab where the party was routed with its senior partner Shiromani Akali Dal after ruling the State for 10 years.The spectacular performance of the BJP in U.P. should not detract from its formidable achievements in the recently concluded local elections, where it made huge strides in previously uncharted territory. In Odishas Zilla Parishad elections, the party expanded its footprint from 36 seats in 2012 to 306 in 2017, snatching second place away from the Congress to become a formidable contender to the long incumbent Biju Janata Dal. In Maharashtra, the BJP won eight of 10 municipal corporations with its total number of seats nearly equal to that of all other parties combined.Explaining the riseThe electoral success of the BJP raises an important question. Without being able to meet expectations built up in 2014, in the absence of a surging economy, and with the poor decision on demonetisation, how is the party achieving so much success? There is one obvious reason: Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains very popular while the Congress partys leadership no longer resonates with voters. However, leadership is not the only factor. The BJP is acquiring hegemonic status in the Indian polity owing largely to ideological consolidation and its creation of an unparalleled election machine.The BJPs ideology has more takers than before because the party frames the main issues for the elections. Its long-standing ideological association with nationalism renders nationalism an issue on which it has a huge advantage over all other parties. Parties that are able to successfully shape election campaigns around their own issues ultimately succeed in winning elections. By placing a large emphasis on nationalism, the party has cleverly tailored its ideological message to be able to capture the imagination of a larger section of the public. It has opened ideological battlefronts in many different spheres  from universities to movie theatres  and promoted conflicts across the board. It has also placed a large emphasis on other issues that it has traditionally been associated with, such as national security and terrorism, patriotism and more recently, corruption.For a very long time the Jan Sangh and then the BJP relied almost exclusively on the hard-line Hindu nationalists who reside with its ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). This is no longer the case. Hindu traditionalists, those who are drawn to a conservative Hindu way of life but are largely opposed to the hard-line Hindutva world view and its intolerance towards other religions, have now shifted their support from the Congress to the BJP. This allows the BJP to win elections without nominating a single Muslim, as it did recently in U.P.Forging multi-caste coalitionsThe party has also revamped its electoral strategy, one focussed on widening its appeal by stitching together multi-caste coalitions. As is widely known, the BJPs traditional social base is predominantly upper caste. To increase its support base, it has been building an electoral machine of its own at the local level in the form of caste-based coalitions. Fully aware that the party would not receive much support from the Muslims and perhaps even the Jatavs, the former traditionally associated with the Samajwadi Party (SP) and the latter with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), its leaders targeted the smaller groups that dont have adequate representation in any of the larger parties. For instance, the BJP tied up with parties like the Apna Dal and Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, giving it the support of a large section of the Kurmi and Rajbhar populations, respectively. It also increased its ticket allocations to non-Yadav OBCs and non-Jatav Dalits. Its campaign was led by a galaxy of local and national leaders, together covering an eclectic set of caste groups  almost a Congress-style coalition  but without the Muslims and some Dalit communities.The BJPs active use of state patronage has also played a big role in strengthening its national footing. In States where the party has come to power, and even at the national level, it has actively worked to break down the existing patronage machinery and replace it with one of its own. For instance, in Maharashtra, a State ruled by the Congress-Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) for more than a decade before the Devendra Fadnavis government assumed office, the BJP has been steadily dismantling the patronage structures put in place by its predecessors. Through ordinances and amendments, the government has managed to severely weaken the hold of NCP and Congress leaders on the powerful cooperative bodies in the State, including the cooperative sugar factories which have been under the tight grip of NCP leader Sharad Pawar for decades. The government not only created a provision whereby it could appoint independent members to the boards of these bodies, but also imposed restrictions on the existing board members, hailing largely from the Congress or NCP, from contesting elections to particular cooperative banks. At the national level, the Modi government removed scores of previous United Progressive Alliance-era political appointees, particularly those notorious for their role in creating the large NPA (non-performing assets) problem facing the public sector banks today, and replaced them with its own people.Risks of rapid expansionOn the electoral front, this has translated into the BJP aggressively co-opting individuals and units of other parties to strengthen its leadership. From Rita Bahuguna Joshi in U.P. to Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, the BJP has taken in many rival leaders into its fold before elections. This resembles the strategy followed by the Congress in the 1970s, at the peak of Indira Gandhis rule. While in the short term, this strategy is giving the party immense electoral success and helping it expand its footprint, just as it had done for the Congress back then, in the medium to long term it poses grave risks. Many politicians and smaller parties have joined the BJP bandwagon as it looks the most lucrative option electorally, and they may desert it at next chance. In addition, as the BJP continues to bring into its fold leaders and parties from outside its ideological umbrella, it risks diluting the content of its ideology over time. If uninhibited, this could also lead to tensions between the BJP and the RSS.The BJP has undoubtedly replaced the Congress as the dominant national party and the cornerstone of Indias political and electoral system. This development has squeezed the space for centre-left forces in Indias polity and has given popular legitimacy to the centre-right narrative on issues of nationalism, secularism and social justice. As Yogendra Yadav has rightly pointed out, the centre-left needs a new vocabulary on the issue of social justice as the BJP has managed to convince a large section of society that the lefts language on the issue reeks of biases based on caste and religion.However, in order for the BJP to remain the dominant national party for a sustained period of time, it too needs to introspect to ensure it isnt compromising long-term success for short-term rewards. Going forward, it should continue to widen its social base while ensuring it doesnt lose its ideological identity. Otherwise, it will only remain dominant as long as a Mr. Modi remains at the helm. As when individuals acquire larger salience over ideology and organisation in parties, it leads to their decline down the road. That is exactly what happened to the Congress.Pradeep Chhibber and Rahul Verma are with the University of California, Berkeley. Harsh Shah is an alumnus of the University of California, Berkeley"
5904723b7be9e04154df6e9d,Softening price of services will help keep CPI in check,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/softening-price-of-services-will-help-keep-cpi-in-check/,2017-03-15,"Consumers who heaved a sigh of relief as retail inflation fell during the last six months, from 6.1% in July 2016 to 3.2% in January 2017, have now reasons for concern. With wholesale price inflation touching a three year high in February the consumer price index (CPI) has moved up in tandem pushing up retail inflation from 3.2% in January 2017 to 3.7% in February.The low level of consumer inflation at the national level hides more than it reveals. Consumer price increases are running at much higher levels in many states. It is 7.1% in Jammu & Kashmir, 6.2% in Himachal and 6.1% in Delhi. At the lower end are states like Uttar Pradesh with 2.8%, Bihar with 2.6%, Assam with 1.3%, Odisha with 1.6% and Chhattisgarh with 0.6%.One reason for the pickup in consumer prices is the increase in food inflation which has gone up from 0.6% to 2% over just one month. However, it still remains lower than the overall increase in retail prices. Moreover there is wide disparity in the trends in food prices with some products registering a surge while others continue to fall.Food products which are trending high include sugar and confectionary (18.8%), fruits at 8.3%, prepared meals at 5.4% and cereals and products at 5.3%. Food prices, which continues to fall includes that for products like vegetables (8.3%) and pulses (9%). Surprisingly prices of pan, tobacco and intoxicants seem to be soaring high at 6.2% probably on account of taxes lumped on them in the recent central and state budgets.However, volatility in food prices is to be expected, given their dependence on monsoons and their short shelf lives. What is of more concern is the trends in prices of services which are becoming an increasingly import part of the households consumption basket. Here the signals are more benign. Housing prices, namely rent, has fallen below the 5% mark for the first time in many months.Similarly prices of household goods and services have fallen to 4.1%, the lowest in more than three years. Similar are the trends in health and recreation services, where inflation levels have slumped to around 4% both three year lows. Price increases in personal care and effects have also come down to 5.1%, the lowest in a year.Softening trends are also noticed in some products of mass consumption like clothing and footwear where price increases have slumped to the lowest level in many years. The only segments where increase in retail prices is a matter of concern are in fuel and light and transport and communications. In the case of fuel and light price increases have now gone up to 3.9%, the highest in the last 12 months. In the case of transport and communications also the 5.4% increase in February is the highest since August 2014.So with food prices, which account for more than half of the consumer price index, still benign and prices of services, which account for another quarter, softening there is no immediate cause for concern on the retail price front."
5929d0967be9e0138af8ee11,Post Poll: A sweetener for sugar,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/post-poll-a-sweetener-for-sugar-mill-sugarcane-farmer-uttar-pradesh-bjp-4570762/,2017-03-15,"The Upper Doab Sugar Mills factory at Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. Praveen Khanna The Upper Doab Sugar Mills factory at Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. Praveen KhannaThe same party ruling at the Centre, and now the state, has given a ray of hope to Uttar Pradeshs (UPs) 116 operational sugar mills as well as 25 lakh-odd cane growers, just emerging out of three consecutive bad seasons. With sugar prices improving  ex-factory realisations are currently around Rs 36.50 a kg, compared with the average Rs 31.74 and Rs 25.64 for the 2015-16 and 2014-15 seasons (October-September), respectively, and the lows of Rs 22.54 touched in July 2015  and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in power both in New Delhi and Lucknow, there is renewed optimism over the fortunes of a hitherto troubled industry.Whats more, UP this season will overtake Maharashtra as the countrys leading sugar producer. Its mills have produced 69.12 lakh tonnes (lt) as on March 14, and with crushing to continue beyond mid-April, output could cross 85 lt out of Indias likely 200 lt or so in the 2016-17 season. While 100 out of UPs 116 mills are still running, 148 out of the 150 factories in Maharashtra have already shut for lack of cane and production may dip below 42 lt, from 84.15 lt in 2015-16 and 105.14 lt in 2014-15.Theres no better time to reform UPs sugar sector than now, when things are looking good. The focus should be on cane pricing reform and ending the problem of payment arrears to farmers once and for all. This can happen by linking cane prices to sugar realisations, based on the C Rangarajan Committees report, said Ajit S Shriram, joint managing director of DCM Shriram Ltd, which has three mills in Hardoi and one at Lakhimpur Kheri district.The committee under the chairman of the Prime Ministers Economic Advisory Council in the previous United Progressive Alliance regime had recommended a value-sharing formula, wherein the cane price payable would be 75 per cent of the average ex-factory realisations on sugar. At Rs 3,650 per quintal, the cane price as per the Rangarajan formula works out to roughly Rs 274 per quintal, higher than the Centres fair and remunerative rate of Rs 254.2 per quintal taking UPs average sugar recovery from cane at 10.5 per cent. But it is below the UP governments state advised price (SAP) of Rs 305 for general and Rs 315 for early-maturing cane varieties.Ideally, sugar realisations should be Rs 4,000-plus to enable us pay the SAP. They must be allowed to go to those levels, as this is an industry, unlike fruits or vegetables, where farmers get a fair share of the consumer price. Also, if people can fork out Rs 52 per litre on 30 litres of milk per month, why cannot they pay the same rate for just 5 kg of sugar? Shriram pointed out. However, farmer leader and convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, V M Singh, opposed the Rangarajan formulas adoption. If millers want the sugar price to be a mark-up over cane cost, the same principle should apply to farmers as well. After all, we also incur costs on diesel, labour and other inputs. Shouldnt these be factored into our cane price, too? he asked. The Rangarajan formula can work in Maharashtra, where sugar recovery averaged 11.3-11.4 per cent and cane yields were also higher. Moreover, in Maharashtra, cane harvesting and transportation costs, which come to Rs 50-55 per quintal, are borne by the factories. In UP, the farmer pays for these, Singh added.Both Shriram and Singh were agreed on one thing, though: A BJP government both at the Centre and in UP offers a golden opportunity to resolve the endemic problem of cane arrears. In the ongoing 2016-17 season, UP mills have so far bought cane worth Rs 20,473.51 crore at the SAP. While Rs 18,264.20 crore of this was payable not later than 14 days after delivery, they have only paid Rs 14,345.12 crore. That translates into arrears of Rs 3,919.08 crore, over and above dues of Rs 255.22 crore and Rs 44.75 crore for the previous two seasons. Although some groups  DCM Shriram, Balrampur Chini, Triveni Engineering, Dhampur Sugar, Dalmia Bharat and Dwarikesh Sugar Industries  have no cane dues, this isnt the case with most others.Significantly, the BJP, in its 2017 UP election manifesto, has promised that its government will ensure farmers get full payment for their cane within 14 days of sale. This provision already exists in the UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act of 1953. If the promise signals an intent to implement the law, we welcome it, stated Singh. His organisation won a major victory when the Allahabad High Court, on March 9, set aside the last Samajwadi Party governments decision to waive the interest on delayed cane payments by UP sugar mills for the 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 seasons. While section 17(3) of the 1953 Act does give the state government the power to waive interest, the court, however, ruled that the relevant Cabinet decisions  in May 2015 and October 2016, involving a total amount of over Rs 2,000 crore  were totally lop sided/one way and taken with no application of mind. Interest on delayed payments, it held, was a substantive right and not a bounty to growers. That being so, the power of waiver could be exercised only in exceptional circumstances and not in a routine manner, as the UP government had seemingly done.The state government waived the interest, citing mills inability to pay in view of low sugar prices. But by that logic, shouldnt the interest being paid by farmers on loans from state-owned and cooperative banks also have been waived? In this case, farmers were basically supplying cane to mill at zero interest, even while borrowing at 10-15 per cent or more themselves, noted Singh. The BJP UP manifesto, incidentally, has also talked of waiving crop loans for all small and marginal farmers. According to Singh, the Allahabad High Court order will strengthen the new governments hand to effectively enforce the 1953 Act. If mills dont pay within the stipulated 14-day period, they will have to shell out interest. And that should be deterrent enough, he claimed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made several big promises and assured delivery, the people look up to him with renewed optimism. Their appetite whetted, the masses expect them to be delivered soon.Moreover, since the BJP is now in power both at the Centre and in the state, its government cannot make any excuses if it fails to live up to its development promise. Here is a list of challenges before the BJP before 2019 Lok Sabha elections:The first challenge for the new government in Uttar Pradesh will be to assure all sections of the society that it is not vindictive to any community or caste.BJP had run an acrimonious election campaign in which its leaders, including Modi, attacked political opponents for appeasement of some castes (Yadavs in case of SP and Jatavs in case of BSP) and the Muslims. The party is also associated with the demolition of the Babri mosque in Ayodhya that led to the dismissal of the Kalyan Singh government.The BJP dispensation in UP must ensure that while it shuns appeasement, there is no discrimination.Kalyan Singh is still remembered as a chief minister who was effective in ensuring law and order and controlling the crime rate. He had also posted honest cops and bureaucrats in key posts. The people would expect this from the new BJP government.Since Modi has also promoted talent in the bureaucracy, both as chief minister and as PM, expectations are high in UP. Land grabbing by mafias, security of women and other crimes are major concerns. Akhilesh Yadav woke up only after the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and tried to sell the Agra-Lucknow Expressway  the deadline was met in a jiffy  and the Lucknow metro Both the projects are still half-baked. The condition of state highways and roads in cities and towns of UP is worse than neighbouring states, including Bihar. This must be a priority area for the BJP.UP would arguably have the most number of closed sugar mills and most disenchanted sugarcane growers. The state still lags behind in industrialisation, with lack of adequate power being one of the reasons. UP is a laggard when it comes to industrialisation. This is also a reason for migration of youth to other states for employment.Modi had promised that the first decision of the BJP government in UP will be waiver of all farm debts and loans. With the BJP declaring that the welfare of the poor and rural folk are its topmost priorities and its outreach to the OBCs and Dalits, development of the hinterland cannot be ignored."

In the Assembly polls this time, the post-demonetisation Modi magic had sidelined developmental issues. Little progress has been made on schemes such as roads, agriculture and railways. With Adityanath at the helm in the state when the next Lok Sabha elections fall due in 2019, the BJP hopes the Hindutva factor will help it retain most of its 71 MPs, or even better the figure.After Gujarat, UP is the next laboratory for the RSS, which approves of Adityanath wholeheartedly. In the context of the changed demographics in Western UP, where the Muslim population has burgeoned, Yogi Adityanaths clout in the east along with the Hindutva counter-effect in neighbouring states such as Bihar will give the party a leg-up. As far as Yogi is concerned, being chief minister will enable him to put his fiefdom of Purvanchal on the development map by working closely with Delhi.amit bandreThe Modi-Adityanath combination as a single powerful image to capture UP in 2019 will benefit both parties. Adityanaths Hindutva agenda will obscure any development concerns and push forward the BJPs poll chariot from Gorakhpur through Ayodhya to Delhi.Its his chance to consolidate his grip on the backward Purvanchal region. Eastern UP has been languishing on the growth index though the Mahants charisma remains unaffected. When Modi visited the Yogi at his math late last year, he had cleared the setting up of a new AIIMS for Gorakhpur, a fertiliser project and many road projects.Numerous sugar factories of eastern UP had been lying idle for many years because of the focus on Western UP by Mayawati and Akhilesh.If Yogi revives the sugar belt, it will add to his lustre. Because Purvanchal is close to Nepal, there is no infrastructure to stop flooding. This is a challenge Adityanath has to meet.In 2019, the Opposition is envisaging a grand alliance against the BJP in the North, including UP. Adityanath is seen as the BJPs best bet to prevent the fragmentation of the Hindu vote in the manner the Modi magic had in UP this time.Besides, of the 312 MLAs in the BJP, 165 are either Brahmins or Thakurs. Yogi power has the mojo to keep all castes, including OBCs, in check. For this, he will have the help of OBC leader BP Maurya and Brahmin leader Dinesh Sharma-both deputy CMs."

She has been treating patients and performing surgeries for over 20 years till the voters decided that its time she donned a new role to serve the people  as the MLA of Modi Nagar in Ghaziabad.First-timer Dr Manju Shivach, who defeated two sitting MLAs in the 2017 UP assembly polls, became the first woman in 32 years to win an assembly seat in Ghaziabad district.The last woman to win from Ghaziabad was Congresss Vimla Singh who won the elections in 1985.Dr Shivach, a gynaecologist, was the only woman candidate to get a ticket from any major political party this elections. Although she was considered a non-entity by many, especially in the hinterlands of western Uttar Pradesh, she proved them wrong to claim the seat.Dr Shivach hails from a small non-political family from Dehradun. Her mother worked as school teacher and father as an accounts officer with UP Roadways.Her first political stint came in 2012 during the chairman election for Modi Nagar Nagar Palika seat which her husband, Dr Devendra Shivach, intended to contest but could not as the seat was reserved for women.Instead, she took up the challenge but lost. The couple had been classmates in medical college and decided to marry before settling in Modi Nagar from where her husband hails. They also set up a small hospital there in 1996.However, after the defeat in the nagar palika election, in 2013, she was entrusted to look after the womens wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party as its district president.There was no looking back since. Women joined me in large numbers and we joined every event, protest and agitation called by the party. It is hard for any woman to stand up in a male dominated region such as western UP. I remember carrying out publicity campaigns in the 2014 general elections for the party and drove through interior villages day and night. There were motorcades deployed by other parties to woo voters and they indulged in hectic campaigning. Still, it did not deter me, she said.During December and January, she stood in bus stops of Modi Nagar and urged people to join the BJP. Her ticket for the assembly seat was not confirmed till she came to the attention of party leaders.I remember that I had gone to partys regional office at Ghaziabad when the names of contesting candidates were being finalised. I was returning home and I had just reached Raj Chopla near my hospital and was on my phone. I lost the connectivity just then and could not figure out the names of the selected candidates and my heart was beating fast. When I reached Modi Nagar, people were celebrating outside my house and they told me that I will be contesting, she said.I could not believe it and I rushed back to the regional office for a confirmation. Since that day, I started preparations for the election. All my hospital work was taken over by my colleague Dr Shobhna Sengar. The networking part with leaders of dominant groups was taken over by my husband. These two people have been the driving force behind my success, Dr Shivach said.On March 11, the doctor was declared as winner from Modi Nagar seat after she trounced sitting BSP MLA from Murad Nagar Wahab Chaudhary and Rashtriya Lok Dals Sudesh Sharma, the sitting MLA from Modi Nagar seat. She was the only woman candidate among the nine who contested from the assembly seat.Her political duties aside, the doctor never misses her morning deadline to attend to patients who come from every section of society and far flung areas. Even after being elected the MLA, Dr Shivach is a regular at the hospital, attending to patients.She is a strict administrator and looks after the hospital personally. It is her personal touch with her patients that makes her respected and loved by all, Dr Sengar said.Her hobbies range from preparing Indian cuisines to reading literature and mythology. Even as she moves on to a bigger and challenging role, Dr Shivach says she will always be available to her patients and at the hospital.I had a lot of support wherever I worked. Even my patients supported me. Now, the time has come to take up a bigger challenge to serve people on a larger scale. I have a definite agenda to implement and take up issues of women security, sugarcane farmers and easing traffic related issues before the 2019 general elections. I will do all this at any cost, the new MLA said.Grill-session: Dr Manju Shivach, BJP MLA Modi NagarYou will be under pressure to perform before the 2019 general elections. What agenda will be your priority?My focus will be on reviving the industrial town of Modi Nagar, holding camps for the unemployed and seeing how they can be provided skills and jobs. Apart from this, I will also persuade all parents to compulsorily get their daughters admitted to schools. I will also try to bring Central schemes to my constituency.What other local issues you will take up?I will work to expedite payment of pending dues to sugarcane farmers who have been suffering for a long time. This is a major issue that has been delayed by local politics. I will also try to promote local craftsmen and revive the area as a textile hub. There will also be proper electrification in villages.It will also be on my agenda throughout to provide school and college-going girls better transport as they travel from far-flung areas. The party has already promised measures for safety and security of women and girls. Bypassing of traffic from Modi Nagar will also be a priority as the town in marred by heavy flow of vehicles.Several parties have held tampering with Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) responsible for their loss in the election. Your view?The EVMs are tried and tested and we have full faith in the Election Commission. Had there been any issue with the machines, there are several checks and balances to prevent malpractices. Also, the media would have raised the issue earlier. The Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) are trying to hide their loss behind EVMs. They cannot figure out why they lost, but it was more because of their caste-based and appeasement politics.Does your victory despite being a first-timer suggest dominance of polarisation this election?It is not about polarisation, but the works of PM Modi that have made people believe he will bring development. The people of UP were fed up with the rule of smaller parties who came to power one after the other. It was in fact a vote in support of PM Modi and his policies. People also supported demonetisation even though they had to stand in queues.I was confident of winning as I have been working on the ground for the past three years. People from all groups supported me. After my victory, a Muslim woman named Momina came to congratulate and gifted me a framed photograph of Lord Krishna.Representation of women has suffered as women MLAs have not been given due chance in the UP cabinet of late? What if you are given a chance as minister?Women have performed well and need due representation in the new cabinet. Representation of women will motivate other women to enter politics as well. They bring a more disciplined approach to politics. If I am given a chance, I will respect the partys choice and work honestly and with utmost transparency. Although I am new, I will learn this job as I learned to become a doctor with training."

The prices are now Rs. 37-Rs. 38 a kg.The Centre should not permit imports of sugar this year (October 2016-September 2017) as output may outstrip demand, said Palani G. Periasamy, president of South Indian Sugar Mills Association.The current season started with an opening stock of 7.7 million tonnes and the production this year is expected to be 20.3 million tonnes. The total sugar consumption will be about 24 million tonnes and the closing stock for the current season is estimated to be four million tonnes.Though production has been hit in south Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu because of drought, it is expected to be high in Uttar Pradesh this year.Mr. Periasamy said the domestic industry was reviving after three years of a sharp drop in prices, the demand has stabilised, and the current demand-supply position is expected to be comfortable.The industry is just recovering and we should not disturb it. Should there be a need for imports, it can be reviewed after a couple of months. But, we estimate there will not be a need for it. If we import, the market sentiment will push down the domestic prices and local mills will not be able to download the stocks, he said.Production in Uttar Pradesh this year was initially estimated to be 8.3 million tonnes. But it might go up to 9.5 million tonnes. This season we expect bumper production in Uttar Pradesh, Mr. Periasamy said.Usually, sugar produced in the south is supplied to the northern States too. But, this year, with production affected in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh, supply to north India might not be there.But, there will be no shortage, Mr. Periasamy said. Further, sowing is said to be good in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra. Hence, sugar arrivals will start early next season.The current season began with ex-gate prices hovering around Rs. 27 a kg and the prices now are Rs. 37-Rs. 38 a kg. Any price increase in the future will be moderate and even if it goes up, it will be less than the international prices, he said. The production cost was Rs. 36.50 a kg."

Though there is a scope for bettering the state balance sheet, its fiscal situation is not as bad as some states, the chamber said.The top priority of the new government should be to drastically improve the quality and quantity of power supply in the ensuing summer. Like several parts of the country, the challenge is not as much generation and availability of power but the financial health of the power utilities, mostly in the state ownership.The new government should immediately take recourse to the UDAY scheme of the Centre and bring the state utility to robust health so that the users in both rural and urban areas are given better power supply. As is provided in the new scheme of things, fresh investment should be made in separate supply channels to the farmers who, for welfare reasons, have to be given the electricity supply at the concessional rates and the financial load can be taken by the state government, rather than the individual power utility.""Being an agricultural state, Uttar Pradesh has a huge potential in diverse agro activities like live stock, milk production and processing, food processing . For instance, abundant supply of potatoes in districts like Kannauj and mango in areas like Maliabad, need a modern processing facilities which should be encouraged in the private sector by way of fiscal and other support. Likewise, lot more agro hubs and mandis should be built in the state,"" ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat said.As of now, the state produces about 360-400 lakh tonnes per annum and is the number one producer of milk in the country.The state has several large sized cities like Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, Allahabad, Noida, Agra, Meerut, Moradabad, Meerut which need to be modernized and upgraded in terms of infrastructure. While initiatives like metro rail have been taken, they must be enlarged and lot more investment be made in city infrastructure including sanitation, drinking water, urban waste management.""A drive down the state presents a bad picture of heaps of plastics not only in cities but also in villages, creating an environment hazards, including the ground water,"" the chamber said. Since the same BJP is now in power in Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh, a better coordination should be achieved between the two states to give a better deal to the Bundelkhand areas which have suffered for long due to water scarcity and general backwardness."
5b2e0c349855b7245313d129,This Doctor Is First Woman MLA from Ghaziabad in 32 Years,https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/this-doctor-is-first-woman-mla-from-ghaziabad-in-32-years/story-9spu0hbhswotmTZe9WLHZN.html,2017-03-20,"Service to others is nothing new for Dr Manju Shivach. She has been treating patients and performing surgeries for over 20 years till the voters decided that its time she donned a new role to serve the people  as the MLA of Modi Nagar in Ghaziabad.First-timer Dr Manju Shivach, who defeated two sitting MLAs in the 2017 UP assembly polls, became the first woman in 32 years to win an assembly seat in Ghaziabad district.The last woman to win from Ghaziabad was Congresss Vimla Singh who won the elections in 1985.Dr Shivach, a gynaecologist, was the only woman candidate to get a ticket from any major political party this elections. Although she was considered a non-entity by many, especially in the hinterlands of western Uttar Pradesh, she proved them wrong to claim the seat.Dr Shivach hails from a small non-political family from Dehradun. Her mother worked as school teacher and father as an accounts officer with UP Roadways.Her first political stint came in 2012 during the chairman election for Modi Nagar Nagar Palika seat which her husband, Dr Devendra Shivach, intended to contest but could not as the seat was reserved for women.Instead, she took up the challenge but lost. The couple had been classmates in medical college and decided to marry before settling in Modi Nagar from where her husband hails. They also set up a small hospital there in 1996.However, after the defeat in the nagar palika election, in 2013, she was entrusted to look after the womens wing of the Bharatiya Janata Party as its district president.There was no looking back since. Women joined me in large numbers and we joined every event, protest and agitation called by the party. It is hard for any woman to stand up in a male dominated region such as western UP. I remember carrying out publicity campaigns in the 2014 general elections for the party and drove through interior villages day and night. There were motorcades deployed by other parties to woo voters and they indulged in hectic campaigning. Still, it did not deter me, she said.During December and January, she stood in bus stops of Modi Nagar and urged people to join the BJP. Her ticket for the assembly seat was not confirmed till she came to the attention of party leaders.I remember that I had gone to partys regional office at Ghaziabad when the names of contesting candidates were being finalised. I was returning home and I had just reached Raj Chopla near my hospital and was on my phone. I lost the connectivity just then and could not figure out the names of the selected candidates and my heart was beating fast. When I reached Modi Nagar, people were celebrating outside my house and they told me that I will be contesting, she said.I could not believe it and I rushed back to the regional office for a confirmation. Since that day, I started preparations for the election. All my hospital work was taken over by my colleague Dr Shobhna Sengar. The networking part with leaders of dominant groups was taken over by my husband. These two people have been the driving force behind my success, Dr Shivach said.On March 11, the doctor was declared as winner from Modi Nagar seat after she trounced sitting BSP MLA from Murad Nagar Wahab Chaudhary and Rashtriya Lok Dals Sudesh Sharma, the sitting MLA from Modi Nagar seat. She was the only woman candidate among the nine who contested from the assembly seat.Her political duties aside, the doctor never misses her morning deadline to attend to patients who come from every section of society and far flung areas. Even after being elected the MLA, Dr Shivach is a regular at the hospital, attending to patients.She is a strict administrator and looks after the hospital personally. It is her personal touch with her patients that makes her respected and loved by all, Dr Sengar said.Her hobbies range from preparing Indian cuisines to reading literature and mythology. Even as she moves on to a bigger and challenging role, Dr Shivach says she will always be available to her patients and at the hospital.I had a lot of support wherever I worked. Even my patients supported me. Now, the time has come to take up a bigger challenge to serve people on a larger scale. I have a definite agenda to implement and take up issues of women security, sugarcane farmers and easing traffic related issues before the 2019 general elections. I will do all this at any cost, the new MLA said.Grill-session: Dr Manju Shivach, BJP MLA Modi NagarYou will be under pressure to perform before the 2019 general elections.

The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
590451177be9e0264d1d3e76,Pune: Vasantdada Sugar Institute’s latest cane promises to be less water intensive and drought-resistant,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/pune-vasantdada-sugar-institutes-latest-cane-promises-to-be-less-water-intensive-and-drought-resistant/,2017-03-22,"Three mills- one each in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Nanded have gone for cultivation of the cane VSI had earlier introduced various cane varieties many of which remain in use. Three mills- one each in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Nanded have gone for cultivation of the cane VSI had earlier introduced various cane varieties many of which remain in use.IN ORDER to make the sugarcane crop less water intensive and drought-resistant, Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute has developed a new cane variety Co VSI 8005. Shivajiarao Deshmukh, director general of the institute, said the new variety has been planted over 10,000 hectares and would go for crushing for the first time in the season of 2017-18.Cane crop has faced criticism because of its increased usage of water. Although the crop occupies only 10 per cent of the farmland, around 70 per cent of water resources are used by it. The cane crop of Maharashtra has been criticised as a water guzzler by both environmentalist and agricultural scientists. Even the Commission for Agricultural Cost and Pricing (CACP) has criticised the states cane crop for its over usage of water.Deshmukh, talking about the new variety, said it uses less water than the more prevalent Co 86032 one. The standing crop can withstand without water for as much as 45 days and thus, it is suitable for drought-prone area, he said. The new variety also has higher sugar content and its stubble can be re-used for three seasons. This variety will help in increasing the overall recovery of Maharashtra, he said. Three mills- one each in Ahmednagar, Kolhapur and Nanded have gone for cultivation of the cane VSI had earlier introduced various cane varieties many of which remain in use. Some of the varieties while having excellent sugar recovery had faced pest infestation which had curtailed its cultivation.In some cases, the presence of thorns had made a water efficient variety. The present crushing season saw Uttar Pradesh stealing the march over Maharashtra in sugar production. Uttar Pradeshs success was mainly due to the introduction of a new variety of cane Co 0238, which has increased the over all sugar recovery of the state.On Tuesday, Deshmukh also announced the winners of the the special prizes for both individual farmers as well as sugar mills which VSI confers annually. This year, the Shree Vighnahar cooperative sugar mill in Junnar taluka of Pune district has been judged as the best overall performer. Also, accolades were in store for the Nanded-based Bhaurao Chavan cooperative mill that won four awards. Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis will be distributing the awards on the occasion of the annual day of the institute on Monday.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

58fd16197be9e06c9371493b,Lucknow's Tunday kababi downs shutters after Adityanath announces slaughterhouse ban,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/mar/23/lucknows-tunday-kababi-downs-shutters-after-adityanath-announces-slaughterhouse-ban-1584925.html,2017-03-23,"One of Lucknow's oldest and legendary Lucknow Wale Tunday Kababi, founded in 1905, has been the go-to place for the famous Tunday Kebabs. This iconic eatery had shut shop on Wednesday because of a scarcity of meat.According to a Scroll.in report, Tunday Kababi had its four slaughterhouses sealed between 2013 and 2015. The report further elaborated that the buffalo meat serving outlet in Akbari Gate was shut, but the one serving chicken and mutton in Aminabad remained open.It is to be noted that UP is a state where cow, bullock and ox slaughter is banned, but buffaloes can be killed.Mohammad Usman, the owner, was quoted in the report saying that the supply of mutton and chicken had not been affected so far, but expressed apprehension about the overall meat shortage in the state. With large quantities of kababs that get produced every single day in Lucknow (estimated to be in tonnes), goat meat or chicken alone can't fulfil the demand. Buffalo meat has been traditionally used to make this Awadhi cuisine.Meat shortage has been the growing worry in Uttar Pradesh, a state which has an estimated 52.9% non-vegetarians, due to the new chief minister Yogi Adityanath's directives of shutting down of illegal abattoirs. Lucknow has already begun to face the heat of this with the civic body sealing nine meat shops so far.Lucknow is well known for its Mughlai -Awadhi cuisine, with non-veg kebabs dominating the recommended eatery list in the lanes and bylanes of the City of Nawabs. The city's tourism, in fact, thrives on this rich gourmet.According to National Sample Survey Office (NSSO) data findings, the total quantity of buffalo meat consumed per month had decreased from 1.25 crore kg in 1999-2000 to 90.5 lakh kg in 2011-12. It also reveals that the state where Mohammad Akhlaq was lynched in 2015 when suspected of storing beef at his home, has the highest number of Muslims eating buffalo meat  1.73 crore  followed by West Bengal (1.5 crore) and Assam (57 lakh).In a media interview last year, Chaudhary Ahleh Umar Qureshi, the U.P. secretary of All India Jamiatul Quresh, which has traditionally been engaged as butchers was quoted saying, 60-70 per cent of those who eat buffalo meat in the form of Lucknows famous kababs, may not get recorded in the above data since they are not consumed at home.Despite NSSO recording a decline in beef and buffalo meat consumption over the last decade in UP, Lucknow's kababs still require meat.Ever since Yogi Adityanath's swearing-in on March 19, the state has carried out several raids and began the process of shutting down slaughterhouses. According to Lucknow Municipal Corporation, this drive has been launched across 11 districts so far.The mouth-watering Tunday kebabs incorporate 160 spices. Ingredients include finely minced lamb or buffalo meat, plain yogurt, garam masala, grated ginger, crushed garlic, ground cardamom, powdered cloves, melted ghee, dried mint, small onions cut into rings, vinegar, sugar, lime. Does this make your mouth water?"

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) A 22-year-old resident of east Delhi knows first-hand what it is like to fall into the trap at a young age. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)Cut, samaan or maal  these are words that a 38-year-old real estate broker wants to forget. What started as an experiment with a pinch of heroin 14 years ago has now hijacked his life. Lodged at a south Delhi de-addiction centre for the sixth time in seven years, the father of two is trying to get rid of a habit that has cost him family ties and his business. I started abusing drugs when I was in Class X. The guard in my school gave it to me, saying it was bhole ki booti. I dont remember if it was heroin, charas or ganja, he says.Clad in a T-shirt and jeans, he sits in a room at the de-addiction centre for a counselling session. I am very familiar with this place; the doctors and staff know me. But this is the last time I want to come here, he says.Over the past three years, police sources say, the demand for drugs, especially cocaine and heroin, has been increasing in the city. While the former is out of reach for many due to its high cost, heroin  especially its adulterated version known as smack  is much more accessible.The cost of 1 kg heroin in the international market is about Rs 4 crore. In Delhi, as all over the world, the drug is adulterated  or cut  using sugar, coffee and several compounds. One gram is sold in Delhi for about Rs 200-Rs 300 in various hotspots, which include JJ clusters and parks. Cocaine, on the other hand, is 15 to 20 times more expensive. Brown sugar or smack is very common in Delhi, mostly among youngsters. It is often mixed with various pharmaceutical drugs that are illegally sold over the counter. Addicts inhale, snort or inject the drug.In February this year, the Delhi Police busted a gang in Shahdaras Seemapuri area and recovered 273.45 grams of smack worth Rs 7.5 lakh in the international market. The gang would sell 2,000 packets (each containing 1 gram heroin) of the contraband in a single day. The peddlers got their supply of heroin from Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh. Police had claimed that the accused were selling heroin packets to almost 4,000-5,000 boys in the area. In the case, police had identified 18 boys who were addicted to heroin. Three of them were minors.A 22-year-old resident of east Delhi knows first-hand what it is like to fall into the trap at a young age. He says he has to inject 10 ml of a mixture of heroin and anti-allergens into his veins every day, else he experiences severe withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, aches and pains in the bones, insomnia, diarrhea, and vomiting.I started smoking cigarettes when I was in Class IX. I quickly moved on to beer, whisky, ganja, charas and eventually cut smack. I can buy a days fix in a small pouch for Rs 200. I mix it with Avil (anti-allergic medicine). Ten ml of the mixture is sufficient for me, he says.He, too, has been in and out of de-addiction centres. This is my fourth time at the centre. After each three-month course, I end up in the same environment  the same friends and the same temptations. I want to get rid of this habit, he says.A transit pointOver the years, owing to accessibility and relative anonymity, Delhi has become a transit point for international drug peddlers. Police sources say that presently there are three big hubs of heroin  southwest Asia, southeast Asia and India.Heroin is an opioid  a drug derived from opium. Cultivation of poppy for opium is allowed in some parts of India, Turkey and Australia. While countries such as Pakistan and Afghanistan have banned the cultivation, the plant is still grown extensively in some areas, police say. Opium is used to make morphine  a purified form of which is used to make a strong painkiller. Morphine is also used to make heroin.In India, police say, heroin comes from Rajasthans Kota, Jhalawar, Bara, Chittorgarh, Pratapgarh and Udaipur, Madhya Pradeshs Bhawani, Mandi, Mandsaur, Indore and Neemuch and Uttar Pradeshs Bareilly, Barabanki and Badaun and some parts of Jharkhand. Police sources say heroin is also smuggled in from Afghanistan and Pakistan via Amritsar. Cocaine  extracted from the leaves of Coca plants  comes to Delhi from west African countries via Mumbai and Goa, police say. Police have also noticed the increasing trend of involvement of foreign nationals and women in the drug trade. According to officials at the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), women belonging to middle class families take to trafficking as their relatives are involved in the trade.Director of the Delhi Zonal Unit (NCB), Madho Singh, told The Indian Express that they have identified two routes via which heroin is supplied to Delhi and other parts of India  border route and air route.Due to tension at the border, smuggling via this route has decreased of late. But a new trend is being noticed  drugs are being smuggled by air passengers. The carrier swallows capsules filled with the drugs. Once they land in the country, the drugs are extracted. However, our intelligence network helps us nab such carriers, says Singh, adding that the unit is working towards procuring a full body scanner at the Indira Gandhi International Airport.Sources say the government has asked security agencies to create a database of persons who have been arrested in connection with drug trade. The government has also directed that information about such peddlers or rackets be shared between the agencies.Deputy Commissioner of Police (narcotics and crime) Rajesh Deo told The Indian Express, We are in the process of developing more human intelligence to delve deeper into the peddling racket. We are developing various mechanisms for this purpose. Low income areas are majorly affected by drug peddling and we will soon launch awareness programmes there.Rise of party drugsBesides heroin, police say the most commonly abused drugs in Delhi are ganja (marijuana), charas (cannabis), cocaine, opium, buprenorphine, nitrazepam, phenegran, diazepam, mandrax, amphetamine, morphine, pentazocin, pseudoephedrine and codine. Use of smack and ganja gained impetus as it is cheaper than other drugs. Most of the addicts are street children, people living in shelters and adolescents from the lower classes, says a police officer, who works in the narcotics department of Delhi Police.In the recent past, another trend has emerged  an increase in the use of party drugs such as LSD (acid/blotter), MDMA (ecstasy/eve/lovers speed, peace), GHB (liquid ecstasy/scoop) and mephedrone (meow meow) in the capital.Police sources say these drugs are being used in tandem with alcohol  drugs and alcohol are taken alternatively to give a high which lasts for several hours. The alternative dosage of alcohol and the drug has a spiraling effect, which is further fuelled by high-pitch trance music at rave parties. Though such parties are not common in Delhi, the increase in the type and quantity of party drugs in Delhi is dangerous, says an officer.Another officer says the dog squad unit will soon see the addition of two new sniffer dogs, who will be trained exclusively for the purpose of detecting drugs. The squad has dogs which are trained to detect drugs as well as explosives, but we need to train dogs to sniff out drugs exclusively, he says.Going cleanAccording to doctors, heroin is highly addictive  using the drug a few times is all it takes for people to get addicted. Quitting is tough because of the painful withdrawal symptoms.The real estate dealer testifies to this. I am married and have two young children. Most people dont understand the struggle. I dont want to live in this drug-induced haze. Even my children have repeatedly asked me to quit this habit. It is heartbreaking. I want to lead a good life. I keep joining de-addiction centres but I cannot remain sober for long. The urge to use is too strong, he says.He says that he had reported to police and other agencies about the illegal sale of heroin in his area to no avail. At least 40 per cent of youngsters in my area are addicts. Many times, I have alerted police about the trade but nothing has been done. Also, tablets and medicines (used to cut the drug) are being easily sold over the counter in medical stores, he says.According to a doctor at the centre, the company an addict keeps and the environment he lives in during and after treatment are important. Once a patient completes the treatment, he should avoid coming in contact with the same circle of friends or people with whom he used to take drugs says the doctor. He adds, While some get over the addiction soon after the first treatment, others require multiple treatments.Talking about how the misuse of pharmaceutical products is on the rise in the capital, another doctor says people mix a small quantity of heroin with readily-available medicines from pharmacies.Police, however, say misuse of pharmaceutical products comes under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, and only the government has the power to take action. We can only inform the administration, which we always do when such an activity comes to our notice. We can only seize, arrest and investigate the banned drugs under the NDPS (Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act, a police officer says. Under the law, a person booked under the Act may face imprisonment up to 10 years or more. The quantum of punishment is also based on the quantity of banned drugs recovered from his or her possession.From Afghanistan to the capitalMarch 2017Special Cell arrests two, recover heroin worth Rs 8 crore. According to Special Cell sources, the accused were part of an international drug ring with origins in Afghanistan and a trafficking network spanning Pakistan and several parts of India.January 2017Acting on information, NCB intercepts an Afghan national travelling from Herat to New Delhi via Kabul.

""The poor people must be issued ration cards, while stringent action be initiated against the food grain and ration mafia. The superintendents of police and district magistrates must act tough against these mafia through sustained campaigns,"" he said while chairing a review meeting of officials of Gorakhpur and Basti divisions here.He directed the officials concerned to submit a report in the next 15 days on the revival of closed sugar mills and repair of those mills which were not functioning properly. The Chief Minister asked the district magistrates to ensure that the benefits of the government schemes reach the needy. Aditya Nath also batted for tough action on mining, forest and cattle mafias. He directed the officials to settle the pending payments of sugarcane farmers in the next 15 days, and prepare a comprehensive strategy in the new sowing season.The priest-turned-politician also drew the attention of the officials towards denotified tribes and asked them to conduct a survey to gauge whether the tribals have availed the state schemes. ""After the survey, the villages dominated by Van Tangiaa and Musahar (both denotified) should be declared 'revenue villages' so that basic facilities of education, health, drinking water, road, housing, electricity and government ration shops could be provided in these region,"" he said.On a stern note, the Chief Minister said contracts for construction work should not be given to any criminal elements. ""If any pressure tactic is used by the criminal elements, it must be brought to the notice of the DMs and SPs immediately and FIRs be registered against these elements,"" he added. The Chief Minister also directed the officials to shift the Indian Institute of Sugarcane Research in Lucknow to Pipraich so that the construction work of AIIMS could commence in the city.He said the construction work of Gorakhpur Fertiliser Plant and Indian Bottling Plant Project must be completed by 2019. The saffron leader also asked officials to refrain from using disputed land as sites of any state project."

That problem could be easily rectified by asking the man at the stall to make the chai really tagda, strong. The resultant brew is (almost) always perfect.The camera-toting flneurs, of course, dont hang out at these dusty street chai stalls for the humble chai (they can always go for flies-free High Tea at big hotels). The real pull of these places is to taste the flavour of the unique hyperlocal worlds that these tea stalls are parts of and which they also help create.One of the most atmospheric chai stalls in the capital is in Old Delhi, though this shack is only three years old.Lallans stall has no name  it is simply run by Lallan (he uses only one name). It consists of an arched niche that is part of an old dilapidated building in Galli Choori Wallan, a street that was once home to bangle sellers.Lallan, a man in his late 20s, walks to this spot every morning at seven from his room in the vicinity, which he shares with half-a-dozen brick-layers.Within minutes, he sets up his stove, a kettle, a steel tray, a box of sugar, a box of chai patti, stacks of white plastic glasses, a pan of milk, strainers, and a few tea snacks such as the flaky fen, made in the neighbourhood bakeries. Lallan carries all of this paraphernalia in a beautiful rust-coloured metal trunk on which the customers are later permitted to sit.The good time to visit the place is at 8 in the morning  the stall remains open until 7pm.Once you are here, you might realize that the most intense way to experience the tea stall is by gazing at it from across the street. The beautifully carved arch and its derelict wall  ruined enough to show lakhori bricks beneath the peeling outer surface  stand out as souvenirs to the vanishing beauty of Old Delhi architecture.This other-worldly enigma is pleasantly balanced by Lallan and his customers, some of whom have their noses buried within the pages of Hindi dailies.Most morning regulars happen to be rickshaw pullers or daily wage labourers  the latter are seen dragging loads all day long on wooden trolleys across the Walled Citys byzantine lanes.Lallan himself started his life in Delhi a few years ago as one such daily wage labourer. His parents, wife and four children live in his village in Bahraich, Uttar Pradesh, where they have a one-acre farm.Now, the real thing. It turns out that the chai doesnt need the trappings of the chai stalls architectural backdrop. Flavoured with ginger, it is strong and reinvigorating enough to turn you into a Lallan loyalist."

He reached Noida at 10am and made his way to Sector 3, where he symbolically cleaned a road with a broom. He then visited Sector 6 where he took the cleanliness pledge along with Noida authority officials.In his address to party workers, he said that Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself took a broom in his hand and cleaned the roads in Delhi to inspire others to do the same.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has woken up the people and the party workers and inspired them to work for public welfare. Taking inspiration from him, we have decided to clean Uttar Pradesh. We will not only rid UP of garbage, but also of the ill feelings that officials have in their minds. We will clean everything from roads and garbage to the minds of the people, he said.State minister (independent charge) of cane development and sugar mills, industrial development, Suresh Rana and Noida MLA Pankaj Singh, who were present with Mahana, also said that they will work to make Noida a better city.We will bring in investment and help set up industries so that Noida surpasses Gurgaon in all aspects, including job creation and policing. It would be the place to work and set up a business. We will also make Noida the safest place for women, he said at the event in Sector 3.Mahana also said that he will regularly visit Noida and keep interacting with the people so that the city does not remain neglected.Earlier, chief ministers did not visit Noida because there was a perception that whoever visits the city will lose their position. But we do not believe in andhvishwas (superstition), so we will keep coming to Noida to be able to fulfil the promises made to public, he said."

We have most of the sugar mills here apart from sports goods industry and other export-driven units. Speedy transport system is of immense importance to the region. There are fairly good chances that we will have a synchronized effort from state and Centre to make this airport a reality now.""A Muzaffarnagar-based government official, who didn't wish to be named, said, ""The distance between Meerut and the state capital is 500 km. Train journey on the route is time-taking and arduous. The air passage will increase productivity of frequent commuters.""The genesis of this proposal dates back to February 2010 when the then UP government had decided to shift the proposed airport from Noida to Meerut. The then principal secretary for civil aviation, UP government, had issued a notification in this regard and had invited bids for appointment of consultants for the setting-up of airport. Meerut Development Authority (MDA) was appointed the nodal authority and the existing airstrip on the outskirts of the city near Gogol village was to be developed as a full-fledged airport. However, the project that was slated for completion in 2016 never took off.After years of negotiations, it was not until February 24, 2014, that an MoU was signed between state government and Airports Authority of India (AAI) to develop seven airports in Uttar Pradesh, including Meerut.According to the MoU, the UP government had agreed to provide the required land logistic report for the development of the airports. But till date, there is little progress in this regard.A total of 158.7 hectares of land was required for the project in Meerut. Most of the land bank belonged to the farmers of two villages, Gagol (120 hectares) and Kashi (106 ha). After prolonged negotiations, a rate was fixed at Rs 5,800 per square metre.Funds of Rs 920 crore needed for land acquisition never arrived. Besides, the project also includes 30 acres of forest land and the forest department did not give the land to AAI as the latter did not issue certificate that minimum trees would be cut.These and many other issues including political hostilities between the state and Centre put a spanner in the progress of the project.Vivek Bhaskar, assistant town planner, ADA -- the nodal agency for the designated project, told TOI, ""The new government in Lucknow is seeking detailed reports of all proposed or unfinished projects in the state with fresh perspective. And, airport project in UP is certainly one of them. A huge amount of work in Meerut airport project has already been done. Now the government has to issue fresh directions in this regard. Once this is done, issues like technical viability survey can be taken up and with decisive leaderships in both Centre and state, all hurdles can be removed. We are only awaiting orders."""

(PTI) Patna, April 3: Chief minister Nitish Kumar today picked up the Supreme Court's highway liquor-shop ban to push for what has almost become his pet project, nationwide prohibition. People in many states including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Haryana are strongly opposing the shifting of liquor shops away from highways into residential areas in accordance with the apex court order delivered in December last year banning liquor shops within 500 metres of national and state highways in an effort to curb drink-driving and road accidents that claim thousands of lives every year. ""Shifting liquor shops 500 metres away from national and state highways due to the Supreme Court directive is no solution to the problem,"" Nitish said when he was asked his opinion on the on the issue on the sidelines of his special Lok Samvad (public dialogue) programme held in the state capital today. ""Complete ban on liquor is the only way out,"" he added. ""Prohibition is the answer as it is attached to public aspiration across the country."" He demanded that the BJP-led government at the Centre should take a lead on this front. ""It's the centenary year of Mahatma Gandhi's Champaran Satyagraha and I would request the central government to show its commitment (to the ideals of the Mahatma) by banning liquor in the country. It could be started with BJP-ruled states,"" Nitish said. He pointed out that neither does any religion support drinking, nor does the Constitution say that the right to drink alcohol a fundamental right, and asked why the Centre was not implementing nationwide prohibition. The chief minister said he has visited several states and noticed that the public sentiment was in favour of prohibition. Bihar, he said, had shown the way and ""people (in other states) were welcoming the step taken by Bihar"". Since clamping total prohibition in Bihar on April 5 last year, Nitish has addressed pro-liquor-ban events in states like Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Maharashtra. ""I have been requesting chief ministers of other states to ban liquor,"" the chief minister said. ""I will do so to Uttar Pradesh CM (Yogi Adityanath). I had suggested this to (former Uttar Pradesh chief minister) Akhilesh Yadav and had requested Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee while attending her oath-taking ceremony."" A few states were avoiding liquor ban on excuses that it will hurt their sugar industry because molasses are used to make alcohol, Nitish said, and declared that no sugar mill had suffered in Bihar as they switched over to produce ethanol, which he called good for the country's economy and environment. The central government has directed that 10 per cent ethanol be mixed in petrol. Nitish also pooh-poohed suggestions that prohibition leads to drop in a state's revenue and declared that Bihar's loss of Rs 5,000 crore excise and value added tax (VAT) in 2015-16 due to the ban on liquor has been almost compensated in 2016-17. ""In the beginning revenue falls,"" he said. but money saved from not spending on liquor leads to growth on expenditure of other items like garments, electrical appliances, milk products, furniture. It expands the economy and leads to revenue growth."""

Although Rahul described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""step in the right direction"", he alleged inaction by the Narendra Modi government by tweeting: ""I am happy the BJP has finally been forced to see reason. But let's not play politics with our farmers who are suffering across the country."" Contending that the Congress has always supported loan waivers for farmers in distress, Rahul said in another tweet: ""The Central Government must have a national response to the widespread distress and not discriminate amongst states."" In the context of Uttar Pradesh too, he said the relief was only ""partial"". The waivers apply to harvest loans up to Rs 1 lakh. Rahul had petitioned Prime Minister Modi seeking loan waivers for farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab before the recent elections in these states. Although he has often demanded a national policy to provide such financial relief, the demand letters he submitted to the government were from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh decision is bound to have repercussions and the Congress appears to have fuelled the discontent with Rahul's response. Sharad Pawar has criticised the selective relief and exhorted the farmers of Maharashtra to intensify their agitation and ""make the life of the government miserable"". Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of suicides in recent times, was compelled to issue a statement that his BJP-led government was examining the issue of loan waivers. The Congress has also pointed to the drought in the southern states and asked the Centre not to address the agrarian crisis according to pressures of political exigencies. Rahul had recently joined the farmers of Tamil Nadu who have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for more than 20 days. The Congress is also planning to raise the issues of farmers in Gujarat, which goes to the polls later this year. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to waive loans of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and, at the state's first cabinet meeting yesterday, the promise has been partially fulfilled. The Yogi Adityanath government decided to waive loans worth Rs 30,700 crore while the total outstanding debt of farmers is Rs 92,241 crore. In Congress-ruled Punjab, an expert committee has been set up to prepare a proposal. The Congress, aware that Punjab's finances are in a mess, expects the Centre to step in. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has already met the Prime Minister seeking assistance for fulfilling the loan-waiver promise. Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said the agrarian distress was the outcome of the policies of the Centre and a national scheme was needed to ameliorate the farmers' plight. Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""mirage"" that skipped the need for addressing the real crisis. ""There are 2.33 crore farmers in UP, of which 2.15 crore are marginal farmers. The proposal will cover barely 86 lakh farmers. The government should have waived the total debt, including term loans. Nothing was done for sugarcane and potato farmers,"" Surjewala said."

The State cabinet also decided to waive loans worth Rs. 6,000 crore extended to small and marginal farmers that had turned into non-performing assets. Together, this package, aimed at fulfilling the Bharatiya Janata Partys election promise, will cost the exchequer about Rs. 36,000 crore. There was no mention of a bigger plan to ramp up the farm sector, in which U.P. invested just 2.3% of total expenditure in 2016-17  one of the lowest rates across major States. A little earlier, the Madras High Court ordered the Tamil Nadu government to extend a similar farm loan waiver scheme for small farmers (with land holdings of up to 5 acres) and marginal farmers (who own up to 2.5 acres) to all farmers. Officials have even been forbidden from trying to recover loans where repayments have slipped. The State, which had already doled out Rs. 5,780 crore on this front, would need nearly Rs. 2,000 crore more to comply with the courts order. This is a worrying trend for a country that wants to double agricultural incomes by 2022. Not only could it trigger a countrywide clamour for similar debt relief packages, political parties would also be more inclined to make such grand promises ahead of future polls. This is a slippery slope with multiple unintended outcomes likely in the years to come.The Madras High Court has clearly reached into the the domain of the executive. The risk is that this overreach could be cited in other courts to seek omnibus loan waivers. Opposition parties in U.P. have already criticised the cap of Rs. 1 lakh on farm loans that will attract relief. The timing of these drastic interventions is unusual as India had a good monsoon in the 2016-17 crop season, after two years of drought, and a bumper output is expected for all major crops barring sugarcane. Forgiving loan burdens is a powerful political gesture that glosses over the fact that governments have had little patience to make agriculture a sustainable economic activity with efficient linkages to formal markets, be it for credit or for supply chains from farm gate to fork. FDI of up to 100% was allowed in food retail trading but investments are stuck over the reluctance to allow a small proportion of non-food sales. Writing off loans as a blanket policy, without scrutiny and restructuring attempts creates a moral hazard for borrowers, who will have no incentive to stick to credit discipline. Frequent write-offs will prod banks to invest in alternatives such as the Rural Infrastructure Development Fund instead of reaching out to individual farmers to meet their agricultural lending targets. In which case, usurious local moneylenders could have a field day."

For example, Aligarh is famous for locks. So the Yamuna Expressway can have dedicated clusters for small-scale lock industries encouraging traditional lock manufacturers so that they can compete with international brands. Similarly, we want Meeruts sports industry, Saharanpurs wood business and Muradabads brass industry to be encouraged, said Rana.While Noida and Greater Noida do not have much land left to set up new industries, the Yamuna Expressway area still has a lot of agricultural land available that can be acquired and used for industrial development.Our government wants to work honestly, with dedication and a clear vision to create jobs for as many youth as we can, said Rana."

(Representational) Our farmers both in the hills and the plains have suffered natural calamities for several years which have hit them hard economically. (Representational)Opposition Congress in Uttarakhand has demanded payment of dues to sugarcane cultivators, loan waiver for farmers of the state on the lines of their Uttar Pradesh counterparts and regularisation of guest teachers. Talking to reporters here PCC president Kishore Upadhyaya said he had written to Chief Minister Trivendra Singh Rawat reminding him of his pre-poll promise of settling the dues of sugarcane farmers within 15 days of coming to power.It is more than a fortnight since he (Rawat) took oath but the promise is yet to be fulfilled. If the government forgets pre-poll promises like his it will be a matter of concern for the people of the state, he said yesterday. Noting that Haridwar and Udhamsingh Nagar are the two districts in the plains where sugarcane growing is prevalent, Upadhyaya said the new season for plantation of the crop has begun but last years arrears had not yet been paid.Terming it a matter of concern, he asked the chief minister to immediately take steps about it. Citing the example of Uttar Pradesh where farmers had been exempted from repaying loans up to Rs 1 lakh recently, the Congress leader said farmers of Uttarakhand should also get a similar waiver.Our farmers both in the hills and the plains have suffered natural calamities for several years which have hit them hard economically. Hence we demand that they should also be exempted from repaying their loans, he said. Upadhyaya said guest teachers had been appointed by the previous government to address the problem of shortage of teachers in schools especially in the remote hill areas.The tenure of their services is over now. But we demand that they should be regularised in view of the fact that their services are still needed, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

If necessary, the state government would also recommend a CBI inquiry into the issue, the chief minister said when presentations about sugarcane development department were made before him at his Lal Bahadur Shastri Bhawan office here late on Friday evening.Adityanath said nobody had any right to sell government properties at unreasonable prices. The state government would not allow anybody to misuse government property under any circumstances, he said.The Mayawati government had decided to sell 21 sugar mills on June 4, 2007. The running mills put on sale included Amroha, Bijnor, Bulandshahar, Chandpur, Jarval Road, Khadda, Rohana Kalan, Sakauti Tanda, Saharanpur and Siswa Bazar.As there were accusations of corruption, the opposition had demanded a CBI inquiry.

Besides concession granted to undervalue the land and buildings of these sugar mills, no stamp duty was levied on the sale.The auditor had also observed that no competition was possible due to connection among the bidders. It noted that the bidders were aware of the expected value before the bidding was opened. Bids that were 50% below the expected value were kept alive and the Swiss challenge method was used.The process of opening the bids was changed, the CAG said, adding that the core group of secretaries on disinvestments did not value the land and the buildings appropriately and focused on the discounted cash flow method."

The loan disbursement has been 80% of the overall agriculture credit target which was set at Rs 51,000 crore for the fiscal.Anticipating non-repayment of loans, the state government has made it clear that those paying their dues will get bigger benefits through different schemes.The government plans to bring a scheme under which those farmers repaying their agriculture loan on time will get bigger benefits, state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar told HT.Bank of Maharashtra, the largest public sector lender in the state, has seen sharp rise in its NPA from 9.55% in 2015-16 to 13.26% in 2016-17. Part of the reason, bankers say, was also demonetisation when recovery almost came to a halt.What we have seen is a growing tendency among borrowers who are otherwise capable to repay loan but postpone their decision. The repeated loan waiver is hampering the culture of repayment of dues as honest people do not see any incentive in paying back the money they borrowed from the bank, Rajkiran Bhoir, general manager, Bank of Maharashtra, said.In western Maharashtra, where farmers produce sugarcane, the recovery of loans has gone down from the previous year, officials said.Solapur district, which has highest number of sugar factories, recorded farm loan recovery of up to 65% till March, compared to 77% during the previous year, according to district central cooperative bank officials, who did not wish to come on record since they were not authorised to speak to the media.In Ahmednagar district, farm loan recovery for the outgoing financial year was just 33%, slightly less compared to previous year, an official of Ahmednagar District Central Cooperative Bank, which through its network of agriculture credit societies along with other financial institution distributed agriculture loan, said.When there is a demand for farm loan waiver, people naturally prefer to wait, hoping they get relief. But there are many borrowers who repay their dues, said Charudatta Arkatkar, secretary, State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), a representative body of all lending institutions in the state.The fall in loan recovery has been recorded despite a good monsoon this year with the economic survey predicting a 12.5% growth rate for agriculture in 2016-17 from the minus 4.6% in 2015-16.Congress workers raising slogans with Tamil Nadu farmers during a protest against Centre in Coimbatore on Wednesday, demanding farm loans waiver. (PTI)The UP government on Tuesday decided to waive farm loan worth Rs 36,369 crore. The same day Madras High Court, while hearing a plea, asked the Tamil Nadu government to provide relief to all the farmers by waiving farm loan.Coming under pressure from opposition and ally Shiv Sena, chief minister Fadnavis said his government is in favour of loan waiver and was studying the UP model.Against growing demand for loan waiver, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel cautioned about the moral consequences of such a scheme saying, waivers undermine an honest credit culture.Kishore Tiwari, an agricultural activist and chairman of government constituted task-force on recommending solutions to agrarian crisis, said the relief should be offered only to farmers affected by drought and those who cant repay dues.There is no point extending the farm loan waiver to all the farmers the way government did in 2008. Only those who are financially in bad shape due to successive droughts and other reasons should be given relief, he said."

PTI file photoAfter waiving farm loans of small and marginal farmers, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is contemplating replicating the 'Amma canteens' of Tamil Nadu (subsidised meal scheme named after former CM, the late J Jayalalithaa) in the state.According to sources, the state government will be setting up Annapurna Bhojnalaya (canteen) in different cities in the state, which would provide breakfast, lunch and dinner at nominal rates.Breakfast will cost Rs 3 while lunch and dinner will be priced at Rs 5 each. Thus, a days meal will cost only Rs 13, said a senior official, who was privy to the information.The draft scheme is almost ready...It will be presented before the chief minister in the next few days, the official added. Sources said that the government planned to launch the project in capital Lucknow, Ghaziabad and Gorakhpur (Adityanaths hometown) on a pilot basis and later extend it to other parts of the state.''We plan to set up Annapurna canteens in all 14 municipal corporations in the state in a phased manner,'' the official said. The scheme would benefit the poor, labourers, rickshaw pullers, daily-wage earners and low-salaried people, he said.The canteens would be run on PPP (public-private partnership) model, he added. Over 250 canteens are likely to be opened across the state...it will cost the exchequer over Rs 150 crore annually, he said.The official said the chief minister may formally announce the scheme in the next few days.Govt orders probeMeanwhile, suspecting a scam of about Rs 1,100 crore, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to conduct a probe into the sale of 21 sugar mills in the state during the BSP rule in 2010-11. The state government might consider recommending a CBI probe into the matter, an official spokesman said here on Saturday.The decision was taken at a review meeting of the sugar cane development department chaired by Adityanath. The chief minister noted that nobody has the right to misuse public property and those violating it will be brought to justice.The chief minister also said FIRs will be lodged against sugar mills if they failed to pay arrears of sugar cane farmers by April 23. He directed officials to take all measures to make operational the defunct sugar mills of the cooperative sector in next crushing season.Adityanath said a committee would be set up to suggest maximum utilisation of resources of sugar mills during the off season."

If necessary, the state government would also recommend a CBI inquiry into the issue, the chief minister said when presentations about sugarcane development department were made before him at his Lal Bahadur Shastri Bhawan office here late on Friday evening.Adityanath said nobody had any right to sell government properties at unreasonable prices. The state government would not allow anybody to misuse government property under any circumstances, he said.The Mayawati government had decided to sell 21 sugar mills on June 4, 2007. The running mills put on sale included Amroha, Bijnor, Bulandshahar, Chandpur, Jarval Road, Khadda, Rohana Kalan, Sakauti Tanda, Saharanpur and Siswa Bazar.As there were accusations of corruption, the opposition had demanded a CBI inquiry. After taking over the reins of the state, the then Samajwadi Party government had ordered a Lokayukta probe on November 6, 2012.The Comptroller and Auditor General of India in its report had estimated losses to the tune of Rs 1,179.84 crore due to sale of these sugar mills.It had observed that the land and buildings of the sugar mills were undervalued. Besides concession granted to undervalue the land and buildings of these sugar mills, no stamp duty was levied on the sale.The auditor had also observed that no competition was possible due to connection among the bidders. It noted that the bidders were aware of the expected value before the bidding was opened. Bids that were 50% below the expected value were kept alive and the Swiss challenge method was used.The process of opening the bids was changed, the CAG said, adding that the core group of secretaries on disinvestments did not value the land and the buildings appropriately and focused on the discounted cash flow method."

The loan disbursement has been 80% of the overall agriculture credit target which was set at Rs 51,000 crore for the fiscal.Anticipating non-repayment of loans, the state government has made it clear that those paying their dues will get bigger benefits through different schemes.The government plans to bring a scheme under which those farmers repaying their agriculture loan on time will get bigger benefits, state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar told HT.Bank of Maharashtra, the largest public sector lender in the state, has seen sharp rise in its NPA from 9.55% in 2015-16 to 13.26% in 2016-17. Part of the reason, bankers say, was also demonetisation when recovery almost came to a halt.What we have seen is a growing tendency among borrowers who are otherwise capable to repay loan but postpone their decision. The repeated loan waiver is hampering the culture of repayment of dues as honest people do not see any incentive in paying back the money they borrowed from the bank, Rajkiran Bhoir, general manager, Bank of Maharashtra, said.In western Maharashtra, where farmers produce sugarcane, the recovery of loans has gone down from the previous year, officials said.Solapur district, which has highest number of sugar factories, recorded farm loan recovery of up to 65% till March, compared to 77% during the previous year, according to district central cooperative bank officials, who did not wish to come on record since they were not authorised to speak to the media.In Ahmednagar district, farm loan recovery for the outgoing financial year was just 33%, slightly less compared to previous year, an official of Ahmednagar District Central Cooperative Bank, which through its network of agriculture credit societies along with other financial institution distributed agriculture loan, said.When there is a demand for farm loan waiver, people naturally prefer to wait, hoping they get relief. But there are many borrowers who repay their dues, said Charudatta Arkatkar, secretary, State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC), a representative body of all lending institutions in the state.The fall in loan recovery has been recorded despite a good monsoon this year with the economic survey predicting a 12.5% growth rate for agriculture in 2016-17 from the minus 4.6% in 2015-16.Congress workers raising slogans with Tamil Nadu farmers during a protest against Centre in Coimbatore on Wednesday, demanding farm loans waiver. (PTI)The UP government on Tuesday decided to waive farm loan worth Rs 36,369 crore. The same day Madras High Court, while hearing a plea, asked the Tamil Nadu government to provide relief to all the farmers by waiving farm loan.Coming under pressure from opposition and ally Shiv Sena, chief minister Fadnavis said his government is in favour of loan waiver and was studying the UP model.Against growing demand for loan waiver, Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel cautioned about the moral consequences of such a scheme saying, waivers undermine an honest credit culture.Kishore Tiwari, an agricultural activist and chairman of government constituted task-force on recommending solutions to agrarian crisis, said the relief should be offered only to farmers affected by drought and those who cant repay dues.There is no point extending the farm loan waiver to all the farmers the way government did in 2008. Only those who are financially in bad shape due to successive droughts and other reasons should be given relief, he said."

The waiver will cost the state exchequer around Rs 3,500 crore.The farmers having outstanding power bills of Rs 10,000 or more will be allowed to pay the same in four installments, the cabinet decided.It also decided to ensure that transformers were changed in 48-hours, instead of 72 hours, in rural areas and within 24 hours in the urban areas.The farmers will not be required to transport the malfunctioning transformers to the power station. This would be responsibility of the power corporation officials, Sharma said.A memorandum of understanding (MoU) will be signed under the union governments power for all project in the presence of Yogi Adityanath and union power minister Piyush Goyal in Lucknow on April 14, the minister said.The pact will be inked to meet the Centres target of making the state energy efficient by 2018.Relief for potato farmersThe cabinet decided to purchase 1 lakh metric tonnes of potato at Rs 487 per quintal to protect the interest of potato farmers.The government wants to give adequate price to potato growers. Even if we cannot give them profit, we will ensure they do not incur loss, Sharma said.He said district magistrates were asked to set up procurement centres wherever needed.If the previous SP regime had played a proactive role, the condition of potato growers would have been better, he added.Sugarcane dues to be paid in 14 daysThe government also made it mandatory to clear the current dues of the sugarcane growers within 14 days and previous dues within 120 days.Legal action will be initiated against sugar mills if they fail to make payments, Sharma said.Steps to end shortage of building materialsThe state cabinet also decided to amend the Uttar Pradesh Minor Minerals Rules, 1963, in a bid to end the shortage of sand and coarse sand, which is adversely impacting construction activities.Health minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state cabinet had constituted a committee, headed by deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya, at its last meeting to look into the issue.The committee had submitted its report, he said.The state government will allow transportation of minor minerals with valid transit permits from other states.As a short term measure, district magistrates will issue e-tenders to allocate up to 10-acre area for sand mining for six months.

The trigger is the decisive mandate the party got in the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Sensing the pro-poor electoral constituencys disenchantment with the Congress and regional parties, the BJP is going the extra mile to sugar-coat all of its initiatives as measures to help the poor overcome their socio-economic backwardness.The Centre-ruling partys national executive meeting has come back to Odisha after a gap of two decades. The saffron party substantially closing the gap with the Biju Janata Dal, that is ruling the State, in the recent panchayat elections seems to be worrying Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik. With Odisha Assembly elections due in 2019, the saffron party is already showing signs of emerging as a challenger to the BJDs hegemony in the State.Odisha will become the laboratory of pro-poor initiatives of the NDA government at the Centre, Petroleum Minister Dharmendra Pradhan said. The two-day conclave, he added, would lay down the roadmap for the Assembly elections and Lok Sabha polls in 2019.The focus of the meeting would be the Prime Minister, that is the trend now under party chief Amit Shah, said sources.However, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is likely to be the show-stopper. In his limited time in office, Yogi has managed to attract the attention of other BJP Chief Ministers, say sources.The BJP is looking to expand in Odisha, West Bengal, Telangana and Tripura. These are the new catchment areas for the party and we want to reach the top slot in these States in a very quick time. Therefore, every occasion would be utilised to project the Prime Minister as a messiah of the poor, beamed a party functionary.Even though the Presidential elections are just a couple of months away, the meeting would give it a miss, the sources added. Interestingly, to cobble up numbers for the Presidential elections, Shah has asked Adityanath and Manohar Parrikar  Chief Ministers of UP and Goa  not to resign from their MP post. Yogis deputy Keshav Prasad Maurya will also follow suit."

Express Must deal with pressure. ExpressThe Kota Hostel Association has decided to install sensors and springs in ceiling fans in hostel rooms, to check the rising number of suicides in the city. These will ensure that if students try to hang themselves, the fans drop to the floor. Sakshi Tomar stays in Keshavam Residency, a hostel that is not getting the the system installed1. Have you heard of the Kota Hostel Associations plans?Yes, but I am not sure if such a plan will help reduce the suicides. We can only stop this by making students strong mentally. I have been in Kota for two years aur yahan bahut hyper environment hota hai (and the environment here is quite charged). If you dont score well in any test, your friends taunt you, and that leads to embarrassment and stress. A student should be able to deal with such things.2. Why do you think this plan wont help?The most important thing is to have a good environment in hostels, because that is where students spend most of their time. Whenever I am low, I try talking to some of my friends here. The pressures cant be denied, and I feel the association should focus on providing a family-like environment at the hostel, instead of tweaking fans, to help students cope.3. What are the pressures that you face in Kota?Financial pressures, performance pressures My father is a sugarcane farmer in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, and I am the third of four siblings. I am taking coaching at Aakash Institute, and it comes at a price. In fact, most students here are from middle-class families and the coaching costs are a big burden. Though my parents dont tell me anything, main hamesha koshish karti hoon ki mere marks achche aayen (I am always trying that I get good marks). I think in most cases, students end their lives because of pressure from parents.4. Has anyone you know ever thought of killing themselves?No, but in my two years here I have often heard of such deaths. I wouldnt say that they disturb me Once in a while we all get depressed, I get stressed too, but taking your life is not the solution. Life mein struggle karna hota hai, kuch bhi aasani se nahin milta (One needs to struggle in life, success doesnt come easy).5. Why did you come to Kota?I always dreamed of becoming a doctor, and I read about Kota in a newspaper. The atmosphere here is quite competitive and I thought that would help me in my preparation. My studies are going well, I have been working hard, and I hope to crack the exams this time.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

They wait for the hour-long lunch break that day with keen anticipation.All 28 of them rise ten minutes before the clock strikes 1pm, go to their chambers for a quick change and then proceed towards the common dining hall where a delectable three-course meal awaits the lordships.The lip-smacking cuisine from a particular part of the country is not sourced from a restaurant or hotel, but is home-cooked.A sitting SC judge hosts the weekly common lunch. The dishes are part of the host judges home state, prepared at his residence.A minimum of five food items have to be served in the main course and paan  as per each judges choice  is a must to end the lunch. Sources said judges sometimes call cooks from their native place to prepare dishes with the right local flavour.On other working days judges eat lunch in their own chambers.This Wednesday the judges tucked into home-made traditional food from Madhya Pradesh that was cooked at Justice Arun Misras residence. Pumpkin soup, bharvan bhindi and baingan, malai-kofta and paneer lababdar were on the menu. More than the main course, the dessert was much appreciated. The roasted kheer, pineapple kesar halwa and maalpua were just to die for, a judge told HT.Last week Justice RK Agrawal from Uttar Pradesh was the host. Dry green peas, kadhai paneer and dum aloo flavoured with local spices were laid out at lunch time.THE JUSTICES ARE SERVED In a charming tradition, Supreme Court judges meet for lunch every week, with each of them taking turns to bring ghar ka khana from his or her home state 1 Jagdish Singh Khehar 2 Adarsh Kumar Goel 3 Deepak Gupta 4 N.V. Ramana 5 Abhay Manohar Sapre 6 Kurian Joseph He brought dishes from Kerala such as spicy mushroom laced with gravy, kappa (tapioca), parboiled rice, papad, neatly chopped pineapples and the unusually long ripe bananas found in the state 7 Navin Sinha 8 Madan Bhimarao Lokur 9 Arun Mishra 10 Prafulla Chandra Pant He brought dishes from Kerala such as spicy mushroom laced with gravy, kappa (tapioca), parboiled rice, papad, neatly chopped pineapples and the unusually long ripe bananas found in the state 11 Ranjan Gogoi 12 Sharad Arvind Bobde Recently, he treated his fellow judges to sambhar wadi with mircha ka thecha, patal bhazi and arhar ki daal cooked in Maharashtrian style. Puran poli (a special dal-stuffed chapatti) with ghee was the high point of the meal 13 S. Abdul Nazeer 14 R.K. Agrawal 15 Ashok Bhushan 16 Uday Umesh Lalit 17 L. Nageswara Rao 18 Mohan M. Shantanagoudar 19 Pinaki Chandra Ghose Recently, he treated his fellow judges to sambhar wadi with mircha ka thecha, patal bhazi and arhar ki daal cooked in Maharashtrian style. Puran poli (a special dal-stuffed chapatti) with ghee was the high point of the meal 20 R.F. Nariman 21 Sanjay Kishan Kaul 22 R. Banumathi 23 Amitava Roy 24 A.M. Khanwilkar 25 Dipak Misra 26 D.Y. Chandrachud 27 Arjan Kumar Sikri brought Rajasthani delicacies when it was his turn: bajre ki roti, bajre ki kichidi, dal bati churma and Rajasthani kadi 28 Jasti Chelameswar He treated the judges to spicy sambar, rasam, idli, dosa, salt pongal, avakkai (mango pickle) and gongura (sorrel leaf) pachadi brought Rajasthani delicacies when it was his turn: bajre ki roti, bajre ki kichidi, dal bati churma and Rajasthani kadiHe treated the judges to spicy sambar, rasam, idli, dosa, salt pongal, avakkai (mango pickle) and gongura (sorrel leaf) pachadi ILLUSTRATION: SUDHIR SHETTY | DESIGN BY: HITESH MATHUR Court judges meet for lunch every week, with each of them taking turns to bring ghar ka khana from his or her home stateThe week before that Justice SA Bobde from Maharashtra treated his fellow judges to sambhar wadi with mircha ka thecha, patal bhazi and arhar ki daal cooked Maharashtrian style. Puran poli (a special dal-stuffed chapatti) with ghee was the delicacy that afternoon.And before that the judges had Rajasthani delicacies from Justice AK Sikris kitchen - bajre ki roti, bajre ki kichidi, dal bati churma and Rajasthani kadi.Vegetables from Justice Kurien Josephs own kitchen garden were used to cook traditional dishes from Kerala such as spicy mushroom laced with gravy, kappa (tapioca), parboiled rice, papad, followed by neatly chopped pineapples. The unusually long ripe bananas from the state were served after the meal.Justice J Chelameswar, who stirred a controversy with his decision to skip collegium meetings, too was a good host when it was his turn. His lunch treat of spicy sambar, rasam, idli, dosa, salt pongal, avakkai (mango pickle) and gongura (sorrel leaf) pachadi left the judges licking their fingers.An unwritten rule is strictly followed at these lunches  only vegetarian cuisine is served to respect the sentiments of those who do not eat non-vegetarian food. The host is selected according to the judges seniority.Justice AK Patnaik, who retired in June 2014, fondly remembers how the then Chief Justice Altamas Kabir had added a new rule not to convert the lunch into a competition between judges. He introduced a penalty for those who exceeded the number of dishes fixed by him, Justice Patnaik recalls.Behind every successful meal is a judges wife, a senior judge told HT. But not for Justice R Banumathi  the lone woman judge  who would have to supervise the lunch herself when her turn comes.The Wednesday lunch not only gives judges an opportunity to taste a variety of Indian cuisines, but also shows their bonhomie. Work is never discussed and judges leave their differences at the door. Food is the only topic of discussion with some of the judges boasting about their local cuisines.A senior judge is appointed as the marshall and he penalises any judge who breaks the rules. At present Justice Bobde is the marshall. An argument with the marshall can aggravate the penalty.A marshall is like a class monitor to whom a complaint is made if a judge is seen breaching the rules. He is also the one who announces the end of the dinner that follows a standing ovation for the host judge, a sitting judge told HT on condition of anonymity.Retired judge Justice Kuldeep Singh who suggested the idea of the weekly lunches in the early Nineties gets nostalgic when asked about what triggered the idea. Justice Ranganath Misra was the Chief Justice then and he agreed for the weekly lunch so that we could all get together. It gave a personal touch and became an exciting event which everyone looked forward to, Justice Singh said.It was an opportunity to unwind and relax over food. Therefore, the rule that work should never be discussed. When we left our gowns in the chambers, we also left our work behind. I always looked forward to meals from south, Justice Singh recollects.Justice GS Singvhi who retired three years ago also has fond memories to share. Those were the only moments when we never discussed work. The lunch ensured that we brushed up our knowledge related to food cooked in our houses he told HT.Nor can he forget the south Indian dishes he had at these lunches. Home-made paisam (dessert), rasam and brown rice of Kerala were my favourites. I never eat sweets due to my sugar problem, but I could not resist the home-made paisam served by a brother judge from the south, he says.Yes, it was difficult for judges to avoid home-cooked preparations, despite health issues. When it was my turn I got two types of dessert ready, which included a sugar-free dessert. To my surprise nobody touched the sugar-free sweet and I always thought that judges were too old, muses Justice Patnaik who enjoyed the variety of chutneys his brother judge from the South got for lunch.A judge recollects how Justice Aftab Alam in his farewell speech on April 18, 2013 described the Wednesday lunch as a congregation of mini India. He said the one thing he would miss post retirement would be the weekly lunch, the judge recalls.Former Chief Justice of India RM Lodha holds a similar view. The Supreme Court is a mini India. You have judges from all over the country. The lunch used to a gastronomical delight of regional cuisine, he told HT.Justice Lodha had served dal-bati when it was his turn to host the lunch. It was soaked in ghee and I remember that after the lunch session all the judges felt so sleepy. Justice Singhvi, who also got dal-bati, says his preparation was different from Justice Lodhas family recipe. Dal-bati is cooked differently in the Jodhpur region and in the Jaipur region of Rajasthan. That is the beauty of Indian food, he explains.The lunch is laid out on a large rectangular table presided by the CJI. The host sits on his right and gives a brief introduction about the dishes. The rest sit wherever they like.However, the seating arrangement keeps changing. During former CJI HL Dattus tenure, the judges used to sit around circular tables and places were decided as per the lucky draw. A judge recollects how the present CJI JS Khehar ended up sitting next to Justice Dattu thrice. And when the former CJI asked him what conspiracy he was up to, CJI Khehar said it was the lucky draws fault!"
593adecf7be9e00e1ecd32b6,Import impact small on sugar prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170417/jsp/business/story_146711.jsp,2017-04-17,"Calcutta, April 16: Sugar prices are expected to remain firm at around Rs 37-40 per kg in sugar season 2017-18. Despite the government's decision to allow duty free import of raw sugar up to 0.5 million tonnes, lower inventory because of a fall in production is expected to keep prices range bound, according to mills and market analysts. The Indian Sugar Mills Association (Isma) has lowered its production estimate to 203 lakh tonnes from 213 lakh tonnes as sugarcane yield in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh in January and February was lower than expected. ""Sugar prices are expected to remain firm in sugar season 2017 because closing inventory is seen to be at an eight-year low following a fall in production in Maharashtra and Karnataka. That's despite the government's recent move to allow duty-free import of raw sugar of 0.45 million tonnes till June 12, 2017, and a fall in consumption because of demonetisation,"" research firm Crisil said in a report. Crisil, however, added that the government's policy on imports would remain ""a key monitorable"" in the coming months. With high cash accruals (because of stable prices) and no proposed greenfield expansion, Crisil also expects the debt burden of the mills to ease. ""According to Isma and Icra estimates, mills are likely to produce 203 lakh tonnes in sugar season 2016-17, 19 per cent lower than last year's 251 lakh tonnes. Moreover, mills have stopped crushing early this year because of insufficient availability of sugarcane in Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We expect the prices to remain firm in the coming months because of a deficient production forecast and diminishing stocks in the domestic market,"" said Ritesh Kumar Sahu, analyst (agri commodities) at Angel Broking. ""Domestic prices are likely to reign at Rs 37-40 per kg. If the import duty is scrapped, this will fall to Rs 29-30 per kg,"" said India Ratings and Research. There is a 40 per cent duty on sugar imports in India. The research firm also expects northern millers to perform better with profitability 15-20 per cent higher than units in the south and west. According to Isma data, sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is 9 lakh tonnes more than what it was last year. Isma, however, expects sugarcane availability to improve next year in Maharashtra and mills in the west and south are likely to start crushing cane in the first half of October 2017. ""With Diwali now being earlier on October 19, 2017, the mills in north India will also start crushing by the latter part of October. Hence, sugar from the new season will be available in the market by the end of October,"" said Isma."

Gandhi's political pilgrimage to Champaran, the Bihar government has organized a week-long celebration from April 10 to 17. This will be followed by other functions throughout the year. It was two years after Gandhi touched down on Indian shores - January 9, 1915 - following over 20 years of stay in South Africa, that he decided to explore the rural interiors of India. As the British had adopted a strategy of deception to conquer India after over a century-long campaign involving several small battles and skirmishes, Gandhi opted for the weapon of peaceful satyagraha to beat them back. Thirty-two years later, when the truth finally prevailed, instead of celebrating Independence in Delhi, he was in Noakhali (now in Bangladesh) fighting communal strife, the by-product of British rule. It was in South Africa that Gandhi witnessed first-hand the sufferings of indentured labourers, many of whom were from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. He campaigned against this practice of bonded servitude, which had started after the abolition of slavery in England in 1834. Surprisingly, it was in 1917 that the system of indentured labour was abolished officially. The peasants of Champaran, forced by European planters to grow indigo, provided Gandhi with the best possible launching pad for his struggle. The region was among the least industrialized. Cultivators were compelled to grow indigo for cotton mills that were owned by the British. A year later, Gandhi was in Ahmedabad and then in Kheda to fight for the cause of mill workers and farmers, respectively, in his home state of Gujarat. Common strands A century later, Champaran continues to be largely agrarian and the least industrialized part of Bihar. Some sugar mills did come up in the district - later divided into East and West Champaran - in the name of industries. Now they are facing closure. Most goods from Nepal enter through Raxaul, a border town in East Champaran, after passing through Bengal, Jharkhand and Bihar as Calcutta serves as the transit port for the Himalyan republic. Champaran is known for smuggling as well as cross-border Maoist activities. Champaran is also the birthplace of the English novelist, Eric Arthur Blair, famously known as George Orwell. He was born in Motihari in 1903, and his father was a narcotics officer employed with the British civil service. Champaran has hardly any 'animal farm'- a satire written by Orwell - even though it has the Valmikinagar forest reserve. By '1984'- another book by Orwell - the largely flood-prone riverine belt had become a hotbed of robbery and kidnapping. Several years later, the then West Champaran superintendent of police, Abhayanand,who went on to become the DGP of Bihar, played a key role in crushing these problems. A hundred years later Gandhi's janmabhoomi - Gujarat - and his first karmabhoomi in India - Bihar - have one thing in common: prohibition. Gujarat imposed prohibition a long time back while Bihar was declared a dry state by the present chief minister, Nitish Kumar, in April 2016. Motihari, the district headquarters of East Champaran, can boast of a Central university named after the Mahatma. Even though it came up during the reign of the United Progressive Alliance, it is yet to function as a full-fledged institution. Incidentally, Gandhi, who was born in the western coast, and graduated from the political nurseries of Champaran, Ahmedabad, Kheda and Dandi, among other places, died in Delhi. For millions of lesser mortals across India, he is still their loving Bapu, and not an Orwellian Big Brother."

The cabinet also gave its nod to rename Agra and Gorakhpur airports to Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Guru Gorakshnath airport respectively.The State cabinet also decided to allocate land for the Centres project to open around 20 Agriculture Scientific Research Centres across the State.While the name of the department for physically challenged people was changed from Viklang Jan Vikas Vibhag to Divyang Jan Vikas department, the cabinet also decided to make the film on the life of Rajmata Vijaya Raje Scindia called 'Ek rani thi aisi bhi', tax-free.Speaking to media persons after the cabinet meeting that lasted less than an hour as compared to the previous two meetings which lasted over two hours, the State governments official spokesman and power minister Shrikant Sharma said that the government had completed one month in office and proved that it was a pro-farmer dispensation.Elaborating on removing sugar cane from the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna, he said it was done as sugarcane is a cash crop. It was included in the scheme by the Akhilesh-led Uttar Pradesh government and was objected to by the Modi-led government at the Centre.So we decided to remove it from the scheme, he said.Spelling out further details of the crop insurance policy, Shrikant Sharma said that the State would be divided into 12 clusters.

He said, ""I will ensure that payments pending from sugar mills reach you very soon. One hundred per cent of the payment will be made by sugar mills soon. I will follow up on this. There will be no injustice done to you anymore. Farmers have suffered for a long time and I will ensure that it doesn't happen anymore,"" he told farmers in Thanabhawan, which is also Rana's constituency. Cane farmers in western UP have for long been complaining about delayed payments from sugar mills. The sugar mills owe farmers over Rs 4,000 crore for the current season, which began in November.The BJP had in its election manifesto said once it came to power in UP, it would ensure that sugar mills make payments to farmers within 14 days and clear all previous dues.Rana assured farmers that they would not be made to suffer any longer and that he would ensure that their dues are paid on time.However, not all farmers are convinced. Sheeshpal Rathi , a farmer in Thanabhawan, said, ""Assurances have been given multiple times in the past as well. It has been over a month since BJP has been in power. There has been no improvement in the status of payments from sugar mills. Sugar mills continue to delay payments and farmers continue to suffer. They do not have t enough money to buy food and eat. All politicians do is to make assurances. They are rarely kept,"" he said."

(Source: Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Farmers with 20-ft tall sugarcane stalks of Co 0238 variety at a field in Bijnor, UP. (Source: Express Photo by Oinam Anand)The story of sugar in the 2016-17 season (October-September) has been about two underestimations. The first has had to do with Maharashtra  not adequately factoring in the impact of the 2015 drought on cane availability for the new season. The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), on September 28, projected the states sugar output for 2016-17 at 62.7 lakh tonnes (lt). Actual production turned out to be just 41.87 lt, a steep drop over the 84.15 lt and 105.14 lt for the preceding two seasons, and the lowest since the 22.33 lt of 2004-05.The second underestimation has been with regard to Uttar Pradesh (UP), although here it has worked in the reverse. ISMAs September 28 advance estimates had pegged sugar production this season at 76.60 lt, up from 68.55 lt in 2015-16. But as on April 18, mills in UP had already produced 85.27 lt. With 52 out of the 116 factories still running, the final output could touch 88 lt  an all-time-high, surpassing the previous 2006-07 record of 84.75 lt.Significantly, the above production achievement hasnt come due to any increase in sugarcane area. UPs total area under cane in 2016-17 has, in fact, fallen by almost a quarter compared to 2006-07. Nor has crushing gone up. Mills had till April 18 crushed 805.33 lt of cane and may end up doing about 830 lt. But that would be well below the 894.94 lt crushed in 2006-07.The higher output by mills is only because of average sugar-to-cane recovery going up, from 9.47 per cent in 2006-07 to a likely 10.6 per cent in the current season. That, in turn, owes itself to Co 0238, a cane variety which gives both higher yields to farmers and also more sugar from every tonne crushed by mills.From practically zero till 2012-13, Co 0238 is estimated to have covered 7.29 lakh hectares (lh) or 35.5 per cent of UPs total cane area this season. Given the higher yields from this variety, its share in overall production and cane crushed by mills will probably exceed 50 per cent, reckons Vipin Kumar Dwivedi, sugarcane development and sugar industry commissioner of UP.My yields were earlier 45 quintals or so per bigha (66 tonnes/hectare). With Co 0238, it is now 55 quintals (80 tonnes/hectare), says Jitender Hooda, who grows cane in six out of his eight-acre holding at Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district/tehsil. Co 0238 is also the main reason for UPs average cane yields rising from hardly 60 tonnes per hectare till only four years ago to 66.5 tonnes in 2015-16. Since Co 0238s share in total area was only 19.6 per cent last season, I expect the average to cross 70 tonnes per hectare in 2016-17, notes Bakshi Ram, director of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute at Coimbatore and breeder of the blockbuster variety.For mills, the biggest draw of Co 0238 is its early-maturity character, defined in terms of sucrose accumulation. This happens faster and reaches optimal levels in Co 0238 at least a month earlier than for normal general cane varieties. Mills are, then, able to get high sugar recoveries right from the start of crushing and all through the season. That alone explains the sharp jump in average sugar recovery in UP, from 9.25-9.5 per cent to 10.6 per cent over the last two years.A one percentage point recovery jump translates into 8.3 lt of extra sugar on the 830 lt of cane that UP mills would be crushing this season. At an average realisation of Rs 36 per kg, it works out to nearly Rs 3,000 crore of additional revenue. In the current season, as many as 27 out of the states 116 mills have recorded average recovery of over 11 per cent. That includes the Bundki (12.31 per cent) and Bahadarpur (12.07 per cent) factories of Dwarikesh Sugar Industries, followed by Balrampur Chini Mills Kumbhi (11.94 per cent), Uttam Sugar Mills Barkatpur (11.91 per cent) and UP Cooperative Sugar Factories Federations Sneh Road (11.87 per cent) units. Four out of these top five are in Bijnor district and one (Kumbhi) in Lakhimpur Kheri.The benefits to farmers via higher cane yields  an average increase of 10 tonnes means extra income of Rs 31,500 per hectare at the state advised price (SAP) of Rs 315 per quintal for early-maturing varieties  have, however, been partly offset by delayed payments from mills. During this sugar season, mills have until now bought Rs 24,717.74 crore worth of cane at the SAP. Out of this, Rs 23,521.10 crore should have been paid not later than 14 days after cane delivery, as per the UP Sugarcane (Regulation of Supply and Purchase) Act, 1953. But mills have actually paid only Rs 19,258.47 crore, corresponding to Rs 4,262.63 crore of arrears.The ruling BJP, in its UP election manifesto, had promised to ensure farmers received full payment for their cane within 14 days of sale, as provided in the 1953 Act. However, cane arrears, which were around Rs 4,175 crore when the Yogi Adityanath government took over on March 19, have shown no decrease. Much of the current arrears are courtesy a few groups  mainly Bajaj Hindusthan (Rs 2,355.49 crore), U.K. Modi (Rs 412.23 crore), Simbhaoli Sugars (Rs 390.92 crore), Mawana Sugars (Rs 303.25 crore) and Uttam Sugar (Rs 110.44 crore).We have given a deadline of April 23 for all mills to clear their pending dues to growers. Once that ends, a review meeting will be held and we will take appropriate action against the defaulters, UPs sugarcane development and sugar industry minister Suresh Rana told The Indian Express.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

This year, the sugar cane crushing was particularly low due the drought last year and the sugar factories shut down much earlier than usual.On April 5, the Union government took the decision to import five lakh tonne raw sugar to keep a check on the prices in domestic market. The decision changed the sentiments in the domestic market and traders stopped purchasing sugar from Kolhapur. In the meantime, the bummer production in Uttar Pradesh has led to a decline in demand from northern states.Sugar expert P G Medhe told TOI the government's decision to import sugar has changed the sentiments in market. Moreover, the transportation cost to send sugar to Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh has gone up.""The sugar from UP is available at lower rate for these states than us. Therefore, the overall demand has decreased. The sugar mills have taken loans to recover operational expenses,"" he said.Medhe, who is also the honorary adviser at Chhatrapati Rajaram cooperative sugar factory, said ""The factories have already suffered this year owing to low yield of sugar cane. If the prices of sugar go below the Rs 3,400 per quintal, then it would become difficult to repay the loan. The government should adopt measures to keep the prices stable.""City based sugar trader Atul Shaha said, ""The decision to import raw sugar has slowed down the purchase from Kolhapur sugar factories.

Over the years, the cultivation of the water-guzzling crop has come down from 7,000 hectares (ha) to less than 2,000 ha. It is now on the verge of extinction.After closure of the sugar mill, Nayagarh Sugar Complex, in 2014, the farmers of the district have almost stopped the cultivation of sugarcane and switched over to other cash crops. Sources said in order to boost sugarcane cultivation, a sugar factory was established at Panipoila here when J B Patnaik was the CM in 1987.Hundreds of farmers were registered as shareholders and also benefited. As the Cooperation department failed to run it profitably, Nayagarh Sugar Complex was sold for a measly Rs 5.22 crore to a private party in 2004.After running successfully for a few years, the mill faced labour problems and the company officials were forced to shut it down in 2014. A farmer leader said now cane is being cultivated only in Sajanapada, Champatipur and Butadi under Nayagarh block and Bodasha and Anlamada in Khandapada block. Farmers in Kantabania village, who were making a fast buck from sugarcane crop, have migrated to other States for their livelihood, he added.Sources said the climate and soil of Nayagarh being conducive to sugarcane crop, farmers used to cultivate it in large tracts of land and prepare jaggery from it in traditional method. Traders from different parts of the State and outside flocked to Nayagarh to take truckloads of gur and molasses in earthen pots. Sugarcane in Nayagarh has more sucrose (sweetness) percentage than those from Uttar Pradesh, experts say."

(Express Photo: Tashi Tobgyal)The National Green Tribunal has slapped an environment compensation (EC) of Rs 25 lakh on one of the countrys largest sugar firms for extracting groundwater without permission and polluting the environment in Uttar Pradesh.The green panel has held that two units of Balrampur Chini Mills in Balrampur and Babhnan and Manakpur Chini Mills in Gonda districts of UP and Rauzagaon Chini Mills in Barabanki were discharging large quantity of waste water into the Ganga through the rivers Rapti and Ghaghra and withdrawing groundwater without obtaining permission from the Central Ground Water Authority.Balrampur Chini Mills is considered to be the second largest sugar mill in the country.Invoking the polluter pays principle, the NGT said these units were liable to pay Rs 5 lakh each as EC for polluting the environment, committing breach of the terms and conditions of the consent orders and failing to install appropriate anti-pollution devices.In environmental law, the polluter pays principle was enacted to make the party responsible for pollution responsible for paying for the damage done to the natural environment.A bench headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar also directed Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board and Central Pollution Control Board to jointly inspect all these industries and submit a detailed and comprehensive report within six weeks.An additional environment compensation of Rs 5 lakh was imposed on Manakpur Chini Mills for causing death of animals and birds through the release of ammonia gas and polluting the environment.The judgement was delivered on a plea by an environment activist who had alleged that these industries were illegally extracting groundwater and operating their distilleries which were discharging effluents without treatment in the nearby rivers.The petitioner had sought a comprehensive study with regard to the impact of water and air pollution caused by the respondents and a detailed study with regard to lowering of the groundwater table in the area.Balrampur Chini Mills has 11 sugar factories in Uttar Pradesh, having an aggregate crushing capacity of 79,000 tonnes of sugarcane per day.

For farmers, burning the remnants from the previous crop is an easy and cheap option while preparing the fields to plant wheat, rice, pulses and sugarcane. With no alternatives to offer, authorities had mostly failed to convince them from stopping the age-old practice.The states have now sought subsidies from the Centre to procure machinery to gather crop remnants, as well as financial support to incentivise farmers to adopt modern residue management systems.Officials have also vowed to create awareness among farmers and enforce rules that prevent open burning of farm waste.Stubble burning is a big challenge that we can overcome, by using it for cattle fodder, incorporate it in soil and compost it or use it as fuel in industrial units, said Jasbir Singh Bains, director at Punjabs agriculture department.We have sought an assistance of Rs 1,600 crore from the Centre to buy machineries for farmers. Also, we have requested for Rs 350 crore to compensate farmers whose cost of cultivation increases in case of manual stubble harvest and another Rs 500 crore for diversification of crops. Punjab will also focus on strict enforcement of rules.The states pollution control board will take action against farmers who dont follow rules against burning of waste. The penalty will be Rs 2,500 for two acres of land, Bains said. The transport department will not register new Combine harvesters  which harvest both wheat and rice  till it has an attachment of super straw management system to uniformly keep the loose straw, he added.In Punjab, more than half of the 37 million tonnes of the rice and wheat residues it produces every year are burnt, according to the agriculture ministry. In Uttar Pradesh, the agriculture department is preparing a proposal seeking enhanced subsidy to procure machines that will help reduce farm wastes. We will submit our proposal to the Centre by first week of May, said AK Bihnoi, director at the states agriculture department.With a limited window between harvesting and planting of crops, open field burning of rice, pulses, sugarcane and wheat stubble was the norm, but it is changing because of increasing awareness about pollution, he said. Haryana, too, is seeking similar subsidies.Collectively, various departments are working to ensure that farmers do not burn stubble. We will have to incentivise farmers for adoption of various residue management operations, said Suresh Gahlawat, additional director of Haryanas agriculture department. Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade analyst based in Chandigarh, doesnt see any need for a central subsidy for such steps.The only solution is that combine harvester manufacturers should make farm machines which enable chopping the plant stem from the base, and bundle the straw like a bailer does,"" he said."

Karnataka is followed by Tamil Nadu (67%) and Andhra Pradesh (63%).Without exception, all the sample households mentioned non-institutional loan as one cause of farmers suicide. The overall indication was that the pressure exerted by non-institutional lenders was more than that by institutional ones, says the study, conducted by the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru.The study was commissioned by the Agriculture Ministry, which shared the report with the Supreme Court in connection with a public interest litigation on farmer suicides that the court was hearing.The survey team interviewed members of 528 victim households  farming families where one member committed suicide  spread across 388 villages in 13 states, including Karnataka. Besides indebtedness, it identified several farming and social causes too behind the rising trend of suicide among farmers.According to the National Crime Records Bureau, 12,602 people involved in farming sector (farmers and agriculture labourers combined) committed suicide in 2015, accounting for 9.4% of total suicide victims (1,33,623). The numbers are on the rise for the last three years.State-wise, the maximum number of suicides was reported in Maharashtra (4,291) followed by Karnataka (1,569); Telangana (1,400), Madhya Pradesh (1,290), Chhattisgarh (954), Andhra Pradesh (916) and Tamil Nadu (606) in 2015, accounting for 87% of all farmers suicide in India.Inability to get farm credit and crop failure are also among the drivers pushing a hapless farmer towards suicide.Expectation of loan waiver as one of the causes for suicide was the maximum in Kerala (89%) followed by Karnataka (66%) and Tamil Nadu (57%). Failure of rainfall was a cause for suicide in all states except Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.There are also social causes like drug abuse, alcoholism, extra-marital affair and fear of declining social status.However, the numbers in these categories are far less than farming and indebtedness causes.With the apex court hearing the PIL, the agriculture ministry last month reviewed the measures that the centre and state governments have taken to prevent farmers suicide.In the review meeting, Karnataka officials pointed out that farmers suicide was on a high for the fourth consecutive year because of drought and failure of sugarcane crop."

These transactions took place during 2010 and 2011.Taking note of certain observations made by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) regarding the sale in an audit report for the 2010-11 period, the Commission suo-motu began looking into the matter to ascertain, whether there have been any bid-rigging.The latest ruling of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has come more than four years after it ordered a detailed probe into the matter. The investigation was ordered in 2013.In an audit report, the CAG had observed that in the bidding by firms for the sugar mills of UPSSCL and UPRCGVNL (Uttar Pradesh Rajya Chini Evam Ganna Vikas Nigam Ltd), there was lack of competitive process and the bidders were engaged in the bid-rigging activities.Such activities violate provisions in the Competition Act.While ten operational mills of UPSSCL were sold during 2010, eleven closed mills of UPRCGVNL were sold in 2011.Wave Industries, PBS Foods, Indian Potash, Nilgiri Food Product, Trikal Food and Agro, Giriasho Company, Namrata Marketing and SR Buildcon had participated in the bidding.CCI said that given the tender conditions and the methodology adopted for inviting bids for the sale of sugar mills, it was open for any bidder who satisfied the eligibility criteria.The Director General (DG) has found no evidence of collusion or coercion which prevented the potential bidders from participating, it said in an order dated May 4.Cases where the regulator finds prima-facie evidence of competition norms violations are referred to its investigation arm DG for detailed probes.On the basis of facts and evidence in the case, no conclusion of contravention of the Competition Act can be drawn against the participating bidders in the sale of ten operational mills of UPSSCL, according to CCI.""The fact that there is no evidence of collusion or coercion to show that several potential bidders were prevented from participating in the bidding process for the sale of closed mills rules out possibility of premeditation of outcome by the participating bidders and hence collusion by them,"" CCI said with respect to eleven closed mills of UPRCGVNL.The bidders had raised issues relating to applicability of Section 3 on the sale of sugar mills, thereby, challenging the jurisdiction of the CCI in the case.The regulator opined that in absence of a finding of collusion/bid rigging in the case, there remains ""no immediate requirement"" to deal with the jurisdiction issue.However, in a supplementary note, CCI member Augustine Peter said the regulator has jurisdiction to entertain the case.

""Some people have been spoilt over the last 12-15 years, and their habits will not change in a day.They are still trying to do mischief in some areas. ""I want to warn them again that they should mend their ways or be ready to face the consequences. We will not let any farmer, labourer, trader or daughter suffer,"" he said addressing a gathering after distributing wheelchairs to the physically challenged at village Ratupura.He claimed that the crime rate has come down after his government took charge and the situation will improve further in coming days. He said those violating the law will not be spared, regardless of their political affiliation. ""Law and order in the state has improved but at some places opposition parties are trying to create 'arajakata' (anarchy). Party workers should expose and thwart such attempts,"" Adityanath said in Bareilly while addressing party workers. ""Our main priority is to establish rule of law in the state. I want to assure the people of the state that if someone tries to take the law into their hands, the government and the administration will deal with them firmly,"" he said.The CM said his government had cracked down on the anti- social elements, and cited the anti-Romeo squads against eveteasing and shutting down of illegal slaughterhouses. ""Every person in the state is feeling safe .... Criminals should leave the state or be ready to go to jail,"" said Adityanath. The CM said he was visiting every division to take stock of the law and order situation and development work there. Citing his government's achievement, he said while sugarcane farmers have got their dues, power supply in the state has improved. There is an 18-hour electricity supply in rural areas and a 24-hour supply in urban areas, he said.The CM said that the situation can improve further in villages if illegal connections are checked. Adityanath said that empowerment of the disabled and the poor was among the top priorities of his government. He also held a meeting of divisional officers at circuit house in Moradabad before leaving for Bareilly, where he reviewed the law and order situation. The CM directed the officials not to spare the guilty and also ""not to harass the innocent"".A group of Dalits gathered outside the meeting venue in Moradabd with black flags to protest the violence in Saharanpur. Recent incidents like caste clash in Saharanpur and communal violence in Bulandshahr, Sambhal and Gonda have led to criticism by Samajwadi Party, BSP and Congress of ruling BJP which came to power in UP on the plank of improving law and order. ""This government has clearly failed to fulfil its foremost constitutional duty of providing peaceful and secure life to the people,"" BSP chief Mayawati said yesterday. ""There has been continued attack on traders who are considered the vote base of the BJP and they are observing bandhs... Saharanpur and Mathura incidents have exposed the reality of the tall claims made by the Yogi Adityanath-led government... protests against electricity woes have become common,"" she had claimed. While clashes between Thakurs and Dalits had rocked Saharanpur, two jewellers were shot dead in Mathura.The chief minister, while meeting party workers in Bareilly, said they should highlight the work of Narendra Modi government and actively participate in ""mera ghar, BJP ka ghar"" campaign as a better connect with the people will help in ""exposing criminal elements"". He said that planning for district development will be done with the help of representatives of district BJP units. He also sought names from local BJP organisation for district planning committee."
59284e697be9e0137c77cb3a,GST: Impact on key sectors,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/612889/gst-impact-key-sectors.html,2017-05-21,"Mahesh Kulkarni May 22 2017, 0:11 ISTFixing rates for six sensitive items will be top priority for the GST Council, which is slated to meet in New Delhi on June 3, just 27 just days beforThe two-day brainstorming session of the GST Council completed its task more or less on May 18 and 19 at Srinagar, with the announcement of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) rates on 1,200 goods and 500 services. The Council has arrived at 18% tax rate as a standard rate on majority of the goods and services. However, there are still some politically sensitive items like bidis, gold, textiles, footwear and agriculture implements, among others, for which the rates will be finalised in the next meet of the GST Council in June. Fixing of rates on lottery service is also yet to be finalised.This leaves the government with a little over 40 days to officially implement the GST effective from July 1, 2017. We are in a state of readiness for July 1 rollout, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said after the meeting.But before getting into the nuances of the implications for various sectors, there are four broad things that one must understand about the intent of the GST.The core intent of the GST rates was to ensure that the GST implementation is not inflationary, as has been the experience with some other countries. As a result, the GST Council has made an attempt to keep the GST on sensitive food items in the range of 0-5% and transport at 5%.According to Vaibhav Agrawal, Head of Research and ARQ, Angel Broking, GST cannot be purely looked as a tax rate, but one should look at the simplicity that it brings in business and trade. GST makes the entire country as a single homogenous market. Take the case of multiplexes, even though the impost under GST may be higher, the fact that a plethora of state and local levies are getting subsumed, which makes it much simpler.There is an issue of credit on tax paid on inputs, which was not available in many cases in the past. However, under GST, the input credit in such cases will be automatic and seamless. That will reduce the effective rate of GST in most cases, he said.What the GST rates mean for key sectors in India:With the government focus on keeping tax on items of mass consumption low, this sector could be the clear winner. While milk, grain and cereals are exempt from GST; other products like sugar, tea, coffee and edible oil will attract just 5% GST. This will benefit companies like Nestle. While personal care items will be taxed at the peak rate of 28%, items of mass consumption like hair oils, soaps and toothpaste will be taxed at 18%. This will be beneficial for companies like Marico, Dabur and Colgate. Overall, the food side of the FMCG business is likely to benefit from the GST.Auto could slightly be a mixed bag as the impost will vary across categories. With the standardisation of GST for automobiles at 28%, two-wheelers and small and medium cars may face a higher impost. While this may be slightly negative for players like Bajaj Auto, Hero MotoCorp, Maruti, etc, we believe that this will be passed on to consumers, Angel Broking said. Among the commercial vehicles space, Ashok Leyland may see higher GST.The GST Council has put items like refrigerators and ACs in the maximum 28% category. This will lead to a higher impost on these companies, and could impact companies like Voltas and Havells. However, with robust summer demand, they should be able to pass on these costs to the consumer. These companies will also benefit fundamentally as GST will bring more companies under the organised ambit and reduce unfair competition from unorganised players.For cement manufacturers, the peak rate of tax may go up slightly under the GST regime. However, there is an additional benefit for them as the GST on coal and metal ore has been cut to 5%. For cement companies, this will largely offset the higher GST impact. At the same time, steel and power companies that depend heavily on coal will also benefit from the lower GST on coal. JSW and Tata Steel may be the key beneficiaries.These companies may be slightly unhappy that they have been bracketed in the highest category along with gambling and betting activities. That almost looks akin to imposing a Sin Tax on movies. However, multiplexes will benefit from subsuming of a plethora of state and local taxes into one single tax and also from input credits. PVR and Cinemax may find the GST rates neutral at best.Grandfathering of current exemptions for services (including healthcare & education) leaves limited anomaly on the taxability services and the Council has clarified that no additions shall be made to the exemption list, Amit Sarkar, Partner & Head, Indirect Tax, BDO India, said.Unlike the current regime where service tax is imposed at a flat rate of 15% across all services, the GST will have four slabs of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28% exactly like the GST on goods. For example, the GST on telecom will be 18%, higher by 3% from current levels. However, the availability of input credit will partially neutralise this impact. However, making transport service GST at 5% will be anti-inflationary. The GST will be just 5% on economy flying, which will help airlines like Spice Jet and IndiGo give a bigger push to the Udaan programme.A rate of 18% for telecom and financial services may appear higher against the current service tax rate of 15%; however, these sectors are likely to derive substantial benefits on the input credit front, given the eligibility of credit on the goods which was not the case under the current regime.Overall positive impact for restaurants having less than Rs 50 lakh turnover, and non-AC restaurants, given that they shall be taxed at 5% and 12%, respectively, with full input tax credit as against the current tax incidence of approximately 19-20% [VAT + ST] for AC restaurants. It is noteworthy that restaurants having less than Rs 50 lakh of turnover may also opt for the composition scheme, subject to the conditions prescribed.With respect to works contract service, though the 12% rate with full input tax credit could be an overall boom for a civil contractor as against the current taxes at 6% (central) and 1-5% (state), it may still lead to potential disputes regarding movability and the applicable rates thereon [works contract vs composite supplies].The impact of GST has been a mixed bag for the Capital Goods and the consumer sector. While the Capital Goods sector would benefit from a lower tax rate on contracts, there would be higher tax incidence on cables and transformers, Motilal Oswal Securities said in its report.A few segments in the consumer sector would see higher effective taxes and need to take price hikes to offset cost pressures from increased taxes. Key changes/surprises vs expectations were for a) Fans, which were expected to come in the 18% bracket, but have been bought at 28% (currently at 24%) and need price hikes, b)Air-conditioners, which have been put in the 28% bracket and would need 2-3% hikes, c) Transformers put in the 28% GST rate vs the current 18% implies price hikes need to be taken, d) Cables, which were earlier in the 18% bracket taken to 28%, and e) Work contract, which is in the 15-20% range (depending on the VAT rate) taken to 12% is a positive for the construction sector (L&T, BHEL).Under the new tax regime, industry stabilisation will take a couple of quarters. However, the benefits of GST on business practices and company strategies will be seen only in the medium term (1-3 years). The extent of business efficiency is estimated to be higher in goods as compared with services. At present, supply chains across major manufacturing industries are strategised, based on tax arbitrage aspect, CRISIL Research said.Seamless tax treatment under GST will eliminate the need of multiple warehouses across states.Broadly, the GST rates are likely to be neutral to positive for the Indian markets overall. Of course, the fine print will give much greater clarity on this subject.Effects:All tax payersWith need for registration and filing of returns in multiple states, compliance costs are likely to go up. Overall tax compliance, too, is expected to go up. This will also impact some of the smaller entities in SME-dominated sectors. Over the longer term, this is likely to lead in consolidation and gain in market share for the organised sectorImpact on manufacturing statesThe destination-based taxation structure of GST implies that states with manufacturing bases will potentially lose revenue which will be compensated by the central government  about Rs. 500 b in the first year. The key states that will require compensation are Gujarat, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Haryana. Proceeds from the additional cess on sin goods/ luxury items will constitute the pool from which the states would be compensated for any revenue loss.Existing companies which have signed MoUs with statesSeveral states have, in the past, offered tax incentives to companies for setting up manufacturing units. Dilution of the power of states to levy independent taxes/offer exemptions under GST regime, will impact existing projects too. State governments and impacted companies will need to find out solutions. However, at present there is lack of clarity on this issue.Revenue authoritiesTax monitoring will become easier on account of the robust GST network platform where all returns can be accessed instantly and in a user-friendly manner. This will help revenue officials monitor the sequence of supply of goods and services as well as flow of input tax credit.Financial institutesGST will increase working capital requirements across major manufacturing sectors on account of tax liability on inter-state stock transfer. Accordingly, businesses will not be able to claim their tax credits until the shipped goods are sold. To reiterate, stock-transfers in the current regime does not attract any tax even during an interstate transfer."

As of now, 32 taxes are being levied on commodities that are in circulation across the country. After the GST is incorporated, it will be a single replacement to these 32 taxes, he said.Earlier on Friday, Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the GST Bill, which is to exempt the daily-use commodities from the levy, is going to be a more efficient and consumer-friendly taxation system.""Four different rate slab for services are five percent, 12 percent, standard rate of 18 percent and luxury rate of 28 percent, out of which five percent mostly comprises of transport services,"" said Jaitley, while addressing the media in Srinagar.""GST in relation to the services sector was completely adopted in today's meeting. Depending on the nature of service, there are various categorisations which have been made with a set of services, which have been exempted at present,"" Jaitley added.""Other services are fitted into rates such as 5, 12, 18, and luxury rate of 28 percent,"" he said while announcing that five percent rates comprises of transport services.""Restaurants with a turn-over of 50 lakhs or below can go over with a composition of five percent,"" said the Union Finance Minister while adding that service tax on non air-conditioned restaurants will be 12 percent, and that on air-conditioned and liquor license will be 18 percent.Earlier, the GST Council decided to exempt the daily-use commodities from the levy.Prices of food-grains, especially wheat and rice, will come down as they will be exempted from the GST.Currently, some states levy Value Added Tax (VAT) on them.

Involuntary passage of stool or urine in death is common in death following suffocation.The finding was detected with the help of Anurag's photographs taken at the crime scene on early Wednesday morning. Karnataka cadre IAS officer of 2007 batch, Tewari's body was found outside Meerabai Marg VIP guest house on Wednesday morning.While police had disturbed the original scene of crime by turning the officer's body over, sub-inspector Vinay Sharma had clicked some photographs on his mobile phone. The police team along with experts from Mahanagar based forensic science laboratory tried to recreate sequence of events on Saturday evening.Photographs clicked by Sharma and other professional photographers who were summoned to the spot later on, were examined thoroughly again. While zooming in, a police officer noticed some soiling on the lower. According to forensic experts, when a person is choked to death by strangulation, smothering or burking, it is normal for him to pass stool, urine and semen.As Tewari died due to asphyxia, police team were struggling to find out how supply of oxygen dropped all of a sudden in Tewari's body in an open area. Former director of Uttar Pradesh medico-legal cell, doctor YK Pathak said that deaths due to asphyxia can only be homicidal (murder) or accidental.""A person cannot choke to death in an open space. He may have been attacked somewhere else and dumped on the road. Police needs to find out if Anurag was with somebody in moving car or SUV before he was found dead,"" said Pathak.Meanwhile, SIT visited KGMU pathology department on Sunday to take samples of Tewari's heart and submit it to Mahanagar forensic laboratory for examination. SSP Deepak Kumar said, ""I will seek opinion of forensic doctors at AIMS if the need arises and family seems unconvinced. I will extend all support to them and will bring out only facts.""Conflicting points - Police says Tewari did not intend to travel on Wednesday and no airline confirmed that booking in his name was made. Tewari's family however provided PNR of a flight which he was supposed to take on Wednesday. Police also said that Tewari used to order tea without sugar, while family maintained he used to have proper tea.""He cancelled the flight ticket late on Tuesday. I have the message saved with me. That is why I am saying we want CBI to probe the case. Lucknow police wants to prove his death as natural at any cost and have ignored the postmortem report too.

He said the state government decision to scrap 15 public holidays in the name of prominent personalities was already projected to save Rs 50,000 crore of state revenue annually.Yogi reasoned that state gross domestic product (GDP) was to the tune of Rs 12 lakh crore, which comes to Rs 1 lakh crore per month. By scrapping 15 holidays, therefore, the state government would be able save Rs 50,000 crore through maximum utilisation of manpower. He said the state government also intends to save funds in the health sector by roping in ambulances provided by Centre free of cost. Maintaining that as many as 150 such ambulances have already been pushed into service, Yogi said the bigger districts would be provided two more ambulances in the near future.His statement came minutes after Opposition led by the Samajwadi Party created uproar in the House accusing the BJP government of digressing from its commitment to waive off loans of farmers. Yogi, however, said the state government was committed to its promises and would do its bit for welfare of the people. The farm loan waiver alone is expected to cause an additional burden of Rs 36,000 crore on the coffers. This would be apart from financial burden of Rs 30,000 crore with the implementation of the 7th pay commission.He said ongoing wheat procurement process in the present government was 2.5 times more than what it was in the previous government. ""This was being done without any discrimination in terms of caste, religion and region,"" he said.The CM said state government has already paid Rs 22,000 crore to cane growers in the present crushing season. This, he said, was much more than what was paid in the previous crushing season. Yogi said while sugar mills formed the backbone of the state's industrial economy, mills faced closure. ""The previous government did nothing for the better of sugar industry and instead sold them off clandestinely,"" said Yogi, adding that all CHCs, PHCs and government hospitals would soon be equipped with 'Jansuvidha Medical Stores' where cheap medicines would be made available."

Even as SUN's efforts to persuade India to join it have not been very successful, Maharashtra joined the movement in 2014 and Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand in 2016. SUN coordinator Gera Verburg of Netherlands is expected to meet Niti Aayog officials this week.Many countries that did not join the SUN network have raised the issue of conflict of interest in the SUN Business Network (SBN), which includes multinational food corporations like Pepsi, Cargill , Nutriset, Britannia , Unilever, Edesia, General Mills, Glaxo SKB, Mars, Indofood, Nutrifood, DSM and Valid Nutrition. In a document detailing the reasons for not joining networks like SUN, officials from a Brazilian government agency said that international initiatives on fighting malnutrition ought to forbid ""the participation of the business sector in the decision-making process and the management and implementation of both international and national strategies and policies"".They pointed out that ""such participation creates conflicts of interests and favours market-guided measures that ultimately result in the increase of food insecurity,"" and added that it goes against the concept of food sovereignty. Of the 58 countries in the SUN network, over 40 are from Africa . Though SUN -- started in 2010 -- claims to be a global movement, it has only aided recipient countries. The letter to Niti Aayog stated: ""We cannot see how the Government of India - or any other government claiming to uphold democratic principles - can allow themselves to be accountable to transnational corporations or philanthropic foundations rather than their citizens. Nor can we see how effective nutrition and public health policies can be adopted if consensus must first be reached with transnational food corporations.""The SUN approach, the letter argued, results in members sidelining sustainable strategies for prevention of malnutrition that NGOs focus on and instead promotes ready to use foods as a solution. Activists warned the agenda was to get India to sign up as it would add to SUN's profile to get India into its network, but this would bring little for India while facilitating business for multinational food corporations selling processed foods, especially those with high sugar, salt and fat content. Research in India has shown that commercially produced fortified, energy-dense food is not effective in treating children suffering from severe acute malnutrition."

''Terrorists, criminals who are into smuggling narcotics and FICN and human traffickers use this route to sneak into the country and over the years, this border has become extremely porous.Therefore, there is a need to have effective surveillance mechanisms,'' sources said. Last year, the BSF had installed operational ''laser walls'' or infrared fencing along the India-Pakistan International Border in Punjab to keep an effective vigil on terrorists and narcotics smugglers. Sources said the sensors would be monitored through a satellite-based signal command system that will also have night and fog operability tools besides other latest features. ''For any person to cross the Indo-Nepal border in Uttar Pradesh, all that is required is an ID proof.Over the years, smuggling has become rampant and so also the movement of intruders and terrorists who then travel to different parts of the country to execute their nefarious designs. We wanted non-obtrusive checking mechanisms as this border witnesses hectic activity involving genuine citizens of both countries,'' said a field official posted on the Indo-Nepal border. Recently, the SSB personnel had nabbed active Hizbul Mujahideen militant Naseer Ahmed at the Sonauli border checkpost when he sneaked in from Nepal. His handlers in Jammu and Kashmir had asked him to go to Gorakhpur and await further instructions. For all terror groups, the Indo-Nepal border has been the easiest way of sneaking into the country with explosives and there have been regular intelligence inputs about the terrorists, human traffickers and narcotic smugglers.MORE GADGETS FOR SSBBesides infrared fencing, the SSB officials are also introducing state-of-the-art explosive-cum-narcotic detectors, fibroscope (a flexible fiber-optic bundle with an eyepiece on one end and a lens on the other used to examine and inspect small, difficult-to-reach places such as the insides of machines, locks, and the human body to check smuggling of explosive material, narcotics, etc) and X-ray baggage scanners.TRAFFICKING ON THE RISEA steady increase in cases of human trafficking from across the Nepal border and Indian towns in the vicinity has prompted security agencies to undertake new measures to check the menace. As per data available with the SSB, a total of 33 victims, both Indian and Nepalese, were apprehended on the border by the force in 2014, while eight traffickers were nabbed. The figures rose to 336 in 2015 when more than 100 traffickers were nabbed. In 2016, the figures went up to an alarming 501 and 148. From the beginning of 2017 (first four months), close to 200 victims have been rescued by the SSB, while more than 50 traffickers have been arrested so far.FICN, ARMS AND NARCOTICSIn 2015, the SSB seized fake currency worth Rs 36,000, six arms along with ammunition and 2.55 kg potassium besides huge quantities of heroin, brown sugar, cocaine, charas and smack (worth Rs 20 crore) and arrested 51 people. In 2016, eight arms with ammunition besides large quantities of narcotics (worth over Rs 71 crore) were seized and 93 accused were arrested. Similarly, in the first couple of months of 2017, narcotics worth Rs 57 lakh was seized and three persons were apprehended. Besides narcotics, people have also been smuggling forest products, sand, beetul nuts, idols, gold and silver among other items.

PTI file photoTerming Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi as a ""tragedy tourist"", Uttar Pradesh minister Shrikant Sharma today said that wherever tragedy takes place, he reaches there.""Rahul Gandhi is a tragedy tourist. Rahul and company are in frustration. Wherever any tragic incident takes place, he goes there. People of the country had given him 10 years, but he proved to be a flop. People have rejected him. He and leaders of other political parties should co-operate in ensuring peace in the region,"" Sharma told reporters in Mathura.Reacting to Rahul's visit to Saharanpur, minister of state (for independent charge) for Cane Development and Sugar Mills Suresh Rana said that he should not see the feud between two families as a political opportunity.""Situation was not conducive when we assumed power in UP. Things will improve, and we will work for the betterment of each and every section of the society,"" he said.Urging the rival political parties to leave politics of negativity, Rana said, ""I urge the other political parties to shun politics of negativity, and start politics of positivism as a habit. The people of UP have shunned the politics of caste and religion in the 2017 UP Assembly polls. Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi should not see the feud between two families in a village as a political opportunity.""UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said, ""After the 2017 UP Assembly elections, the Congress, the SP and the BSP are desperately searching for issues, so that they could survive politically. In fact they do not hesitate in taking advantage of even the slightest opportunity.""Meanwhile, state Congress spokesperson Dwijendra Tripathi questioned the UP government's stand in denying permission to Rahul to visit the clash affected village.He said, ""The UP government wants to conceal something. Hence, the district authorities denied permission to Congress vice-president to visit the strife-torn area."""

For years, the villagers were forced to drink contaminated water of hand-pumps, which drew water from the river.Once a pristine tributary to the mighty Ganga, the East Kali river is now reduced to a dark shadow of its former self. The river, which criss-crosses hundreds of villages in eight districts of western Uttar Pradesh, once used to replenish the ground water of the region, through which hand-pumps draw water.Locals said that instead of water, the river now carries ""industrial effluent and municipal waste"".They said that the hand-pumps ""spew venom"" instead of fresh water, leading to spread of cancer and various other life-threatening diseases. According to a recent report, at least 20 people died of cancer in just three villages of neighbouring Bijnor due to contaminated water and over a dozen people were suffering from the deadly disease.However, last week's NGT order, asking the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to inspect the hand pumps releasing contaminated ground water in the eight districts has come as a breather for thousands of villagers living along the river.A bench, headed by NGT Chairperson Justice Swatanter Kumar , has directed the apex pollution monitoring body to test the samples of the ground water in these areas through which East Kali River flows. The CPCB has been asked by the green panel to test the water samples and seal the hand-pumps if they find the water to be polluted.Meerut, Muzaffarnagar, Hapur, Bulandshahr, Kasganj, Aligarh, Kannauj and Farrukhabad are the eight districts through which the river passes.Locals allege that several pleas to the government to treat the contaminated river elicited no response. Some of the villages even purchased RO system with the help of local NGOs to get clean drinking water.The NGT order came on a plea filed by Meerut resident Raman Kant Tyagi seeking directions for preparation of a comprehensive action plan for cleaning East Kali River and sealing of the hand pumps whose water is not fit for consumption.East Kali originates from Antwada village in Muzaffarnagar district and flows through the west UP districts before its confluence into Ganga near Kannauj.The petition, filed through advocate Rahul Khurana, has made Union Ministry of Environment and Forests, Ministry of Water Resources, Uttar Pradesh government and CPCB as parties.According to the plea, sugar processing units and their associated alcohol manufacture distilleries, paper mills and tanneries, located adjacent to the river, were extracting large volumes of water and contaminating the river by discharging their effluents into it.""It is a positive step. We have been drinking poison for long and nobody from the government ever bothered to check. We even had to spend money and install RO machines. But, the water is so dirty that even ROs are not helping. There are several cases of cancer in our village because of the dirty water,"" said Dewendar Sharma, a resident of Panwari village in Sardhana, Meerut.After an inspection in November 2016, UP Jal Nigam, the UP Pollution Control Board, National Mission for Clean Ganga and CPCB had stated in their report that 14 drains were releasing effluents into the river."

The village, a one-of-its-kind infrastructure platform, will anchor movement of goods by railways and roadways ultimately dovetailing with the waterways scheme of things, as per plans. The facility will come around the proposed multi-modal terminal adjacent to the city on the banks of the Ganga.Adityanath along with his top officials met IWAI brass in Varanasi on Saturday to understand the mammoth, World Bank-funded projects requirements in Uttar Pradesh. Following a presentation by the IWAI, the CM directed the UP chief secretary to set the process in motion for making the land acquisition process smoother with help from state agencies, sources said. The CM was keen that this unique central project gets a red-carpet treatment in the state and does not face any hurdles, a top UP government source present in the meeting told The Indian Express.The assurance of assistance from the UP government was something missing in the previous regime in the state, officials claimed. Location-wise, the village is proposed to be at a critical future freight-movement hub for north and eastern India. The authority has zeroed in on a location at a junction of National Highways 2 and National Highways 7. The villages distance from NH 7 will be just around 600 metres. The closest railway station, Jeonathpur, at a distance of around six kilometers on the main Kolkata-Delhi rail route and the future Eastern Dedicated Freight Corridor.The NDA government is developing the 1,390-km National Waterways 1 on the Ganga under Jal Marg Vikas Project from Haldia in West Bengal to Varanasi with the technical and financial assistance of the World Bank at an estimated cost of Rs 5,369 crore. The rationale is that since rail and roadways for cargo movement on this route is already congested and bursting in seams, a waterway would provide another alternative, cheaper mode of moving goods. The NH-1 will cater to Allahabad, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Bhagalpur, Patna, Howrah, Haldia and Kolkata, and the industrial hinterland in the Ganga basin.The IWAI has also commissioned a study by MIT Infrastructure Architecture Lab to develop models for ferry services at six urban locations along NW-1, one of which is Varanasi. Petroleum products, chemicals and fertilizers, vegetables, sugarcane, cement, rice, cereal grains are some of the major products that are projected to be moved through Varanasi on NW-1 with a potential for 39 million tonnes worth of cargo, as per the government estimates.Under the project, there are going to be three multi-modal terminals  one each at Varanasi, Sahibganj in Jharkhand, and Haldia; two inter-modal terminals- at Kalughat and Ghazipur; a new Navigation Lock at Farakka, five Roll on-Roll off terminals, development of ferry services at Varanasi, Patna, Bhagalpur, Munger, Kolkata and Haldia and vessel repair and maintenance facilities.Indias waterways are largely overlooked today for freight movement due to the rise of other modes over the past decades. The move to revive them as an economically viable alternative takes its cue from other large economies like the US, which moves 615 million tonnes of freight on waterways representing an 8.3 per cent of modal share compared to rail and road. Similarly, China moves a massive 1,100 million tonnes of goods, as much as the entire Indian Railways, per year through its waterways, which make 8.7 per cent of total goods moved in all modes. India on the other hand moves only 0.5 per cent of its goods through waterways. The current thrust is to revive the waterways and make them viable options in the economy again.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Hindustan Times tracked him down at the Chandigarh office of one of the companies in which he is a director. In an interview, he strongly contradicted his description as a cook in media reports. Wearing formal trousers and a flashy shirt with three high-end mobile phones in hand, Bahadur repeatedly asserted that he never worked as a cook and denied that he is being used for Ranas benami operations.Q: Being a cook, how did you manage to get Punjabs richest mine?A: Let me tell you, I am not a cook and I dont know cooking. If I have Bahadur surname, it doesnt mean I am a cook. Nobody in the last four generations in my family has ever worked as a cook. My forefathers were Nepalis but our family had settled in Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh. I am Delhi-born and my daughter is studying in Delhi Public School, Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh. Anybody can go and check. Calling me a cook is wrong and defamatory. Every Punjabi with a Singh surname is not a truck driver. I challenge anybody to prove that I was a cook ever.Q: But have you not worked in Ranas firms?A: I have and I am not denying it. Before leaving Rana Sugars to join the mining business, I was working as liaisoning officer in the firms Moradabad unit. There are many IAS officers in UP who still know me as Rana Sugars liaisoning officer. I am giving you the mobile numbers of those officers. You can check with them. I was originally working in Captain JS Randhawas firm and left it in 2011 to join Ranas firm. But when Randhawa Sir told me to join him in mining business, I left Ranas firm.Q: It seems a miracle for a liaisoning officer of a sugar company to become director of the company that has bagged the biggest mining contract of the state? You seem to be lying to save Rana?A: Before joining Randhawas firm, I had been working in Balwinder Paper Mill situated on Gill Road in Ludhiana since 2001. The mill is not there now, but the company records can prove that. Before moving to Ludhiana, I worked with a construction firm of Sultanpur (UP) as well. Thereafter, I joined Randhawas firm as my father-in-law was already employed with this firm for over 35 years. I am a matriculate and have earned my position by loyalty and hard work.Q: But your salary is just Rs 11,000 and your income tax returns show an annual income of Rs 9 lakh only. And you are a director in more than three firms having links with Rana. Unbelievable!A: Since I have looked after many construction projects for Ranas and Randhawas, they found me fit for the job. There are additional perks with my salary as well. My social status in Moradabad will show you my position. As far as mining is concerned, I am not raising any fund for the firm. We formed this company on February 12 this year and I am one of the directors, who would get 5% of the profit from mining. As per the agreement, I would oversee the operations of the mine, including loading of truck,s and would get Rs 60,000 as monthly salary from the firm. I was first made director of another firm in 2015 as well.Q: Isnt it a fact that Rana and Randhawa are partners and your company is doing benami operations for Rana?A: I know that Rana and Randhawa Sirs are good friends. As an employee, I dont know more than that. But how can anybody believe that Rana would give our company Rs 26 crore secretly and we would submit it with mining department without mentioning the source. After demonetisation, you have to reveal your financial source for every transaction of Rs one lakh."

""If this doesn't work, the party will then have to move court,"" AAP MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira said at a press conference.Khaira added, ""Just like Vijay Mallya, Rana Gurjeet too could leave the country and his passport should be confiscated. The Uttar Pradesh government has already initiated such a move in view of default in payments by three sugar mills owned by Gurjeet's family. As per news reports, cane commissioner of Uttar Pradesh has said that the four sugar mills belonging to his family have defaulted payment to the farmers to the tune of Rs 202 crore. The UP government has lodged an FIR against them and ordered impounding of their passports. ""Khaira demanded that the money trail of Amit Bahadur, a former employee of Rana should have been included in the terms of inquiry to trace the source of the amount of Rs 13 crore to bid for the auction. ""First, the government gives time to those under the scanner to defend themselves. Then a retired judge known to the minister is picked to conduct the inquiry. The inquiry should been handed over to the Chandigarh police,"" he said, adding that AAP rejects the judicial commission.The party demanded that there were 17 other suspicious mining contracts and the entire bidding process should be cancelled. Khaira said Rana is part of a cartel and there are two other Congress leaders who have stakes in the mining business. ""The cartel formed to hijack sand mining trade in Punjab at the behest of Rana Gurjeet Singh includes ""benami"" investments of Ramanjit Singh Sikki MLA Khadur Sahib and Laddi Sherowali defeated Congress candidate from Shahkot and close associates of the accused Minister. A sitting judge should have been ideally asked to probe the matter,"" he alleged."

The judicial committee has indicted former chief secretary Alok Ranjan and former principal secretary (irrigation) Deepak Singhal for serious irregularities in the implementation of the project.A four-member committee headed by urban development minister Suresh Khanna has now been constituted to examine the judicial committee report and recommend action against those responsible for the lapses.On his part, former irrigation minister Shivpal Yadav has defended his role and said everything was fine with the project till he was involved in its implementation.Read more:Environment issues ignored in Gomti River Front project; vigilance or CBI probe likelyThe Yogi government has asked district magistrates associated with the acquisition of land for the Agra-Lucknow (Access Controlled) Greenfield Six Lane Expressway that connects the city of the Taj Mahal and the Uttar Pradesh capital to probe irregularities.

I do not even know anything about sand mining and have never thought about getting into it. Khaira is making these claims because I am close to Rana Gurjit, who brought me into politics, said Laddi. Attempts were made to speak to Ramanjit Sikki for his response to Khairas allegations but his mobile phone was switched off.Launching an attack on Rana Gurjit, the AAP MLA alleged that the minister had emerged as a defaulter of payments of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and that as per that states Cane Commissioner, Vipin Kumar Dwivedi, Rs 202 crore were due to farmers from four sugar mills in the state.There are orders in place to seize his passport and this should be done straightaway so that he does not flee the country like Mallya, said Khaira. Asking for fresh auction of sand minies in the state, he added: Rana Gurjit was emerging as Punjabs Vijay Mallya.Calling the allegations baseless, Rana Gurjit said: There was a slump in the sugar industry last year and not only my mills were affected but there was an overall negative affect on the payments to be made. But all this has been sorted out now and you can speak to the affected farmers to check. What has Khaira got to do with all this? Does he know anything about the sugar industry.However, Khaira alleged that the inquiry commission was set up to give a clean chit to Rana Gurjit. He said that issues relating to money laundering and the ways and means through which Rana Gurjits employees received cash to bid for the mines had not been included in the terms and reference of Justice Narang Commission and this defeats the basic purpose of the inquiry. He demanded that the Narang Commission be disbanded.One bidder for 17 minesAAP MLA Sukhpal Khaira also demanded a probe into the manner in which there was only one bidder for 17 sand mine sites. He said that there was a need to inquire into the circumstances in which only one bidder emerged for such a large number of mines.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"
5a05d5159855b76bf13c12c7,When a peasant revolts,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/when-a-peasant-revolts/article18716297.ece,2017-06-04,"It didnt last long enough to turn public attention away from more weighty matters like cattle trade and peacock tears, but nevertheless, the two-day strike by farmers in Maharashtra ought to have politicians and policymakers worried everywhere. That is because when the Indian farmer decides to take collective action, there is really no way to counter it.Chaudhary Charan Singh demonstrated this way back in 1978. His kisan rally remains the largest gathering witnessed in Delhis Boat Club lawns to date. It was an awesome display of political power which propelled him  howsoever briefly  into the Prime Ministers office.Mahendra Singh Tikait demonstrated it again a decade later at the same venue. Half a million farmers squatting on the lawns off Rajpath soon brought the Rajiv Gandhi government to its knees, which accepted Tikaits long charter of demands, ranging from higher price for sugar cane to waiving of electricity dues.More recently, the Jats of Haryana once again demonstrated the might of farmer power, seeking Backward Class status  and associated reservations in jobs and education  for themselves by coming out into the streets.So, it is hardly surprising that the Devendra Fadnavis government had to cave in, in a span of just two days. With fruit and vegetable prices soaring 50% and faced with an imminent milk shortage, the Fadnavis administration bought peace by agreeing to waive the loans of small and marginal farmers  nearly 80% of the States 13.7 million-strong farmer population  as well as waiving interest and penalty on pending power bills.The government also agreed to hike the procurement price of milk  though perhaps not to the Rs. 50 per litre farmers demanded  and promised to bring in legislation to make procurement of agricultural produce at prices below the Minimum Support Price (MSP) a criminal offence. It also agreed to set up a State-level commission on agricultural costs and prices.Of course, the ruling party has accused middlemen of machinations to jack up prices (quite true) as well as the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party of political shenanigans (also quite true), but that shouldnt distract us from the real takeaways from this episode.The first one is this: when the Indian farmer is roused enough to march on the streets, it is almost impossible for any government to counter it. That is what 65% of the population means. Faced with large-scale farmer protests, Rajiv Gandhis Congress caved; the Janata Party caved; the UPA caved and, now, the BJP has caved in  in Haryana and Maharashtra.The second is this: unless the powers that be stop merely paying lip service to agrarian distress and actually double down efforts to find meaningful solutions, we are looking at potentially much larger, much more impactful uprisings in times to come.A distorted subsidy regimeIt is paradoxical that agrarian distress has risen even as agricultural output has grown. There are many reasons for this. At the core is a distorted subsidy regime which has pushed cereals in favour of oilseeds and pulses, and water or input-intensive cash crops like sugar cane or cotton in areas which are agro-climatically not suited for them. On the other hand, with rising incomes, education levels and prosperity, the nature of food demand has also changed. Indias per capita cereal demand, as Credit Suisses Neelkanth Mishra pointed out in a recent article, has been declining by 1% a year for the last 30 years. This means that domestic demand for cereals isnt growing any more  while output, even in bad monsoon years, has risen.Farmers continue to grow cereals, tempted by rising MSPs. Procurement, faced with growing grain mountains and tightening of subsidies, has reduced, except in traditionally strong agri-markets like Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh.This forces distress sales at below MSPs, as was also seen in the case of toor dal this year. Last years record price surge forced the government to announce higher MSPs and incentives. However, an immediate and overwhelming response from the farmers found it unable to actually procure at the promised support price, leading to distress sales, and a continuing cycle of rising agricultural debt and unpaid bills.In Maharashtra, for instance, one of the subsidiary demands was to stop harassment by microfinance companies, which leads me think that another Andhra Pradesh-type crisis may well be brewing there.This in turn triggers demands for loan waivers and other write-offs. Yogi Adityanath set the ball rolling with a loan waiver in Uttar Pradesh  now the demand is spreading. Tamil Nadu farmers, despite a high-profile demonstration in Delhi and a half-hearted strike, have not managed to get one yet, but that is only because they havent yet found a forum  or a leader  they can rally behind. If Tamil Nadu finds a Tikait, the tale would unfold quite differently.The point is, given the manifest shortcomings in execution capability, and the limits on capacity, state intervention  of the type which Fadnavis and the Yogi have preferred  can never really solve the problem. There isnt enough capacity and there isnt enough money.What needs to be done instead is to find holistic solutions  actual, rather than theoretical access to credit, lifting of market access controls, better rural infrastructure, affordable and reliable power supply and a crackdown on middlemen. Otherwise, it may not be milk that flows down the streets the next time around."

The Noida authority had in October 2016 allotted 30 acres of industrial land to Samsung India Electronics, which aims to expand its smartphone manufacturing unit in Noida. Samsung already had one industrial unit on an around 45-acre plot in Phase-2 industrial area in the same sector.Noida and Greater Noida have the potential to become a Singapore soon in terms of manufacturing of electronics products. And Samsung can become a global manufacturing lion, said Prasad.Noida houses 600 IT units, mostly along the Noida Expressway in sectors 125, 126, 127 and 135 among others. Around 1.5 lakh IT professionals are working with various IT firms, BPO units and MNCs operating from Noida. IT major Infosys is also developing its campus in Noida with an investment of Rs1, 354 crore.Apart from IT services, Noida has also become a hub of smartphone makers. Chinese smartphone maker Oppo has its manufacturing unit in Noida and is also planning to build a 110-acre manufacturing unit in neighbouring Greater Noida. Lava opened its first mobile manufacturing unit in Noidas Sector 58 in 2015 and also decided to set up another unit along Yamuna Expressway near Greater Noida. Chinas Vivo Mobile too is based in Greater Noida.Indias digital story is beginning to unfold. We aim to make 50 crore smartphones in the next two to three years. We are giving all the support that is required from the government, said Prasad.Uttar Pradesh industries minister Satish Mahana and minister of state (independent charge), sugarcane, sugar mills and industrial development Suresh Rana were also present at the event in Noida.Mahana said he will ensure that setting up of industrial units gets speedy clearances.The Samsung team came up to me in Lucknow and expressed their intention to leave UP and set up their unit in another state because the system was not supporting them. I took them to chief minister Yogi Adityanath and we expedited the clearances required.

5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

File/PTI Photo Farmers and NCP activists throw away milk on the road outside Collectors office during a protest over farmers issues in Thane, Mumbai on Saturday. File/PTI PhotoClearing the decks for an end to the ongoing agitation by farmers in the state, the Maharashtra government Sunday announced a blanket loan waiver, the largest ever, to provide immediate relief to 31 lakh farmers. This is a clear departure from its earlier position that loans of only small and marginal farmers will be considered. The government also agreed to raise the price of milk.There are 1.36 crore farmers in the state and their loans add up to Rs 1.14 lakh crore but the government estimates that the loan waiver will not exceed Rs 35,000 crore when parameters are introduced to weed out non-farming categories to ensure that genuine farmers reap maximum benefits.These parameters will ensure that big business houses, professionals or politicians who own large parcels of agriculture land do not avail loan waiver benefits in the name of farmers.Announcing that a consensus had been reached and farmers had called off their strike, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who described the decision as historic, told The Indian Express: The loan waiver is for all farmers and not confined to just small and marginal categories. There will be defined parameters to ensure genuine and needy farmers are not left out of the institutional credit bracket.Indicating that financial implications are yet to be worked out, Fadnavis said the volume of loan waiver will be largest the state has ever offered. He hinted that the farm loan model would be almost on the lines of Uttar Pradesh and Telangana.When it was pointed out to him that the blanket waiver would mean writing off Rs 1.14 lakh crore for 1.36 crore farmers, Fadnavis said: There was an overwhelming response from farmer leaders that loan waiver should be for needy farmers, and not become a medium availed by rich and prosperous individuals or groups at the cost of poor and needy farmers.Earlier, in a series of tweets, the Chief Minister said: Government agrees for loan waiver for farmers. Conditions and detailing will be finalised by a Joint Committee.Govt also accepts the demand of farmers to increase the milk prices. At the same time, the milk societies will have to agree with 70:30 formula of profit sharing on the lines of sugar industry. Farmers and their betterment was, is and will always be this Governments top priority. Group of Ministers will also hold discussions with various political parties for a broader consensus and inclusion, he said.The development of farmers and their welfare has remained integral to all policy decisions with capital investments of Rs 26,000 crore. The loan waiver is another step to reaffirm our commitment to the farmers, he said.The waiver decision came after a meeting of the core committee led by state Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil and farmer representatives from Nashik, Ahmednagar, Kolhapur, Sangli and Pune.Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetty said, We are pleased with the decision. Our concern was for genuine farmers. We are not seeking a blanket loan waiver. Why should rich and prosperous politicians or industrialists get loan benefits?Patil said, This is a revolutionary decision. A loan waiver of such magnitude has never been considered in the state.Taking another step to provide relief to farmers supplying milk to cooperative dairy societies and private players, the government decided to increase milk rates from June 20.We want to stop exploitation of farmers who are often underpaid. The formula for fixing the milk rate for farmers will be derived, as is done in the case of sugarcane. The ration of 70:30 profit share between sugar mills and cane farmers will be enforced for the milk sector, Patil said.The farmers have demanded Rs 50 per litre but it is likely that they will get between Rs 28-30 per litre.Shiv Sena Minister Diwakar Raote said,  We are happy with the loan waiver.

But now we have to see how soon it is enforced.The Shiv Sena along with NCP and other farmers organisations had backed the strike over the last ten days.

5a0531b79855b76bf13c00ff,The crops of wrath,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-crops-of-wrath-demonetisation-4699598/,2017-06-12,"Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrest Demonetisation may not have hit agriculture production but it is the cause for the current unrestWhen demonetisation happened, many, including this writer, thought the decision, taken at the start of rabi plantings in November, would significantly impact farm production. We were proved wrong. Good monsoon rains, after successive drought years, besides the timely onset of winter conducive to germination, turned out to be strong motivations for farmers to sow, even if this entailed begging or borrowing. They successfully weathered the DeMo storm by simply replacing cash with deferred payments, for labour, purchase of seed, fertiliser and pesticides. Informal credit networks and social capital ensured that, at the end of the day, we had a bumper crop.Where demonetisation did have an impact, however, was in the prices received during harvest: Potatoes in Farrukhabad, Uttar Pradesh, fetched below Rs 350 per quintal this February, compared to Rs 600 or more last year. Moreover, while prices in 2016 had crossed Rs 1,100/quintal by mid-May, they are stuck even now at Rs 350-400. The same goes for rabi onions in Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, that traded at an average of Rs 450 per quintal in May, as against Rs 750-800 and Rs 1,200 in the same month of the preceding two years. Farmers, likewise, sold tomatoes at Kolar, Karnataka, in early May for Rs 300-400 per quintal, down from Rs 1,500-1,600 a year ago.When was the last time we saw all three  potatoes, onions and tomatoes  wholesaling at less than Rs 5/kg, and even retail prices within Rs 20/kg? And this, in peak summer! The above fire sales  the evocative term used by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its latest bimonthly monetary policy review statement  has been repeated across a range of other crops too: Garlic and methi (fenugreek) seed prices at Mandsaur  the district in Madhya Pradeshs Malwa region thats become synonymous with the ongoing farmer unrest  averaged Rs 3,400 and Rs 3,100-3,200 per quintal in April, whereas these ruled at over Rs 4,100 and Rs 4,700-4,800 respectively during the same time last year. Farmers in Nashik, which has also witnessed large-scale street action, along with the rest of Western Maharashtra, had to dump Sonaka grapes at about Rs 12 per kg in March, having sold the same green seedless variety for Rs 45 or so last year.Even more illustrative is the story of soyabean, a kharif crop that, at harvest time in November, quoted at Rs 2,800-2,900 in Indore  that price has barely moved since then, even as sowing for the new season has commenced. A similar fate has befallen arhar/tur (pigeon-pea), which realised Rs 4,300-4,500 in January-February at Gulbarga, Karnataka.That rate, already below the governments minimum support price of Rs 5,050, has fallen further to Rs 3,700-3,800 levels now. Given a choice, will any farmer plant soyabean or arhar in this kharif season?The idea behind throwing these numbers is to emphasise a fact that should be obvious: Whats going on isnt an ordinary fire sale limited to one or two commodities. This is not an isolated sugar or egg price crash, affecting only the cane grower in Muzaffarnagar and Sangli, or the layer poultry farmer of Namakkal. It is about a generalised fall in prices across agricultural commodities. Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.How? Well, much of the produce trading in India is cash-based and financed through a chain of mandi intermediaries, processors, input dealers and retailers. While difficult to establish, anecdotal reports suggest that this traditional agro-commercial capital was dealt a body blow by demonetisation. The collateral damage from it has been a haemorrhaging of liquidity from the markets. With the trade, which used to previously buy and stock up whenever prices fell, no longer active  it neither has the cash, nor the confidence now  the produce markets are suddenly without an important source of liquidity. True, this speculative capital was also a source of inflation, wherein, say, a 10 per cent production shortfall led to prices zooming 200 per cent. But today, its the opposite: A 10 per cent output increase engenders a 200 per cent price collapse.One does not know how long it would take for formal finance, banks, commodity trading houses or organised retail, to fill the void left by traditional agro-commercial capital whose transactions were largely in cash. Till that happens and liquidity truly returns, the ultimate sufferer is the farmer, evidence of which is visible in mandi prices and restive hinterlands.But even assuming demonetisations effects to be transitory, there is another elephant in the room in the form of inflation targeting. The finance ministry and the RBI, in February, 2015, signed a monetary policy framework agreement, obliging the latter to achieve an annual consumer price index (CPI) inflation target of 4 per cent, subject to a plus/minus 2 per cent band. While such inflation targeting may have been adopted by some 29 other countries, the Indian case is unique because of the sheer weight of food and non-alcoholic beverages in its CPI. At 45.86 per cent, this is way above the corresponding combined share of these items in the official CPIs of the United Kingdom (10.3 per cent), Canada (16.41 per cent) or New Zealand (18.84 per cent).Given the high weightage of agricultural products in its CPI, the success of inflation targeting in India is predicated on what happens to food prices. And since inflation at the retail and not just the wholesale level is whats being targeted, it inherently incentivises policy actions that depress farm prices (fire sales may, after all, not be all that bad a thing for the five wise men and one woman constituting the RBIs monetary policy committee). That could also explain why our policymakers today are naturally predisposed towards imposing controls on stockholding, domestic movement and export of farm goods, alongside allowing duty-free imports, at the slightest hint of a price increase  while doing nothing when produce realisations hit rock bottom.Inflation eventually isnt just a matter of the prices of goods and services going up or down. It is also about whose prices are rising and whose are falling  in other words, winners and losers. In the current deflationary environment, the farmers are the clear losers.harish.damodaran@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Congress legislature party chief Kiran Chaudhary also remained absent. Tanwar had on Monday announced that from June 18, party leaders would start a week-long agitation across the state against ""anti-farmer policies of the BJP government"".However, in Tuesday's meeting it was decided that in the first phase dharnas would start from Pipli in Kurukshetra on June 16, which would be followed in Sirsa on June 21, in Rewari on June 25, in Sonipat on July 1, in Jind on July 5, and in Nuh on July 7.When contacted, Tanwar replied, ""I have already taken a decision to start protests from Charkhi Dadri on June 18. I would also sit on 3-day fast at Karnal from June 19, which also happens to the birthday of Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi.""Asked as to why Congress leaders were protesting separately on the same issue, Tanwar replied, ""It is their choice. But I think everybody should come together to overthrow the anti-farmers BJP government.""He added that Congress' main demand is to implement the Swaminathan report, to grant debt waiver to farmers and to seek justice for five farmers killed during the protest in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh In Tuesday's meeting, 12 demands were raised which included implementation of Swaminathan report at the earliest, debt waiver of Haryana farmers on the line of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra governments, to fix the support price of Rs 400 per quintal for sugarcane, to allow farmers to opt for Kisan Fasal Bima Yojana on volunteer basis.Those who attended the meeting included: MP Deepinder Singh Hooda, former state party head Phool Chand Mulana, former speakers Raghubir Singh Kadiyan and Kuldeep Sharma, former ministers Anand Singh Dangi, Harmohinder Singh Chatha, and Geeta Bhukkal."

The Opposition decided to press for a comprehensive loan waiver for farmers and implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions five-part report.The Opposition parties have decided to organise a Bharat Bandh on the issue of farmer distress. The decision came in the meeting of the Opposition sub-group on Wednesday to discuss a strategy for the Presidential election. Sources said that the farmers unrest on a range of issues  falling prices, Minimum Support Price and debt  was discussed at the meeting where many Opposition leaders felt this was the appropriate time to seek answers from the government.The Opposition decided to press for a comprehensive loan waiver for farmers and implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions five-part report. That 2006 report had suggested detailed, sweeping reforms to address agrarian distress: from ensuring better credit and insurance to marketing to better access to technology; steps to promote land reforms and productivity to food security and employment.The date for the Bharat Bandh, a source said, would be decided after parties discuss with their respective leaderships. On Wednesday, Raju Shetti of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana, an NDA ally from Maharashtra, met senior JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav at his residence here where the two discussed agrarian distress. Shettis party has set a deadline for the farm loan waiver in Maharashtra where protests have put the BJP government in a tight spot. A day before Rahul Gandhi visited Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh on June 7, Sharad Yadav and Gandhi had a long discussion at the JD(U) leaders residence, too.Yadav, incidentally, accompanied the Congress vice president to Mandsaur to protest against what he called was the MP governments apathy towards protesting farmers. Later, a delegation of the All India Kisan Sabha, led by CPI(M) leader Hannan Mollah, also visited Mandsaur this week.After Mandsaur, some Opposition leaders have planned a joint visit to Mandola in Uttar Pradesh to express solidarity with farmers who have been protesting there demanding revised compensation for land acquired under Avas Vikas Housing Scheme.An Opposition leader said that agrarian crisis cuts across caste and community lines and could, therefore, be a potent political issue to corner the government with. More so, he said, because both MP and Maharashtra, where the protests reached a flashpoint, are BJP-ruled states.Sporadic farmer agitations were going on at a number of places. Our effort is to unite all such forces, said a leader associated with the plans. A section is sceptical as well given the Oppositions diffused agenda and failure to build a narrative around the protests so far. They cite the fact that in the run-up to UP polls, a rally was organized in Delhi on sugarcane prices and other farmers issues bringing parties like JD(S), NCP, Congress, JD(U), RLD and SP on the same stage. A rally was also organized in Muzaffarnagar to bridge the Hindu-Muslim divide under the overarching umbrella of farmer identity. However, this campaign failed to make any impact during the elections which the BJP won hands down.However, on the land acquisition issue, after Opposition parties had joined hands in 2015 to call the government anti-farmer in and outside Parliament, the government was forced to retract its plan to bring key changes to the UPAs 2013 land law.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The figure came after an elaborate road survey by all departments. Of this, only 76,356 km of roads could be made pothole-free, he said.Individually, the public works department (PWD) headed by Maurya has sought 15 days more to complete the leftover repair work and until October 30 to rebuild completely damaged roads. The PWD had to make 85,160km of the total roads pothole-free. Of this, it has been able to repair 70,030km roads, or 82%, Maurya said.Other than PWD's major share, 139km of 189km of national highways were repaired. National Highways Authority of India roads repaired 49km of its 60km and Panchayati Raj only 333km of its 3,890km. A total of 2,457km of 10,193km of Mandi Parishad roads, 489km of 3,716km of sugarcane department, 1,637km of 1,703km under Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana and 1,222km out of 6,455km of local bodies and municipal corporations' roads were made pothole-free. The irrigation department did not repair any of its 9,668km roads.Claiming that the progress report of some departments was not up to the mark because of lack of proper resources, Maurya said the Yogi government's bid to begin e-tendering in all contracts also hampered the road repairing considerably.The agreement between Union government and the UP government includes construction of seven elevated roads in Lucknow to ease traffic congestion. Maurya said the seven sections would come up between Lekhraj Market and Polytechnic Crossing on Faizabad Road, between Daliganj and IT Crossing, between Sarojininagar and Banthra, between Telibagh and SGPGI, between Engineering College Crossing and IIM turn, between Tedhipulia crossing and Sector 20 Indiranagar crossing and between Koneshwar crossing and Dubagga on Hardoi highway.The UP government has given its consent to a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of railways. Now, Bridge Corporation would construct the portion above railway lines unlike in the past when the railways used to do it. This would help in expediting the construction of railway overbridges in the state. The minister of railways also suggested that Bridge Corporation should get involved in laying of railway tracks."

5a052bc69855b76bf13bff88,No proof required: Battle of the elites,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjp-congress-narendra-modi-nehru-dynasty-demonetisation-farmer-riots-no-proof-required-battle-of-the-elites-4707752/,2017-06-17,"The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004).The present news trend, and expert opinions, are very confusing. You have a marked improvement in agricultural growth, and you have farmer riots in two large states  Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. You have an economy that has been slowing since June 2016, and inflation now at historical lows, and you have economic experts stating that the RBI/MPC decisions have been valid because the wise MPC is looking beyond the temporary decline in inflation to 2 per cent brought about by demonetisation.One of the major objectives of demonetisation was to diminish the role of cash (read black money) transactions. However, if the expert headlines are to be believed, the volume of digital transactions is contracting. What we are witnessing in India is a historic transformation  one that occurs rarely in most countries. It has never occurred in India before, never. But it is happening now. It is a changing of the guard  more appropriately, a changing of the elites.The single most critical factor in Indian politics, from its independence in 1947 until the birth of the Modi administration in 2014, was that the same elite ruled the country. Regardless of political affiliation, this elite had broadly the same political and economic philosophy, characterised by Western-style social liberalism and Fabian economic socialism. In addition, traditionally, the elite was heavily anti-American.The dominant arm of the elite was,The dominant arm of the elite was, of course, the Congress, which was in power from 1947 until 2014 except only for 13 years (1977-1980, 1989-91 and 1996-2004). And except for five years (1991-1996), a Gandhi family leader was the PM or in charge (as was the case during the 2004-2014 period when Manmohan Singh was the PM, but Sonia Gandhi was in control).The influential English-language press shares the basic Congress worldview. Thus, they could not possibly believe that Modi, an unabashed Hindu leader, would win in 2014. There was a parallel belief that the BJP could not possibly win in the largest state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in 2017. Of course, the rise of a new cosmology represented by Modi wasnt an overnight phenomenon, as things were gradually changing. Starting with Narasimha Rao, India began to distance itself from heavy state involvement in economic activities. Economic reforms (especially for industry) were introduced in 1991, tax reforms in 1997, and the beginning of disinvestment in 1998. With the signing of the nuclear deal with US President George Bush in 2008, the first major step towards the American camp was taken by India.As time went on, however, it became increasingly clear that the old elite had failed to notice and respect that India had changed from the illiterate and feudal order prevalent at the time the Nehru dynasty assumed control. There are complex factors feeding into each other to explain the publics increasing mistrust in the old elite, but it can safely be pointed out that the educational level of average Indians has risen; the old elite mismanaged the economy  and power corrupted the old elite.The Indian people are asking more questions and demanding greater accountability from dynastic political leaders. But the old elite  politicians, corporates, left-intellectuals, academics  cannot be expected to give up their privileges so easily. They will try to derail the transformation and object at every turn: If that means fake analysis, they will do so. If that means intellectual gymnastics, they will do so. The key point is that they must do so.This is a long drawn-out battle, and a healthy battle. This is what checks and balances are all about. Should the new elite emerge without being questioned? No. Can the new elite just be allowed to roll over the old elite? Definitely not. Will the old elite use all its instruments, and cash in all the old I-owe-you(s) in order to influence the debate, even with fake news and even flakier analysis, if need be? You bet. This is one movie India has never seen before. Sit back, learn, comprehend and enjoy.The battle is joined from all sides. Even from within the BJP. The new elite wants to rewrite history. That is its privilege. But do they have to distort history as much as they claim the Congress did? And do they have to ban documentaries, just like Indira Gandhi did with the banning of Louis Malles nine-hour documentary Phantom India? Or, the later banning of The Satanic Verses?It is important that history be re-written  all new-born elites have done that since time immemorial. But why write history in as distorted a manner as the previous 70 years  by obliterating any mention of Nehru? And will you next sink as low as previous historians who find that the actions of General Rawat (defending parading an innocent as a human shield) and General Dyer (who oversaw the Jallianwala Bagh massacre) are comparable? Invoke Savarkar if you will, but also mention that he was not opposed to cow slaughter. And remember your Hindu Vedic ancestors, who not only did not infringe on the diets of others, but also ate beef.In my previous article (Just why are farmers rioting, IE, June 10), I documented that because of good weather, agricultural growth in 2016-17 was much better than the previous two years (4.9 per cent in 2016-17 vs an average of 0.5 per cent in 2014-15 and 2015-16). Farmer incomes had improved  so, riots now and not before? Some experts pointed out that flower sellers had suffered because of demonetisation  true; some others pointed out that vegetable sellers had suffered, especially those cultivating potatoes, onions and tomatoes. And many, indirectly or directly, attributed all of the price decline to the disruptive policy of demonetisation.The same experts are silent on what happened to fruit prices, also a perishable crop and subject to bad demonetisation  fruit prices (wholesale and consumer) are up 5 per cent y-o-y. And they are silent on sugar, rice and wheat farmers  their prices are up 10-15 per cent. How many vegetable farmers in India? Less than 4 million. How many rice, sugar and wheat farmers  close to 90 million.Now, demonetisation. This is aNow, demonetisation. This is a parallel to the farmers-are-justified-in-rioting-with-record-crop-output flake news. And that is that demonetisation was a comprehensive failure because its simplest goal  reduce cash transactions  has not been achieved. The evidence offered by several experts  RBI data on cash and non-cash transactions since November 2016.There is a basic flaw in this lazy approach to ideological analysis. The experts only process data from November onwards, and are not willing (because of the results?) to look at the change in non-cash transactions over the last three years. They compare April to March 2017, find the volume of transactions lower, and conclude that demonetisation was a failure. The old elite could not possibly do a worse job!The accompanying table documents RBI data on all non-cash transactions (by volume) since 2014. For each year, the data reported is an average for the months January-April. Card usage is only for POS transactions (as emphasised by the RBI in its weekly releases). You be the judge. Total non-cash transactions increased by 53 per cent over last year, January-April. And non-cash transactions induced by demonetisation  debit and credit cards (POS), prepaid and mobile  are up 173 per cent. Your sixth-grade daughter will tell you this is doubling every eight months. And you maintain that demonetisation has failed to move India rapidly towards less cash (less black money) transactions?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Convicted for the dowry death of his wife, he has spent 18 years of his life in jail, 13 of which at Sampoornanand Shivir, an open-air prison in Uttarakhands Sitarganj.Set amid lush green fields, the jail was established in 1960 over an area of 5,965 acres.Sampoornanand, then chief minister of undivided Uttar Pradesh of which Uttarakhand was a part, promoted the concept.Balbir attributes the transformation in him to the unfettered life in the shivir, which is among the 28 unique open jails of India.General jails are cramped, there is no individual space and inmates there are mostly depressed. Here we are already part of the mainstream, he said.But all is not well at this unique jail. Its area has now shrunk to just 640 acres as a vast swath of its agricultural land was given away to the Sate Infrastructure and Industrial Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIIDCUL), the Border Security Force (BSF) and the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB).The number of inmates, referred to as shivir wasis, too dwindled from 500 in 2000 to 44 in 2017. We have urged the inspector general of jails to shift 50 prisoners from other jail to this camp so that the number of inmates is increased and we can have more hands for agricultural work, superintendent of the shivir TD Joshi said.The area of the jail has now shrunk to just 640 acres. (HT Photo)Giving some respite to those who are striving to protect the unique concept, the Uttarakhand high court, Nainital, recently ordered that not an inch of the land belonging to the shivir should be given to any agency for any work other than building of hospital or school.But inmates are not fully assured. Besides, there are many problems that still persist.There is no doctor on the campus. The 15- day home leave to inmates was withdrawn by the government five years ago.Inmates at the shivir live in huts on the fields and guard the crops at night. Sugarcane, wheat and rice are grown over around 200 acres of land by them.The inmates are categorised as pucca and kachcha shivir wasis. The pucca shivir wasis live in the fields as they are trustworthy. They can, however, move only within the fields of the jail and not beyond the open boundary. They are allowed to keep with them their families for a week in a month and are provided daily quota of rations. They have to cook their own food. The kachcha shivir wasis are considered less trustworthy and are kept in unlocked barracks."

(Source: PTI Photo) A panel of Group of Ministers constituted by the CM has submitted a report on a new mining policy and on clamping down on illegal mining, which is a major problem in UP. (Source: PTI Photo)As Yogi Adityanath completes 100 days in office this week as Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, formidable challenges including funds for the farm loan-waiver, and law and order stare him at his face, with the opposition claiming the misses have outnumbered the hits. The loan-waiver, a major pre-poll promise of the BJP, is making finance department burn the midnight oil in trying all permutations and combination to offload the sudden fiscal burden of nearly Rs 36,369 crore. This coupled with Rs 34,000 crore for the implementation of the seventh pay commission recommendations, has put an additional burden of a whopping over Rs 70,000 crore on the states coffers.The government faces other major challenges including of arranging funds for mega projects like the Purvanchal e-way.The government itself has admitted it could manage to make just 63 per cent of the state roads pothole-free by the June-15 deadline set by the chief minister.Distribution of free laptops among students  mentioned in the BJPs sankalp patra (election manifesto)  is another challenge confronting the Yogi government, which was inaugurated on March 19.No date has been announced for the scheme to be launched.With certain law and order incidents, especially caste and communal clashes, threatening to eclipse the achievements of the 45-year-old saffron-clad chief minister, his officials are going the extra mile to ensure there is no dent in BJPs image in the run up to the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The chief minister and his cabinet colleagues have already sought more time saying they inherited a jungle raj from the SP government and it would take them some time to set things in order.Soon after being sworn-in, the CM had claimed he would prove his governments commitment to good governance first by ridding the roads of potholes completely by June 15.However, his deputy Keshav Maurya, who also holds the PWD portfolio, admitted that out of 1.21 lakh-km of road length, repair works on only about 70,000km had been completed.The condition of roads in Kanpur and PM Narendra Modis constituency of Varanasi is particularly bad.Another challenge for the government is holding the urban local body elections by July 15, when their term expires.The State Election Commission was ready and had completed its preparations, but the government itself put off the polls saying the rapid survey of the backward seats was faulty- the survey was conducted under the present BJP regime.Now the elections are likely to be held in October.As the state government prepares to come out with a 100-day achievement document later this week, state Congress spokesperson Dwijendra Tripathi ridiculed the ruling party for making promises that it could not meet.Two months of the Adityanath government have not sent out any strong message on any of the issues which were part of BJPs campaign  improved law-and-order situation and better administration, he said.BSP chief Mayawati has alleged that the Dalits, the OBCs as well as forward castes including Brahmins have been facing atrocities in the state in an apparent attempt to associate Adityanath and his government with Kshatriyas only.As head of the Gorakhnath Peeth, Adityanath has often associated himself with Kshatriya symbols.He is often seen surrounded by Kshatriyas mostly and he has supported Thakur leaders of other parties too  in 2013, he came out in support of Kunda MLA Raghuraj Pratap Singh alias Raja Bhaiya who was accused of conspiring to kill a deputy Superintendent of Police.Not known to take frequent barbs at him lying down, ex-chief minister Akhilesh Yadav recently took on the Yogi government, saying, I never knew officers wielded brooms so well. Now the question is how much filth have they cleared so far?He said the deadline to make state roads pothole-free by June 15 remained a pipe dream.When asked about the Yogi governments decision to probe the Expressway and river front projects launched during the SP rule, Akhilesh said, Will this government do any workor will it only conduct probes? This government should try to do better work than us.Presently, the entire state machinery  from ministry to departmental level  is working on their 100-day progress reports which will be presented to the public in the form of a white paper, an official said.While the CM is personally reviewing the works, a web-based monitoring system has also been put in place for 73 departments in the state to submit their progress reports, the official said.The government has not announced any major scheme or big-ticket infrastructure projects other than the farm loan-waiver.These are likely to be addressed when the government presents its maiden budget in the next few months. Adityanath has said that two months is a too short a period to showcase any achievements.Law-and-order and governance, however, remain the primary challenges for Adityanath. It will be a herculean task to change the attitude of the bureaucracy down to the lowest level and make the government machinery responsive to the needs of the public, political observers feel.Adityanath will need to begin the process of change and show tangible results soon in order to satisfy those who voted the BJP, and to stave off anti-incumbency sentiment before the Lok Sabha elections scheduled for 2019, analysts say.The recent clashes between the Dalits and the Kshatriyas in Saharanpur, several instances of vigilantism in the name of cow protection or moral policing and the run-ins of BJP leaders, including legislators, with police and officials have hindered the new governments attempts to send out right signals on good governance.The change has started to show in UP since the Yogi government took charge. Well-meaning people are feeling relieved with the closure of illegal slaughterhouses. With the constitution of anti-Romeo squads, anti-social elements harassing women and girls are now in fear.Rowdyism is dying and crime graph falling. Peoples confidence in the government has been restored, the state BJP had said in its political resolution at its recent working committee meeting at Lucknow.But, on the ground, certain recent incidents like caste clashes in Saharanpur and communal violence in Bulandshahr, Sambhal and Gonda gave the law-enforcing agencies sleepless nights more so as the BJP came to power on the plank of improving law and order, terming the erstwhile Samajwadi Party rule as a goondaraj.In Bulandshahr, members of the Adityanath-founded Hindu Yuva Vahini were alleged to be behind the killing of an aged Muslim man after a love-jihad-style elopement. The Bulandshahr incident took place even as Adityanath met senior Yuva Vahini workers during a visit to Gorakhpur and warned them againts taking law in their own hands.The attack on Saharanpur SSPs residence allegedly by BJP activists led by local MP Raghav Lakhanpal, hogged the headlines.And even before the dust settled on the controversy, caste violence broke out in the region.The Samajwadi Party latched onto these developments. We were termed the goonda party. Now, what is happening under Yogi ji? Will he act? Akhilesh asked.Perturbed over the sudden spurt in such incidents, the CM decided to set up a special monitoring cell in his office.A special cell will be constituted in the CMs office for crime-monitoring, which will be done personally by the CM, cabinet minister Shrikant Sharma said.Refuting SPs criticism over the law and order, he said, Those SP leaders, who have carried criminals and rapists with them in their cars, should introspect.Ever since Adityanath took over the reins of the state, the bureaucracy is constantly on its toes.It is an unusual sight to see that the parking lots at the secretariat here get full even before the clock strikes 9:25 in the morning.Adityanath has proved himself to be a tough taskmaster, holding back-to-back meetings with ministers and bureaucrats well past midnight, only to return to office before 9.30 the next morning.For almost a month, some 80-odd presentations were made by as many departments before the CM.The state government has so far announced half a dozen significant measures, starting with the Rs 36,500-crore loan-waiver and power-for-all agreement, said Principal Secretary (Information) Avaneesh Awasthi.At the BJP working committee meeting, Adityanath praised Cane Development Minister Suresh Rana for his efforts to clear Rs 5,558 crore of dues of sugarcane farmers within 40 days.A panel of Group of Ministers constituted by the CM has submitted a report on a new mining policy and on clamping down on illegal mining, which is a major problem in UP.A portal being launched under the CMOs supervision to allow people to file complain on illegal land-grab could be a game-changer, too.The Power-for-All agreement between the Yogi government and the Centre promises electricity around the clock to district headquarters and 18-hour a day to all villages.Another key decision was making transfers and postings of bureaucrats merit-based and free from extraneous pressures as reflected in wide-scale transfers done by the government.In the erstwhile government, transfers had become an industry. Now, honest and talented officers are getting respectable posts, a BJP leader said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Express Photo. Uttar Pradesh CM Yogi Adityanath has expressed displeasure over rising corruption and kept it on its priority to rid the state from corruption. Express Photo.Take a tour of jail, get a glimpse of the life behind the bars and decide for yourself if you want to indulge in corruption. This is the message the Farrukhabad District Magistrate has for government officials to deter them from graft. District Magistrate Ravindra Kumar hit upon the novel idea and sent 576 government employees to the central jail in Farrukhabad to interact with inmates, including government officials who are living in confines of the prison.Recently I suspended six government officials as they were allegedly involved in corruption. In the entire process of taking action, a probe officer is appointed and again the possibility of corruption rises. The best way to curb corruption is to instill a sense of responsibility among the officials so that they themselves deter from corrupt practices, Kumar told PTI over the phone.About his concept of sending government officials on jail tourism, Kumar said there were 88 government employees from across the state lodged in the central jail, Farrukhabad.Jail tourism should act as a new mantra to deter corrupt officials, he said.I sent 576 government officials to visit jail yesterday so that they share the experience of inmates, including government servants. The objective is that they should know the experience of those behind bars and ultimately deter them not to indulge in corrupt practice which might invite similar fate for them, the district magistrate said.Among those who visited the jail included Lekhpals (revenue officers) dealing in land-related matters, ration shop owners, who deal with supply of food items, and panchyat officers, who deal with various schemes implemented at village level.Head of some departments also went inside the jail to feel the life there, he said, adding that following the state governments zero tolerance for corruption his aim was to check the menace.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath has expressed displeasure over rising corruption and kept it on its priority to rid the state from corruption.He had also raised question mark on functioning of the anti-corruption organisation (ACO) in the state while saying that it was time to restructure the body to make it more effective and result-oriented.The ACO deals with complaints of corruption related to the police force and non-gazetted ranks of other state government departments.There has been a number of arrests of government officials, including an ARTO (Assistant Road Transport Officer) in Chandauli, and a number of policemen have been caught taking bribe.The CM has also recommended probe into a number of schemes launched in previous Samajwadi Party regime during which corruption allegedly prevailed.The alleged scams in Shia and Sunni waqf boards and Gomti river front project are already under the scanner, while sale of sugar mills without following norms is also being probed by the Yogi Adityanath government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The FIR was filed by an executive engineer of Sharda Project at Gomti Nagar police station for misappropriation of funds and other financial anomalies,"" Circle Officer of Gomti Nagar, Satyasen, told PTI today.He said the officials against whom FIRs were lodged, were posted as chief engineers and superintendent engineers.""Case has been lodged under various sections of the IPC and Prevention of Corruption Act for committing financial anomalies and misappropriation of funds,"" Satyasen said.SHO Gomti Nagar Sujit Dubey said the officials against whom FIR has been lodged will be arrested soon.""We are collecting evidences against them,"" he added.Yesterday, while speaking to PTI, UP minister of state for urban development Girish Kumar Yadav had said, ""A few days back, the probe report was submitted to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. As far as CBI probe is concerned, all necessary steps will be taken and appropriate action will be initiated.""""If there is any need to lodge an FIR, the government will not hesitate in doing so. None of the guilty persons will be able to escape the clutches of law and stringent action will be taken against them,"" Yadav had said.The river front has witnessed a political showdown between the erstwhile Samajwadi Party regime in the state and the present Adityanath government.It had become a major issue during the recent Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections.On April 1 the chief minister had ordered an inquiry by a retired High Court judge into the project. He had instructed chief secretary Rahul Bhatnagar to constitute a committee and also directed for submission of the report within 45 days.Adityanath had also directed the urban development minister and the irrigation minister Dharmpal Singh to monitor the development work at the Gomti river front.During the meeting, officials had told the chief minister that of the total allocation of Rs 1,513 crore, 95 per cent of the budget, which comes to around Rs 1,435 crore had already been spent, while only 60 per cent of the work could be completed.Adityanath had directed the officials to ensure that no effluent should flow in Gomti river and ordered expeditious diversion of drains releasing effluents and polluted water in it.He had remarked that till the time the river water becomes pollution-free, its beautification would hold no meaning.He had also expressed his unhappiness that the river water was so much polluted that it was very difficult to even stand at the river front and said, ""In such a scenario, a fountain on Gomti river was useless.""Gomti river, meandering through the 940-kilometre stretch of rich alluvial plains of Uttar Pradesh, is polluted by industrial effluents and domestic discharge.The river becomes more of a flowing dumping yard for the 15 smaller and bigger towns, including Lakhimpur Kheri, Sitapur, Lucknow, Sultanpur and Jaunpur, in its catchment area.The major sources of pollution in the Gomti are industrial waste from sugar factories and distilleries and sewage from habitations."

Cabinet Minister and government spokesperson Sidharth Nath Singh said the challenges existing before the government will be highlighted in the white paper.The scarcity of funds in the state exchequer after BJP came to power, poor condition of different departments and failures of the previous government in improving condition of the state will be highlighted in the white paper, a government official said. Since assuming office on March 19, the BJP government has already got a judicial probe conducted in the Gomti riverfront project, developed when Adityanaths predecessor Akhilesh Yadavs uncle, Shivpal Singh Yadav, was the state Irrigation minister.The state government has recently lodged an FIR in Lucknow against eight engineers in connection with the alleged scam, and sources said the probe may be handed over to the CBI in near future. Adityanath himself had inspected the riverfront project site in March and had expressed dissatisfaction when informed that 95 per cent of the Rs 1,513-crore project was utiltised but less than 65 per cent work had been completed. After officers presented a revised project cost of Rs 2,448 crore, Adityanath had sought a review of the necessity of remaining works, removal of unnecessary works, and quick completion. The government has also ordered inquiry in Alpsankhyak Samudaayaon ke Kabristaanon/Anteyshti Sthal ki Bhoomi ki Suraksha Yojana (scheme to build boundary walls around burial grounds to guard against encroachments).Approximately Rs 1,300 crore was spent across the state during the last five years in building boundary walls around Muslim graveyards. The scheme was implemented under supervision of Azam Khan, who was the minister concerned. The government has constituted a three-member committee to probe this. Following Adityanaths directive, another inquiry has been started in Janeshwar Mishra Park, Jai Prakash Narayan International Centre and beautification of Hussainabad area in the heritage zone of Lucknows old city area  all developed under direct supervision of Akhilesh, who handled the Housing portfolio.The process of awarding tenders in these projects would also be inquired. On April 11, Adityanath had ordered a stop on implementation of Samajwadi Pension Scheme, a flagship public welfare scheme of the previous government. Adityanath had ordered a probe on whether existing beneficiaries were eligible for the pension scheme, as also the eligibility criterion laid down for selection of beneficiaries.The government has stopped monthly pension of Rs 50,000 to recipients of Yash Bharti award and Padma awards from UP from March, and, in a review meeting of the Culture department on April 21, had ordered a thorough review of the awards, instituted by the Mulayam Singh Yadav government in 1994. The government has asked officers to look into the criteria of selecting the award winners. The BSP government under Mayawati stopped the scheme in 2007 but the Akhilesh administration revived it. It also raised the cash prize to Rs 11 lakh, and in 2015 decided to give a monthly pension of Rs 50,000 on demand.Adityanath has also expressed dissatisfaction on quality of infrastructure development works under Jawaharlal Nehru National Urban Renewal Mission (JNNURM), and asked for a committee under Urban Development Minister Suresh Khanna to probe the works executed by Jal Nigam. The government ordered inquiry into sale of 21 UP sugar mills in 2010-11 on suspicion that it involved a scam of approximately Rs 1,100 crore.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

For commuters headed towards South Delhi, the drive from NH-24 to Ashram will speed up significantly when the road opens.The 17km stretch from Uflex to Ashram will now be signal-free and, if traffic is smooth, will take less than half an hour to cover.The elevated road will be officially launched by Uttar Pradesh industrial development minister Satish Mahana on Wednesday at 5pm.Before that, the Noida Authority will start trials on the elevated stretch from Tuesday. A 2.5-km stretch of the road from Uflex to the ISKCON Temple is already operational, having been opened to commuters in October last year.When the entire stretch opens, traffic flow around sectors 23, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31 and 33 should ease. Due to construction work, motorists have been facing regular snarls along the Master Plan 2 road. Those bottlenecks too will go.""We are giving the elevated road finishing touches and will ensure it is ready a day before the official opening,"" said S C Mishra, project engineer, Noida authority and in-charge of the elevated road project. ""On the morning of June 27, we will undertake trial runs along the stretch to ensure all is fine,"" he added.Suresh Rana, minister of state (independent), sugarcane, sugar mills and industrial development is also likely to accompany Mahana. A public address is scheduled at Cambridge School before the ribbon cutting ceremony, officials said.The project was commissioned in October 2014 when Akhilesh Yadav was in power. Initially, it was scheduled to be completed by October 2016 but was affected by the National Green Tribunal's (NGT) ban on use of hot-mix plants, which was necessary to prepare construction material for the road.""We did face a delay, but construction was resumed in full swing after NGT on May 8 temporarily lifted the ban on hot-mix plants,"" Mishra said.The elevated road has exit and entry ramps at Nithari (Sector 30) and (NTPC Sector 24) to allow traffic from internal roads access it. Nearly one lakh vehicles pass through the Sector 62 area every day. Commuters use the stretch to reach Ghaziabad via NH-24 and parts of East Delhi. Several thousand vehicles also drive towards Noida Extension from Film City via the Uflex route."

Express Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his ministers release their governments 100-day report card in Lucknow on Tuesday. ExpressHaving completed 100 days in office, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday released a progress report of his government in the form of a booklet containing brief details of its achievements and plans for the future. In the presence of all his Cabinet ministers, he spoke at length about the governments consistent efforts to fulfill the promises made in the manifesto his party had released prior to the Assembly elections held earlier this year, which it had won by a landslide.The 48-page booklet, titled 100 Din Vishwas ke, contains brief references to the governments take on various issues including law and order, policing, farmers issues including payment of pending sugarcane dues and loan waivers, steps being taken to attract investment, setting up industries to aid employment, infrastructural development as well as Metro rail operation in Lucknow and other cities.The first claim made is zero tolerance on law and order. The booklet mentions Adityanaths directives which include strengthening of police patrolling to stop incidents of theft and dacoity, effective action against crimes, to make police more alert and vigilant so they can fix responsibility at all levels while reviewing law and order.One of the pages in the booklet refers to the government as Aam jan ki sarkar (government of the common man). While referring to the governments paini nazar (sharp eye), the CM claimed while talking to the media that the formation of anti-Romeo squads has created a sense of safety among women and girls. As per the booklet, over 8.55 lakh persons were checked by the squad and 651 cases were registered with legal action initiated against 1,367 accused. Over 3.84 lakh persons were released after issuing warnings.The report also mentions that 16,152 cases of harassment of women were registered, 11,922 accused were arrested and 1,922 accused had surrendered in connection with such cases in the last 100 days. Besides, 3,326 cases of harassment of SC/STs were registered, 4,620 accused were arrested in such cases while 1,148 accused surrendered.

Also, 1,035 land mafias have been identified and 5,895 hectares of land was freed from illegal encroachment, claimed the report.Speaking to the media, Adityanath expressed satisfaction over the governments achievements in 100 days. He said that bringing about change in just 100 days in a big state like Uttar Pradesh, and that too with limited resources, was a challenge and the government had accepted that. He also claimed that his government was working for all sections of society without any discrimination.The chief minister further said that he wants to assure that the state government has initiated effective steps for growth and prosperity in the state. Taking a jibe at the previous SP and BSP governments, he said the state had been left behind in growth in the past 14-15 years because of corruption, pariwarvad (nepotism) and poor law and order.The chief minister said that crop loans of more than 86 lakh marginal and small farmers of upto Rs 1 lakh have been waived and the decision has caused a financial burden of Rs 36,000 crore to the state exchequer, which his government will compensate by reducing unnecessary expenditure. He further claimed that 36.99 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was procured this year, 4.5 times more than the wheat procured in the previous year.Presser becomes one-question affairA PTI report said that though it was billed to be a press conference at the Lok Bhawan, opposite the state legislature complex, the 45-year-old CM took just one question from mediapersons.Adityanath sought the cooperation of newspersons in helping him run the government when a scribe raised a question relating to the plight of small and medium newspapers.

Projects like Gorakhpur Metro, to come up at an estimated cost of R12,000 crores , are among the dream projects of the CM and officials from the departments concerned have been instructed to ensure they materialise in time .Rapid transit: Gorakhpur Metro on the anvil The Gorakhpur Metro, connecting major routes in the city, seems to be the best plan to tackle traffic snarls, making commutation faster, easier and comfortable for office goers, students and locals.Officials from Rail Technical and Economical services (RITES), the government agency which entered an agreement with the Gorakhpur Development Authority (GDA)to prepare detailed project reports, have been visiting different localities to assess traffic load and conducting surveys.RITES has been entrusted with the task of preparing a detailed project report on Gorakhpur Metro within eight months. Within two months of agreement with GDA, they have to complete 25% of DPR work  said ON Singh , vice chairman, GDA, adding that the total estimated project cost of Gorakhpur Metro was around Rs12,000 crores.Introduction of Gorakhpur Metro would not only ease huge burden of traffic on roads and bring down pollution level but also help provide employment to jobless youth.No one had ever imagined that one day Metro would run in a city like Gorakhpur. Indeed this has become possible because of the personal interest of the CM who wants that Gorakhpur should not remain a backward area, BTech third year student Yashpal Singh said.AIIMSSetting up of the 700-bed AIIMS on 112 acres land of Ganna Shodh Sanstha in Gorakhpur is another ambitious project of the central and state governments which would boost growth in the city and help government deal effectively with ailments like encephalitis , the most fatal disease of east up which claims hundreds of lives every year.On July 1, 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone of AIIMS and fertilizer factory and assured people that he would not let a single child die of encephalitis .Giving pace to the project, DM Rajeev Rautela leased the land in the name of AIIMS for 90 years last week.Work on construction of three and half km long boundary wall of the site was initiated by service providing firm in March.AIIMS will be like a new ray of hope for encephalitis patients .It will also reduce burden of encephalitis patients at BRD Medical College ,where patients from 36 districts and even Nepal report for treatment , said DR RN Singh, paediatrician.Fertilizer factoryThe fertilizer factory which was once the pride of the city before closing down in the late 90s, is set to be revived to manufacture neem-coated urea for farming. The project is expected to be completed in three years, at a cost of R6,000 crore. Over 3,850 metric tonnes of urea will be produced here every day, helping in the green revolution.Youths, including those passing out in chemical engineering from MMMUT, would have a chance of employment at the factory, said Mohd Azhar, an engineering student.Two closed sugar mills in Padrauna and Munderwa will also be revived to usher in growth.Under the new industrial policy to be announced by the state government, east UP, particularly Gorakhpur, was to be developed as an industrial state , CM Yogi Adityanath had announced during his recent visit to Gorakhpur .Tax exemption and land at cheaper rates is what the government plans to attract investors here . Such policies s will further fuel growth and create more job opportunities .It will also help check migration of youths who move to Mumbai, Delhi and other big cities for livelihood, BJP leader Satyendra Sinha said.Better connectivityThe citys road and air connectivity will also be improved. After new Spicejet flights for Delhi and Kolkata under Udan scheme last year , flights for Mumbai and Kathmandu were also on the cards, MoS Civil Aviation Jayant Singh had announced during a programme at Gorakhpur airport on June 14.Power sectorThe government will spend Rs 214 crore to improve power distribution system under IPDS scheme and Rs 90 crore for underground power cables, said AK Singh, chief executive engineer, Gorakhpur zone . Of the 16.29 houses, only 11.53 lakh have power connections in Gorakhpur, depriving 4.76 lakh consumers of electricity. Under the IDPS, all such houses will be covered. Capacity of 18 substations will be enhanced while four new substations will be set up, Singh said.Tourism sectorGorakhpur and its surroundings have immense unexplored potential in tourism. The government has allocated funds for about half a dozen projects, including sound and light shows at Gorakhnath temple, revival of Chauri Chaura memorial and Budhdhist circuit in Kushinagar , said Tourist officer Arvind Rai.International flights from Kushinagar are also on cards to attract foreign tourists."

Now, changes are being made. Please also note that we have been in power for three months only. So why hold a good intentioned-move against us? Dont catch our words, catch the intention instead, says BJP leader Navin Srivastava.The best progress was observed in roads under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (96% roads repaired), NHAI (81% roads covered) and PWD (82%) while roads under irrigation department fared the worst with no improvement.UP BJP chief Keshav Prasad Maurya, who is also the states deputy chief minister, says the government undertook the difficult task despite being aware of the challenges.Read more| Yogi government at 100 days: Development finally dawns on eastern horizonUP has 1, 21, 034 km of UP roads.

As far as the PWD is concerned, 70,030 kilometres of roads have been made gaddha-mukt so far. While our overall success is 63%, if you just take the roads managed by PWD, its 82% success, says Maurya, who is also the PWD minister.Although no fresh deadline has been announced for making all the roads in the state free of craters , additional chief secretary Sadakant (he goes by one name) says all the remaining roads would be repaired by October.Maurya, however, hasnt set any date . There is no fresh deadline as its an ongoing project, he says, while blaming the neglect of roads during the 15 years of SP-BSP rule.The states main opposition Samajwadi Party has slammed the government. Why only potholes, this government has been a miserable failure on all counts. Its regularly contradicting itself and doing little, says SP leader Ram Asrey Vishvakarma."

Express Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and his ministers release their governments 100-day report card in Lucknow on Tuesday. ExpressHaving completed 100 days in office, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday released a progress report of his government in the form of a booklet containing brief details of its achievements and plans for the future. In the presence of all his Cabinet ministers, he spoke at length about the governments consistent efforts to fulfill the promises made in the manifesto his party had released prior to the Assembly elections held earlier this year, which it had won by a landslide.The 48-page booklet, titled 100 Din Vishwas ke, contains brief references to the governments take on various issues including law and order, policing, farmers issues including payment of pending sugarcane dues and loan waivers, steps being taken to attract investment, setting up industries to aid employment, infrastructural development as well as Metro rail operation in Lucknow and other cities.The first claim made is zero tolerance on law and order. The booklet mentions Adityanaths directives which include strengthening of police patrolling to stop incidents of theft and dacoity, effective action against crimes, to make police more alert and vigilant so they can fix responsibility at all levels while reviewing law and order.One of the pages in the booklet refers to the government as Aam jan ki sarkar (government of the common man). While referring to the governments paini nazar (sharp eye), the CM claimed while talking to the media that the formation of anti-Romeo squads has created a sense of safety among women and girls. As per the booklet, over 8.55 lakh persons were checked by the squad and 651 cases were registered with legal action initiated against 1,367 accused. Over 3.84 lakh persons were released after issuing warnings.The report also mentions that 16,152 cases of harassment of women were registered, 11,922 accused were arrested and 1,922 accused had surrendered in connection with such cases in the last 100 days. Besides, 3,326 cases of harassment of SC/STs were registered, 4,620 accused were arrested in such cases while 1,148 accused surrendered. Twenty-four cases have been registered under the National Security Act, added the report.The government claimed to have set up anti land-mafia task forces and identified over 1.53 lakh persons with illegal possession on government land, while 16,505 revenue/civil cases were registered and legal action taken in 940 cases. Also, 1,035 land mafias have been identified and 5,895 hectares of land was freed from illegal encroachment, claimed the report.Speaking to the media, Adityanath expressed satisfaction over the governments achievements in 100 days. He said that bringing about change in just 100 days in a big state like Uttar Pradesh, and that too with limited resources, was a challenge and the government had accepted that. He also claimed that his government was working for all sections of society without any discrimination.The chief minister further said that he wants to assure that the state government has initiated effective steps for growth and prosperity in the state. Taking a jibe at the previous SP and BSP governments, he said the state had been left behind in growth in the past 14-15 years because of corruption, pariwarvad (nepotism) and poor law and order.The chief minister said that crop loans of more than 86 lakh marginal and small farmers of upto Rs 1 lakh have been waived and the decision has caused a financial burden of Rs 36,000 crore to the state exchequer, which his government will compensate by reducing unnecessary expenditure. He further claimed that 36.99 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was procured this year, 4.5 times more than the wheat procured in the previous year.Presser becomes one-question affairA PTI report said that though it was billed to be a press conference at the Lok Bhawan, opposite the state legislature complex, the 45-year-old CM took just one question from mediapersons.Adityanath sought the cooperation of newspersons in helping him run the government when a scribe raised a question relating to the plight of small and medium newspapers. When another journalist rose to ask a question, the chief minister, with folded hands, took leave of the mediapersons.For all the latest Lucknow News, download Indian Express App"
5a06405f9855b76bf13c4b44,Globalised approach to theatremaking,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/globalised-approach-to-theatremaking/article19158671.ece,2017-06-28,"The past weekend witnessed the culmination of a global theatre project at Theater Freiburg, an independently owned cultural space in Baden-Wrttemberg, Germany, with a provenance that dates back two centuries. Since the autumn of 2015, the Human Trade Network, which is supported by the German Federal Cultural Foundation, has facilitated a creative consortium of theatre companies from three continents to research perspectives on human trafficking and modern slavery worldwide.One of the collaborating teams is the prolific Indian Ensemble from Bengaluru, which operates under the stewardship of the multifaceted Abhishek Majumdar. The four theatrical productions that emerged from this exploration were showcased at an event, dubbed The Meeting, that commenced June 21 at Theater Freiburg. Apart from the performances, it featured a packed itinerary of talks and interactions, and concluded with a joint lecture-cum-performance at the Kammerbhne (the chamber stage) involving all partners, a theatrical try-out they have been working on since coming together in Germany.Majumdars presentation was the play #supernova , performed in Hindi and Bhojpuri, which had its Indian premiere earlier this month, with two shows at the Max Mueller Bhavan, Bengaluru. Written by upcoming playwright Rahul Kumar Rai, and performed by Avneesh Mishra and Sandeep Shikhar, it recounts the tale of a young boy from eastern Uttar Pradesh who is sold to the flesh trade in Dubai. There, he acquires the online persona of #supernova, a so-called exemplar of sexual virility, an identity that sends him inexorably spiralling down the rabbit-hole of sexual subjugation.Although India has the most trafficked children in the world, Majumdar had never imagined that he would ever work on the subject. As his team researched further, they realised how the world of cyber trafficking of children is more ruthless than other conventional modes of human trade. In an interview with the Human Trade Network, Majumdar said, The morality of the Internet, the ethics of communicating online, the possibilities of every changing persona were all discoveries for me in this project. Poverty is no longer the only marker. Gullibility and susceptibility are themselves equally dangerous.Common causesThe international partners of the Human Trade Network worked in tandem with each other. This took the Indian Ensemble to Western Africas Burkina Faso in July last year, to collaborate with Ouagadougous ThtrEvasion, whose presentation is titled Adjug! . In this play, an employee in a sugar plantation is dismissed before he is entitled to a pension. He starts working as a daily wage labourer, sinking into debt. Hopes for a better life for his children soon recedes from view as the sceptre of child labour raises itself. The Romanian contribution, called Do you speak Silence? / Vorbii tcere? is a performance by Gianina Crbunariu, widely regarded as the enfant terrible of the contemporary Romanian stage. Its blurb reads, Dignity and freedom of decision - do these things play a role in buying and selling labour? What defines us apart from our strength? A game with identities, perspectives and deceptive conclusions.Also set in Romania is the German production, For Sale . Director Clemens Bechtel, who also serves as the artistic director of the Human Trade Network, has collected varied stories with a team in Bucharest, which illuminate the subject of child trafficking from myriad perspectives. On their research trips, they dealt with construction workers, butchers, caregivers, harvest hands, adoptive parents, and prostitutes. As Bechtel said, The fact that in all these cases human trafficking plays a vital role, was not clear to me beforehand. Either it was how easily I too am part of this system, or how easily I can become a human trafficker or human buyer.Cross cultural focusIt was on Bechtels invitation that Majumdar came on-board. Sometimes when the subject is so vast, and the group so rigorous, it makes absolute sense to begin ones journey on someone elses impulse, he said. Bechtel had earlier served as the artistic director of the Hunger for Trade project, which provided a similar international setting for theatre research and experimentation, to which the Indian Ensemble had contributed Thook in 2014. That play was written by Irawati Karnik and Shikhar, and focused on the effects of neo-liberal reforms on the Indian economy. This globalised approach to theatremaking, and the negotiations that ensue, brings about dialogue and a nuanced understanding of the complex issues at hand. Bechtel said, I am interested in the way people from other cultures look at such a topic, what approaches they choose in their theatrical approximation during their analysis. I want to get to know people from the countries of the south as agents, not just as victims or a surface for projections of myself.This is echoed in Majumdars prophetic words, We are heading towards the era of transience. More people would have moved home in this century than ever before in the history of mankind. We are also potentially the swan song generation of somewhat homogeneous identities and in the future we will be more mixed than ever before. [Thus] it makes absolute sense to open our vision and dialogue within a global present and not the global absent of wealthy corporations whose presence is only felt on advertisements and shelves. The possibility of a pure relationship with someone far away is crucial to humankind discussing anything at all in humanities."

He said: We want to assure the people that the government has taken initiatives needed to put the State on the path of development.With the promise of transformation and development, we took the oath of office on March 19. One hundred days are a brief period. The resources were limited, but we took up the challenge. And at this point of time, I am satisfied. In a jibe at his rivals, he said the State did not develop because of corruption and nepotism in the past.The CM said 2017 would be observed as Garib Kalyan Varsh. Uttar Pradesh is associated with Jan Sangh leader Deen Dayal Upadhyay. It is his birth as well as work place. The 100 days of the government are devoted to fulfilling the objectives of antodaya [ensuring that benefits reach the last strata of society].He said over Rs. 22,517 crore in dues were paid to sugarcane growers after he assumed office.

5a05d1889855b76bf13c115f,Booklet battle over Yogi 100 days,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170628/jsp/nation/story_159095.jsp,2017-06-28,"Lucknow, June 27: Yogi Adityanath didn't organise any programmes to mark 100 days as Uttar Pradesh chief minister, only releasing a ""booklet of achievements"" on a day that the Opposition dubbed the ""100th unfortunate day"" for the state. ""I am satisfied with 100 days of my work,"" Adityanath said, releasing the booklet at a news conference that contrasted with the grand celebrations previous chief ministers like Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati held after crossing such milestones. The booklet titled 100 Din Vishwas Ke (100 days of Trust) lists among the accomplishments the crop loan waiver scheme for marginal and small farmers, purchase of 36 lakh tonnes of wheat at state-guaranteed support prices, settling payments worth Rs 22,517 crore due to cane farmers by sugar mills, and improvement in law and order. Also on the list was a ""plan"" to observe Uttar Pradesh Day on January 24 next year. The dossier also said the BJP government was working without any bias against anybody, making the claim even as minority community protesters clashed in Muzaffarnagar with police over arrests linked to unfounded rumours of cow slaughter following complaints from gau rakshaks (cow protectors). The Congress dismissed the assertions by releasing another booklet, Sau Din, Sau Fareb (Hundred days, hundred deceits). Reminding Yogi about the BJP's election promise that all criminals would be behind bars within 45 days of the government taking charge, the Congress's pamphlet pointed out that the incidents of murder, rape, loot and robberies have increased 200 to 400 per cent under the new administration. Farm-related claims were rejected too. ""The government has purchased only 33.90 lakh MT wheat from farmers at the support price. The payment of sugarcane farmers is still awaited,"" the Congress report said. State Congress spokesperson Akhilesh Pratap Singh reminded Yogi that his party had promised to purchase 80 million tonnes of wheat this year and termed the cane-payment claim to farmers a ""big lie"". Singh also questioned the law and order picture. ""While the chief minister was holding his news conference, the body of a six-year-old girl was found in Lucknow's Thakurganj area. She was kidnapped yesterday evening by unidentified people and the police had refused to register a case at that time. We are passing through an unfortunate time."" The police claimed it would nab the killers with the help of CCTV footage, only to be left red-faced after a few hours when it emerged that none of the cameras in the locality were functional. ""Before that, an undergraduate student of Bareilly succumbed to burn injuries this morning. This is the law and order situation,"" Singh said. A youth had poured kerosene on the girl, the daughter of a constable, and set her on fire when she resisted sexual assault last night. The police registered a case only after she died. ""Yogi had asked his ministers and officers to declare their assets within 15 days. But the majority of ministers and officers have refused to follow his orders,"" said Satyadev Tripathi, the state Congress's media in-charge. Mayawati gave the BJP government a ""zero"" and said ""crime has reached its peak in 100 days"". ""The Adityanath government is following Narendra Modi government at the Centre in cheating the masses. The two governments are happy because their own saffron-clad people are involved in criminal activities."" The BSP chief appeared to be alluding to today's Muzaffarnagar clashes, stoked by the gau-rakshaks' complaints. The locals, angry because three persons were arrested despite no evidence of cow slaughter, damaged a police jeep and threw stones at the cops. A large police picket has been deployed at the spot in the Kassawan locality. ""Today's incidents are enough evidence that the law and order has collapsed and the Adityanath government has failed to provide security to the people. It was 100th unfortunate day for Uttar Pradesh,"" said Rajendra Chaudhary, the chief spokesperson of the Samajwadi Party."

Traders from accross the country called for a shut down. PTI PhotoA train was stopped by traders in Uttar Pradesh and commercial establishments and wholesale commodity markets in some cities remained closed today in protest against the ""hasty"" rollout of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime.As the GST was set for an ambitious rollout, Kashmir Traders and Manufacturers Federation (KTMF) called for a general strike in the Valley tomorrow against the new unified tax system.Protests against the GST broke out in different parts of Uttar Pradesh over ""anomalies and complexities"" in the GST while commercial establishments in major cities in Madhya Pradesh were closed as part of a bandh called by traders.A trade bandh call by Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal (BUVM) in West Bengal against the ""hasty"" rollout of the GST evoked mixed reaction.Trade and industry bodies in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana urged the Centre to be lenient for at least one year on filing of returns as many more businesses come under the GST regime for the first time.In Uttar Pradesh, Kanpur was one of the main centres of the protest with office bearers of trade organisations taking part. Reports of protests also came in from Varanasi, Allahabad, Jhansi, Faizabad, Shahjahanpur and Ghaziabad.Traders in Kanpur squatted on rail tracks and stopped the Kanpur-Pratapgarh passenger train.The traders led by 'Akhil Bhartiya Udyog Vyapar Mandal' leader Gyanendra Misra protested at the Lucknow railway crossing around 9.47 AM and stopped the local train.It was only when the GRP personnel rushed to the spot and removed the protesters from the tracks that the train could resume its journey, Railway sources said, adding there was, however, no disturbance by the protesters at the main station.The wholesale and retail markets in Kanpur werer closed with the trade organisations taking out processions in the market areas throughout the city.The bandh call was given by Uttar Pradesh Udyog Vyapar Pratinidhi Mandal, which also got the support of around 50 trade organisations.""We are not against the GST.

Branded grains, rice, sugar and atta will be levied a five per cent GST.According to Ravindra Modi, president of the Federation of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry, it would take at least six months for the trade to get accustomed to the new regime.""...There are some issues that need clarity. We will learn about it only after implementation,"" Modi said.""Many more new traders and service providers will now come under the tax fold. They need some time to become familiar with the taxation and filing systems,"" he said.In Madhya Pradesh, shops in main cities like Bhopal, Indore, Gwalior, and Jabalpur downed their shutters while commercial activities remained suspended in small towns as well. The bandh was called by various organisations of traders.In Bhopal, important commercial markets like MP Nagar, New Market, Chowk, Bairagarh, BHEL township etc. largely remained closed.""We are not against the GST but are protesting its anomalies and complexities. The Centre is going to impose this new tax regime without any prior preparation. The government has not taken traders into confidence,"" Bhopal Chamber of Commerce and Industries general secretary Vishnu Bansal said.Bansal said a total of 72 traders' organisations extended their support to today's bandh.According to Bansal, business in almost all major cities and towns in MP was affected due to the bandh.In West Bengal, impact was visible in shops of Burrabazar, Asia's biggest wholesale market and the city's prominent retail hub New Market, as they downed their shutters.There were reports of many retail stores remaining closed in various parts of Kolkata and the state.""The bandh is in protest against the procedures and provisions of GST, "" an official of the Federation of West Bengal Trade Associations said. He said response to the bandh was mixed in the districts.The KTMF while calling for a general strike in Kashmir Valley tomorrow said they will not allow the implementation of this new law, even if we have to sacrifice their lives.""We will not allow the erosion of our special status. We are giving a call for Kashmir bandh tomorrow,"" KTMF president Muhammad Yasin Khan said."

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is also seen. (PTI)NEW DELHI: At the stroke of midnight, India finally embraced the Goods and Services Tax (GST), explained by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as ""Good and Simple Tax"", with members of Parliament as witnesses to the epochal transition.Modi drew parallel with the monumental exercise of unification of hundreds of princely states by India's first Home Minister Sardar Ballabh Bhai Patel, saying that the GST is likewise unveiling economic integration of the country.Even while the grand occasion at the Central Hall of Parliament lost the lustre of unity in the political class following the boycott by the Congress, Trinamool Congress and the RJD, the Prime Minister credited the rollout of the GST to the success of cooperative federalism and democracy in the country. ""From Ganganagar to Itanagar and from Leh to Lakshadweep, GST will unveil one nation, one tax,"" said Modi.With President Pranab Mukherjee keenly listening, Modi recalled the journey of the GST, which began with the former PM Atal Bihari Vajpayee constituting a committee under Vijay Kelkar and afterwards the introduction of the Constitution Amendment Bill in 2006 and underlined the collective efforts of different governments and stakeholders.The PM seemed aware of the possibility of the glitches and pains to traders, as he suggested that time is needed to adjust to transition even while he cautioned people from rumour mongering.Seeking to give an esteemed position to the momentous event, Modi noted that Gita has 18 chapters as had been the number of meetings of the GST Council. Referring to a host of luminaries, including Albert Einstein, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Chanakya, the Prime Minister sugar-coated the rollout of the GST strongly as a decisive step to uplift the conditions of the poor. ""The additional resources will help eastern Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand and Bihar to join the path of economic prosperity,"" Modi noted.Apparently addressing the concerns that the rollout of the GST may mark the return of the Inspector Raj, the Prime Minister stressed that the simplicity of the measure, in contrast, would end tax terrorism and help the country improve ease of doing business, besides boosting exports.Invoking the ideals of ""New India"", Modi said that the rollout of the GST will herald ""Ek Bharat-Shresht Bharat"".President Pranab Mukherjee too retraced the journey of the GST and said that he had been personally attached to the monumental exercise.Both President and the Prime Minister jointly pressed the button to inaugurate the GST.Earlier speaking on the occasion, Finance Minister Arun Jaitely said that the rollout of the GST signified India rising above narrow politics while stating that the old India was economically fragmented.""With the rollout of the GST, India is awakening to limitless possibility. While the old India was economically fragmented, new India will write a new destination with the Centre and states working toward shared prosperity,"" Jaitely said in his introductory remark, while noting the consensual approach adopted in the meetings of the GST Council."

He wants to be a doctor. For the 17-year-old, a degree from one of the top medical colleges is the sure-shot way to a secure job in government-run hospitals, which in turn will ensure upward social mobility for him and his family.Determined as he is, Raunak an above average student, also knows that mere school education may not help him achieve his dream. He also knows that the key to admission in MBBS and BDS courses in the best medical colleges of India is a good ranking in the national eligibility entrance test (NEET).It was to gain that cutting edge needed to crack the NEET that Raunak, a resident of Gorakhpur in Uttar Pradesh, decided to head to Kota, the district in Rajasthan that is now known as coaching capital of India.Gupta is one of the nearly 1.25 lakh students who have made Kota their temporary home while preparing for two of the countrys toughest examinations --- NEET and IIT-JEE.Stories behind storiesKota, with its coaching centres selling the success dreams, represents the perennial struggle of the Indian middle class and its aspirations to escape the life of mediocrity. Every time results of competitive exams are declared, the coaching centres come out with full page advertisements in newspapers highlighting their success stories. The ads invariably have stories written by successful candidates who detail how they wouldnt have made it to the top without the help of the coaching centres.Town situated on the Chambal bank is home to 40 institutes. (HT Photo)The ads, however, dont tell the full story. They dont tell about the thousands who fail to crack the exams. They dont tell about the students who didnt turn out to be good enough to escape the life of mediocrity, and will live hating it. They also dont tell stories of those who couldnt cope with the competition and the pressure to perform and gave up, taking the extreme step of committing suicide.Suicide hub?More than 60 students took the extreme step in the past six years owing mostly to pressure or failure. Last year, 17 students killed themselves. At least 12 students have already committed suicide in Kota in 2017, the last being a medical aspirant from Bihar who killed herself days before NEET results were declared.The suicides have naturally led to apprehensions among parents. When Raunak told his parents in April that he wanted to shift to Kota to prepare for the NEET, his father put his foot down.The moment I said I wanted to go to Kota, my father refused. He said there are a lot of cases of students going into depression and committing suicide in Kota and he suggested that I go to Kanpur instead, says Raunak.It took days of persuasion to convince his father, who owns a drug store in Gorakhpur, to let Raunak go to Kota for a year. He now has taken up a room in Kunhadi area, where a mini city has come up with tall, glitzy hostels and paying guest accommodations catering to the coaching institutes.In six years, 60 students have killed themselves in Kota. (AH Zaidi/HT Photo)The citys Indra Vihar area, home to the countrys biggest coaching institute with 79,000 students on rolls in Kota alone, bustles with activity on a summer afternoon, even as temperatures soar 40 degree Celsius.Youngsters, entering their second growth spurt, walk hurriedly and purposefully, in greyish-blue uniforms, the colour of the trousers only a few shades darker than the colour of shirts. The teachers, all of them males, with six-figure monthly salaries, drive around in their swanky vehicles.Newcomers to the city, usually couples along with their children, clutching handbags, ostensibly with money for coaching fee that is generally around Rs 1 lakh for a year, take breaks from the heat at roadside stalls offering sugarcane juice and mango shakes.No full stop hereKotas competitive atmosphere attracts people from all parts of the country. The student deaths, however, has gained it some notoriety too.For those who have been living in Kota for more than a year, a suicide and the subsequent media report means a frantic call from home. And most of the parents, according to students, have a standard way of addressing the concern  he or she need not have committed suicide...you must not take any stress.The concern is always there. My father tells me not to worry if I am unable to crack the exam, says Vandana Bharti, a native of Saharsa, Bihar, a Class 12 student at a school in Kota. She is also preparing for the NEET.Prabhat Kumar has reached Kota from Muzaffarpur in Bihar. He says his son wanted to come to Kota immediately after Class 10 examinations to prepare for IIT-JEE. But I told him to wait for two years. One reason was the reports of depression and suicides that emanate from here, says Kumar, an advocate at Muzaffarpur civil court.Kumar adds that he would have been fine with his son pursuing a graduation degree and that his son was free to come back home anytime he felt he was unable to handle the pressure.Antaryami Kaushik, a resident of Sri Ganganagar is in Kota to get his 16-year-old son admitted to a coaching institute. Kaushik says his wife will stay with their son as he prepares for IIT-JEE. The son of a close friend is also staying here with my son. My wife and my friends wife will alternately come and stay here with the children, says Kaushik, a teacher in a government college.Celebrations at a coaching institute after one of its student was declared the topper of JEE MAINS 2017. (AH Zaidi/HT Photo)Kaushik adds that the main reason he wants his wife to stay with the children is the disquiet caused by the reports of suicides.Life moves onWhile the fears do encroach upon the hearts and minds of parents, it has not deterred them from sending their children to Kota. Incidentally, none of the students HT talked to said that they were forced into the competition by their parents.Kota has six to eight major coaching institutes, apart from some 35 minor ones, according to district administration.The coaching industry in Kota has grown consistently in the past decade, both in terms of enrolment as well as the number of coaching institutes. Many a times, a group of teachers defect from a major institute and establish their own setup, so the number keeps growing, says Rajeev Jain, professor of management studies at University of Kota.Allen Career Institute, the biggest player in the coaching industry, has 79,000 enrolled students. The number was 60,000 three years ago.Another major institute, Resonance has some 25,000 students at its Kota centres. The institute too has registered a growth of few thousand in the past three years, an official from the institute said.As the evening approaches and the temperatures dip, more uniformed students appear on the streets. Some hang around food joints, some go about talking on their cellphones -- one goes around fidgeting with a Rubiks cube  while a giant TV screen plays promotional videos with bytes of former toppers vouching for the coaching institutes.The coaching industry of Indias coaching capital marches on with its usual ruthlessness"

The village is currently in the limelight as the farmers have restarted their demand seeking hiked land compensation and have launched an indefinite fast from Sunday.Tyagi was detained near the Delhi border and brought to the Harsaon police lines on Sunday afternoon, but said that a delegation of Parliamentarians will soon head to Mandola.He said that he is already in talks with Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi, Rashtriya Lok Dal chief Ajit Singh, Sharad Yadav of Janata Dal (United) and CPI (M) leader Sitaram Yechuri over the issue of Mandola farmers.The farmers want hiked compensation as per the new Act. The state government and the district administration have shown a stepmotherly treatment. During the recent agitation, the farmers, including women, were beaten up by the police and denied them medical examination. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) assumed power in UP highlighting the issues of farmers, but their conduct is not appreciated in Mandola, Tyagi said.There have been nearly a 45% increase in farmer suicides in the last three years and a payment of Rs 2,335 crore to sugarcane farmers in UP is still pending. We still appeal to the state government and the district administration to look into the demands made by Mandola farmers. Otherwise, a major agitation will be launched and the state government will have to take the responsibility, he said.Ahead of Tyagis visit, the district magistrate on Saturday had promulgated prohibitory orders. During earlier meetings with farmers, the district administration has clarified that the issue of compensation hike can only be directed by the Supreme Court as the petitions of the farmers were already dismissed by the Allahabad high court.Ghaziabad police detained Tyagi along with nearly 100 supporters and politicians who sympathised with the farmers in their bid to demand a hike in land compensation.The Mandola Housing Scheme, estimated to construct nearly 12,000 affordable housing units, is under construction in Loni near Delhi border. The project, pegged at Rs 3,000 crore, is already facing delays. According to UP Housing Board officials, only 4,000 flats got occupied till now; another 4,000 were being constructed and bookings were reduced due to unjustified demands by the farmers. The board is in possession of nearly 2,300 acres of land, out of the total 2,610 acres planned for the scheme. For the land it acquired, it has paid a compensation at the rate of Rs 1,100 per square metre.We detained the Rajya Sabha member and others near Sonia Vihar border. They were trying to proceed to Mandola, but prohibitory orders are already clamped. They were later taken to police lines and detained. In case the farmers want more compensation, they must move Supreme Court. They have disrupted construction activities and are causing delay to the project, said Gynendra Singh, additional district magistrate."

UP CM Yogi Adityanath said the Budget is dedicated to village, poor, farmer and women, adding that over Rs 240 crore has been set aside for development and promotion of cultural heritage and religious tourism.The Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh Tuesday presented its maiden Budget worth Rs 3,84,659 crore, 11 per cent more than the one presented by the previous Samajwadi Party government. It included an allocation of Rs 36,000 crore to meet its poll promise of a crop loan waiver, and Rs 55,781 crore for new schemes. Having discontinued funds for some welfare and freebie schemes launched by his predecessor, the chief minister claimed that his government was able to make provisions for the loan waiver by cutting down on shashan ki fizulkharchi (extravagant expenses of the government).Presented by Finance Minister Rajesh Agarwal, the Budget showed a deficit of Rs 7,468 crore for the year 2017-2018 after deduction of the total expenditure from receipts of the consolidated fund. Reminding the House about the overwhelming majority with which the present government had come to power, Agarwal started his speech by saying, Rashtra ki asmita ke prateek maryada purshotam bhagwan Ram ka smaran karna humari pratibadhta hai.Adityanath said the Budget is dedicated to village, poor, farmer and women, adding that over Rs 240 crore has been set aside for development and promotion of cultural heritage and religious tourism. Agarwal said special schemes had been formulated to promote and preserve cultural heritage as the younger generation is moving away from them. Apart from a Geeta Sodh Sansthan, a Krishna Museum would be built and a Bhajan Sandhya Sthal would come up in Ayodhya and Chitrakoot, he said, adding that the government had set a target 10 per cent growth rate in five years.Apart from the farmers loan waiver, the state government has earmarked a large chunk of funds for the education sector.Over Rs 21,000 crore has been allocated as the states share for various central government schemes, and another Rs 600 crore for state-run schemes for students. These state-run schemes would be aimed at providing shoes, socks, sweaters, schoolbags, uniforms and books to students. The government will also provide free education to girls till graduation and free WiFi facilities in colleges and universities.Central schemes, including Rs 3255 crore for building toilets under Swachha Bharat Mission (Rural) Scheme will also get a considerable amount as the states share. A considerable sum has been set aside for projects like metro rail, a sugarcane research centre and an AIIMS in the CMs home district Gorakhpur.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A higher crop output is anticipated following increased sowing of rice and pulses when compared with the last season.The latest Union Agriculture department data showed that across the country, kharif crops have been planted on 563.17 lakh hectares till now, as against 521.80 lakh hectares in the corresponding period last year.Increase in acreageWith the sowing of crops apace during the past few days across the country, paddy (rice) has been sown in 125.77 lakh hectares in the current season till July 14, which is marginally higher than the 120.32 lakh hectares recorded in the 2016-17 season. The acreage under pulses has been recorded at 74.61 lakh hectares till now, as against the 60.28 lakh hectares of the corresponding period for the last season.The sowing of coarse cereals is up as well, at 113.06 lakh hectares against the 98.79 lakh hectares of last year.

To make this possible, the key action point under the PFA is to bring down the UPPCLs power purchase cost that constitutes 80% its overall expenses, says the corporation in one of the notices served in respect of the Bajajs Barkhera thermal plant.In the same notice, it has been pointed out that the UPPCL purchased 354.52 million units of power from this plant during 2016-17 for Rs 8.04 per unit which was among the highest and around 111.58% higher as compared to average power purchase cost of Rs 3.80 per unit.Meanwhile, UP Rajya Vidyut Upbhokta Parishad president Avadhesh Kumar Verma has urged the power regulator (UPERA) to accordingly revise the UPPCLs annual revenue requirement (ARR) proposal to minimize tariff hike.Verma said states consumers were facing the heat since the UPPCL was passing the burden on them through the tariff. He said the UPPCL in its ARR had proposed to buy power worth Rs 1773 crore at an average rate of Rs 7.22 per unit from the Bajajs five plants during 2017-18.Now when, the UPPCL has terminated the PPAs for costly power, the ARR should be revised accordingly so that consumers get relief when the tariff is revised in September-October, Verma demanded.The UPPCL had earlier terminated the contracts for setting up nine power plants under the MoU routes on the Yogi Adityanath governments directives after it was found that the private developers that had bagged the contracts during the Mayawati regime had not done sufficient work on the proposed sites despite getting time extensions during both Mayawati and Akhilesh Yadav regimes."

Pramod Kumar, Amit Kumar alias Billu, Sohanveer, and Nepal alias Goverdhan were arrested following a shootout, while four others, including the cab driver, are still at large.Preliminary interrogation and investigation have revealed absconding siblings Sushil and Anuj, both residents of Dadri village, as the main accused. They allegedly roped in their neighbours Gaurav Sharma and Vivek alias Modi for the abduction, said the police.The victim, a native of Telangana and resident of Delhi, works with Metro Hospital. Dr. Goud had booked a cab around 11 p.m. on July 6 from Preet Vihar to Gautam Nagar, where he lives on rent.The driver assigned to him was one who had joined the cab aggregator just three days before the incident and Dr. Goud was his first customer. The police said the cab aggregators nodal officer gave them the car owners documents, including Aadhaar Card, PAN card, cheque leaf, driving licence, company registration certificate, certificate of fitness and insurance policy certificate.Car owner illiterateAll documents were found to be fake during investigation, said Joint Commissioner of Police (Eastern Range) Ravindra Yadav, adding that this made it extremely difficult to ascertain the identities of the abductors.Most documents were in the name of Shalimar Bagh resident Vinita Devi. She is illiterate and uses a thumb impression for bank transactions. She has never been issued a cheque book, said the officer.Lapses in verificationOn lapses in verification, a cab aggregator source said the abductor had tried to associate himself with the company four time earlier and managed to get in the fifth time. This clearly implies criminal intent, he said.Interestingly, the ransom call for Rs. 5 crore was made to the company instead of the victims family. The abductors had called the customer care helpline stating that they had kidnapped the passenger.They were absolutely certain the company would pay the ransom for the sake of its reputation. They also felt that the cab aggregator had the capacity to pay the huge amount, said Mr. Yadav.Calls from across UPRansom calls from different locations in Uttar Pradesh made using the doctors phone, which the accused would switch off immediately after the calls, made it difficult to trace their location. Mr. Yadav said several teams were formed and they camped in difficult conditions to crack the case.The teams camped in villages, fields, canals and jungles to ensure the doctors successful recovery. The areas covered by them included Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr, Baghpat, Hapur, Meerut, Bijnor, Muzaffarnagar and Haridwar, he claimed.The police also spoke to disgruntled Ola drivers to analyse their profile for clues but in vain. The police finally nabbed the four accused with help of technical surveillance and human intelligence.On July 16, the police received a tip-off and followed a vehicle purportedly transporting the abductors. However, the accused managed to give the police a slip by fleeing inside sugar cane fields at Daurala village.They left the car behind, which helped understand their plan and gave us a broad idea of their location, said Mr. Yadav.He added that there were masks, aluminium foil and rubber bands in the car, which the abductors might have planned to use after receiving the ransom.Detailed planThe police received yet another tip-off on Wednesday that Dr. Gouds was being held at Partapur village. The police team surrounded the house. During the shootout, one of the accused got injured in the left leg. Dr. Goud was rescued and handed over to his family, said Mr. Yadav.The police said the accused had planned the abduction in detail, including carrying out the crime during Kanwar season and wearing saffron clothes to conceal their identities."

(Representational image) In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. (Representational image)Just 18 months ago, Jalna farmer Chandrakant Kshirsagar sold the couple of quintals of tur (pigeon pea) he produces at Rs 8,000 a quintal. This year, after waiting months for prices to rise, he finally sold his produce at Rs 4,000 a quintal, making exactly half last years earnings even as his input costs have grown.Other farmers who sold at Rs 3,200 a quintal had fared so much worse, he reasons, explaining why pulse producers, all habituated to volatility in pulse prices, are still the angriest among Maharashtras farmers this year. Many of them small and marginal farmers especially in Marathwada where Latur and Nanded districts produce tur, urad and moong in large quantities, pulse farmers fully anticipated a bumper crop in 2016-17.An excellent monsoon had followed two consecutive drought years, prices were sky-high last year, and there was a government-induced increase in acreage of pulses. Everybody knew we would have an excellent output. And still, we now have a glut of imports, so much so that the oversupply will not end any time soon, says Rajan Kshirsagar, a farmer and Left leader from Parbhani in Marathwada, a mostly dryland farming region that produces much of Maharashtras approximately 1.5 million tonnes of pulses annually.Current wholesale rates for tur are still approximately Rs 3,700 a quintal. And to add to farmers woes at having to sell way below the MSP of Rs 5,050 a quintal, there are allegations that cartelised traders abused the governments procurement process by selling to government centres at the MSP, at huge profits. Maharashtra is a major pulse-producing state, among the top four.While pulse farming across India is largely unirrigated, the problem is more acute in Maharashtra, where only 8.7 per cent of land under pulses is irrigated, making the 16 per cent share of Maharashtra in Indias pulse production especially vulnerable to monsoon shocks. (In Uttar Pradesh, 35.1 per cent of area under pulses is irrigated).It follows naturally that the plentiful monsoon of 2016-17, and government policy promoting pulse production, saw area under pulses in Maharashtra grow from 20,06,000 hectare in 2015-16 to 25,57,000 hectare  a 28 per cent rise. From 6,11,000 tonnes last year, output ballooned to an estimated 17,51,000 tonnes, a 187 per cent rise.In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. But everybody is unanimous that the reduction in acreage will not help tackle the existing oversupply.Maharashtras farmers are sowing less tur because of crashing prices, but supply will not come down so soon. The rains are going to be good, so it is a reasonable assessment that prices will remain depressed, says Dr Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.Also, price volatility in pulses, a cyclical problem, is neither peculiar to Maharashtra nor unusual. Dr Joshi says the massive volatility in pulse prices has been a constant phenomenon over the last 15 years or so. Every third year there is a price spike and then a crash, and the volatility is directly linked to production. Farmers look at experience of high prices and sow more, so prices fluctuate.Dr Joshi believes a 10 per cent price increase annually is good incentive from farmers perspective, but a mechanism needs to be devised to smoothen prices. Firstly, you have to de-risk agriculture from rains  irrigation is key. Alongside that, better food management can ensure that volatility is kept under control, through buffer stocks and other measures.That import arrivals of pulses continued even as it became apparent that there is a bumper crop locally contributed to the glut. Structural solutions are needed from a long-term perspective, but in the short term, various devices on imports, buffers and so on are needed.Nitin Kalantry, one of Laturs larger pulse traders, says imports from Africa are at about Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,300 a quintal and from Burma at Rs 3,400 a quintal. So prices will definitely not rise dramatically in the near future, he says. In addition, Kalantry says, theres a 1.10 million tonne buffer stock with the government at the all-India level and traders are wondering how and when this will be disposed of. Also, he says farmers continue to hold about 15 per cent of their stocks, hoping prices will rise.Also, while government buyouts themselves will not suffice to tackle the oversupply, many say the procurement process itself should have been better streamlined. Kshirsagar, the Parbhani leader, says there was negligence and poor planning in procurement. First there were only 17 procurement centres, and too few were added later. Then farmers were first told to bring their produce, and they waited there while incurring rent for the vehicles, then they were told to take a token and make deliveries later, he says, adding that thousands of farmers also received delayed payments.MahaFPC, a consortium of Farmer Producer Companies, which demonstrated a procurement intervention in the 2016-17 season in parts of the state with a transparent system for farmers, says there are many policy interventions needed to improve the procurement process. Inadequate warehousing and procurement infrastructure in the producing states, unpreparedness of the state nodal agencies and political interference in procurement operations created mismanagement and failed to stabilise the markets, says Yogesh Thorat, MD of MahaFPC, adding that a huge majority of pulse farmers may have sold below MSP.Thorat adds that while commodity futures markets are in an infancy stage, they may help reduce market risks for pulse farmers despite fears that trading in futures may be highly speculative, without any actual delivery of the commodity. Recently SEBI allowed NCDEX to launch chana futures. Presently these trading platforms are in the hands of middlemen, hence neither farmers nor consumers are benefitted.Farmer Producer Companies are coming forward to participate in these markets for physical delivery of commodities, a good sign, and futures can be a crucial instrument to regulate price trend. All kinds of marketing avenues should be open for better price realisation and price stabilisation in pulses, Thorat says.Tuesday: Sugar, not sweet for farmersFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File photo) Maharashtra produces 36 per cent of the countrys sugar stock. (File photo)Well over two years since the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party lost power in Maharashtra, the states sugar barons are still coming to terms with the loss of political patronage for the sugar sector. Known for their political significance during the previous regime, while the major sugar millers with deep-rooted networks in the cooperatives and farms now find themselves isolated from the power centres, they say the sector  with a Rs 50,000 crore annual turnover in the state  is suffering on account of political neglect.Sugar has been a historically important commodity in Maharashtra, given its socio-political relevance. The state produces 36 per cent of the countrys sugar stock, making it the largest producer of the sweetener in the country. India is the second largest producer of sugar in the world and is the largest consumer as well.The sugar sector in Maharashtra, besides its huge annual turnovers, is also a major employment generator in rural areas. Naturally, the position of sugar in the states economics cannot be overstated  any distortion in production gets planners in a tizzy.On paper, the state has 175 cooperative and 72 private erected mills, but the number of mills that actually participate in a season have been fewer. In fact, sugar production in 2016-17 fell considerably, with back to back droughts leading production to fall to only 42 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar as compared to the 84.1 lakh tonnes in the previous season. For the coming season, the state is projected to produce around 70 lt of sugar, still much lower than the 100 lt mark the state reached a few seasons back.Historically, the sugar sector in Maharashtra has always been close to power. Sugar barons  barring a few  have been inclined towards the Congress and Nationalist Congress Party, with the latter holding sway over the sugar-rich western Maharashtra region through a close relationship with the rural elite, this political patronage bringing growth to the region but also pitfalls.In drought-prone parts of western Maharashtra itself where there is plenty of cane cultivation, such as in Solapur, and in large pockets of Marathwada too, sugar cultivation is at the centre of a controversy for the sheer quantum of water needed for these stretches of farmland.What ails the farm sector part-1: Maharashtra farmers angry despite bumper pulse harvest, prices crash on oversupply | Click here to readThe district of Solapur is a classic case of the growth of sugar sector in an otherwise drought-prone area. Annually, the district receives barely 550-650 mm of rain. Yet, the district has 38 installed mills  the most for any district in the state. In its report on Pricing Policy of Sugarcane: 2013-14, the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Pricing (CACP), Ministry of Agriculture, draws some harsh truth about the states cane group. It says for production of 1 kg of sugar, Maharashtra requires 2,068 litres of water whereas Uttar Pradesh requires about 1,044 litres, making the water stress caused by the crop in drought-prone regions a serious problem.Adding to the imbalance is that while barely 20 per cent of Maharashtras farm lands are irrigated, almost 80 per cent of existing irrigation facilities in the state are concentrated in cane-growing areas. This anomaly, for a crop that occupies just about 10 lakh hectares of land, means that one single crop has cornered the major portion of irrigation facilities. Water experts including Indias waterman Rajendra Singh, as well as multiple reports of the CACP, have discussed the option of mandating drip irrigation for cane.Amid the intensifying debate on the inequitable water distribution in favour of sugar, the state has recently made it compulsory for cane growers to install drip irrigation systems. Despite the efforts, until now, only 30 per cent of Maharashtras cane-growing area has come under drip irrigation, with growers complaining of difficulties in raising finance for the project. Subsidies are hard to come by, say farmers.Environmentalist Vishambhar Choudhari points to the water-intensive nature of cane and says a compulsory drip system is a good move. The cane crop doesnt add much in terms of soil nutrients but the fixed returns lure farmers to it, he says. The only way farmers can be weaned away from cane, he says, is to ensure equal and better returns for other crops such as pulses.Simultaneously, the changes in the political landscape have meant sugar barons are no longer assured of a sympathetic ear in the government. For millers, for example, easy access to finance from government institutions has disappeared. Minister of Cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, whose family runs three private mills under the Lokmangal banner, has repeatedly talked about the need for millers to spruce up their act. To cite one example, millers have been asking for the last two years for a restructuring of the soft loan extended to them to pay growers from the 2013-14 season, but the government has not accepted their demand. Millers are at present repaying the Rs 3,000 crore extended to them by the state and central government.Shivajirao Nagawade Patil, president of the Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation, says the market for the states sugar has shrunk over the last two years. Earlier we used to send sugar to Kolkata but the transport costs have made that uneconomical, he says. Uttar Pradesh, Nagawade Patil says, has captive markets in Rajasthan, Delhi and other states that continue to elude Maharashtras millers. We have been asking for restructuring of loans but the government is yet to respond, he says.Congress MLA and director of Latur-based Manjara Cooperative Sugar Mill Amit Deshmukh cites the state governments refusal to execute a power purchase agreement (PPA) with the mills as another example of official apathy towards the sector. The state government has consistently refused to accept the Rs 6 per unit rate quoted by the millers to sell excess power generated through cogeneration plants. A special committee has been formed to look into the matter now.For growers, cane is almost akin to a salaried crop  assurance of a fair and remunerative price (FRP) by the mills at the end of season is one of the most important reasons that growers opt for it. However, rising production costs now pose a challenge for growers as well. Prahlad Ingole, a farmer from Ardhapur taluka of Nanded taluka, says that for an acre of cane the costs of inputs come to almost around Rs 50,000 this year. With increasing water stress it is becoming difficult for us to make our ends meet, he says. Overall the situation for the sugar sector, the sweetness appears to be missing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilizers (RCF), Chambal Fertilisers and Chemicals and Deepak Fertilisers and Petrochemicals Corporation are among the scrips that touched their 52-week highs on the stock exchanges on Tuesday.The RCF stock led the pack with a 10.1% jump to end the day at Rs 97 on the BSE and was followed by Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals that surged by nearly 10%. RCF and Nagarjuna were among the top-10 gainers on Tuesday. The Chambal Fertilisers scrip was up by about 5.2% while the Tuticorin Alkali Chemicals and Fertilisers and the Madras Fertilizers stocks posted 4.8% and 3.3% gains respectively during the day.""The demand for fertilisers in H1 (first half) FY2018 (2017-18) should witness good recovery, given the lower base for H1 FY2017 (2016-17) and satisfactory progress shown by monsoons leading to growth in kharif sowing,"" said K Ravichandran, senior vice president and group head, corporate ratings, ICRA.The area under kharif crops increased 3.3% year-on-year to 7.91 crore hectares during the 2017-18 season, data compiled by the Ministry of Agriculture for up to July 28 showed. The area under pulses went up 6.9% y-o-y to around 1.15 crore hectares during the timeframe. The Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a normal monsoon for 2017-18. Monsoon showers have been well-distributed so far with cumulative rainfall at 102% of the long period average. Interestingly, the sowing for cash crops such as sugarcane, which see extensive use of fertilisers, has shot up during the current kharif season. While the area under sugarcane increased 8.7% y-o-y to 49.15 lakh hectares, cotton sowing jumped 20.8% y-o-y to 1.12 crore hectares, data showed.But some market experts are advising caution given the steep increase in prices of these scrips. ""Valuation comfort is not there as PE (price-to-earnings) multiples are quite high,"" said G Chokkaligam, founder and managing director, Equinomics Research and Advisory.Incidentally, ratings agency Crisil has estimated that tractor sales would hit an all-time high of over 6.5 lakh units during FY2018 on the back off normal monsoon, declining interest rates and farm loan waivers by state governments. Agricultural loan waivers in states such as Maharashtra, Punjab, and Uttar Pradesh will also put more money in the hands of farmers, the agency said."

About 48 km from one end to another, Bawana is one of Delhis largest and most varied Assembly segments, with lush green villages existing alongside crowded, unauthorised slum clusters.Ahead of the August 23 bypoll in the reserved constituency, home to over three lakh voters, The Indian Express follows the campaign of the BJP, AAP and the Congress to understand why the contest holds great significance for each party.About 48 km from one end to another, Bawana is one of Delhis largest and most varied Assembly segments, with lush green villages existing alongside crowded, unauthorised slum clusters. Punctuating these are a few pockets of Rohini, mostly comprising vacant DDA flats. Ahead of the August 23 bypoll, Bawana is also ground zero for a pitched battle between the BJP, the AAP and the Congress. To understand the significance of this bypoll, one only needs to look at what is at stake for each party.For the AAP, which won the 2015 elections with a resounding majority, Bawana offers a chance to overturn two electoral losses  the Punjab Assembly elections and the MCD polls. The BJP, on the other hand, hopes to build on the momentum from the victory in MCD polls. But the highest stakes, perhaps, are for the Congress, which, for the first time in the history of Delhis politics, has not had representation in the Delhi Assembly and hopes to finally win its sole seat. The contest, though, is anything but easy.At the BJP office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha) At the BJP office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha)One of the 12 reserved seats in the 70-member Delhi Assembly, Bawanas 26 rural villages have traditionally voted for the BJP, and the colonies have traditionally voted for the Congress. The pattern began to change from 1998, five years after Bawana was declared a reserved seat, when an influx of migrants from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar moved to the colonies in the area, tilting the electoral advantage in favour of the Congress  so much so that their candidate, Surender Kumar, remained the legislator from1998 to 2013.But with Kumar losing to the BJP in 2013, and AAP winning the seat in 2015, none of the three parties are confident of which way the wind is blowing, with party leaders maintaining that it all depends on the voter turnout. The fact that the issues the residents are facing vary every few kilometres makes coming up with a strategy that much harder. At Bawana village  the largest of the 26 rural villages  Om Prakash Rana (45) explained, The villages are very different from the colonies. Here, the concerns are that fertilizers are expensive, seeds are hard to get and water for irrigation is poor. Water is a problem on both sides, but here its more pronounced because the need is more. Plus, in the last few years, our crops were destroyed by hailstorms. That is also a major concern.In comparison, at Shahbad Dairy  the largest of the slum clusters in the area  Ram Kumar, a migrant from Madhubani district in Bihar, said, We dont own land here. We barely have any space to live. I have been working as a labourer for a decade. All I want is to earn enough to eat and drink, and make a decent salary so my children can go to school. What unites these two distinct areas of Bawana, though, is the sense of waste that the bypoll entails. With Assembly elections in Delhi scheduled in less than three years, residents maintained that the election is a waste of taxpayer money.***The bypoll was necessitated after AAP legislator Ved Parkash quit the Delhi Assembly just ahead of the municipal polls to join the BJP. Parkash, who had been in the BJP until 2015, fought the Assembly polls that year as an AAP candidate after being denied a ticket by his former party. Speaking to The Indian Express, he explained his reason for leaving AAP for the BJP this time: They turned Delhi into a launching pad for Punjab. I kept telling Kejriwal and other leaders that this is not why the people of Delhi had voted for us. But they wouldnt listen. Everything, from what was being said in press conferences to what would be asked at the Delhi Assembly, was coordinated and pre-decided. How can anyone work like that?At the AAP office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha) At the AAP office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha)He added, If I hadnt left the party then, my political career would have been finished. I have another 20 years left; for me coming back to the BJP was like a ghar wapsi. BJP leaders said their strategy for Bawana would be the same as it was during the MCD polls  a combination of Modis image, a promise of governance as provided by the Centre, and a hint of nationalism. Parkash argued, Which other party will stand for the Jats? They are the backbone of our nation, they are the farmers and the soldiers. They are nationalism.BJP MP Parvesh Verma, the party in-charge for the bypoll, added, The BJP will win as it has approved the land pooling policy, which will benefit the rural population. The challenge for the former AAP legislator, though, will be to explain to people why he left the party and joined the BJP. A close aide said, When he left, some people felt betrayed. But we had to explain to them what AAP was doing. It is something that comes up still, but we are dealing with it.For now, the BJP appears confident. The party office is a week-old, freshly painted in saffron and green with photographs of the PM dotting its walls. A lotus has been painted at the entrance. Asked how the campaign was progressing, a BJP leader said, We bought four quintals of sugar to make laddoos, which got over in a week. We bought 50 cartons of water, almost over in two days. People are flocking to the BJP. Whether its Bihar or Bawana, people want the BJP and they know we will form a government.***To get to Punjab Khor village, one has to drive 8 km from Bawana village along the Saheb Singh Verma road. On Thursday, AAP cabinet minister and Delhi convener Gopal Rai, who is handling the campaign, sat there, addressing the 100-odd people who had gathered at the rural chowk. The greatest advantage that AAP has is that its in power in Delhi, which is why it can do the most for you, he said. Rai described such events as seedhi baat sessions, an opportunity for the party  that feels its strength is in the unauthorised colonies and slum clusters  to make its presence felt in these villages. Their candidate, Ram Chandra, who had contested on a BSP ticket in 2008 and had received 14 per cent of the votes, is a resident of Shahbad Dairy.A Purvanchali, AAP hopes that Chandra will be able to mobilise voters in these clusters, dominated by residents from Bihar and eastern UP. Has any other party done so much for those who are poor and live in slums? From free electricity to water, from mohalla clinics to improving the standard of education is government schools. There is no question in their minds about who they should vote for, said Ram Chandra.Rai, on the other hand, is focussing on rural villages. The smart village idea is a game- changer. This is something the Delhi government has recently done. They have constituted a rural development board and decided to allocate Rs 2 crore to each village annually under the Smart Village scheme. In the case of Bawana, with 26 villages, the amount comes up to Rs 52 crore. An MLA, on the other hand, gets only Rs 4 crore to develop the entire area. This will give power back to the villagers and let them decide on how the money should be spent.But, will the project not come through if AAP doesnt win the polls? It will. But its better if the MLA and the government are from the same party. Things work more smoothly then, Rai said. Another AAP leader explained, With Parkash leaving the party, the onus is on him to explain why he left. Anti-incumbency is not a factor here; in fact, us heading the state government puts us in a unique position from where we can deliver results faster and more easily.Of the three party offices, AAPs  currently run out of three rooms at a cricket coaching centre for teens, three kilometres away from Shahbad Dairy  is arguably the busiest. A small army of volunteers can be seen going through documents, while a room has been assigned to Rai to meet voters who turn up with their problems. What neither Rai nor Ram Chandra admits is the desperation that underscores this frantic activity. We simply cant afford to lose another election. But this is different  enough time has passed and Rai has virtually been here for the past month, said a volunteer.Since the MCD poll loss, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal seems to have largely disappeared from public discourse in the capital. However, he has made frequent visits to rural areas, including Bawana  either to talk about the land pooling policy that the DDA had passed, which both the BJP and the AAP take credit for, or to speak about the historical rates of compensation that the AAP government gives to farmers for destroyed crops, or just to tout MLA Kailash Gehlots promotion to the Delhi cabinet. On June 3, Kejriwal had said in Bawana, No other government works for the villages like we do. The land pooling policy, we hope, will bring joy and income. Gehlot will be the voice of the villages in the cabinet.***The Congress, meanwhile, hopes the swapping of leaders between the BJP and the AAP will work to its advantage. Pointing to the induction of former BJP MLA Gugan Singh  who won the 2013 elections from Bawana with a margin of over 20,000 voters  into AAP, Delhi state unit chief Ajay Maken said, Both parties are morally bankrupt. What kind of inducement must the BJP have given to the AAP MLA, for him to have resigned from AAP and joined the BJP? He negated the mandate that the people of Bawana had given him. Similarly, what kind of inducement must the AAP have given to the BJP leader?At the Congress office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha) At the Congress office in Bawana. (Source: Express Photo/Abhinav Saha)While Singhs induction to AAP has been touted as a masterstroke by some who feel it will help them get traction in rural areas of Bawana, Congress candidate and three-time MLA from the area, Surender Kumar, said he is relying on his past work. As MLA, I worked here day and night for 15 years. I am a strong believer of the Congress philosophy of ensuring that the poor and the middle class have roti, kapda aur makaan. They have always felt safe when the Congress is in power not like now.The Congress office in Bawana, a few metres from the BJP office, is not new. A little away from the road, it opens into a massive hall with a high ceiling. A desk is placed at one corner, with two landlines and a pile of notebooks. On the other side, mattresses have been laid out, where some party workers were taking a nap on Thursday afternoon. Asked about Kumars schedule, a handwritten sheet is drawn out. He is scheduled to travel to eight areas and meet people as part of his padyatra. But a Congress worker informed that the timing of each meeting hasnt been mentioned. After some discussion, a phone call is made to figure out where the Congress candidate is.Another worker added, This is the problem with the party. Our candidate is easily the best, the most seasoned and arguably the most popular. You dont win an election thrice otherwise. Nobody has heard of Ved Parkash or Ram Chandra, but after our defeats in the elections since 2013, the organisation hasnt been the same. When Kumar was eventually traced, he told The Indian Express, I have worked selflessly for the people of Bawana for years. There is no doubt in my mind that we will win.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

5b5059a59855b70b4a41a70c,The Sundarbans Way,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-sundarbans-way-up-pilibhit-tiger-reserve-human-animal-conflict/,2017-08-14,"Pilibhit is among the narrowest tiger reserves in India, and in many areas, fields along the edge merge with the forests. Pilibhit is among the narrowest tiger reserves in India, and in many areas, fields along the edge merge with the forests.Disquiet has given way to clamour in the fields around Pilibhit Tiger Reserve (PTR) in Uttar Pradesh. At the heart of this clamour is an unfolding tragedy, as one or more tigers continue to claim human lives. Fifteen people have lost their lives since last November. Villagers have blocked highways and traded charges with forest managers. But the solutions considered thus far to mitigate the human-animal conflict in Pilibhit have been mostly poorly thought out.Misconceptions around the human-tiger interface in PTR are widespread. For instance, it has been reported in a section of the media that unlike other tiger habitats, humans live cheek by jowl with big cats in Pilibhit, and thus routinely fall victim to them. Another theory is that the areas tigers, being unaccustomed to humans, have taken to attacking them. Another theory pins the blame on the emergence of a population of man-eating tigers. Some contend that Pilibhits tiger population has doubled since its designation as a reserve three years ago, and therefore the big cats are spilling out into farmlands in search of habitat and prey. Until its creation in May 2014, the area today that constitutes PTR was one of north Indias most productive timber-yielding reserve forests.Logging crews and local residents, grazing their cattle or harvesting minor forest resources frequented the reserve on a daily basis. Given this, Pilibhits tigers are likely to be accustomed to human presence. Many generations of the regions human population have also lived in close proximity to tigers  presumably todays residents of the region are also well aware of the perils of venturing into the forest after dark, and of other basic precautions they need to take when living in the vicinity of tigers.Pilibhit is among the narrowest tiger reserves in India, and in many areas, fields along the edge merge with the forests. These fields, especially when seen from the eyes of a wild feline, are grasslands, extensions of natural habitats and corridors. They hold water because they are well-irrigated, and shelter pigs and hog deer and are thus attractive for wild carnivores. These farmlands have replaced expansive tracts of forest and riparian habitats, with land-use change that began in the colonial area. The presence of tigers in these farmlands is thus neither novel nor unexpected. For the most part, they move through such areas, silent and unseen under cover of darkness, avoiding humans, light and noise.Data also does not support the claim of a rapidly growing tiger population in PTR. Instead, the population has fluctuated greatly since 2010, and is characterised by high turn-over (where the same tigers are not seen from one year to the next) and moderate adult survival. The occurrence of a large tiger population, a dense human population within five kilometres of the forests edge, extensive sugarcane cultivation and the forests narrow geography do increase the potential for the spatio-temporal overlap of humans and tigers.It is also untenable that Pilibhits tiger population is biologically predisposed to preying on humans, more than any other tiger population. Recent attacks on humans in and around PTR could primarily be attributed to one or two animals that could be young individuals in marginal habitats without territories, older individuals with disabilities, or those with debilitating injuries. Conflict mitigation in PTR needs to shift from a case-by-case response to a cohesive and coordinated approach. There are lessons to be learnt from the Sunderbans in West Bengal where tiger attacks on humans are managed on a regular basis. The state has evolved mechanisms to identify and relocate the conflict-causing tiger(s). It has also established quick response teams to ward off straying tigers and aid in their capture, when necessary.Following the Sunderbans example, PTRs administration should take steps to build rapid response teams comprising wildlife veterinarians, forest department staff, and local volunteers trained to contain conflict-prone animals and engage irate crowds. The local police too needs to be integrated into these response teams and assist in crowd control. Educators and public health professionals need to engage communities to enhance their preparedness for conflict and reduce casualties.The proposed solution to fence the tiger reserve is not feasible. Fencing in tigers and their natural prey will lead to new problems. These will limit animal dispersal and may increase conflict in the long-run.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a0f0c469855b76bf13d57c3,Shah doesn't know how to behave: Siddaramaiah,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/628132/shah-doesnt-know-behave-siddaramaiah.html,2017-08-15,"Shah doesn't know how to behave: SiddaramaiahDH News Service, Bengaluru, Aug 15 2017, 1:42 ISTSiddaramaiahChief Minister Siddaramaiah on Monday took a dig at BJP president Amit Shah for sitting crosslegged in front of Adichunchanagiri Mutt seer Nirmalanandanatha Swami.One should show respect to pontiffs and follow etiquette. Perhaps, Shah doesnt know how to behave, Siddaramaiah told reporters seeking his reaction on the issue.On Sunday, Shah visited the seer in what was seen as a move to woo the Vokkaliga community, which holds the Mutt in high reverence. However, Shah courted controversy when a picture showing him seated crosslegged in front of the seer went viral. Sitting with one leg crossed on top of the other is considered informal and disrespectful.The chief minister also hit back at Shah for calling the Karnataka government Indias most corrupt. He has no moral right to speak on corruption when he has corrupt people flanking him all the time. In the last four years, Congress has given a scam-free administration in Karnataka, Siddaramaiah said.Earlier in the day, Union Minister D V Sadananda Gowda targeted the Siddaramaiah government for not waiving loans taken by farmers from nationalised banks. Governments of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra wrote off farm loans taken from nationalised banks. It wont be a new thing if Karnataka does it. It was under the Modi government that we gave interest-free loans to sugarcane factories and ensured that 90% farmers got their dues. Also, the devolution of central funds to states is up from 32% to 42%. It is the state governments responsibility to ensure the excess 10% reaches farmers, Gowda said.Siddaramaiah responded by pointing out that former prime ministers, Manmohan Singh and V P Singh, had waived farm loans worth Rs 72,000 crore and Rs 10,000 crore, respectively. If he (Manmohan Singh) could do it, why cant Modi? If the BJP doesnt do it, they are anti-farmer, he said.DH News Service"

DeepakK_R_DEEPAKHoneybees visit an estimated four lakh flowers to collect nectar for producing one kg of honey but their hard work is going in vain due to a variety of factors.The number of honeybee habitats is under threat mainly in the Eastern Ghats due to excessive use of pesticides and degradation of flora.Honeybees, a highly organised community, are considered eco-friendly as they contribute to higher agriculture yield and maintain the ecological balance.In some places crude methods are followed to collect honey by the farmers as they dont follow scientific methods for sustainable beekeeping, Dr. N.B. Brundhavanam, Adviser, Dabur India Ltd, who was here to take part in the World Honeybee Day celebrations, told The Hindu on Saturday.Honeysbees, the native type of insects also known as rock and forest bees, are facing threat even as bees imported from Europe mainly Italy are getting domesticated in Uttar Pradesh, Haryana and Punjab in the North and Bihar and Jharkhand in the East India.As per estimates, Dr. Brundhavanam says India produces 45,000 tonne, which can be increased to 1.10 lakh tonne if farmers are sensitised on the advantages of using organic manure. It also renders great pollination service.Citing an instance, he points out that in Himachal Pradesh, the apple growers spend money to attract the bee colonies to migrate to their area as it leads to increase in apple production by 35%.Because of health-friendly ingredients, honey has found a mention in ancient literature dating back to 5,000 years ago. The average consumption in India is just 49 grams as against the global average of 750 grams.The Girijan Cooperative Corporation, which procures non-timber forest produce from tribals to provide them remunerative price by keeping middlemen at bay, is planning to implement a comprehensive action plan to promote honey production in a big way.Our aim is to increase floriculture, facilitate bank finance and popularise scientific ways for sustainable beekeeping, A.S.P.S. Ravi Prakash, Vice-Chairman-cum-Managing Director of GCC.He says the GCC is producing 500 tonne of honey straight away collecting it from the forests in totally pure form as against the demand of 1,000 tonne in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The domesticated honey produced in North and East by using the European bees contains a lot of sugar content unlike the honey marketed by the GCC."

A letter was also sent to Chief Secretary, Uttar Pradesh asking to focus on major industrial districts responsible for 50 percent of pollution in the river.A drive was carried out in March-April this year to identify grossly polluting industries that dont comply with the effluent discharge norms. Eleven technical institutions like IITs, NIITs were roped in for indentifying defaulters.About 1109 such industries were identified and then based on the report, closure notice has been issued to 358 and show cause notices were issued to 180. The closure orders came after these industries failed to give a satisfactorily reply about effluent discharge in the river, said a senior official in the water resources ministry.The closure notice has been issued if industries failed to comply the norms or did not put the Online Continuous Effluent Monitoring System (OCEMS). All polluting industries were asked to put emission monitoring system but still many have not complied with it.We have written to UP chief secretary last week that most of these polluting industries are confined in eight districts -- Kanpur, Unnao, Allahabad, Varanasi, Bareilly, Saharanpur, Moradabad and Meerut. If we can monitor these, it will solve nearly 50 percent pollution related problem in the river, the official said.Majority of polluting industries are cement, iron and steel, thermal power plants, sugar, tannery, distillery, fertilizers, paper and pulp and pesticides and Centre has asked Ganga states to ensure that the district and state administration play an important role in checking these polluting industries.District Ganga committees and District Magistrates must play an active role as they have the resources and manpower to check polluting industries and give feedback to NMCG to take action, the official added.The NMCG has been given powers under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act to take legal action against polluters."

The crushing has only began this season and officials at the factory told TOI that so far, it was well below par.""Only one of our two boilers is working, sugarcane production is low too,"" said Rame Gowda, a former managing director of the factory who has now been roped in as adviser.A few kilometres away , the Pandavapura Co-operative Sugar Factory, remains shut.""There is no work happening here,"" said the security incharge, the only person on the premises. Four other factories in the region have shut over the past three years.Venkatesh Murthy, vicePresident of Bannari Sugar Factory and committee member of the South Indian Sugar Mills Association, said there was no way the demand for sugar would be met domestically this year.""The government has al ready imported around 5 lakh tonne of sugar this year. The situation in Karnataka, which is the third largest sugar producing state after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, is likely to further push sugar prices up,"" Murthy said.He added that the factories -which take stock of the sowing during the season -are expecting only 50% of the average sugarcane this year. ""Sugar price has already touched Rs 35 (in the wholesale market), and we expect it to hit Rs 45 to Rs 50 in the absence of timely imports,"" he said. In the retail market, sugar costs upwards of Rs 45 a kilo.""Last year too, crushing was poor with only about 50% having been achieved. The situation was particularly bad in south and central Karnataka,"" Murthy said.Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of All India Sugarcane Growers' Association , said the trouble began in 201314 when sugar factories could not pay the farmers. The following year, sugar prices increased to Rs 35 per kilogram from Rs 25.""However, sugar factories could not pay the dues even that year, pushing several farmers into distress.

Incidentally, our workers were about to go home at the end of their shift. But the moment we got to know of the derailment, we started mobilising our resources... We rescued around 100 passengers trapped in the coaches, Dr. Kumar said.The first three teams of the NDRF left their Ghaziabad camp  80 km from the site  at 6.30-7 p.m. However, since seven of the 13 derailed coaches had overturned, many passengers were trapped, and immediate rescue measures were necessary to save lives.Before the NDRF teams arrived, residents living on both sides of the track rushed to rescue the passengers. Many workers from the nearby mill who were well trained in cutting arrived immediately with their equipment. As it was getting dark, the mill also gave generators to supply electricity to ensure better visibility, Mr. Kanhai Singh said.Around 100-150 workers rushed to the site nearly 500 metres away from the mill. We provided lighting arrangements and around 10-15 cutters to cut through the coaches and take out the passengers, Dr. Kumar said.Our target was to cut open the window grill of the coaches so that we could free the passengers straight out of the window because our cutting equipment could not break the coaches, said Anwar Alam, who works at the mill. We started off with the S2 coach that crashed into a house near Khatauli, leaving the passengers stuck. We managed to save 10-12 persons from this coach, he said.Sushant Thakur, assistant general manager (administration and security) at Triveni, said the mill provided 25 halogen lights for proper lighting at the site for the mill workers engaged in the rescue. Our medical officers were present there to provide immediate assistance to the injured passengers and we deployed our ambulances too, he said. The responsive passengers were pulled out of the window, but for those who were deep inside the coaches, cutting equipment was used, he said.Finally, at 9 p.m., three NDRF teams arrived and used their high-end cutting tools to rescue the remaining passengers. The NDRF teams cordoned off the area and rescued the passengers more expeditiously, Mr. Singh said."

The second wave of floods, since July, devastated the two districts along with adjoining districts - Nagaon and Lakhimpur - claiming lives and leaving thousands homeless. In spite of the water level of the Brahmaputra and its tributaries receding in some parts, most of the places still remain submerged. The residents of the affected places are yet to return to normal life with scarcity of drinking water posing a major health hazard. Nakul Das, a resident of South Jaipur village in Gohpur sub-division, said lack of drinking water has become a cause# for concern. ""We are collecting water from miles away and boiling it for consumption,"" he said. Incessant rain, followed by floods, have contaminated most of the sources of drinking water in the flood-affected areas. General secretary of All Assam Koibatra Students' Union, Gohpur sub-division, Padma Das, said, despite all the efforts, most of the affected people were compelled to drink unsafe water as most of the shallow tubewells are still submerged. ""Water pouches are being distributed by the administration, but this measure is far short of the huge demand,"" Das said. Talking to The Telegraph, Gohpur sub-divisional officer (civil) Indranoshee Das said, ""We are providing drinking water pouches to the affected people. We have also installed over 40 shallow tubewells with hand pumps in affected areas and are trying to install more. But, this will take time because of technical problems, as the sites are still underwater."" She also said chlorine tablets and bleaching powder packets have been distributed among the affected to purify and decontaminate# water before consumption. The tablets have been distributed through relief and rescue teams among the affected people. Das also admitted that there was demand for more. Rina Das, a resident from Naduar circle of Sonitpur district, said, ""The public health engineering department supplied water packets because the sources from where we were consuming water are all submerged in floodwater. Now we are afraid of consuming water from there. Water pouches are also being distributed by the relief workers but still it is not enough."" In Naduar circle, 22 villages were affected by floods and 18 in Gohpur. Army school relief: To provide immediate support to the flood-affected people, Army Public School here undertook an initiative to collect and distribute relief items. Defence spokesperson, Tezpur, Lt Col Sombit Ghosh, said the students and employees donated food items, such as rice, pulses, biscuits, milk powder, sugar, drinking water and clothes. A team comprising teachers, students and administrative staff visited flood-affected areas in Kaliabor yesterday to distribute the relief items."

5a10e94d9855b76bf13daa3f,Sugar output likely to rise by 18%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/sugar-output-likely-to-rise-by-18/article19597862.ece,2017-09-01,"The country's domestic sugar production in 2018 is likely to increase by 18%-20% to around 24.5 million tonnes, rating agency ICRA said on Thursday. It said that the growth was driven principally by a recovery in cane availability in Maharashtra and north Karnataka, supported by monsoon rain and an increase in sugar production in Uttar Pradesh.ICRA, Senior Vice President Sabyasachi Majumdar said that in comparison to the sugar year of 2017, the domestic sugar production in sugar year 2018 could rise by 18%-20% and production could be between 24  24.5 million tonnes.Sugar production in south Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is likely to remain impacted by consecutive seasons of poor rainfall. This, coupled with an increase in the cane costs due to higher fair and remunerative price in sugar year 2018, is likely to negatively impact the performance of the sugar mills in these regions, he said.Drought impactMr. Majumdar said that in terms of profitability, the south-based mills especially those in Tamil Nadu and south Karnataka are likely to be adversely affected in the financial year of 2018. This is due to continued drought which is expected to significantly impact their cane availability in sugar year 2018 and the increase in the cane costs.While mills in Maharashtra and north Karnataka are likely to be negatively impacted by higher costs, they are likely to reap benefits of higher production. As far as Uttar Pradesh-based mills are concerned, they are likely to be benefitted by the healthy sugar prices along with continued healthy volumes and recovery rates, although that impact could be partly offset by higher cane prices, he said.He said that according to ICRA estimates, sugar year 2017 would end with a stock between 4 - 4.5 million tonnes, which is likely to be sufficient for around two months of domestic consumption, although there is a possibility of a localised sugar deficit in the southern and western States during the forthcoming festival season. While the shortage in the west is likely to be mitigated by early commencement of cane crushing, the deficit in the south is largely likely to be handled by way of imports from west and north India, said Mr. Majumdar."

Companies and traders were bullish about sugarcane and cotton , which have seen an increase in acreage by 9% and 18%, respectively, this year.Floods in parts of Gujarat, Assam, Rajasthan, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh and weak rainfall in south India have hit crops. Agriculture secretary SK Pattanayak said the kharif harvest would be similar to last year's levels.""There is no cause of concern in terms of production. Farmers in flood-affected areas will shift to other crops once the water recedes,"" he said. Till last week, an area of 3.82 million hectares was affected due to floods, heavy rain and drought, he added.The state worst-hit by floods was Gujarat (1.1million hectares), followed by Rajasthan and West Bengal at 700,000 hectares and Bihar at 650,000 hectares.Analysts are not so optimistic. ""There will be a 5-10% fall in production level for kharif. In the previous year, production was 138.52 million tonnes,"" said Prerana Desai, head of commodity research at Edelweiss Agri Value Chain Ltd.The research company expects output of pulses to fall 10-15% from last kharif season's 9.42 million tonnes. Production of rice is expected to be similar as last year's 96.39 million tonnes, while oilseeds are expected to drop 15-20% from 22.4 million tonnes, said Desai.A fall in prices prompted farmers to reduce the area under pulses plantation by 4% to 13.76 million hectares, according to agriculture ministry data.""We can expect a 3% to 5% decrease in kharif pulses production in India. With the government holding 1.4 million tonnes of arhar and huge stocks in the domestic market, there is unlikely to be a price rise,"" said Pravin Dongre, chairman of the Indian Pulses and Grains Association. He said that in the long term, the government will have to remove import restrictions.This year, rice acreage fell 1.5% to 36.6 million hectares. ""The output will remain similar to previous year as in key growing areas the weather was favourable and yields will be higher, too,"" said Vijay Setia, president of the All India Rice Exporters' Association.The dry spell in Karnataka, Kerala and Telangana affected acreage under pulses, coarse cereals, oilseeds and cotton, according to the agriculture ministry.India's soyabean production this year will likely fall 10-15% from last year's 13.79 million tonnes, said BV Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors' Association of India. The planting of all oilseed crops, including groundnut and sunflower, has been 8% less.""Groundnut production will also fall by 10% from 6.2 million tonnes in the previous year,"" said Mehta, who added that with 70% dependence on imports, a price hike was not likely.Cotton is expected to benefit from higher acreage and favourable weather.""This year's cotton production will be 10% higher than last year's production. Good weather can lead to a further increase,"" said Nayan Mirani, president of the Cotton Association of India.The area under cotton has increased almost 18% to 11.98 million hectares. Seeing a bigger crop, future prices for delivery in October-November have crashed to Rs 38,500 per candy of 356 kg each from current prices of Rs 42,500 per candy in Gujarat.The sugar industry expects higher output as cane planting is up 9%."

Consider this: a staggering 273 dams have been built in the Upper Bhima basin across the state and 90% of canal water diverted from such dams is used to irrigate sugarcane. Agri expert Nishikant Bhalerao says the reason for such disproportionate distribution is, ""Politicians wanted to ensure sugarcane growers don't face water shortage.""Sugar mills became the lynchpin of the state's rural economy and its politics over the decades. ""Every MLA wants a sugar mill...we help them as we have to keep them (happy) with us. But today , we are suffering because of this policy ,"" said Sharad Pawar recently . Most of Pawar's satraps own two or three sugar mills.In the last decade and a half, Maharashtra's share in sugarcane output rose from 15.6% to 21.9% while Uttar Pradesh's marginally declined. UP tops in sugarcane production in the country (38.7%) followed by Maharashtra (21.9%).In the Upper Bhima basin, 19% of the cultivated area--more than six lakh hectare--is under sugarcane. In 2016, amid acute water shortage when Sec 144 was imposed to protect water sources in Marathwada, sugar mills continued to receive copious quantities for the cane-crushing season.Sugarcane tracts in western Maharash tra thrive on a combination of flood irrigation and high doses of fertilizers. Water treated with chemicals remains stagnant in fields, but this process has degraded more than six lakh hectares of land, turning them saline, according to a recent study. Salinity is multiplying annually by 10% in the sugarcane belt.The paper on `Severity of soil salinity and sodicity problems in Maharashtra and their reclamation' said salt concentration is high ""owing to injudicious management of canal irrigation water"" and this is expected to reduce land productivity .Expressing concern over excessive use of water for sugarcane, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has now directed agriculture officials to make cane growers take to drip irrigation."

According to the first advance estimate released today by the agriculture ministry, the production of all kharif crops - rice, pulses and coarse cereals - is projected to decline from the record 138.52mt last kharif. Harvesting will start from next month. According to the latest data, rice output is likely to fall by 1.9mt to 94.48mt this year from the record 96.39mt in the previous kharif. Pulse output could drop to 8.71mt from the record 9.42mt because of depressed prices and poor rains. The production of tur is estimated to be lower at 3.99mt from 4.78mt, while urad output may rise to 2.53mt from 2.17mt in the last kharif season. Coarse cereal output is also seen lower at 31.49mt, against 32.71mt in the gone-by kharif season. Maize output is pegged at 18.73mt against 19.24mt a year ago. Oilseed output is estimated to be down at 20.68mt compared with 22.40mt in the year-ago period. Soyabean output has been pegged at 12.22mt against 13.79mt last kharif. Among cash crops, cotton output is estimated to be slightly lower at 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) from the earlier 33.09 million bales. However, sugarcane output might rise to 337.69mt, from 306.72mt before. Production of jute and mesta is estimated to decline to 10.33 million bales (of 180 kg each) from 10.60 million bales last year. The overall monsoon was projected normal, but till the first week of this month, it was less by 5 per cent. Assam, Bihar, Gujarat and Rajasthan witnessed floods, while parts of Karnataka, Chhattisgarh and Tamil Nadu faced a dry spell. The kharif output estimates might be revised later taking feedback from states. The ministry releases four estimates before the final one at different stages of harvesting. Sugar production The government is expecting about 24 per cent increase in the country's total sugar output to around 25 million tonnes in the marketing year beginning next month on likely higher output in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra following good rains, an official source said. This is an initial projection based on the inputs of the state governments. The estimate, however, is in line with the industry body ISMA's projection. The country's sugar output in the ongoing 2016-17 marketing year (October-September) is estimated to be lower at 20.2 million tonnes because of poor rains. India is the world's second biggest sugar producer. In a meeting with state cane commissioners called by the Union Food Ministry, official sources said state governments have submitted the sugar production figures after assessing the likely sugarcane output and recovery level. Based on their inputs, the country's overall sugar output is expected to be around 25 million tonnes in 2017-18 marketing year, the sources said."

Coming from Sitapur district in Uttar Pradesh, they have gathered in the city for the Dhamma Chakra Pravartan event at Deekshabhoomi. The group of over 50 families is among regular visitors from other states to the annual congregation here.The social stigma Dalits faced decades ago is no longer there. However, many are still marginalized on the economic front, and are facing a new crisis in the cow belt these days. After the ban on cow slaughter, there has been a problem of plenty of the bovine. The hinterland is infested with unproductive cattle abandoned by their owners. The cows have now become a new cause of crop damage. Majority of these men have small holdings, and cattle eating away the meagre crop, leaves them bleeding, they said.""The chana (gram) had hardly grown, and the cows finished it all. There is hardly anything left even for the family to consume,"" said Ram Dulari Devi of Kisripur village in Sitapur district. ""My sugar cane crop too was damaged, when it had barely grown a feet,"" said Raju Gautam of Arua village in the same district.The problem started after the ban on cow slaughter. Cows that are no longer productive cannot be sold for slaughter, since it would invite the ire of the gau rakshaks (cow conservationists). So the herdsmen have simply let them free. Even some milk producing cows and calves have been set free. The animals graze freely in the fields, with little chance of stopping them, said Hemnath Gautam.The big farmers can easily fence their fields, but the marginal cultivator cannot afford this. Many in the group hardly have a single acre of farm. The number of cows abandoned is anywhere between 20 to 100 in a village, said one of the visitors in the group.""The activists immediately spring into action if they find people setting up fences. They allege farmers are trying to kill the cattle with electrified fences. When the situation gets worse, the residents of one village load the cows in a truck and dump them near another village under the cover of darkness. When caught, it leads to clashes,"" added Hemnath Gautam.""A bull had gored a young man in our village, and such a risk is always there, but nothing has been done,"" said Shivbal Gautam, another member of the group.The government keeps saying that gaushalas (cow shelters) will be built, but nothing has happened so far, he said.

In a letter written to the Chief Secretary of the State, the U.P. Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA) said that any increase in cane prices would hit them hard as the cane industry has been going through losses for last three consecutive yearsFarmers in distressThe request comes days after distressed farmers of the State alleged that the present rate of Rs. 305 per quintal of cane was much lower than the total input cost that goes into the farming of cane in U.P.Farmers have waged a campaign to increase the State Advised Price (SAP) to Rs. 400 per quintal.Uttar Pradesh became the highest producer of sugar last year, contributing close to 42% of the total sugar production in India.To push forth its request, the UPSMA reminded the Chief Secretary that the present Chief Minister Adityanath had, on several occasions, said that increasing the procurement rate for sugarcane was not the solution to the problems of the industry.Last year, the Samajwadi Party (SP) government increased the SAP of sugarcane by Rs. 25 and fixed it at Rs. 305 per quintal.The UPSMA also urged the government to give the mills the option of paying sugarcane prices in two installments, and decreasing the commission paid to cooperative societies to Rs. 2 per quintal from the present Rs. 7.65.The cane crushing season is expected to start from October.The letter said that sugarcane prices in U.P. are undoubtedly higher as compared to other major sugar-producing States.Excess productionThe overall increase in sugar prices have been marginal when compared to the substantial rise in cane prices. Though sugar prices decrease, cane prices continue to go up. Main reasons for this has been excess production and increased supply, said the UPSMA letter.The industry has been suffering continuous losses from 2011 and is barely able to stand on its feet, the letter added."

The district sugarcane department has come up with the suggestion that they spray the infected plants with buttermilk as an organic means to protect their crops from the disease.The disease is most rampant in 0238 variety of sugarcane. Pokka Boeng disease is caused by a complex of fungal species within the genus Fusarium that causes malformed or distorted tops in cane crop.Giving details about the disease, a farmer said leaves of the crop shrink, dry up and main shoot turns black in colour. Use of pesticide at this stage is not advisable as the tops of cane crop is used as fodder.According to district agriculture officer OP Singh, Farmers should not use pesticide at the time when sugarcane crushing season is round the corner as it can affect the quality of sugar and will be harmful for livestock. We are suggesting to farmers to spray mattha (buttermilk) on their sugarcane crop. It has anti-fungal properties which protects the crop from Pokka Boeng.He said, Farmers should mix two or three litres of buttermilk in 100 litres of water and spray the mixture over the crop. It will control the growth of the fungus. The method was suggested after consultations with those farmers who practice organic farming.Ashok Kumar, director, research, Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel University of Agriculture & Technology, Meerut, endorsed the view and said that buttermilks acidic property helps tackle such disease and has been adopted by organic farmers.The suggestion to use buttermilk as a remedy is significant as Bijnor is the second biggest sugarcane-growing district in Uttar Pradesh after Lakhimpur Kheri. Cane has been cultivated in an area spanning 2.12 lakh hectares in Bijnor and over 21.5 lakh hectares across the state. A cash crop, cane can withstand storms and heavy rain. But of late, farmers are facing problems due to cane diseases.A particular variety, 0238, has been cultivated across 40% of the total area under cane cultivation in the state. This variety has become a hit among farmers as its yield is better than other varieties. But now, farmers find that due to its low immunity, it is prone to plant diseases like Pokka Boeng. This means, farmers have to put in more pesticides to grow 0238 variety."

Following committees visit to Greater Noida, chief minister Yogi Adityanath in Lucknow announced that the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway will deliver 50,000 flats in three months. However, the builders did not have an action plan for the delivery of flats.In the run up to the ministerial panels visit, the Noida authority chief executive officer Alok Tandon on Tuesday evening met with 15 builders and discussed the action plan of delivery of the flats to homebuyers. Supertech, Amrapali, Jaypee Group, ABA Corp, Gardenia Glory and Antriksh among others met the CEO in his Sector 6 office.The CEO discussed problems of each project with the respective builders. He met three builders at a time and heard problems that are delaying a housing project. We hope that now builders will start delivering flats because the new policy of clearing 10-15% of the land dues for obtaining occupancy certificate will help them a lot, said Amit Modi, vice-president of CREDAI (western UP) and director of ABA Corp.Greater Noida has 203 housing projects out of which 82 are critical in nature and builders owes 7,200 crore debt to pay to the government. The Noida authority in around 90 housing projects needs to recover 10,215 crore land dues from the builders. The Yamuna authority struggles to recover around 3,000 crore from 13 builders. In the three areas, thousands of homebuyers suffer as the builders have delayed housing projects for four to eight years.Officials said that if the builders are unable to deliver their respective flats even after the new scheme, it would mean they do not wish to deliver the flats.I do not think the builders will not deliver now. I am very positive about the new scheme and hopeful of it working out well for both the builders and buyers, said Manoj Rai, director of Gardenia Glory housing project stuck due to financial crisis in Sector 46."

However, many builders are yet to give assurances to the committee about the same, said Dr Prabhat Kumar, Meerut division commissioner and chairman of Yamuna Expressway industrial development authority, after attending the meeting.The committee met with a delegation of homebuyers and builders at India International Centre in Delhi to discuss the issues faced by buyers and builders.The committee also met with the officials of Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna authorities during the meeting which started at 11am and ended at 6pm.Industries minister Satish Mahana, urban housing minister Suresh Khanna and state minister (independent charge) of cane development and sugar mills Suresh Rana are the members of the committee.The panel will again meet the officials of three authorities to review the progress of various infrastructure and other projects on Friday in Delhi.The scheduled meeting on Friday in Delhi will focus only on progress of projects, including parking facility, road resurfacing and hospital construction among others. The committee will check if there is any delay in ongoing projects or not. And the panel will seek answers for the delay, if any, said a Noida authority official.Apart from discussing homebuyers issues, the ministers also discussed civic issues in Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway areas.The committee took up civic issues as the three industrial development authorities which had been formed for industrial development also take care of the civic work.Residents complain that the three authorities are allegedly unable to address civic issues adequately and, hence, they have demanded a municipal body to be formed to properly look after civic issues.Keeping in mind this demand, the ministers panel formed two separate committees with an aim to address civic and traffic issues.The committee headed by Dr Prabhat Kumar will work to streamline municipal functions in the three authorities. Noida authority chairman and chief executive officer Alok Tandon will head the committee that will work on improving traffic management.The panel formed two committees for better municipal functioning and addressing traffic congestion issues. Now, detailed terms and reference will be drafted under which two committees will function. Once terms and reference will be made, we will select the members of these two committees to start our work, said Kumar."

5a5227e89855b770e0374e08,Drought remedy: trip to Japan,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171008/jsp/nation/story_176796.jsp,2017-10-08,"Shivraj Singh Chouhan Bhopal, Oct. 7: As Madhya Pradesh reels under drought with farmer protests erupting everywhere, its lawmakers have united across party lines to jump to the rescue. They are planning a foreign trip for themselves - to study agriculture. At a meeting of the state chapter of the India Parliamentary Group on Wednesday, most MLAs suggested a joint tour of China and Japan. Perhaps mindful of his role as an Opposition leader, Congress member Jaivardhan Singh, son of party senior Digvijaya Singh, voted for Israel and Jordan instead. Some BJP members favoured the tourist hotspots of Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore, the last of them a city state with limited scope for agriculture, an MLA who was present told The Telegraph. When state finance minister Jayant Mallaya suggested Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and other neighbouring countries, highlighting the lower cost of travel, a sullen silence greeted the proposal. Sensing the mood, Speaker Sitasaran Sharma ruled that a sub-committee would be formed to decide the destination, expenses and logistics. The tour has tentatively been scheduled for the year-end and is expected to be of two weeks, with a group of about 30 MLAs picked across parties in proportion to their strength. Anand Rai, a rights activist, wondered: ""What do the MLAs hope to learn from a study tour of Japan, China, Israel, Jordan or Singapore, whose farming practices, technology, crop patterns and laws are a world apart from those in Madhya Pradesh?"" In 2011, a team of some 30 MLAs from the state had toured America with stopovers in France, Greece, Spain and Switzerland - to study agriculture. Most of them had taken their spouses along, apparently paying about Rs 60,000 each towards their air tickets. Apart from that, each legislator is believed to have paid Rs 2 lakh for his or her own trip, covering a percentage of the total expenses. Most state Assemblies, including that of Madhya Pradesh, are affiliated to the India Parliamentary Group, an autonomous body that serves as a link between Parliament and its foreign counterparts. The MLAs' foreign trips as part of the group's programmes are generally funded through contributions from the state government, the India Parliamentary Group and the legislators themselves. Sometimes, the local hospitality is borne by the host country. The MLAs have lunches and dinners thrown in their honour by the Indian missions and NRI forums. Last year, 17 MLAs from Uttar Pradesh had visited Japan, Australia and New Zealand on an 18-day ""study tour"". Although the trip was partly funded by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, the MLAs picked a destination - Japan - outside the Commonwealth. In 2013, a group of MLAs from Karnataka had toured Brazil, Argentina and Peru. A private tour operator had planned the itinerary for the 16-day-15-night trip, which took in tourist paradises such as Rio de Janeiro, Manaus, Iguassu, Lima, Cusco and Buenos Aires, with a stopover at Dubai thrown in. The MLAs feasted their eyes on the Sugarloaf Mountain, Corcovado and Tijuca and the wondrous harbour they enclosed. They experienced the ""exuberant ecosystems of Rio's tropical urban jungle"" and halted at Manaus to absorb the rhythms of Samba, Tango and Paraguayan music. On their return, one member of the delegation said: ""We learnt of poverty and how people here must open up."""

From hartals and satyagraha against the British rule, to movements after independence like the Emergency protests, kisan agitations, Mandal Commission protests, Jan Lokpal andolan, and the December 16 gangrape protests, Delhi has witnessed several shakeups that have had far-reaching social consequences. Because of the citys expansion in the last 70 years and with concerns about security, the venue for such events has undergone several changes.With the National Green Tribunal (NGT) banning dharnas at Jantar Mantar, which has served as the unofficial site for demonstrations for the last 25 years, Hindustan Times tracks the history of places for assembly and dissent across Delhi.Gandhis salt satyagrahaOn the final day of Dandi Satyagraha when Mahatma Gandhi produced salt from seawater in the coastal village of Gujarat on April 6, 1930, scores of Delhi residents gathered at the banks of Yamuna to defy the British legislation introducing tax on salt production.A few of them were subsequently arrested. However, the satyragrahis soon outnumbered policemen and the force had to back off.The same day, a public meeting was held at Queens Garden (now called Azad Park) located behind Town Hall in Chandni Chowk to mobilise support for the movement. The gathering here was addressed by senior city leaders of the time including Desh Bandhu Gupta, who pledged allegiance to the Mahatma.Queens Garden had become the epicentre of the freedom movement where political activities and agitations were frequently held after the imperial capital was shifted from Kolkata to Delhi in 1911.It was at Queens Garden when Kasturba Gandhi, on June 22, 1930, urged the nation to join the freedom movement after Mahatma Gandhi was arrested.Several public meetings during Khilafat and non-cooperation movement were also organised at Pataudi House near Daryaganj. It was here, that Mahatma asked people to boycott foreign goods, government services, schools, and colleges in November, 1921.Several such incidents are documented in the book Struggle for Freedom, the Role of Delhi: 1919-1934 by Reva Dhanedhar, director of History division at the Ministry of Defence.Sporadic protests would also be held at Town Hall Clock Tower, Feroz Shah Kotla, Jama Masjid, and in a park opposite the old St Stephens College building at Kashmere Gate. In the 1920s, a few rallies were organised outside the then city limits at a ground in Karampura, now west Delhi.Mirza Nasim Changezi (107), a freedom fighter living in Old Delhi, says indoor meetings were held at the residences of nationalists in the Walled City  Dr MA Ansari (Daryaganj), Hakim Ajmal Khan (Ballimaran), Asaf Ali (Kucha Chelaan), or Jugal Kishore Khanna (Dariba), which were frequently attended by Moti Lal Nehru, Mohammad Ali Jauhar, Maulana Mohammad Ali, Maulana Shaukat Ali, Maulana Abul Kalam Azad, and Mahatma Gandhi.Freedom fighters would also meet secretly at Fateh Garh in northern ridge area near Hindu Rao Hospital. The other places were the residences of Nawab Bangash at Chitli Qabr or Nawab Loharus havelis in Gali Qasim Jaan, where they schemed against the British administration. Meetings were held under the garb of mushaira and in the end, the messages were delivered, says Changezi, who claims to have worked closely with Bhagat Singh.Protest at Parliament HouseAs the character of protest changed post-independence, the concentration of dissenters also shifted to from Old Delhi to New Delhi, the seat of power. Agitators would often march till the gates of Parliament House to express disagreement with government decisions.Recalling his initial days of political activism in the 1950-60s, senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader professor Vijay Kumar Malhotra (86) says there were no security issues back then. We could gather right at the threshold of Parliament House or Vijay Chowk, he said.Many of us would take scooters till the gates of Parliament House. I participated in agitations against the government decision of auctioning of plots and dwelling units to migrants. We would carry portable microphones. Sometimes, parliamentarians came out to hear our grievances, Malhotra said.Violence during demonstration seeking cow protection in 1966 led to restrictions on dharnas at Parliament, he adds.Some protestors tried to scale the gates of Parliament House. To control the crowd, the police had to resort to firing which killed 5-6 people. After the incident, protesters were barred from reaching the gates, he says.OP Jain (88), heritage conservator, says for big political rallies, Ramlila Maidan was the venue of choice. However, he adds, people who wanted their voices to be heard, would go to Patel Chowk, or sometimes they managed to reach the PTI Building at 4, Sansad Marg, near Parliament House.The presence of All India Radio and the offices of news agencies lured protestors to march towards Patel Chowk, he says, adding that there were hardly any non-political protests at the time.Till 1960-70s, Ramlila Maidan also served as the venue for non-ceremonial state functions. In 1961, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru hosted Queen Elizabeth II here during her state visit.Former Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri delivered his slogan, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, in 1965 at Ramlila Maidan and a mammoth rally led by Jayaprakash Narayan was also held here in June, 1975, before Emergency was imposed.Social activist Jayaprakash Narayan addressing a public meeting at Ramlila Maidan in 1975. (Rane Prakash / HT FILE)Meanwhile, small-scale or union protests continued around offices of ministries and those who wanted to gherao the Parliament would throng the Boat Club near Rajpath.Former Doordarshan anchor, Shammi Narang (61), said that while large agitations were organised at Ramlila Maidan, sometimes at Rajghat or Boat Club, small marches were carried out in New Delhi.No such event would take place then like we have at Jantar Mantar now. Employees of different ministries or departments would gather outside their respective offices to raise their voice. Industrial labour would stage sit-ins outside their factories, says Narang, who read news on DD for 19 years.He adds that dissenters from outside Delhi would usually camp at Rajghat. Maybe, Rajghat was the obvious choice as it was conveniently located near the (Old and New Delhi) railway stations and the interstate bus terminal at Kashmere Gate. At that time, there were no political provocations to reach to heart of the city, he adds.Ban on Boat Club agitationAround the 1980s, the Boat Club became the most sought-after venue for a show of strength. However, the government imposed ban on any gathering at the Boat Club in 1993 following the Ram Janambhoomi-Babri Masjid movement.Another reason for the ban was the violent 1988 kisan agitation led by powerful western Uttar Pradesh (UP) leader Mahendra Singh Tikait. Demanding higher sugarcane prices and waiving of electricity and water charges, farmers who were camping at Raj Ghat initially thronged the Boat Club. Around five lakh protesters are reported to have reached India Gate lawns riding bullock carts where they camped for a week with their cattle. The sprawling lawns along Rajpath virtually became open toilets for cattle.They created a kind of blockade at Rajpath. Soon, the agitation turned violent. The central part of the city was virtually cut off from the rest. Several policemen were injured, after which the government decided not to allow such assemblies at Rajpath, says retired IPS officer Amod Kanth (69), who was then posted as deputy commissioner of police (DCP) crime at headquarters.After the restriction on assemblage at Boat Club, a handful of events were organised behind Red Fort on Ring Road and in Burari briefly. However, soon after, the agitations were moved back to New Delhi where they were located currently  Jantar Mantar."

5a151ea39855b76bf13eb464,"For Yogi, the Modi model",http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/narendra-modi-yogi-adityanath-uttar-pradesh-bjp-for-yogi-the-modi-model-4885810/,2017-10-12,"Yogi Adityanath with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Yogi Adityanath with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In my book, The Monk Who Became Chief Minister: The definitive biography of Yogi Adityanath, I argued that the state of Uttar Pradesh, with 22 crore people and 80 Lok Sabha seats, is a crucial political piece in Indias electoral puzzle. With a history of producing many prime ministers for the country, UP may have given yet another prospect for the prime ministers office in the post-Modi era.Narendra Modi and Yogi have some similarities, which force political pundits to make the Modi-Yogi comparison. The media has created a Hindu hardliner image around both. Both are extremely popular among their supporters. Modi and Yogi are both bachelors and have minimal involvement with their families, which make them free from any obligations or nepotism. Both are extremely hard working, disciplined human beings in their food habits, yoga routine and work ethic.Yogi Adityanath completed six months as Chief Minister at the pancham tal on September 19. Modi inherited a decent Gujarat to be turned into a good, even best Gujarat, which he did meticulously and there emerged a Gujarat Model of development. Yogi got a miserable Uttar Pradesh, where showing instant results will be very tough. Yogi needs to focus tactically on the low hanging fruit, along with long-term strategic initiatives. Its too early to pronounce a verdict on his performance but the initial days look promising. In a state marred with corruption, mis-governance, nepotism coupled with a Bimaru and dysfunctional machinery, the initial months, maybe years in office, will be spent in basic housekeeping. Even Yogis detractors have commended his work in the power sector, his transparent procurement policy, streamlining the transport department, cracking down on bogus ration cards, making long-pending payments to sugarcane farmers and initiating the process of recruitment of 1.5 lakh police personnel.Yogis main difference from Modi, and a challenge for him, is that in a very disciplined cadre-based party like the BJP, Yogi has never held a party position. This makes him a bit distant from the party. Modi, an RSS pracharak, had held various important positions in the party throughout the country before taking over as the chief minister of Gujarat. Chief ministers of the BJP manage their state through a combination of factors  their political acumen, administrative ability, effective use of the bureaucracy, a set of confidantes among ministers and most importantly, their connect with the party cadre, who act as their eyes and ears on the ground. While Yogi seems to score well on all counts his connect with the party cadre is not the best.In UP today, the organisational secretary and Amit Shahs strongman, Sunil Bansal, is filling this gap for Yogi and providing the much needed connect with the party cadre. The new state party president, Mahendra Nath Pandey, will also get into action soon.In the BJP, most sustained political journeys have been undertaken by a pair. Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee had L.K. Advani as his close confidant and PM Modi has Amit Shah as his alter ego. But Yogi still seems to lack a close aide in the party. He should soon identify someone from his set of ministers to be his partner in this long political race.Even Modis critics commend him for the effort he has put in over the years to groom himself for office. Be it his effort to constantly hone his oratory, the use of technology to connect with his followers, his command over the English language or his ability to attract the best teams to work with him, Modi has stood ahead of the pack. Journalists covering the 2014 elections were amazed to see the multiple teams that Modi was operating in parallel for his campaign  first, the party and RSS cadres, then came the BJPs IT backbone lead by Arvind Gupta, there was data crunching by Rajesh Jains team and on top of all this, Modi utilised the services of the likes of Prashant Kishor for communicating his aspirational message far and wide. Yogi has the image of a champion of the Hindu cause. Going forward, he needs to access the best new-age support teams, technology interventions and communication channels to race through the governance track, along with his hardliner image.Despite these challenges, Yogi has his own set of achievements. At 44, he is one of the youngest chief ministers, that too of a humongous state like UP. When the age of 75 is an internal ceiling in the BJP for active politics, Yogi has age on his side. At a young age, he already has two decades of gruelling experience as a parliamentarian. His performance in terms of questions, debates and private members bills is among the best in Parliament. His natural ability to connect with the people, through his janta darbars at the mutt, is paralleled only by a long-time RSS pracharak.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

In 1972, his father Brig RS Randhawa (retd), an Armoured Corps officer commissioned into the 8th Cavalry, was camping near Nanpara village of Lakhimpur Kheri district of Uttar Pradesh during a field exercise. The village falls in the Terai region and abounds in the jungles and wildlife immortalised through the shikar tales of Jim Corbett.After partition, many Sikh farmers settled here and turned an inhospitable terrain, swarming with perilous creatures, into profitable, agrarian tracts by sheer guts, blood and hard work. Senior Randhawa was hooked to Nanpara as wild boars, red junglefowl and even an occasional tiger roamed freely. He set up a farm here. Jyoti, thus, grew up with the many sounds and spectacles afforded by the Terai wilderness, especially on magical moonlit nights when hog deer and grunting boars would crash through vast sugarcane tracts.This childhood passion for wildlife evolved into an easy accompaniment to Jyotis travels across India and the globe to play professional golf. On one such golfing odyssey, he took time off to visit the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve in Maharashtra.Five of us got onto a machan made near a waterhole. A tigress and a cub came to drink water. After they left, a majestic male arrived. The male eased into water backwards to cool down and drink water, which was fascinating. One of my friends made the slightest of sounds, but that did not escape the tigers attention. After his bath, the tiger came lumbering towards the machan to investigate. One of my friends, whose legs were dangling down from the machan, quickly pulled them up, Jyoti recalls.Perched on the machan and holding on tightly, we shuddered at the thought of what would happen if any one of us were to be caught alone on the ground with this brute. But the funny thing was that as the tiger came under our machan, he somehow got unnerved. The king of the jungle turned tail and bolted from the spot like a stray dog, leaving us equally puzzled but thrilled to bits by this once-in-a-lifetime experience! Jyoti told this writer while playing the championship at the Chandigarh Golf Club.UNPROVOKED ATTACKThe dog bite mark on Rajiv Kumar Jatiwals leg. (VIKRAM JIT SINGH)You never know which stray dog is grinning at you in abject servility and which one may suddenly pounce on you and hack your flabby calves without so much as a warning bark. On October 8, professional golfer Rajiv Kumar Jatiwal Boney was playing a practice round ahead of the 1 crore Take Open Championship at the Chandigarh Golf Club. He mounted the vacant tee at the eighth hole bound to the west by thick bushes, and sought shade under a tree.A brown dog emerged from the bushes and quietly came up to me. I noticed it had a redness around the face and carried bite marks on the body. There was a look of madness in the dogs eyes. I turned and ran to get a golf stick, but the dog chased me and bit me under the right knee. I fell down, tearing a muscle in the left leg. I have spent Rs 18,000 on rabies and allied injections and have missed the championship due to this unprovoked attack, Jatiwal told this writer.On Friday, ace golfer Jeev Milkha Singhs path to the sixth hole tee was blocked by a dog. Uncertain of the strays intention and the Boney attack fresh in mind, Jeev was naturally apprehensive, as have other golfers been on numerous occasions.The areas dogs are neither neutered nor vaccinated and the adjoining Sukhna Lakes multiplying strays spill over to dig retreats in cool sand bunkers. Under the Animal Birth Control (Dogs) Rules, 2001, the club can get dogs trapped, neutered and vaccinated but they must be released back at the same spot.THE MARIGOLD HONOURA portrait of a long-tailed shrike atop marigolds (NITIN SONAWANE)If all goes well, the humble marigold will soon be declared Indias National Flower of Remembrance and December 7 as the National Day of Remembrance for soldiers who sacrificed their lives in wars. It is learnt that the Ministry of Defence has already accorded approval to these remembrance symbols and the three chiefs of the armed services are scheduled to meet on October 18 to sanctify the noble initiative.As part of the evolving India Remembers project, the marigold symbol is modelled on the same concept as the flaming poppy, which is the Commonwealth Flower of Remembrance, and November 11, which is established as Remembrance Day in western nations.The idea behind the project is that on December 7, which also marks the annual Armed Forces Flag Day, Indian citizens will be encouraged to identify a serving or retired serviceman or servicewoman, present them with a marigold flower and thank them for their service and sacrifice for the nation. The marigold has been chosen as the flower due to its rich resonance with Indias cultural and social life as also at funerals. It is an inexpensive, fine cut flower found across India, and blooms throughout the year.(The writer can be contacted at vjswild1@gmail.com)"
5a14cfc69855b76bf13e8213,is it difficult to clean up the Ganga?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/is-it-difficult-to-clean-up-the-ganga/article19899358.ece,2017-10-22,"How polluted is the river?Coursing about 2,500 km, the Ganga is the longest river within Indias borders. Its basin constitutes 26% of the countrys land mass (8,61,404 sq. km.) and supports 43% of Indias population. Even as its basin traverses 11 States, five States are located along the rivers main stem spanning Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal. Much of the rivers pollution load  from chemical effluents, sewage, dead bodies, and excreta  comes from these States. In the Ganga basin, approximately 12,000 million litres per day (mld) of sewage is generated, for which there is now a treatment capacity of just 4,000 mld. Particularly, on the stretch spanning Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand, approximately 3,000 mld of sewage is discharged, and a treatment capacity of just 1,000 mld has been created to treat it. Though the contribution of industrial pollution, volume-wise, is about 20%, its toxic and non-biodegradable nature has a disproportionate impact. The industrial pollutants largely emanate from tanneries in Kanpur, distilleries, paper mills and sugar mills in the Kosi, Ramganga and Kali river catchments. Then there is the municipal sewage which, at about a billion litres a day, generates 80% of the pollution load. This spans a wide range, from run-off in rural settlements to carcasses floated down the river.What is the government doing?The BJP included the cleaning of the Ganga in its 2014 election manifesto. The Narendra Modi government earmarked Rs. 20,000 crore for the clean-up and promised that the river would be clean by 2020. Former Union Minister for Water Resources Uma Bharti said the river would be clean by 2018 but the new Minister, Nitin Gadkari, indicated that this deadline was unlikely to be met. He, however, said the river would be noticeably clean by March 2019.What has been done so far?The government has set up an empowered authority called the National Mission for Clean Ganga. This is a dedicated team of officers who are responsible for disbursing the Rs. 20,000 crore fund towards a variety of projects that involve setting up of sewage treatment plants (STPs), replacing woodfired crematoriums with electric ones or those that use fuel more efficiently, setting up biodiversity parks that will enable native species  from the Gangetic river dolphin to rare turtles  to replenish their numbers and planting trees to improve the water table in the surrounding regions and prevent soil erosion. The authorities focussed on having trash skimmers ply along the river and collecting garbage, and improving crematoria. However the big task  of installing sewage treatment plants  is grossly delayed. Barely Rs. 2,000 crore of the Rs. 20,000 crore has been spent so far. The government says this has taken time because it wanted to put in place an extremely transparent tendering process. It has also established a system called the hybrid-annuity model, used in commissioning highways, for selecting firms that will manage STPs. Under this, firms would be given nearly half the money upfront to set up a plant and the rest (with a profit margin included) at regular intervals, provided they meet certain criteria over 15 years. Sixty-three sewerage management projects are being implemented in Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. Last week, STPs to treat 1187.33 mld were cleared for Hardwar and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh.What are clean river criteria?The ultimate objective, for the river to be clean, would be to ensure that the coliform bacteria level, biochemical oxygen demand, pH and dissolved salts remain within the standards prescribed by the Central Pollution Control Board.Can the government meet its targets?A lot will depend on how soon the STPs are commissioned. On average, they will take about a year-and-a-half to work at their optimal capacity. The tanneries, a major polluter, will have to install new systems to ensure that no discharge leaches into the river. Given that several employ techniques that have not been tried on a large scale in Indian rivers, it is unclear how soon they will deliver results. Moreover, a clean river also implies that it maintains minimum levels  called ecological flows  across all stretches of the river. This requires management on a larger scale, including controlling the several dams along the river that bring with them their own challenges.Jacob Koshy"

5a14e5aa9855b76bf13e8dd6,PepsiCo eyes more from ‘hydration’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/pepsico-eyes-more-from-hydration/article19942595.ece,2017-10-29,"Yen for health:PepsiCo is working on products that have flavours of herbs and fruits, with vitamins added to them.PepsiCo India Holdings, a fully-owned subsidiary of New York-based PepsiCo Inc., plans to double its revenue from the hydration segment of beverages from the current Rs. 1,000 crore in the next five years, Vipul Prakash, senior vice president, Beverages, India, said in an interview.The fastest growing categories are the hydration, juices and dairy, which offers a very small base right now, Mr. Prakash said. Carbonated soft drinks are also growing but growing slower in the last five years. The beverage category is growing in high single digits and within that, carbonate soft drinks will be in lower single digits, hydration would be in double digits, and juices in low double digits.Increasing awarenessAn increasing health awareness among Indian consumers and their preference for health and wellness products may be the reasons for a strong demand for juices, according to research firm, Euromonitor International. Carbonates, both cola and non-cola, are likely to see sustained slowdowns.Juice and juice-based carbonates remained the most important priorities for Indias soft drink companies last year, which also saw new entrants such as Manpasand Beverages and Hector Beverages fighting for shelf space with PepsiCo India and Coca-Cola India, according to Euromonitor.PepsiCo would reduce the calorific value in its drinks as part of a global commitment that two-thirds of the companys beverages will be less than 100 calories per 355 ml by 2025, Mr. Prakash said.We will reduce the sugar in our carbonated soft drinks. We launched 7UP with reduced sugar, 30% less, in Gujarat. We launched it as a a test pilot a year ago. The pilot has been a success and we will be extending it to many more parts of the country in the first quarter of 2018, he said. Similarly we are working on Mirinda, Mountain Dew and Pepsi.Zero-sugar productsThe company is also working on how to accelerate zero-sugar products, Mr. Prakash said.Things like Pepsi Black come in there. We have other products such as Tropicana Essentials which do not have added sugar. That is a very small portion of the portfolio now. Another element is..., how do you introduce beverages which are inherently lowe [in] sugar? That is where hydration becomes extremely critical.Hydration is the largest in the liquid refreshment category today and the fastest growing. The strange thing is that (in India) 99% of it is plain water. If you go to any other country it will be between 60-70%. About 30% is what we call value-added water. We want it to be 80:20.PepsiCo is also working on products that have flavours of herbs and fruits with vitamins added to it. It aims to add one new product every 6-12 months on the Aquafina platform, such as the recently introduced Aquafina Vitamin Splash with Kiwi lime and Raspberry mint flavor  both fortified with vitamins.The Splash range of beverages took about 18 months to develop, Mr. Prakash said. It is the first time we are calling out a benefit and a claim on the pack. One is for immune function and one is antioxidants. It is India-specific and was developed for people with certain deficiencies like B12, Vitamin E.He said PepsiCo was taking baby steps in the dairy business. At least for the next two years, we will be in a learning space. We have much to learn in this segment.The firm has 62 manufacturing plants in India  43 for beverages and 19 for snacks. The factories are a mix of company-owned plants, franchisee or bottler-owned, co-packers and bulk water units.The franchisee business is about two-third of our overall business and one-third is the company-owned bottling units, which is mainly in the south, Mr. Prakash said.The franchisee bottling plants are owned by Delhi-based billionaire, Ravi Jaipuria of Varun Beverages, C.K. Jaipura in coastal Andhra Pradesh, S.K. Jaipuria in central India, parts of Maharashtra, Dharwad area, Jharkhand and Anurag Jaipuria in Jammu. Lumbini Beverages, run by Ravi Khilani, owns a plant in Bihar.Varun Beverages holds a significant portion of the business. They have the whole of north India  in New Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajastan, Goa, West Bengal and they have recently acquired plants in Madhya Pradesh and Odisha from S.K. Jaipuria, Mr. Prakash said."

His statement came amid an ongoing protest by farmers over the State Advisory Price of sugarcane for 2017-18. Almost all farmers organisations are protesting against what they see as unfair SAP fixed by the State government last week.The State government increased the SAP by Rs. 10, a move which was highly criticised by the farmers bodies as insufficient to meet the input cost incurred by the farmer in sowing the cash crop. The new rate of the common variety of sugarcane is Rs. 315 per quintal, against Rs. 305 last year, but farmers have been demanding that it be fixed at not less than Rs. 400.The State sugar mill owners association, however, has welcomed the move.The Minister rejected the allegation that the government was working for the sugar mill lobby."

It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.More than a fifth of Indias agricultural output by value today comes from milk. In 2014-15  the latest year for which detailed estimates at individual crop level is available  the value of milk production, at Rs 495,840.52 crore, for the first time, exceeded even the Rs 486,845.87 crore for foodgrains that includes all cereals and pulses.The accompanying table shows that in many states  virtually the entire northern belt covering Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, plus Gujarat  milk accounts for over, or just under, a quarter of the value of their total output from farming and allied sectors. It puts paid to assumptions by policymakers and even academic scholars, who have for long viewed livestock farming as a subsidiary activity to regular crop agriculture.The subsidiary treatment to dairying may have some justification at an individual farmer level. Income from milk could well be lower than from their main crop for most farmers. However, even this might, in many cases, be obscured by the fact that milk marketing happens round-the-year, as opposed to the more visible money generated from the one-time sale of paddy, wheat, sugarcane or cotton. Bulk income from the so-called main crop may help marry ones daughter or build a new house, but the cash from milk sales is what is squirrelled away by the homemaker to meet the familys day-to-day expenses. It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.Also, while a sugarcane grower may not cultivate cotton, just as mustard or chana farmers are unlikely to plant paddy, virtually all of them produce some quantity of milk. If every farmer is, by implication, a dairy farmer  a rising share of the milk that the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Amul) procures is now being supplied those having 30 or more animals, fed on fodder grown in-house(see The Big Picture: A new churning )  it makes all the more sense to discard the traditional subsidiary view of dairying.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The number is reducing every year as the department is trying to take measures, he said.A senior official from the department, on anonymity, said that on an average, every year in Karnataka, 200 new boilers are added.These boilers need routine inspection. The wear and tear also cause damage. We can prevent accidents, provided it is routinely checked and maintained.The owners focus more on production than maintenance, official said.Further, an official said, though there are 3,000 boilers, there are hardly 10 officials, including the Joint Director, Assistant Director. Normally the inspection is conducted by inspectors, with one inspector for every 300 to 400 boilers. How can one person inspect so many boilers in one year? Some boilers need inspection twice a year to get certified. We need people to conduct a routine inspection. The department is planning to hire three more people, but even then it wont be enough, he said.When contacted T G Manjunath, Director of Factories, Boilers, Industrial Safety and Health, said, there is a shortage of inspection staff but they are trying to manage. The government of India has also given some relaxation on inspection.All these years, it was a department official. Now, third-party inspection is also possible, where an external private agency is given authorisation to do a periodic inspection. This will certainly lessen the burden, added the official."

Telegraph picturePatna: Stress might raise glucose level in your blood causing diabetes while it can cause hypertension as well.Doctors said this during the concluding day of the 30th annual conference of Indian Society of Atherosclerosis Research (ISAR) at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Patna, on Saturday.""Under stress, the body goes into fight or flight mode, raising blood sugar levels to prepare one for action. Scientifically, when a person is under stress, the adrenal glands trigger the release of glucose stored in various organs to fuel up body to do work which lead to elevation of glucose level in blood which causes diabetes while the adrenal glands produces two stress hormones - epinephrine and norepinephrine which play a role in increasing blood pressure causing hypertension. When one is under stress, certain hormones are produced which causes obesity and affect his/her metabolism rate,"" said cardiologist Anjali Arora from the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital during the conference.""Expectant women have been found suffering from diabetes because pregnancy gives them physical and mental stress. Stress can be described as anything that tends to change the control which one has over his/her body and emotions,"" added Anjali.Dr Amit Gupta from Noida's Amrapali Hospital said diabetes was occurring not only due to hereditary reasons but stress was also the reason. ""Atherosclerosis, the disease in which plaques build up in the arteries is linked with diabetes. Diabetic people have high chances of suffering from atherosclerosis which causes cardiovascular disease and stroke,"" said Dr Gupta.Dr Nirupam Prakash from ISAR's Uttar Pradesh chapter said women have chances of developing high blood pressure problem in post-menopause period due to decline in the oestrogen hormone which modulates blood pressure. He said women should take up regular exercise and eat healthy food to minimise chances of developing blood pressure problems.Dr Prakash also spoke about how the heart abruptly stops beating when one suffers from very high blood pressure. ""The person might face cardiac arrest in this condition. So controlling blood pressure is the need of the hour,"" he said.Postgraduate students were also awarded for their research works on the occasion.

Behind the moment of being able to use the grocery shopping list, is the thought of 'how did all those products reach the store in the first place, and then, how were they able to be taken home'?The answer sits firmly packaged in one of the most important, yet working-in-the-background sort of industries  Packaging. And Manjusjree Technopack is a packaging household name today, with innovations in the plastic packaging space, which is the driving force of how food, beverage, and other home FMCG companies seamlessly position, sell and supply their products today.Way back in 1983, then Assam-based Manjushree Technopack set out producing flexible plastic packaging for the tea industry in Eastern India, supplying pouches, bags and other products. In 1994, it purchased a unit in Bengaluru.""A thought occurred to me: Why not, we expand out of Assam?"" reminisces Vimal Kedia, the Founder and Managing Director of Manjushree Technopack.""We had a plan to work in the plastic PET bottle space. We went around government departments, and met stakeholders to understand the market. We set up this facility totally new. We thought this is a good area for PET bottles, because all the Southern states are industrialised, with high literacy rate and per capita income, resulting in greater spending power. Bengaluru is where logistics works out very well, because of its proximity to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Kerala and Maharashtra. If you cover all of South India, 60% of consumption is covered,"" he tells DH.Manjushree's first facility in Bengaluru came up at Bommasandra, which also came to house a unique packaging heritage museum, exhibiting over 80 years of packaging.The PET at homePET or Polyethylene Terephthalate is one the greatest innovations in the packaging space, let alone plastic packaging. Over 20 years ago, PET bottles were not in vogue. When this innovation arrived in India, women were easily attracted to it because they could reuse the wide-mouthed PET jars, for keeping masalas, groceries, sugar, tea powder, salt, spices, and so on. Earlier, glass jars and tin cans were used. PET bottles are easy to handle, no breakage if dropped, and come in handy with the purchase of most items for the home and kitchen.""Initially, we would send PET consignments of tea packaging by train all the way to Eastern India, because the demand was huge, with limited players,"" Kedia says.Explaining the science behind PET packaging, with tea as an example, he says: ""In tea, only 100 gm, 250 gm, 500 gm, and 1 kg are popular sizes in India. The 250 gm tea packs constitute 60% of sales, either in pouch or PET containers, 25% are from 500 gm, while the balance is between 100 gm and 1 kg. The science here involves knowing popular sizes and what should be the volume by density. Tea will require a particular size of capacity to pack. In the same way, oil requires different sizing. A 250 gm tea pack requires a 750 ml jar, but to pack 250 ml oil or water, one requires a 250 ml bottle.""A second factory came up in 2003, which merged its earlier factory within itself, setting up unified operations. As business expanded, Manjushree acquired land in the Bidadi Industrial Area and opened a large factory to manufacture preforms for cola and bottling industries, owing to high tonnage  Every day, that facility produces about 250 tonnes, while Bommasandra makes only 50 tonnes. Production level has risen to an annual output of four billion units of PET preforms, bottles and containers, which corresponds to 15% share in the overall Indian PET market.""We moved up with all the industries, and our uniqueness was in service, quality and design. We invested in technologies and innovations, understanding customers' ideas. We imported bottle-blowing machines from Japan, preform machines from Canada, film machines from Germany, and multi-layer technologies from Italy, so as to never compromise on quality. The main crux here is reliability and integrity. If I get an order, which I don't deliver on time, my customer's factory will shut down. And if his product is out of the market for even one week, someone else will take over,"" Kedia says.Industry mantraPackaging has two formats: Flexible (wrappers), which is economical and cheap; and Rigid, which can be held in hand and is reclosable. General merchandise in India is packed in cheaper flexible packs, against expensive rigid packaging. Premium products like shampoos, cosmetics, and colas, are packed in rigid bottles, which are convenient to use, carry, refrigerate, and reuse.Today, Manjushree is one of the largest manufacturers of 'anything in rigid packaging', supplying to a mega host of customers and industries. The company caters to 12 sectors including food and beverage, edible oil, alcobev, dairy, personal care, and home care, among others.Last year, Manjushree acquired rival Varahi, emerging as a pan-India company  with seven operational plants in Karnataka, Himachal Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Assam, with a total annual manufacturing capacity rising to 1,25,000 MT. Today, the company's clients, who number around 200, include Patanjali, Dabur, SC Johnson, Marico, Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Reckitt-Benckiser, Mondelez, and many others. It also exports to 10 countries.""Totally, we have over 1,000 designs from 5-ml containers to 20-litre potable water bottles. We can manufacture any size for any industry. We are capable of making bottles for any product, be it acidic, processed food, or dry product, as we even have moisture and oxygen barriers. Besides PET, we work with Low-density polyethylene (LDP), High-density polyethylene (HDP), Polypropylene, LED bulbs made of Polycarbonate, and Polystyrene,"" Kedia says.Plastic perilIndia's plastic packaging industry, which is largely unorganised, is expected to reach $73 billion by 2020, at 18% CAGR, according to a report by FICCI and Tata Strategic Management Group, which also states that the size of the industry in India today is at $32 billion, constituting only 4% of the global packaging industry.The largest consumer of plastic products is the beverage space at 40% in India (global is 60%), led by colas, followed by liquor (10%), pharmaceuticals (8%), and then other health supplements, and miscellaneous products.With plastic comes the question of its inherent threat to the biosphere and its unfortunate ability to degenerate the environment, if not treated or disposed of properly.""The biggest challenge is plastic mismanagement. The government has come out with the Plastic Waste Management Rules, which specifies producers' responsibilities. Even citizens must be disciplined enough to dispose of plastic in a separate bin, lest we all continue to suffer,"" Kedia, who is also the President of PET Association for Clean Environment, says, adding that awareness and stringent punishment is needed.Manjushree is carrying out R&D on biodegradable plastics, which isn't in much use, owing to its high cost. ""It has to be produced from plants  sugarcane to molasses, from which Monoethylene glycol has to be sourced. Biodegradable plastic doesn't fulfill requirements of all industries,"" he says.A way out would be to reduce the weight of a plastic bottle or container, and also using recycled plastic. ""We look at new designs through our dedicated design studio, on how to reduce weight and plastic use. By this, the customer reduces his packaging costs, and it is our objective to reduce plastic usage every year,"" he adds.Till date, Manjushree Technopack has invested over Rs 500 crore. Last year, it logged a turnover of Rs 650 crore, and will close this year at Rs 850 crore, a growth of 30%. ""We eye Rs 1,000 crore in turnover by 2019,"" concludes Kedia."

(File/Photo) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath. (File/Photo)Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said his government would take help from Mauritius in sugarcane research to get sugar production in the state at par with international standards. He was speaking to mediapersons in Lucknow shortly after returning from a three-day trip to the country.Speaking about Mauritius having a 51 per cent Hindu population and how those who migrated from India to Mauritius decades ago had still preserved their culture, Adityanath cited examples like a sacred pond called Ganga Talao, a 108-ft-tall statue of goddess Durga, over 350 temples and the Ramayana Center for research in Mauritius. He further said that considering the countrys position in the Hind Mahasagar (Indian Ocean), Mauritius is significant not only from the point of view of trade, but security as well.The chief minister said his government was also working on a proposal to set-up a Pravasi Bhartiya Bhawan in Varanasi along with a museum to depict the history of Girmitiya labourers, who had migrated to Mauritius over a century ago. Apart from tracing the roots of these labourers along with the Mauritius government, UP government officials would also visit Kolkata, from where these labourers had left the country, said Adityanath.They have saved their culture in adverse situations. Be it Bhojpuri, Hindi, Tulsi, Ramayna, they preserved it all. They also got cultural heritage status for Bhojpuri Gawai from UNESCO, said the chief minister. He also said that while a section is also working on ensuring the inclusion of Bhojpuri in the curriculum of schools in Mauritius, there is also a Hindi secretariat in the country.Stating that Mauritius had the potential to become a world trade centre, Adityanath said that though people of Indian origin are settled there in large numbers and hold important posts, the countrys economy is still in the hands of people with originate from France. He said efforts are on not only to bring in technical experts and investment from there, but to also ensure Indian businessmen also invest in that country.The CM indicated that both the Centre and state government were working on reviving the Buddhist Circuit project and a plan to establishing a Buddhist Research Centre in UP as well.Budha par ab shodh Cheen kare bari ajeeb si baat hai. Budh ke bare mein jo de sakte hain, hum de sakte hain, (It is strange that China now does research on Budh. Whatever can be provided about Budh, it is us who can provide it). He further said that it would be strange if China today makes a claim over Buddha, adding that most related to him are in India, especially UP and Bihar.Adityanath said that the state government has also invited those associated with the Maitriya Budha project for discussion to understand the reasons for the project being a non-starter after over 15 years.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But after that, the realtors did not do much to resolve the issues in their projects, which are stuck, mostly due to funds crunch, a Greater Noida authority official said.According to officials, builders in Noida had promised to deliver 16,000 flats in three months while builders in Greater Noida had assured delivery of 34,000 flats in three months.We have delivered 1,500 flats in the last two months. Builders are yet to deliver flats in other projects. Many builders are completing the formalities to deliver around 8,000 flats in next three months, a Noida authority official said.Greater Noida builders are yet to start delivery of flats in stuck projects, officials said."

The committee comprises industries minister Satish Mahana, urban development minister Suresh Khanna and minister of state for industry and sugar mills Suresh Rana. The committee has held many meetings with the builders to expedite delivery.On September 12, chief minister Yogi Adityanath directed the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway authorities to deliver 50,000 flats in three months. However, builders are yet to expedite delivery and offer relief to homebuyers.The government wants builders to expedite delivery of flats to provide relief to homebuyers. If the builders do not deliver or solve buyers issues as per their promised schedule, we will initiate legal action against them. The committee made it clear that whoever fails to deliver is bound to face stringent action, said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.Of 50,000 flats,12,500 flats are to be delivered in Noida, 27,500 in Greater Noida and 10,000 in areas under the Yamuna Expressway authority.Now, the committee has instructed the builders to deliver flats by December-end to evade action. The authorities are trying to help builders in delivering flats to benefit buyers.There are 31 projects for which occupancy certificates (OC) are about to be issued. It will help around 20,000 buyers in getting delivery, provided the builders complete all formalities related to OC application. We will meet them on November 15 to resolve minor issues and expedite delivery, said Debasish Panda, CEO of the Greater Noida authority.The builders will be able to deliver flats faster if the UP government further relaxes the process of issuance of OCs. For example, the authorities should start issuing OC to a ready building without asking for land dues at this stage. And once the OC is issued, the authority can recover land dues per flat at the time of registration. If the government supports the builders, delivery will happen quickly, said Getambar Anand, CMD, ATS Builders, and president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India."
5a522bdb9855b770e0374f6e,Noida:&thinsp;Authorities to waive off interest for litigation period,http://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authorities-to-waive-off-interest-for-litigation-period/story-YznL9Reb2PIQWwbnb1AHSP.html,2017-11-09,"The Noida and Greater Noida authorities have decided to give an interest waiver on the outstanding land dues to builders whose housing projects got delayed due to land disputes.The move comes after the Uttar Pradesh state government-appointed three-minister committee of industries minister Satish Mahana, urban development minister Suresh Khanna and minister for state for sugar cane and industry Suresh Rana approved the waiver.Builders were demanding an interest waiver for the period when construction was disrupted due to land disputes between the government and farmers whose land was acquired for development and realty projects.The committee has allowed us to look into applications of builders, who are seeking a waiver for the period when their projects were affected due to court cases. In the past as well, the authority board took decisions to resolve such cases but it could not be executed. Now, we will look into this issue on a case-to-case basis, said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.In Noida, there are around 10 big housing projects for which interest waiver for the period has been sought. The realtors alleged that they failed to get possession of the land on time due to ongoing cases.Many builders failed to finish their housing projects as per the scheduled deadline because farmers had challenged the land acquisition by the respective authorities and filed pleas in the Allahabad high court and the Supreme Court.The case between the Noida authority and farmers pertaining to group housing land took several years to be resolved. In some cases, the cases dragged on for three-four years. During this period, builders were forced to suspend construction at the site due to high court and Supreme Court orders.The builders were alloted group housing land against payment to be made in instalments. If they defaulted on payment, they had to pay 11%-14% interest on land dues. The builders argued that since their realty projects got affected due to the land dispute between the government and the farmers, the interest must be waived off.In comparison to Noida, many more projects in Greater Noida were stuck due to litigation. Around 30 builders are claiming interest waiver on the basis that their work was disrupted.We have a committee that is looking into such cases and proposals submitted by builders for a waiver, said Debasish Panda, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.Builders said that if the interest waiver is given, it will help them resolve issues related to flat delivery.The government must look into the cases where construction was disrupted due to court orders in response to farmers applications. Because in these cases, builders were not at fault, said Amit Modi, vice-president of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (western UP) and director of ABA Corp.Six projects of Amrapali Group in Greater Noida West and two in Noida were caught up in litigation and thereby, construction work was disrupted. The builder is demanding an interest waiver for the period when work was affected due to litigation.If the authorities give us interest waiver for the period when work was halted due to the dispute between the farmers and the authorities, our projects will be benefited. We are hopeful of delivering around 30,000 flats and providing relief to homebuyers if the interest waiver is provided. Not only Amrapali, but other builders will also be immensely benefited, said Shiv Priya, director, Amrapali Group."

People are compelled to live with fear and hate, and a hostile state, as normalised elements of everyday living. An old farmer in Uttar Pradesh lost his son transporting cattle to a lynch mob. The police did not register this as a lynch killing, the killers are untraced, and he has not even seen his sons post-mortem report. He said to us, his face lined with sorrow, Maine sabar kar liya. I have learned to endure.Attempting love, atonement, conscience and justice, the Karwan-e-Mohabbat travelled through India from east to west, traversing Assam, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Delhi, Western Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan and Gujarat. The landscape changed  paddy fields, areca nut groves, sugarcane fields, millet farms, arid wastelands. But the stories we heard in state after state were frighteningly similar.We found widows, mothers, fathers and children, numbed with incomprehension at the ferocity of loathing and violence that had snatched from them their loved ones. How could parents of two boys in Nagaon, Assam come to terms with the lynching of their sons by a mob from their neighbouring village, accusing them of being cow thieves? Why would they gouge their eyes out and cut off their ears? Why would complete strangers stab Harish Pujari 14 times near Mangalore, pulling out his intestines, only because they mistook him for a Muslim when he was riding pillion behind his Muslim friend?Dalits are viciously attacked by upper caste neighbours to crush any assertion. Single women remain vulnerable to incredible medieval cruelty by family and neighbours, branded as witches. Christians in tribal regions are subjugated by violence targeting their priests, nuns and places of worship, and by laws criminalising religious conversions. But the foremost targets of hate violence by lynching and police killings are Muslims, and it is they who have most abandoned hope.Against Muslims, the hate weapon of choice is public lynching. We read of lynching of Blacks in America as public spectacles, watched by white families in picnics. In todays India, this same objective of lynching as public performance is accomplished with the video camera. Most lynch attacks are filmed by the attackers, with images of their victims  humiliated, cringing, begging for their lives. In a particularly horrifying incident in Jharkhand, in a busy market square in Ramgarh, a mob stops the car of a Muslim man. A huge pile of red meat  the size of the body of a full cow  appears on the street, the mob claiming that they seized this from the car. He is filmed as they beat him to death. Laughing faces of attackers appear in the video. They upload the videos even as they lynch the man and torch his car. His young son receives the video of his father being lynched on his mobile even as the lynching is underway.We found that lynch videos are widely and avidly shared among young Hindutva activists. As evidence of what they see as their valorous exploits. As proof that the state will protect them. As public exhibitions of the humiliation of their enemy communities. And for drafting new recruits to militant Hindu supremacist formations like the Hindu Yuva Vahini founded by the chief minister of Uttar Pradesh Yogi Adityanath.We found families that were bereaved by hate violence bereft of hope of either protection or justice from the state. The police in almost all the 50 families we met during our travels in eight states registered criminal charges against the victims, and treated the accused with kid gloves, not opposing their bail. A lynch mob, for instance, attacks a vehicle transporting cattle, killing some of the transporters. The police registers criminal cases of illegal cow smuggling, animal cruelty and rash driving against the victims. It obliterates completely the fact that the men were lynched. Or, in other cases, it mentions anonymous mobs who are never caught. The families of people attacked by lynch mobs sometimes do not even file a complaint with to the police, because far from getting justice, the police would register criminal charges against them.Even more worrying, we found that in Haryana for the past two years, and in Western Uttar Pradesh since Adityanath became chief minister, the police has allegedly taken on the work of the lynch mob. And unlike lynching, targeted police killings have barely registered in the national conscience.Dalits homes were gutted and women and men attacked by their Rajput neighbours in Shabirpur of Saharanpur district, only because they had the temerity to plan the installing of a five-foot statue of Ambedkar on their own community land. They could not accept that the statue on a raised platform would display Ambedkar pointing his finger at the public street on which they walked. In Dangawas in Rajasthan, six men were crushed under tractors because they dared to demand their land back after their claims had been validated by every court. In Anand district in Gujarat, the only crime of a Dalit youth was to seek a dry portion of the village commons that was not a swamp to skin a cow.But hearteningly, we found that the Dalits in all three states were angry, proud, organised and fiercely determined to fight back. In Shabbirpur, the Dalits have converted en masse to Buddhism, immersing their Hindu idols in the village ponds. Jai Bhim was their resounding slogan everywhere.This was in stark contrast to the Muslims, who are today crushed, isolated and despairing. And we found in all these local communities profound and pervasive failures of compassion. We encountered very little acknowledgment, regret or remorse among the upper-caste Hindu communities in any of the states we travelled. They remain convinced that somehow their Muslim and Dalit neighbours deserved their cruel deaths to lynch mobs or police bullets.There is a gathering darkness in our land, less and less penetrated by the light of compassion and solidarity. As India is fast mutating into a republic of hate, why do we just watch from the sidelines?In Nuh in Haryana, a young Muslim man said, A poisonous wind is blowing through our country. I feel a stranger in my own homeland.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Situated beside a granary in Chawri Bazar, it has been serving fruit sandwiches since 1948.The sandwiches, with apple, chiku, pineapple, and grape stuffed between slices of white bread, are a delicacy you will probably not find anywhere else in the Capital.The basic ingredients of each fruit sandwich, besides the fruit, are white cream, home-made paneer and sugary kesar chutney. Some of the specialties are seasonal, but the rule doesnt apply to all seasonal produce. The mango sandwich, for instance, is available round the year. They also serve toasted sandwiches with a simple filling of tomatoes and cucumber.The area where the Jain Coffee House is located has a colourful history. It was a red-light district during the Mughal era. Serious-minded city explorers, however, visit the area to photograph crumbling old balconies and try delicious streetside, vegetarian-only snacks such as aloo tikkis, gol-gappas and bedmi puri.If you dont have a taste for fruit sandwiches, you might like the savoury namkeen sandwich layered with paneer, tomato slices, pomegranate seeds, and flavoured with coriander leaves and light spices.The dimly lit coffee house is owned by a family of grain merchants from north Delhis Kanhaiya Nagar. A few assistants spend the day placing sliced tomatoes on slices of white bread. Its founder, Lala Shambhu Dayal Jain, had migrated to the city from Shikarpur in western Uttar Pradesh.The coffee house also serves fruit shakes. But you should wash down the sandwiches with its excellent ginger-flavoured chai.Sadly, Jain Coffee House doesnt have patience for people who like to sit for hours over a single cup of coffee.

The Air Quality Index (AQI) improved to an average reading of 308, even as the city government extended the ban on the entry of trucks till further orders.Officials said light rain is expected on Wednesday, which might intensify the fog but could clear the smog.Delhi has been experiencing dense smog for about a week, forcing the authorities to enforce emergency measures in the National Capital Region.Here are the highlights:9.37pm: Gadkari says electric transportation could ease the situation in Delhi a bit like Nagpur which has 200 electric taxis that are going to swell to 1,000 next month.9.35pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari urges farmers to produce ethanol and biofuel from stubble instead of burning them. These can fuel vehicles including motorbikes on flex engines that will be launched shortly. A tonne of rice straw can produce 430 litres of ethanol, he says.9.33pm: 50% pollution from automobiles in Delhi will be removed after these projects as vehicles from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh will not be required to enter Delhi, says Gadkari.9.30pm: Eastern Peripheral Expressway that will be completed by January and the Delhi-Meerut Expressway project and other projects worth Rs 40,000 crore to decongest Delhi will contribute significantly in curbing pollution, says Gadkari.9.27pm: Road transport minister Nitin Gadkari says he has written to environment minister Harsh Vardhan to look into Delhis pollution problem and get it studied by experts including international consultants.9.25pm: If vehicles are stopped or converted into electricity, still there is no guarantee that the pollution will stop completely. Climatic changes are also behind it and there is need of a holistic approach, says road transport minister Nitin Gadkari.9.22pm: Delhi pollution is not related to only automobile pollution.

The CPCB task force will meet tomorrow (November 15) and the day after (November 16) and suggest future course of action as drizzle is expected, says CPCB member secretary A Sudhakar.9.02pm: Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) member secretary A Sudhakar says Delhis air quality may further improve on Wednesday as light rains are expected, which will help in flushing suspended particulates away.9.00pm: Delhi HC says stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana alone cannot be blamed for the poor air quality in the national capital.8.58pm: Delhi HC tells AAP government: Entire city is unable to breathe. Look at your concern in the areas of education and health facility. We want the same for public transport.8.56pm: All the authorities have opined that the major cause for air pollution was vehicles. So the Delhi government should make an effort on war-footing to bring in more buses.

Her family says she had not eaten for five days. The state government is investigating whether the family was denied their monthly quota of cheaper food-grain because Shakina, who was paralysed, could not be present at the ration shop for her fingerprint authentication for Aadhaar.Shakina's husband Mohd Ishaq says they begged the ration shop owner for grains when she was paralysed.The Yogi Adityanath government says its initial inquiries suggest Shakina died of an illness, not starvation.The family alleges that it had been denied ration under the Public Distribution System for November, because Shakina - marked as the head of the family in the ration card - was too unwell to be even taken to the shop in a rickshaw, as she was every month.""My wife died because of hunger. She was very ill. We used to take her there in a rickshaw. This time she was very ill. We begged the Kotedar (ration shop owner), but he said he would not give anything without the biometrics,"" said Mohd Ishaq, Shakina's husband.The ration shop owner insisted that Shakina come for her biometric identification using a fingerprint machine at the ration shop, says the family.The family is entitled to 35 kg of subsidised wheat, rice and sugar each month under the central government-sponsored Antyodaya scheme for the poorest.Seema Tripathi, the official in charge of foodgrain supply in Bareilly, said there is no order to deny food if anyone can't be present to authenticate their biometric data.""We found out through the newspapers. She had an Antyodaya card. We are trying to find out the exact cause of the death. There is no provision of the government that people will be denied rations because of an Aadhaar card. We have alternative systems in place. If the person in whose name the Antyodaya card is cannot go, then there is a provision for other relatives to be given ration,"" Ms Tripathi said. Sources in the local administration also question the starvation allegation because they say Shakina had about Rs 4,000 in her bank account. However, they have no answer to the question of why the ration shop insisted on Aadhaar biometrics to provide their share of food.In September, an 11-year-old girl died crying for ""bhaat, bhaat (rice)"" at her village in Jharkhand, allegedly because her family had been denied ration for not linking it with an Aadhaar ID. The state government ordered that no one should be denied food benefits for want of Aadhaar-linking."

Narayanasamy Ministry, in its first Cabinet meeting, had taken a decision to write off loans taken by farmers from PACS. However, the Lieutenant Governor referred the issue to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs for its approval.With the matter pending for approval, farmers have stopped repaying and societies have stopped issuing no-objection certificates.Its a tricky situation. Farmers have stopped re-paying the amount as it was a policy decision taken by the government to write off loans. Only when it is published in the gazette will the loan be formally closed, said an official with PACS.Big demandAs many as 4,000 farmers have taken loans from various PACS.The societies used to provide Rs. 7,000 per acre, mainly for paddy cultivation. The societies had issued loans totalling Rs. 19. 8 crore, a source in the government told The Hindu .There is a huge demand for fresh loans, especially in Karaikal. But we have stopped issuing fresh loans since the decision to waive off loans is pending, he added.According to an employee of PACS, the societies were put to undue financial stress as these loans had turned into non-performing assets. Only those who want extra amount have made repayment, he said.N. Murugayian, president of sugarcane growers co-ordination committee, said since banks had stopped issuing fresh loans, farmers were driven to private money lenders.Leader of Communist Party of India (Marxist) V. Perumal said the government had taken a decision taking into account the prevailing distress in the farm sector. When societies stop issuing loans, farmers go to money lenders and get exploited. It has been almost a year since the Cabinet took a decision. They delay is causing hardship to farmers, he said.When a newly formed government in Uttar Pradesh could implement farm loan waiver immediately after swearing-in, why cant Puducherry government do it. Its really sad to drag farmers into the political turf war, Mr. Perumal added."

It can make us notice details we may have overlooked, emotions we may not have tapped into, and, at its very best, give us a completely new perspective. While writers are the rulers of the worlds they create, photographers must make do with the world they inhabit. They must observe it patiently, waiting for that fleeting momentthat split second when everything comes together in visual coherence.Some use the medium to document the ordinary in the extraordinary, like Showkat Nanda, 34, with his haunting images of the widows of Kashmir (featured on page 1). Others use it to comment on the erasure of natural habitats, like Asmita Parelkar, a documentary-wildlife photographer whose series on animal trafficking helped create awareness of the urgency of the problem.We list young photographers with different areas of focusdocumentary, street, wildlife, fashion and interior-architecturedelving into their practice and seeking to offer insights into their visual thinking.To curate this list, we reached out to galleries and senior photographers. While we couldnt include many deserving names, we hope this gives you a glimpse. They come from different regionsKolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabadbut their photographs transcend the boundaries of time, space and geography. Each photographer has a compelling story to tellof that decisive moment which prompted them to pick up the cameraShowkat Nandas self-portrait.Showkat NandaBest known for: documentary photographyShowkat Nandas childhood memories of Kashmir are singed with the strife of the 1990s. A reticent child, he dreamt of becoming a surgeon. As violence tore through the state, however, Nandas dream crumbled. I began to believe that I would never live to grow into a young man. Survival became the topmost priority, he says. He lost his 17-year-old brother and 16-year-old cousin to the conflict. But while many children his age would go on to pick up stones, Nanda picked up the camera.Throwing stones at the Indian forces was a natural, human response to the situation one witnessed every day, he says. But I wanted to tell stories of my people. The desire to show the world the reality of a conflict that has devastated thousands of lives turned me towards photography. He borrowed his first camera, a Cosina C1 SLR, from his friends brother in 1997; he was 14 years old.I wanted to tell stories of my people [in Kashmir]. The desire to show the world the reality of a conflict that has devastated thousands of lives turned me towards photography.-In 2009, Nanda would shoot an image which would leave an indelible mark on him. I shot the image of a 12-year-old boy throwing stones at an armoured vehicle of the Indian forces, moments after his schoolmate died in my arms, Nanda says. It was a defining moment since he, a photojournalist, was compelled to play his role of a silent observer, while his instinct told him to pick up stones. He didnt rebel.Haleema, whose husband was arrested in 1998, on her way to a sit-in.Nandas photographs offer the insiders view of Kashmir. Perhaps one of his most bone-chilling works is The Endless Wait. It features Kashmiri women and children, often in isolation, waiting, silently, for the return of their husbands, brothers, sons and fathers (who disappeared mysteriously during the conflict). A womans face was the most prominent symbol of suffering in Kashmir, explains Nanda. In the early 1990s, during the crackdown, many men left their homes in fear of being arrested, spending days in forests. The only people left behind were elderly men, women and children. Nanda goes beyond the archetypal front-page images of women protesting and delves into their personal tragedies through quiet, yet haunting frames of longing and loneliness.Today, the 34-year-old has won recognition for his work: He has been a recipient of the Magnum Foundation Emergency Fund grant (2016), won the National Press Photo Award (2011), and a Fulbright fellow (2012). He has done his postgraduation in photojournalism from the University of Missouri, US, and in mass communication, from the University of Kashmir. Nanda is currently busy teaching visual storytelling to young photographers in Kashmir.Deepshikas self-portrait.Deepshikha JainBest known for: architecture photographyFor architecture photographer Deepshikha Jain, the process of looking at a building for hours and observing its intricate detailing is akin to reading a novel. One has to know and learn every part of it. Jain belongs to a group of young photographers who believe it is important to document the architectural facades that define an urban landscape. Architectural photography in India, as a niche or a specialization, didnt exist (until) almost eight years ago, she says.Jains two series, BOMbai and Urban Postcards, capture the different facets of the city, from modern skyscrapers to buildings caged in scaffolding. It is an attempt, perhaps, to immortalize the city through black and white stills.-Her interest in the visual arts led her to pursue a masters in architectural photography from the Spos International Photography School, Paris (2009-10). While many of her batchmates chose the field of fashion photography, Jain chose to shoot archaic arches and modern symmetrical squares. She was invariably drawn to mansions falling into disrepair, as well as modernist masterpieces. I love architecture that is rooted, that has a story, that is raw and minimalist, and is all about the form which complements the function, she says.From the series Urban Postcards.Her first assignment was photographing some buildings designed by award-winning architect Anupama Kundoo in Auroville, in 2010. Jain has since worked for architects such as Annkur Khosla, Riyaz Tayyibji, and the architecture firm Morphogenesis, and shot for various publications, including Architectural Digest, Harpers Bazaar and Vogue.I think Bombay has influenced my sense of storytelling. I find urban stories very compelling, says the Mumbai-based 31-year-old.Villa Savoye by Le Corbusier, Paris, France (built from 1928-31).Her two series, Bombai and Urban Postcards, capture the different facets of the city, from modern skyscrapers to buildings caged in scaffolding. It is an attempt, perhaps, to immortalize the city through black and white stills.Bombay as we knew it has been disappearing. Matunga and Dadar were different from Bandra; Andheri was different from Borivali. But as the old structures are being erased and newer ones are built, my attempt is to document that change.Asmitas self-portrait.Asmita ParelkarBest known for: wildlife photographyMumbai-based Asmita Parelkars favourite image is from 1989. Its a photograph by Michael Nichols of primatologist Jane Goodall, with strands of her hair, backlit by the sun, seeming to fall delicately into the palm of a chimpanzee. It was the tenderness shared between two species that resonated with me, she says. At a broader level though, that tenderness is absent between humans and animals.Parelkar, 34, refers to another photograph, by Biplab Hazra, who won the Sanctuary Wildlife Photographer of the Year award earlier this month. The image, shot in West Bengal, shows a baby elephant on fire as it flees a mob with its mother. We dont respect animals or their habitat at all. Wild habitats are burnt down in the name of urbanization. That angst informs Parelkars photographic direction. Stories related to wildlife conservation and endangered species form the backbone of her work.From the series Illegal Wildlife Trade.Her series Illegal Wildlife Trade puts the spotlight on the brutality behind the slaughter and trafficking of animals. Parelkar was allowed access by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (which regulates the import and export of flora and fauna in the US) for it. They have a lab in Long Island, which works as a repository for the animals that are confiscated at harbours and airports. I made two-three trips and managed to photograph the animals, she says.As humans, weve pushed animals out of their natural habitat. While zoos exist under the pretext of protecting these animals, they ironically serve to entertain us.-While studying photojournalism at the International Center of Photography, New York (2010-11), Parelkar worked on a series that featured animals in captivity, particularly those living in zoos. As humans, weve pushed animals out of their natural habitat. While zoos exist under the pretext of protecting these animals, they ironically serve to entertain us, she says. Parelkar shot the series in five zoos across New York and its boroughs. In comparison to the zoos in India, she observes, these man-made habitats in New York were pristine. The dioramas replicated the natural habitat of the animals really well. But if you think about it, the paintings on the walls were fake. They have been done for our eyes. These animals were still in a confined space.From the series Giraffe Behind The Door.This project Giraffe Behind The Door, still ongoing, was published in The New York Times in 2011.Parelkar, who also designs photobooks, is part of the BIND collective, a platform that curates visual book exhibitions. This year, she has helped the collective put together Travelling Library, a pop-up photobook exhibition at the GoaPhoto festival (23-26 November).Saumya Khandelwals portrait by Reuben Singh.Saumya KhandelwalBest known for: documentary photographySaumya Khandelwal uses her camera as a truth-telling instrument, taking us on a cross-country ride to the peripheries, and making us look at social anomalies we would rather hide under the carpet. Her ongoing series, Child Brides Of Shravasti, shot over a period of three years, is a peephole view into the lives of young girls from a small town in Uttar Pradesh who are prematurely pushed into adulthood. There is an incomparable beauty in her imagesthey are piercingly intimate and poignant. My approach to making photos is always to reveal something more about the people I am photographing than just the information of whats happening, says Khandelwal. Instead of objectifying them, I would like to make it subjective, where the viewer can put a context to the lives of these people.Khandelwals ongoing series, Child Brides of Shravasti, is a peephole view into the lives of young girls from a small town in Uttar Pradesh who are prematurely pushed into adulthood.-From Alex Webb to Raghubir Singh, Khandelwals visual language has been influenced by their phenomenal oeuvres. Having been mentored by senior photographer Amit Mehra since 2012, she has gone on to assist Delhi Photo Festivals co-founder Prashant Panjiar, and VII photo agency photographers Jessica Dimmock and Stephanie Sinclair. The 27-year-old is also the recipient of the Getty Images Instagram Grant (2017), National Foundation of India Award (2017) and the Neel Dongre Photography Grant (2014 and 2015).Images from the series Child Brides Of Shravasti.Currently an in-house photographer at Thomson Reuters in New Delhi, Khandelwal also works on personal projects. They are reflective of her meditative documentary skills, where she immerses herself into the milieu, slowly unravelling its layers, one photograph at a time. Her first serious project was WaterThe Dying Lifeline (2013), which documented the devastating conditions of Indias existing water bodies. The series proved to be a turning point, convincing her to consider photography as a profession.Images from the series Child Brides Of Shravasti.When she was working in an Indian publication, she was the only woman photographer in the team. I hadnt looked at my profession through the lens of gender before, she says. I would get stories that involved women with the expectation that the subjects will be more comfortable in my presence, she says. So it was an opportunity to work on good stories. To make a mark in the field as a woman is challenging. But Khandelwal used it to her advantage. With an approach that is steeped in ethnography and visual journalism, Khandelwal is a photographer to reckon with.Ronny Sens portrait by Shreya Dev Dube.Ronny SenBest known for: documentary/street photographyRonny Sen is self-effacing as he tries to recall the first image that left an impact on him. It was a black and white image by Pablo Bartholomew in 1975, of Poohperhaps one of Bartholomews most unforgettable subjectslying on a bed, looking directly at the camera. There was something very special about the photograph, says Sen. Its a memory of an infatuation that grew into something incomprehensibly more. When I look at this photograph, it almost makes me touch that time. Thats the power of this medium.Sen received the prestigious Getty Images Instagram Grant last year for his powerful documentary work on Jharkhands Jharia coal town that has had, for decades, an intense, uncontrolled fire burning underground. He also has a string of accolades to his name, including being the recipient of artist residencies in Japan (2012) and Poland (2015). The 30-year-old, who began his journey in photography in Salt Lake, Kolkata, in 2006, began shooting in monochrome. His visual language has been heavily influenced by the works of the Japanese photographers Daid Moriyama and Eikoh Hosoe, as well as Bengali film-maker Ritwik Ghatak.Untitled from the series Dont Breathe.A large part of Sens pictorial record is marked by compositions of barely recognizable figures shot in low light, often accompanied by grains and blurs. There is a jarring, almost unsettling theme that pulsates through his work: shattered windows, deliberately blackened faces, an anonymous arm here, an unrecognizable torso there. Sens photographs are hypnotic, be it his first, dark, quasi-surreal photobook Khmer Din (2013), which depicts the grim underbelly of Siem Reap, Cambodia, or the palpably raucous atmosphere depicted in Dont Breathe (a series that began in 2008 and was first exhibited in 2011), which conveys the experience of travelling in unreserved train compartments.Growing up in the late 1990s was pretty chaotic. We were surviving one day at a time. It was the fear of death that got me closer to photography.-To an untrained eye, however, his frames may seem imprecise and flawed. Many of his works carry macabre overtonesreminiscent of a difficult past. Sen grew up on the streets of Kolkata, where many of his friends were addicted to brown sugar. Growing up in the late 1990s was pretty chaotic, he says. We were surviving one day at a time. Staying alive was a big deal. It was the fear of death that got me closer to photography, says Sen. To give some meaning to my life, art became extremely important.Untitled from the series Khmer Din.His series New World Chronicles Of An Old World Colour (2015), which he created while at an art residency at the Gdask City Gallery in Poland, was a departure from his black and white photography. Polish film-maker Krzysztof Kielowskis Three Colours trilogy served as inspiration, with Sen depicting the melancholic Polish winter, while looking for traces of red, where solidarity had once emerged and how capitalism had finally taken over today. He is currently working on his first feature film, titled Cat Sticks (slated for release in early 2018)the screenplay has been co-written with Soumyak Kanti DeBiswas. He is also working on a project commissioned by Royal Enfield (in association with the India Foundation for the Arts) to travel and photograph his journeys for a possible book.Swarat Ghoshs self-portrait.Swarat GhoshBest known for: street photographyAcross the canvas of sky, an outstretched arm, an umbrella thrown in the air and a plane taking flight. In another time, in one of Hyderabads oldest wrestling precincts in Yakutpura, a young boy catapults against a wall with the help of a rope, his head coveringalmost merging withthat of another boy standing next to him. There is a certain charm, a nuanced idiosyncrasy in Swarat Ghoshs images.His images, never static, are often characterized by levity. Ghoshs angles are peculiar; there are figures that seem to appear by chance; and others that seem to merge. Each element in the composition, though, falls into an unexpected coherence.Ghoshs angles are peculiar; there are figures that seem to appear by chance; and others that seem to merge. Each element in the composition, though, falls into an unexpected coherence.-It was in 2012 that Ghoshs wife gifted him his first camera, a Nikon D3000, for Durga Puja. I had never shot a single image before that, so I dont know what made her give me a camera, Ghosh says, laughing, over the phone. The gift kindled his interest in photography. Based in Hyderabad, Ghosh had a demanding 12-hour job as a graphic designer, but in his spare time, he enrolled in photography clubs, and explored different parts of the city with his group.Photographed near Mumbai airport, from the series Beyond Street.As an aspiring street photographer, the 37-year-old spent nights poring over booksfrom Robert Franks exquisite visual book, The Americans, which captured the lives of people in the 1950s, to Raghu Rais revolutionary documentation of Kolkata locals, Calcutta. In addition, the collective works of veteran photographers Kaushal Parikh and Prashant Godbole influenced him too.He has been a finalist in the reputed LensCulture Street Photography competition (2017), won the Neel Dongre Awards for Excellence in Photography (2016-17) and has been featured in one of the most sought after international photography publications, BURN magazine, as well as the National Geographic Traveller magazine. His works have been exhibited in Paris, London, Glasgow and Istanbul, as well as Mumbai and Hyderabad, among other cities.Young wrestlers at Yakutpura, Old Hyderabad, from the series Beyond Street.While his ongoing series, Beyond Street, emerged on the edit table when he realized that certain patterns and repetitions emerged while placing the images together, another series that he has been working on features his family.

A large part of Nisha Purushothamans life involves living away from the city, meandering through sprawling, open grasslands, and turning wildlife photography into her own branch of animal anthropology. From a group of cheetahs that appear to have broken away from a serious discussion, to capturing a rhinoceros crowned by birds as the sun setsPurushothamans images capture the interiority of the animal empire, making the unseen seen.We have to ensure that our work is used effectively to comment on issues as diverse as mountaintop removal mining and deforestation, or the very real impact of oil spills on marine life.-Purushothaman was born in Paravur, a small coastal village in Kollam, Kerala. Paddy fields and the Polachira wetlands were a 10-minute walk away from home. Becoming a person who loved nature, therefore, was not difficult, she says. It was only years later though, in 2008, when Purushothaman shifted to Dubai to work as a project manager at an advertising firm, that her interest in wildlife photography surfaced. It all started with a weekend photography trip during which she spotted over 150 species. I fell in love with birds. Slowly, instead of weekends, I started to shoot every day, at least an hour before I headed to work. And the more time I spent shooting, the more I became motivated to become a nature photographer.Cheetahs in Maasai Mara, Kenya.Since then, Purushothaman has travelled to some of the most forbidding terrain across India, Kenya, Tanzania, Alaska and Russia. She has photographed over 200 birds, as well as tigers, leopards and lions. As a practice, Purushothaman visits sanctuaries near her home in Dubai at least two-four times a week. I start from home around 4.30am and shoot till 10am. Nothing comes easy. As a wildlife photographer, you need to be fit in order to carry equipment, which can be as heavy as 10kg. Sometimes you even have to trek long distances, she says.An elephant in Amboseli National Park, Kenya.In 2004, Purushothaman, along with her friend Hermis Haridas, established Paws Trails Explorers, a global platform for wildlife conservation, travel and photography. Using photographs to protect animals is immensely important to her. We have to ensure that our work is used effectively to comment on issues as diverse as mountaintop removal mining and deforestation, or the very real impact of oil spills on marine life. In 2016-17, Purushothaman became a finalist for the Hamdan International Photography Award. A TEDx speaker, she has hosted over 30 photography workshops around the world.Hashim Badanis self-portrait.Hashim BadaniBest known for: fashion photographyA model struts across a blur of crayon-ish greens and neon.

He ventured into commercial fashion photography in early 2016 to explore his ability to shoot differently. His fashion shoots developed an idiosyncratic identity, involving a blend of orchestrated and real people/life situations.An Irani caf fashion shoot for Vogue India.Badanis process of conjuring up images is akin to film-making. I try to build a narrative in my head. There is a loose script and the models are characters in that story. I assign a mood, a personality and situation to them, and it makes the process a lot more fun, he says. In fact, as an ode to Wong Kar-wai, Badani collaborated with Mumbai-based fashion brand Obataimu to weave in the theme of Chungking Express into a shoot for the brands Wabi Sabi line.Having shot for Vogue India, Rolling Stone India, Lonely Planet Magazine India and National Geographic Traveller India, Badanis work is not confined to fashion photography. He is currently collaborating with writer Zeenat Nagree on a story on Myanmars Rohingyas. Were trying to document the challenges they face in their daily life, their culture, and what the future holds for them, keeping in mind the current government stand, he says.Anshika Varmas portrait by Adil Hasan.Anshika VarmaBest known for: interiors/documentary photographyPhotographing interiors is a tough task. Attention to detail is of prime importance, of course, but its the ability to convey the intimacy of a luxurious restaurant, the quaintness of a caf, or the charm of a newly opened retail store, that marks out a good photographer. It involves the craft of making a three-dimensional space look visually appealing in the format of an uncompromisingly flat, often rectangular frame.Anshika Varmas initiation into photography happened when she was a student of social communications media at Sophia Polytechnic in Mumbai. I felt that images could transport people to different worlds. It was perhaps the multiplicity of different realities that got me hooked to photography, she says. Her first camera, a borrowed one, was a Nikon F65 SLR film camera. I had asked my mother to lend me her camera and some film so that I could walk around Bombay with it. I still have the camera up in my studio although I dont use it any more.Detail from a space designed by Adil Ahmad, Mumbai.From images of interior spaces that are suffused with dense, contrasting colours, to framing objects that come together in a seamless symmetry, Varma has the ability to balance the incongruous. Symmetry becomes primary for me while working with interiors. Whether the aesthetic of design is minimal or ostentatious, its important for the eye to not get lost in clutter, she says.Symmetry becomes primary for me while working with interiors. Whether the aesthetic of design is minimal or ostentatious, its important for the eye to not get lost in clutter.-In fact, Varma has explored myriad facets of photographyfrom documentary (dealing with themes of identity, memory and objects) to curating exhibitionsshe was co-curator of A Million Mutinies Later: India At 70, which was shown at Ffotogallery in Cardiff, Wales, in July. It looked into the everyday revolutions that are slowly and steadily transforming the social, cultural and political fabric of the nation, she writes on her website. Varmas work has appeared in Cond Nast Traveller, Motherland and People magazines, among other publications.

Even today, when I am looking for inspiration, I revisit it, and it affirms my belief that a compelling portrait is an invitation to envision.An image from Neighbourhood Watch, a personal body of work.In the past two years, Singh has consciously steered away from fashion photography to focus on personal projects that are driven by reportage and deal with socially relevant themes. The Wrestlers, for instance, features female wrestlers who have struggled hard to upend the feminine stereotype and transcend social norms in India. The series offers an insight not only into Singhs versatility as an artist, but is a reflection on her awareness as an observer on gender in a patriarchal set-up. The Wrestlers was part of Photographing The Female, which was exhibited at the FOCUS Photography Festival in Mumbai in March. For me the wrestlers are symbolic, wrote Singh in her introduction to the series. Each of their stories speaks of overcoming innumerable hardships, fighting family pressure and most importantly, living gender differently.An image for fashion label Bodice.In 2017, Singh was one of the 29 finalists at the FCBarcelona Photo Awards, and was handpicked by Focs Scotland (an international platform that invites conversations on identity and culture) to exhibit her work at Street Level Photoworks in Glasgow.

Its foremost task is how to spread hatred, create problems and humiliate others. In order to divert attention of the people, the BJP leaders pick up brooms or wear masks, he told reporters here.The BJP blames others (for lack of development in the State), but now it is ruling Uttar Pradesh.

This will affect cash flows, which may prove detrimental to the interests of sugar producers and very soon may impact their paying capacity to the sugarcane farmers,"" it noted.The government has extended the stock holding limit on traders by two months till December 31.As per the latest data, mills have produced a total of 13.73 lt sugar till November 15 of this season as against 7.67 lt in the year-ago period.Of this, mills in Uttar Pradesh - leading sugar producing state - have produced 5.67 lt as against 1.93 lt in the same period last year.Maharashtra - the country's second largest sugar producer, has manufactured 3.26 lt so far this season as against 1.92 lt a year ago.""The main contributors to the higher production of sugar are the sugar mills in UP and Maharashtra,"" ISMA said. Sugar output in Karnataka till November 15 of this season is almost same as that in the year-ago period. The production situation in other states is almost similar to last year, it added.According to ISMA, sugar offtake from mills during last two months was lower.

The two-fold increase is not only because of higher number of operating mills  80 mills started operating this year against 67 last year  but also because of a quantum jump in cane crushing from 29.25 lakh tonne in October-November last year to 68.05 lakh tonne this year.The sugar production also got a boost because of better sugar yielding cane varieties grown by farmers. Not surprisingly, sugar recovery rate also rose from 9.42% to 9.60%.""Sugar production looks impressive because of head start to cane-crushing. It needs to be maintained for next five to six months,"" said a senior official in the department.The high quantum of cane crushing and subsequent sugar production comes nearly 20 days after the state government increased the state advisory price (SAP) for sugarcane by Rs 10.UP had surpassed Maharashtra to become the highest sugar producing state in the country last year.Officials said that given the present production rate, the state would certainly repeat its performance this year.UP always had highest cane cultivation area in India but average and poor grade cane variety were limiting factors for sugar production.However, millers fear that the high production in first month may result in sugar glut, eventually leading to fall in prices.UP Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA), which represents private sugar mills in the state, is apprehensive of a fall in sugar prices affecting their compensation paying capacity."

Illustration: Jayachandran/MintThe India: Health Of The Nations States report, released last week, makes two things abundantly clear. The first is that the lack of such a granular, state-wise assessment of Indias public health scenario and trends in a common framework until now has been an inexplicable failure on the part of previous governments. The Narendra Modi government has done well to rectify the lack. The second is that the nature of the countrys health challenges has changed sharply over the past couple of decades and is going to continue changing.The latter should not come as a surprise. Global precedent shows that a countrys health profile changes as its economy and level of urbanization grow. The threat posed by communicable diseases such as tuberculosis and malaria, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseasescollectively termed infectious and associated diseases in the reportdeclines, and the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) grows. India is no different, even if the rapidity and extent of the change are startling.In 1990, the total disease burden of infectious and associated diseases in the country, measured using the metric of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), was 61%. The burden of NCDs at the time was 30%. Cut to 2016 and those numbers have just about flipped: infectious and associated diseases account for 33% of the disease burden while NCDs account for 55%. This trend is going to continue to play out as Indias socio-economic contours change. In roughly the same period that the report coversthe past quarter centurytwo thirds of the deaths globally have been because of NCDs. The World Health Organization predicts that over the next decade, NCD deaths will increase by 17% globally. And in high-income countries, generally speaking, they account for 80% or more of deaths. All of this leads to two conclusions.The first is the need for decentralized health policymaking. There is wide divergence between the health profiles of various regions and states in India. While infectious and associated diseases now account for less than half of the disease burden in all the states, the transition happened as early as 1986 and as late as 2010 depending on the state in question. Likewise, the NCDs burden covers a substantial rangefrom 48% of the state disease burden to 75%. Drill deeper and it gets even more complicated. The burden due to specific diseases within the NCDs and the infectious and other diseases groups differs substantially. This is true not just between groupings of economically similar statessay, industrialized states like Maharashtra and Gujarat, and Empowered Action Group states like Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradeshbut between similar states as well. This divergence, naturally, extends to the risk factors that cause various diseases. In the face of this reality, Centre-dominated health policymakingsave in its broadest contours such as increasing insurance coverage, setting standards for public sector health institutions and deciding drug policymust inevitably diminish the effectiveness of state response.The second takeaway is the nature of state response will have to enter relatively new territory. According to the report, The leading individual cause of death in India in 2016 was ischaemic heart disease... The other NCDs in the top 10 individual causes of death included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease. Risk factors such as dietary risks, high blood pressure, high blood sugar and tobacco use rank correspondingly high.In a journal article Beyond Carrots And Sticks: Europeans Support Health Nudges, Lucia A. Reisch, Cass R. Sunstein and Wencke Gwozdz note that tools such as nutritional standards, fiscal measures and hard regulation such as banning advertisements for certain products have been less effective globally than hoped for in addressing such risk factors. Instead, they note: Increasing research evidence suggests that a key to changing nutritional and activity patterns is the purposeful design of living and consumption environmentsthe so-called choice architecture. In other words, nudges, brought into prominence in recent years by the work of Nobel Prize winning economists like Daniel Kahneman and Richard H. Thaler. An increasingly large number of countries are incorporating this in policymaking; the UKs Behavioural Insights Team is perhaps one of the most well-known attempts.Building an effective choice architecture can require direct government action. Urban planning is perhaps the best example of this. Ensuring that citizens lead a more physically active life would directly address a number of risk factors for NCDs. That means ensuring ease of access from everything to pedestrian access to public transport and communal green spaces. Effective architecture will require bringing private enterprises on board in other instancesfrom displaying health information and advice in stores to appropriate food labelling, high salt warnings and product placement in stores.This sort of broad and diffuse response will not be easy to implement. And certainly, addressing the weak fundamentals of Indias health system is critical. But NCDs are called lifestyle diseases for a reason. Evidence from developed economies shows that addressing them requires inducing basic changes in the manner citizens live their lives, effective health systems notwithstanding. Achieving this without straying into state paternalism and heavy-handed regulationan ever present risk in Indiais going to be tricky but essential for fighting tomorrows health battle.Can nudges effectively address Indias growing NCD burden?

Photo: PTINew Delhi: Thousands of farmers protested in Indias capital, demanding better prices for their crops and relief from high debts, underscoring the challenges Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces before elections in his home turf Gujarat next month and nationally in 2019.Representatives from 184 farmer organizations squatted on a road leading to the parliament building in the heart of New Delhi, demanding a nationwide waiver of crop loans on the lines announced by some states like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, higher prices for their produce and lowering seeds and fertilizer costs.The protest is the latest challenge for Modi who promised to double farm incomes by 2022 and ensure a 50% profit over the cost of production. The number of farmers committing suicides climbed about 42% to 8,007 in 2015 from a year earlier, according to a farm ministry statement in parliament in February.I am struggling to take care of my family and considering the current situation, I dont think I can get out of this mess without any help from the government, said Jayesh Bhai Hurabhai, a farmer from Gujarat. We have come here with a lot of hope as farmers from all parts of the country have joined hands this time to protest.Some farmers travelled for more than 1,000 miles (1,609km) from different parts of the country to reach New Delhi to participate in the two-day protest that ended on Tuesday. As many as 300 widows of farmers who have committed suicides in the past years due to high farm loans also took part in the protest, with some holding placards that read Farmers are Robbed.Dwindling incomesAbout 800 million people of Indias 1.3 billion depend directly or indirectly on farming, with agriculture accounting for about 16% of the economy. The country is the worlds top grower of cotton and the second-biggest producer of wheat, rice and sugar.The farming community is agitated over falling food prices and high debt levels. Bumper harvests, boosted by a normal monsoon last year after back-to-back droughts and good rain this year, have hurt prices of crops such as oilseeds and pulses. Depressed prices, combined with poor arrangements for government-assured purchases, have triggered these protests.I have heard that the country is becoming prosperous. But what am I getting out of it?, said Pintu Patil, a farmer from the western state of Maharashtra. Rising input costs and household expenses are making it difficult to manage a seven-member family with an annual income of just about Rs2 lakh, he said.Indian farmers are likely to fetch about Rs36,000 crore less this crop season due to lower market prices of top seven commodities, including paddy, corn, cotton, soybean and some pulses, than what they would have received by selling at government-set minimum purchase prices, according to All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee.Minimum support prices for cotton, paddy and sugar cane have risen between 7% and 16% in the year ending in March 2018 from the start of 2014-15 when Modi came to power, according to government data.The government procurement agencies, which are mandated to purchase some agricultural commodities at fixed rates to support prices and supply to the government for its welfare programs, buy only a small portion of a commoditys total output, leaving million of farmers across the country to sell at the market-determined levels.

The institute trained them for three days to replicate the ideas in Vizianagaram district which has many sugar factories. According to officials, UP farmers depends on CO-0238 seed to get maximum production.They also cut the crop only three times but in Vizianagaram it is being done more than eight times. Interestingly, the expenditure is also very less in Bihar and UP where farmers spend only Rs. 50,000 per hectare but in Vizianagaram and Srikakulam it is up to Rs. 80,000. The farmers of UP are depending on inter-crops such as pulses and potatoes along with sugarcane to earn more income. We need to adopt those techniques to improve production in Vizianagaram district too, said Mr. Yadav while speaking to The Hindu . As many as 116 sugar factories in UP are in profits with the adoption of new technology, he added. The Vizianagaram administration planned to conduct training programmes for selected farmers to improve the production in the district. The Agriculture Department has been directed to prepare an action plan to implement new ideas from the next rabi and kharif seasons.Revival of factoryAITAM College professor and president of Parivartan Trust Chintada Ravikumar said that one lakh signatures were being collected to step up pressure on the government for revival of co-operative sugar factory of Amadalavalasa in Srikakulam district. Sugarcane growing and production can be made profitable activity if the government looks into the issue seriously. The sugarcane growing will go up in Srikakulam district if steps are taken to reopen the factory which was closed two decades ago, he added."

Ramasami, former secretary of Department of Science and Technology, is approved by the Centre.The institutes which are addressing different mandates should not be merged even though they are working in the same commodity and resources as they are specialised in nature and created for addressing special issues and problems of farming community, said the Agricultural Research Service Scientists Forum in its letter to Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Radha Mohan Singh.Funds cutScientists working for these institutes alleged that the merger would not only result in substantial cut in funds, but deprive the institutes of focus, original research and modern equipment.The objective of the government, they alleged, is to merge, corporatise and in some cases it may result in closure.In CIBA we are concentrating on low saline brackish water while ICMFRI in Kochi is focusing on capture fisheries. There is enormous scope and huge potential for brackish water aquaculture, as Tamil Nadu alone has 56,000 hectares of area and per annum generates Rs. 1,200 crore. Brackish water aquaculture empowers all sections of society while CIMFRI can benefit only trained fishermen, said a senior scientist of the CIBA, which has achieved many breakthrough in captive breeding of seabass, milk fish, white shrimp, karimeen , a delicacy in Kerala, and scat, an ornamental fish.Scientists explained that aquaculture technologies had contributed Rs. 35,000 crore of foreign exchange in the last couple of years. Instead of focussing more on aquaculture development which is the only scope for expanding fish production in the country, merging an aquaculture institute with capture fisheries will diminish scope of fisheries development in the country, they said.In fact, the ICMFRI, launched in 1947, originally functioned from Mandapam in Tamil Nadu, but moved to Kochi because of political reasons.Of the major States, T.N. has only three institutes.

(Bishwarup Dutta)Garden Reach: A statue of a couple carrying a sack of belongings each stands on the bank of the Hooghly, a stark monument to the indentured labourers crammed into a ship that had set sail from there in 1873 to reach the former Dutch colony of Suriname.Called the Mai Baap statue, it is a replica of the original monument of the same name in Parimaribo, the capital of Suriname on the east Atlantic coast.Minister of state for external affairs M.J. Akbar on Saturday unveiled a Dutch plaque on the base of the Mai Baap statue in Suriname Ghat during an event coinciding with the tiny nation's Independence Day. The memorial previously had plaques in English, Hindi, Bengali and Suriname.""The word 'indentured labour' hides the inherent exploitation of these poor workers. They were taken as replacement slaves and not employees. They were cheated... thaga diya. They had been told that they could come back after five years. But that was not to be,"" Akbar said, harking back to February 26, 1873.That was the day a ship named Lalla Rookh set sail from the jetty of the Calcutta port, carrying 400 labourers, most of them from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. They were being taken to Suriname to work in the sugar plantations there.The ship reached its destination on June 5, a day that is since observed in Suriname as ""Indian Arrival Day"".Sixty-four more ships would sail to the South African, African, Caribbean colonies after that historic first trip, carrying millions of indentured labourers.The gathering at Suriname Ghat on Saturday included the Surinamese ambassador Aashna Kanhai, herself a descendant of indentured labourers. She said the labourers had left Indian shores with just two pairs of clothes and a copy each of the Hanuman Chalisa and the Bhagwad Gita.Kanhai said India's relationship with the former Dutch colony had since undergone a sea change.The focus has shifted from exploitation to reconnecting with the huge Indian diaspora and ""strengthening the bond"" through various programmes.Dutch ambassador Alphonsus Stoelinga recalled that slavery being abolished in 1816 was the trigger for the influx of indentured labourers to the colonies.""This created a huge demand for cheap labour in the plantations. In 1871, the Dutch bought recruitment from British India,"" he said.On Lalla Rookh, Stoelinga said the name of the ship came from the eponymous poem by Thomas Moore that speaks of the love of the tulip-cheeked princess of Aurangzeb."

The Global Burden of Disease study was initiated 26 years ago to chart the changing patterns of disease-related death and disability from 1990 onwards.Health status of populations across the world changes over time in response to socio-economic, demographic, nutritional, scientific, technological, environmental and cultural shifts. Such health transitions have been especially profound in the past half-century due to sweeping industrialisation, rapid urbanisation and relentless globalisation in most parts of the world. It is necessary to understand, and even predict, the patterns and dynamics of health transition so that multi-sectoral actions can be taken to protect and promote the health of populations.The Global Burden of Disease study was initiated 26 years ago to chart the changing patterns of disease-related death and disability from 1990 onwards. Since then, estimates are periodically provided for years of life lost to premature mortality as well as for years of disease-related disability that is weighted for severity. A combined measure of these two metrics is expressed as the loss of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) attributable to any disease or risk factor. In recent years, national and sub-national estimates are emerging to provide greater focus to action within countries.The first-of-its-kind Indian effort to map state-level disease burdens was undertaken by over 1,000 experts led by Lalit Dandona of the Public Health Foundation of India, in partnership with the Indian Council of Medical Research and the team that leads the global study. The results, reported last week, highlight significant trends common to all states as well as important differences between them.Life expectancy at birth improved in India from 59.7 years in 1990 to 70.3 years in 2016 for females, and from 58.3 years to 66.9 years for males. However, life expectancy of women in Uttar Pradesh is 12 years lower than that of women in Kerala, while the life expectancy of men in Assam is 10 years lower than that of men in Kerala. The per person disease burden, from all causes, dropped by 36 per cent in the same period. However, there was an almost two-fold difference between the states in 2016, with Assam, Uttar Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh having the highest rates, and Kerala and Goa the lowest rates.The under-five mortality rate has reduced substantially in all states in these 25 years. But there was a four-fold difference in this rate between the highest, in Assam and Uttar Pradesh, as compared with the lowest in Kerala in 2016. Despite a decline from 1990 levels, child and maternal malnutrition remains the single largest risk factor, contributing to 15 per cent of the disease burden in 2016. With its under-five mortality six times higher than Sri Lanka and burden of child and maternal malnutrition 12 times higher than in China, India has wide gaps to bridge.Communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases contributed to 61 per cent of Indias disease burden in 1990. This dropped to 33 per cent in 2016. But the share of non-communicable diseases in the disease burden increased from 30 per cent in 1990 to 55 per cent in 2016, and that of injuries increased from 9 per cent to 12 per cent. While all states show this trend, Kerala, Goa, and Tamil Nadu have the largest dominance of non-communicable diseases and injuries over infectious and associated diseases, whereas this ratio is much lower in Bihar, Jharkhand, Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. Five of the 10 individual leading causes of the disease burden in India in 2016 are a carry-over of past threats: Diarrhoeal diseases, lower respiratory infections, iron-deficiency anaemia, neonatal pre-term birth, and tuberculosis. Though the disease burden due to poor water and sanitation decreased in these 25 years, the per capita burden due to these factors is 40 times that in China.In 2016, three of the five leading individual causes of disease burden in India were non-communicable, with ischaemic heart disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease being the top two causes and stroke the fifth leading cause.A group of risks including unhealthy diet, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high cholesterol, and overweight, which mainly contribute to ischaemic heart disease, stroke and diabetes, caused about 25 per cent of the total disease burden in India in 2016, up from about 10 per cent in 1990. Ambient air pollution and household air pollution both rank high as risk factors in 2016, the former rising and the latter declining in the past 25 years.There were large variations between states in the degree to which these risks are rising. States in early stages of the health transition were coping with both the persisting challenge of infectious, nutritional and pregnancy-related health threats and the rising magnitude of non-communicable diseases. States in the advanced stage of the transition were grappling largely with non-communicable disorders.These data, of time trends and inter- state variations, highlight the need to develop specific strategies to address the major contributors to disease burden within each state. Disaggregated data, as provided in the recent report, will help to tailor customised state-level responses while summated time trends will help the National Health Policy to set and track the progress towards country-level targets. Since the present report provides modelled estimates derived from multiple and often limited data sets, it is imperative to strengthen vital registration mechanisms and disease and risk factor surveillance systems in every state.The broad national agenda should be elimination of malnutrition, reduction of child and maternal mortality, control of infectious diseases and containment of risk factors contributing to non-communicable diseases. This report provides each state the GPS to chart their individual journeys towards those goals, from different starting points.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Ramasamy, former Secretary of the Science and Technology.The committee recommended merger of 103 agricultural research centres to 60 across the nation. It had suggested one research centre for one crop instead of having multiple centres. Besides SBI, two other institutions to be closed or merged are National Research Centre for Banana in Tiruchirappalli and Central Institute of Brackishwater Aquaculture in Chennai.Researchers felt that it was a strong lobby of the BJP in Uttar Pradesh to gain control over the south-based institute. If both, the SBI and IISR, are merged the former should be headquarters, they say.We are not opposing the merger of the institute which has glorious record in sugarcane research in the world, but it should be made as headquarters instead of bringing it under the control of IISR to retain its name and fame of its seed brands beginning with ``Co'', said retired director of SBI P. Rakkiyappan.MemorandumThe Agricultural Research Service Scientists Forum (ARSSF) in its memorandum to ICAR has opposed the merger proposal.The ARSSF members feared that a decision in this regard may be taken at a meeting of the governing body of ICAR held on Wednesday. However, this was not part of the agenda.On its part, the ARSSF has initiated the process to safeguard the interest of Tamil Nadu and its members plan to meet the Chief Minister and also the BJP leaders in Chennai soon.

One of the private mill owners is Punjab power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh The decision was conveyed by the private mill owners during their meeting on Tuesday afternoon with a committee of senior state functionaries headed by chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh. Rana also attended the meeting.Punjab Private Sugar Mills Association president and Akali leader Jarnail Singh Wahid told TOI, Every sugar mill had been facing around Rs 40-50 crore loss every year since 2013-14. We have clarified; we are not in a situation to return Rs 115 crore.He said since the government had deposited Rs 50 per quintal subsidy in the farmers account as per the cabinet decision taken in November 2015, the authorities could recover the amount from them. When the cabinet decision was taken, we had already clarified that we can give Rs 245 per quintal cane price on the Uttar Pradesh pattern, said Wahid, who is the former chairman of Markfedapex cooperative body of the state.Wahid said the mill owners have conveyed to the committee that they were ready to shut down their factories because of losses and the government should ask farmers to adopt some other crop as a diversification measure. Recently, the state government increased the state assured price (SAP) of sugarcane by Rs 10 without consulting us, he said.For the 2015-16 crushing season, the SAD-BJP government had fixed crushing rate at Rs 295 per quintal to be paid to the farmers. The sugar mills were to pay Rs 245 per quintal and Rs 50 per quintal was to be paid as subsidy by the government. But the authorities say the decision to pay subsidy was taken only if the market sugar price remained Rs 2,600 per quintal or less. In case sugar prices reached Rs 3,000 per quintal or more, the mill owners were to pay the total Rs 295 per quintal to the farmers.A senior officer of the committee said, After the cabinet decision, sugar prices crossed Rs 3,000 per quintal and mill owners should pay Rs 115 crore back to the state. But when the mill owners put their foot down on their decision on the pretext of losses incurred over the years, the committee directed them to submit their contentions in writing.These seven private sugar mills crush around 70% of sugarcane produced in the state. Rana Sugar Mills, owned by power and irrigation minister Rana Gurjit Singh, is located in Amritsar district, Wahid Sandhar Sugars Limited in Phagwara owned by SAD leader and former Markfed chairman Jarnail Singh Wahid, Nahar Industrial Enterprises Limited in Amloh owned by former industrial adviser to SAD-BJP government Kamal Oswal, Chadha Sugars and Industries Limited in Gurdaspur owned by late liquor baron Ponty Chadhas family members, AB Sugars Limited in Dasuya is also owned by Chadhas family members, Bhagwanpura Sugar Mills in Dhuri and Indian Sucrose Limited in Hoshiarpur are owned by jailed Uttar Pradesh politician D P Yadav."

But over the years Uttar Pradesh has also made inroads in Kolkata, said senior NCP leader Ajit PawarThe export of 15 lakh metric tonnes of sugar by Pakistan along with adequate subsidies has left the top leadership of Congress and NCP worried about the fate of Maharashtras sugar market. Leaders of the two Opposition parties met Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis Friday and urged the government to take some policy decisions to provide stability to the sugar sector.They demanded an increase in the import duty and scrapping of export duty. They also said the government should make payment of fair and remunerative price mandatory as an ad hoc system was not practical, especially at a time when sugarcane crop was surplus and prices had steeply declined. Fadnavis has assured the Congress and the NCP of taking up the matter with the Centre, and initiate whatever measures necessary. If Pakistan sugar comes to India, it will badly affect the domestic market. Kolkata was the biggest sugar market. But over the years Uttar Pradesh has also made inroads in Kolkata, said senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar.The top leaders concern over the sugar sector, however, has not gone down well with the elected members of the two parties representing Vidarbha. The perseverance displayed by top leaders to make the sugar sector a common cause is good. But they never display the same unity or commitment when it comes to fighting for the rights of Vidarbha issues, said a senior Congress leader who did not wish to be named. Another Congress leader said, The Winter Session (of the state legislature) in Vidarbha is held once a year. And it lasts for just two weeks. Yet, if we look at the Oppositions overall concern, very few Vidarbha issues are highlighted and taken to a logical end. As a result, the BJP walks away with advantage in successive elections in Vidarbha.Meanwhile, the alarm raised by sugar mill owners cutting across party lines over Pakistan sugar has been dismissed by a section in the BJP and the Shiv Sena. A Sena minister said, It is not as if Pakistan sugar is coming to India for the first time. Moreover, sugarcane crop brings assured profit. And successive governments at the Centre have always given Sharad Pawar an audience every time he meets the Prime Minister to discuss problems related to the sugar sector. However, NCP leader Dilip Walse-Patil argued, When we raise issues related to sugar industry, it is for the larger welfare of the state and its farmers. It is the only cash crop that helps earn highest revenue to the government.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Interestingly, Ramala falls in Chhaprauli, the lone assembly constituency in Baghpat that was won by RLD's Sahender Singh Ramala Since Jats are deeply associated with cane farming in West UP, Yogi government has been focusing on sugar mills ever since it came to power. BJP appointed controversial leader, Suresh Rana, who is known as a Hindu hardliner from west UP, as sugarcane development minister and the ministry has since been in an active mode to keep cane farmers in good humour.In West UP, the CM has also made concerted effort to ensure that private mills, which impact masses in Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bulandshahar, Saharanpur, Sambhal and Amroha, begin crushing this time. Some of these mills had closed six to nine years ago.Similarly, the CM has sanctioned Rs 325 crore to increase the capacity of Snehroad Najibabad Sugar Mills which would affect masses in Bijnore and Najibabad Lok Sabha constituencies and Rs 78 crore for Moinuddinpur Sugar Mills, which would impact voters in Meerut and Ghaziabad Lok Sabha constituencies.Baghpat MP and Union minister of state for human resources Satya Pal Singh, a Jat, would play host to CM Yogi on December 23. Singh told TOI that Ramala Sugar Mills' capacity would increase two-fold after expansion.Yogi's efforts are being seen as a bid to stake claim to the legacy of Charan Singh and keeping his son Ajit Singh and his party Rashtriya Lok Dal at bay."

Vishal SrivastavLeader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary on Wednesday accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of provoking and instigating opposition parties and asked him to be mridubhashi (soft-spoken). Chaudhary targeted Adityanath over his statement in the Assembly on Tuesday, when he had indirectly mentioned Congress president Rahul Gandhi speaking about aloo ki factory. Adityanath had said that there is a leader, who does not even know that potatoes are grown on fields, not in factories.While Adityanath had also said that many in the Opposition do not even know the difference between aloo and lauki or mango and sugarcane, Chauduary said, Aap to vipaksha ko khud uksate hain bharkate hain mridubhashi ho jaiye (You provoke and instigate the Oppositionbe a sweet-talker).Chaudhary said that he had raised the issue (of potato farmers) even during the previous Samajwadi Party regime. Lag sakhta hai aloo ka karkhana, said Chaudhary, while pointing out that potato farmers are facing acute crises due to extremely low rates of their crop in the market. He said that the anger of farmers is increasing. Replying to Chaudhary, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government had taken steps to help potato farmers soon after it had come to power. He added that apart from allowing and promoting export of the crop, farmers were also given exemption from mandi fee and the government had even purchased the crop. He said that the state government has decided to include potato in the midday meal menu of state schools.Congress Legislative Party leader Ajai Kumar Lallu, meanwhile, raised objection to the comment made on the statement of Rahul Gandhi but Treasury benches as well as the Speaker pointed out that no specific name was taken at the Assembly. As the Opposition went on to raise the issue of potato farmers, Adityanath said that his government has worked to give protection to all farmers without any bias. He said that while his government has announced support price for potato farmers for the first time, a three-member committee was also formed to solve their issues, apart from giving them other benefits. The chief minister said that for the first time, potato farmers were given permission to export their produce and orders have been issued to include potato in midday meals as well.Adityanath said that his government kisano ke hiton ko puri tarha se sanrakshan karegi (The government will protect the interest of the farmers in every possible way).At this point, Samajwadi Party MLAs staged a walkout, calling the government kisan virodhi (anti-farmers).Later in the day, Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded discussion on the deaths of children across the state especially in Gorakhpur and staged a walk out over the issue. He said outside the Assembly that he demanded a discussion on the issue of childrens death in Gorakhpur and other districts, but was denied it. The Congress leader said that he would again raise the issue on Thursday.Chaudhary as well senior BSP leader Sukhdev Rajbhar also raised the issue of incorrect information being given by officers in reply to questions asked in the Assembly and requested action in the matter. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna promised to order an inquiry into the matter and take appropriate action against the guilty officers.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Repealing Bill, 2017 was placed in the Assembly on Wednesday.

Two have been referred to Gorakhpur in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh for treatment, and one has been sent to Siwan Sadar Hospital.The deaths sparked violent protests at the Gopalganj district headquarters, around 147 km northwest of Patna, with residents attacking the home of Mohammad Ali, owner of the Sasamusa sugar mill. The town remained tense.""The rescue operation is still on,"" said Gopalganj superintendent of police Mritunjay Kumar Choudhary, who confirmed six deaths. ""State disaster response force personnel have been pressed into service to retrieve the bodies.""Chief minister Nitish Kumar announced Rs 4 lakh ex-gratia payment to the kin of each deceased and sent principal secretaries of the industries and labour resources departments - S.

The Noida authority, Gautam Budh Nagar district administration and the Uttar Pradesh governments top officials are busy in preparations for the prime ministers visit.I have come here to conduct an inspection of preparations in the run-up to prime ministers scheduled visit. It is an achievement for the Uttar Pradesh that the prime minister will inaugurate the Metro Link from Noida. The prime minister has a special attachment to the state and his visit is very important, as it will further help in better development of the state, Adityanath said.He said that he has started an audit of builders and the authorities to punish those involved in corrupt practices.He reached Noidas Botanic Garden in a helicopter around 5pm from Bhagpat district after opening a Sugar Mills there. He travelled to the Amity University campus in Sector 125 by car and conducted an inspection of the tent, where around 10,000 chairs have been put up to accommodate the public.After making rounds of the venue, Adityanath met homebuyers, builders and officials with an aim to ensure the prime ministers visit is peaceful, without any protest by homebuyers, who are angry as they failed to get their flats on time due to the builders failure.The chief minister said that right after coming into power in the state, his government has started work to solve problems faced by people from all sections of the society.Our government is working on issues to resolve problems faced by homebuyers, builders and farmers.

Still High,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/dry-still-highkallu-or-toddy-tadimahuakinnauri-195757?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-24,"Sonia SarkarBREWCREW: A Muria Gond tribal woman of central India prepares liquor from mahua (AFP)For tipplers in India, these are no happy hours. Prohibition seems to be the order of the day. First, the ban on sale of liquor by the Bihar government, and then, the Supreme Court diktat that says no vends or restaurants can sell alcohol within 500 metres of the highways. So the beer or rum or single malt might be near-endangered stuff, but desi liquor - the sour toddy, the pungent mahua, the fizzy kinnauri ghanti - is relatively free-flowing. In Haryana, there is no ban on tharra; toddy or tadi is still legally sold in Bihar; purchase and sale of cannabis is not permitted, but its derivative, bhang, can be bought and sold across India.And while politicians like to open and close the liquor tap depending on the political climate, their godly predecessors recognised its power, used it and prized it too. The Rigveda mentions soma, a juice derived from fermented milkweed, which was consumed by Hindu gods. And after the Prohibition in Bihar, the shrines of Masan Baba, Goraiya Baba and Bhairav - revered among the Dalit community and accepting only liquor as their first bhog - have virtually gone dry.References to alcoholic beverages are to be found in the Ramayan and the Mahabharat, too. In the paper titled ""Drinking habits in ancient India"", Ottilingam Somasundaram, D. Vijaya Raghavan and A.G. Tejus Murthy cite their popularity. How Baladev, Krishna and Arjun ""indulged in drink in the company of their wives, daughters and sisters""; how while crossing the Yamuna, Sita offered ""a 1,000 jars of arrack - alcoholic spirit made of coconut palm - and cooked flesh-meat"" for the goddesses.In keeping with what seems to be an ingrained love for the tipple, The Telegraph brings you an exhaustive list of indigenous intoxicating beverages from different parts of the country.Kallu or Toddy/ TadiIn her book Kerala: The Divine Destination, Lalitha Balasubramanian talks about Shiv's favoured cloudy palm wine, toddy. Made from the fresh sap of palm - date or coconut - toddy or kallu is popular in Kerala, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.In Bihar, toddy becomes tadi, but its popularity remains undiminished. In 2016, the Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, lifted the ban on the sale and consumption of tadi in the state under pressure from his then ally, Lalu Prasad. When Lalu was the CM in the 1990s, he had declared it tax-free to help the Mahadalit Pasi community that is largely engaged as tadi tappers.MahuaWomen named Mahua - a common name in eastern India - have more often than not been teased by friends for being named after a heady drink derived from the mahua flower. Distilled in earthenware pots, the fiery mahua is popular in rural Bengal, Bihar and Jharkhand. The Bhils of Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat (a dry state, mind you) drink it. In Bastar too, a lot happens over mahua when motiyaris (girls) and cheliks (boys) of the Gond tribe come together in ghotuls or mixed-sex dormitories.Kinnauri ghantiTransparent like vodka, this all-season drink made of apple or apricot is popular among locals in Kinnaur in Himachal Pradesh. If you prefer fizzy drinks, you will enjoy it.ZawlaidiThis grape wine is a favourite drink in Hnahlan village of the Champhai district in Mizoram, and is considered to be a kind of love potion. High on alcohol content, the drink is supposed to be the best country-made liquor in India. Some brewers are also trying to market it globally.ChuwarakPrepared with rice, jackfruit and pineapple, it is the desi whiskey of Tripura. Local tokhiseleng and thakotor leaves are used to make this distilled alcohol.TharraThe pungent desi tharra, made of fermented sugarcane juice, is most popular in Punjab and Haryana. But a bottle of it, which was earlier available for Rs 20 or 30, is now going for Rs 80 because vends along the highways have closed down after the Supreme Court order. Tharra is literally the poor man's drink in Bihar, Jharkhand and Uttar Pradesh.FeniThe Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.Kesar kasturi and royal chandrahasHave you ever heard of dry fruits and spices being used to make alcohol? Well, it happens in Rajasthan. Made of saffron, herbs, nuts, seeds, sandalwood, clarified butter and natural aphrodisiacs, this drink is served at the winter gatherings of royal families. The royal chandrahas, also a winter drink, contains 76 different spices.AFP PictureBhangNo one needs an introduction to bhang, a paste of cannabis or marijuana buds and leaves. Despite the ban on sale and purchase of cannabis, bhang is widely available. Legend has it that the Hindu god, Shiv, fetched it from his abode in the Himalayas. And then, Bollywood went and turned it into the ""Holi drink"".RaksiUsually made out of finger millet ( ragi), raksi is a strong drink similar to vodka and gin. It's popular at social and religious events in Sikkim and neighbouring Nepal.ChhangThis is a millet beer that is consumed largely by the Memba and Libo tribes of Arunachal Pradesh, and also the Ladakhis. The millet is first boiled and then spread over a clean floor to cool. Later, dry yeast - locally known as oppop - is mixed with it and kept in a container for over 20 days to ferment. When the smell fills the room, you are bound to get drunk.The Ladakhis prepare their chhang in wooden drums called zem. Guests are served chhang with a blob of butter in a brass pot known as chhabskyen.Arak or arrackThis fiery Ladakhi whiskey is made by boiling and then collecting the vapour of chhang. It's a popular drink among Buddhists. People in Karnataka also drink arrack, but there it is made of fermented coconut flowers, sugarcane and rice grain.Rice beerAs part of their elaborate cultural ritual, Adivasis brew their own liquor and drink with the entire village. Rice is a common ingredient of almost every home-brewed liquor. The Pnar tribe of Meghalaya's Jaintia hills drinks kiad, a fizzy rice beer, served in bamboo tumblers. A liberal quantity of this triple-distilled liquor is offered to the local gods in a hollow gourd.In Assam, every other household in the tribal belt produces rice beer. Lao-pani is a common variety, another would be the apong. Often, the very smell of these intoxicates the wandering elephants, who then go on a rampage attacking locals. The Mishing tribe of Assam is fond of the apong and drinks it in plenty during weddings. It is said, the richer the beer the stronger the chemistry between the newly-weds.In neighbouring Nagaland, locals drink dzutse, ruhi and zutho - sour varieties of rice beer. In Manipur, nobody really cares about the state ban on liquor. Andro and sekmai, two varieties of yu - liquor made of fermented rice - are brewed in almost every household in the state capital of Imphal. Made from a local variety of rice called moirang phu, yu is generously offered to voters come poll time.And in the tribal belts of Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Jharkhand, handiya or hadiya is popular. Fermented over a week, it is also used to treat an upset stomach and certain gynaecological ailments. And in Himachal Pradesh, especially in the hilly Manali, locals drink lugdi.AFP PictureChuwanMade of rice, jackfruit and pineapple leaves, tokhiseleng roots and red chilli, chuwan is a local drink of Tripura. Brewed and served in langi, a small earthen pitcher, it is mostly prepared by women.Mrit Sanjeevani SuraIt is also known as mritasanjeevani arishta. This is not for binge drinkers. It is an ayurvedic syrup used to treat loss of appetite and weakness. It contains naturally generated alcohol.The Portuguese brought the cashew plant to Goa from Brazil to check soil erosion. Goans being Goans, made feni out of them. They swear by this sweet and fruity drink that leaves a sharp aftertaste. The Bharatiya Janata Party government in the state announced plans to launch a feni festival to celebrate the medicinal values of the drink.All in all, Prohibition or no, we are blessed in the swadeshi department. Let's make the most of it."

ArchiveWITH CHIEF Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Minister of State for Co-operation Gulabrao Patil deciding to skip the annual general body meeting in Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute, former agriculture minister Sharad Pawar took to the stage to advised the sugar sector to brace up for hard times.The recent directives of the state government of charging millers for harvesting and transport as per the distance have invited a flak from the sugar sector. The millers have also sought an appointment with the chief minister early next week to discuss the harvest and transport (HnT) charges, among other issues.Till last year, sugar mills charged a uniform rate of Rs 650 per tonne of the cane crushed as the HnT cost. As per the new directives, the HnT cost will depend on the actual distance of the field from the mills. Thus, farmers whose fields are closer to the mill will be charged lesser than those whose cane had to travel further distance.Unlike in Uttar Pradesh, millers in Maharashtra make arrangements for harvesting and transportation of cane from the fields of growers in lieu of a fixed charge, which is deducted from the final payment of the farmer.At the event, Pawar said this mechanism was not suitable for cooperative mills. I have raised the problems faced by the sector with both the central and state government. However, I do not know if they will be ready to help. In such a scenario, it is best for the sector to take steps to tide over the crisis. This will hit the availability of cane and needs to reconsidered, he added.Former minster and senior Congress leader Harashvardhan Patil said the decision was taken without taking into account the present legal framework. District collectors, Patil said, have been asked to determine the transportation costs, but barring Aurangabad, no one has submitted the data. We will be meeting the chief minister in the first week of January and are hopeful that the old system will be reinstated, he added.On the absence of the CM and the MoS, Pawar said the chief minister had gone to attend the swearing-in ceremony of the Gujarat government and had expressed his inability to attend the meeting. Perhaps this would be the first year that the biggest event of the sugar industry happened in the absence of top government participation.The major part of Pawars speech was devoted to the greater crisis looming over the sector in view of a bumper crop next year (2018-19). Initial estimates have put the next years cane average in Maharashtra alone at over 9 lakh hectares and over 90 lakh tonnes of sugar is expected to be produced in the state. The former agriculture minister said, in view of the increased cane availability, mills might have to start their crushing operations earlier. Although, he added, it might result in lower sugar recovery. Growers are expected to get compensation in case mills fail to crush their cane in time.He said, The extra cane will seriously pose a problem for the millers but, in absence of government help, mills have to make arrangements themselves to ensure 100 per cent crushing.

The panel had directed the Greater Noida authority to file FIR against errant builders, who are not delivering flats as per the promises they had made to the buyers.But the committee failed to address any of the issues we (homebuyers), have been facing for the last seven years, said Pushpendra Kumar, a buyer.Homebuyers had pinned their hopes on the new government in Uttar Pradesh to solve their issues in 2017. After almost eight months of assuming power, chief minister Yogi Adityanath led state government has been unable to provide relief to thousands of homebuyers in Noida and Greater Noida.Yogi Adityanath, however, said the government has addressed the issues of homebuyers.The committee is seriously looking into the issues of homebuyers and it has been able to solve much of the problems. The committee has ensured delivery of 40,000 flats and another 40,000 flats will be delivered next year, said Suresh Rana, minister and committee member.On September 12, the chief minister directed the Noida and Greater Noida authorities to deliver around 50,000 flats by end of December 2017.We did not get any relief even after flat delivery promises were made by the state government on several occasions. The chief minister on December 25 said that Noida and Greater Noida authorities have ensured delivery of 40,000 flats by December end and another 40,000 flats delivery in 2018. But two authorities are unable to give a break up of these flats, which were claimed to be delivered to buyers, said SK Nagrath, president of Jaypee Aman flat buyers association.Homebuyers said living up to the promises of the government to maintain transparency in public functioning, the authorities should have provided details of delivered 40,000 flats on their respective website.The two authorities and the UP government have given an imaginary figure and their claim is an eyewash to fool us. Why cannot they share exact details of the number of flats delivered to buyers, who were earlier in trouble? We are going to resume our protests from January 2018, said Abhishek Kumar, president of Noida extension flat owners welfare association (NEFOWA).Office-bearers of NEFOWA said none of the aggrieved homebuyers associated with their group got any relief from the problems.Officials of the Noida and the Greater Noida misled the CM on flat delivery issue. In reality, the two authorities and the builders are yet to solve the problems, said Shashank Shekhar, a flat buyer.Out of 40,000 flats, the Noida builders were supposed to deliver 12,500 flats, and Greater Noida builders were supposed to deliver 27,500 flats.As per the details given by the Noida authority, the builders have delivered 6,900 flats while remaining 5,600 are yet to be delivered. In Greater Noida, the builders delivered 12,000 flats out of 27,500 flats and remaining were supposed to be delivered by December end. But these ready flats are not owned by aggrieved buyers. The question is the builders should have delivered pending flats or shared a schedule of delivery, said Satish Kumar, a buyer.Homebuyers said the state government and officials in two authorities are ignoring the questions of buyers pertaining to pending flats.We have tried to ensure the builders deliver flats as per the orders of the Chief Minister. Now we have scheduled another meeting on January 15, 2018 with builders to ask them to deliver pending flats at the earliest, said Debasish Panda, chief executive officer of the Greater Noida authority.The Noida authority officials said they are helping the builders to deliver flats.We have tried to help the builders so that they easily deliver the flats and the homebuyers get relief by getting possession of their flats. We have expedited the process of issuance of occupancy certificate and also simplified the process for the same, said Alok Tandon, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.There are around 300 stuck housing projects in Noida and Greater Noida. Around 2 lakh homebuyers are unable to get flats as per the schedule promised by the builders, said officials. The Noida authority needs to recover around 11,000 crore land dues from the 94 builders, who got land on instalments after paying 10% of the total land cost. And the Greater Noida authority needs to recover around 7,200 crore from 203 builders.The confederation of real estate developers association of India (CREDAI), a realtors body, said the pending flats can be delivered if the UP government agrees to their demands.The real issue with the builders is of the funds due to the dip in sales of flats. If the UP government will agree to our demands, 80% of the pending flats can be delivered.

Uttar Pradesh has surpassed Maharashtra as the top sugar producing state in the country.Sugar millers from Maharashtra, already bogged down by falling demand and price, now have to reckon with sugar from Uttar Pradesh. Thanks to the logistical advantage, sugar from the northern state is fast posing a challenge even in the traditional markets which were monopolised by Maharashtras sugar sectorSince the adoption of the wonder variety Co 0238, Uttar Pradesh has surpassed Maharashtra as the top sugar producing state in the country. Two consecutive droughts had also hurt Maharashtras sugar production, which has further cemented Uttar Pradeshs claim.This year, while Maharashtra is projected to produce 73 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar, UP is all set to touch the 100 lt production figure.This variety, developed by Dr Bakshi Ram, director of the Indian Council of Agriculture Researchs Sugarcane Breeding Institute in Comibatore, has helped both millers and farmers in Uttar Pradesh. The higher sucrose content in this variety has helped millers recover more sugar per tonne of cane crushed and for farmers, this variety has resulted in higher yield per acre.Millers from Maharashtra say that UP millers, thanks to increased sugar production, have now started making inroads into markets which were traditionally cornered by them like Delhi, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. To add to Maharashtra millers woes, UP millers enjoy logistical advantage  they are geographically nearer to these markets and thus charge less on transport costs. UPs domestic consumption is around 37-38 lt and as compared to its previous production records of 50-60 lt, this year it is all set to produce 100 lt of sugar. The excess sugar obviously challenges the markets which were traditionally captured by us, said a miller from Kolhapur.On Friday, cooperative and private millers from Maharashtra held a meeting to discuss the various issues plaguing the sector. BB Thombare, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA)  the apex body of private millers in Maharashtra  said they have decided to meet the chief minister early in January to discuss the issues. In view of the falling prices, payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to the growers is becoming a major issue for us. Unless there are some policy level tweaks, the mills will soon not be in a position to pay the growers, he said.To arrest the falling prices, millers in Maharashtra want the creation of a buffer stock of 50 lt along with 100 per cent ban on imports. The millers also want the 20 per cent export duty on sugar to be waived off along with the Re 1.2 per unit cost levied on captive consumption of electricity generated by millers themselves.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
