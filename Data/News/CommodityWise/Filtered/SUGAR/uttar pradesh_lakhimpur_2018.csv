Photo: Pradeep Gaur/Mint$500 millionWhat is it? The size of the deal that India had placed with Israels state-owned defence contractor Rafael to buy Spike anti-tank guided missiles. It has now cancelled the order.Why is it important? This is reportedly due to reservations on the part of the Israeli firm to fully transfer the technology as per the Make in India provisions and the Indian defence ministry reportedly deciding to back state-owned Defence Research and Development Organisation, which has said it will develop a world-class missile within four years. Till then, Pakistani foot soldiers are likely to have an advantage over Indias as they possess portable anti-tank missiles that can strike Indian bunkers and tanks at a distance of 3-4 km, while Indias equivalent missile tanks have a range of 2 km.Tell me more: The order cancellation could be taken up for discussion during Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahus visit to India in a couple of weeks.100What is it? The number of people who were detained across Mumbai on Wednesday due to a bandh called by Dalit groups in Maharashtra.Why is it important? Normal life was disrupted in Indias financial capital: schools and colleges remained shut, Internet services were down, and attendance was poor in offices. With protestors squatting on railway tracks, rail services were stalled, roads were blocked and shops shut. Although Dalit leader Prakash Ambedkar called off the bandh on Wednesday evening, tension simmered in the state. A 16-year-old student was killed in a road-block agitation in Nanded.Tell me more: The protests began on Monday after a 28-year-old man was killed when the Dalit community was celebrating the 200th anniversary of a battle won by a backward community called Mahars (who fought alongside the Britishers) to overthrow upper caste Peshwas.$0.9 billionWhat is it? The expected consolidated free cash flow of Reliance Industries Ltd (RIL) in 2017-18, according to international brokerage firm CLSA.Why is it important? If RIL meets the forecast, it would mean the end of a four-year run of negative cash flows, which is a measure of a companys overall financial health and performance. This is likely to put Indias biggest firm by market capitalisation on a strong footing as projects worth $40 billion would begin to deliver as capital expenditure declines. Recently, RIL chairman Mukesh Ambani said the firm aims to be among the top 20 companies in the world.Tell me more: The brokerage said the monetisation of refinery off-gas cracker and petcoke gasification plant would boost the operating income of RIL. In telecom, it expects the firm to monetise Reliance Jio Infocomms customers in addition to its industry-leading capacities.2,700What is it? The number of locomotives in India that will be installed with a GPS tracking device under the first phase of the Real-Time Train Information System (RTIS), a move that will enable passengers to track trains on a real-time basis.Why is it important? This Indian Railways initiative, in collaboration with Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro), comes in the backdrop of piling complaints of train delays and accidents. The new GPS-enabled trains would replace the existing national train enquiry system (NTES), which has a train controller who updates the train status manually.Tell me more: So far, trials on GPS-enabled locomotives have been done on six electric locomotives on the New Delhi-Guwahati and New Delhi-Mumbai Rajdhani routes. The first phase is scheduled to be completed by December 2018.26%What is it? The year-on-year growth in Indias sugar production during the three-month period from October to December, according to industry association Indian Sugar Manufacturers Association (ISMA).Why is it important? In these three months of 2017, production stood at 103.3 lakh tonnes, against 81.9 lakh tonnes in the corresponding period of 2016, mainly due to improved outputs from Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. This augurs well for the 2017-18 sugar year (October to September), which could register its highest production since 2014-15, when India produced 283 lakh tonnes. ISMA has estimated 2017-18 production at 251 lakh tonnes.Tell me more: Earlier, the government had been considering removing stock limits on sugar to curb the fall in prices resulting from a bumper harvest.howindialives.com is a search engine for public data"

Similarly, a new sugar mill of 5000 TCD capacity and a co generation power plant of 18 MW capacity will be set up on the land of Bastis Munderwa sugar mill (UP State Sugar Corporation) that has been lying closed for years. The state government hopes each sugar mill will benefit 30,000 farmers and create 8500 direct and indirect additional jobs. The state government will bear the addition cost of Rs 401 crore and Rs 314 crore respectively on the two new projects and this would be considered as loan to the corporation.The cabinet also decided to bear the additional cost of Rs 546 crore on providing nutritious food to malnourished children, pregnant women and children in six month to 72 month age group under Integrated Child Development Scheme. The state government will incur additional cost following the Centres decision to revise the rate for providing nutritious food.

P. Nadda.Centre supportMr. Nadda said that the Centre is providing support to the tune of Rs. 482 crore to the States and as many as 45 labs are to be strengthened for greater food safety.We must safeguard public health by ensuring all food businesses are licensed and follow standards. At the same time, we should be careful that it does not put unnecessary regulatory burden on businesses, noted the Minister.The focus should shift from disease-centric treatment to preventive and promotive healthcare, Mr. Nadda added.The Minister also released the FSSAIs Healthy India Food Calendar. The first-of-its-kind calendar covers Indias main festivals, the food associated with them and their nutritional benefits.

That exhilarating thrill of guitars, eddying dust and smuggled rum: sweet, heady and watered-down, slugged slyly from beat-up plastic water bottles.The taste of summers at the beach: lukewarm rum and Coke gritty with sand and a slick of displaced sunblock. Later, its the taste of your first foray into the bar scene, where you drink it army style to impress dates, with a pinch of salt and a lemon wedge. Or order a slew of marginally more elegant Cuba Libres, clinking with ice and spiked with lemon juice (which you inevitably regret the next morning, holding your head and groaning gently over paracetamol, tea and toast.)India has had a long and tumultuous affair with Old Monk rum. Its cheap. Its accessible. And its somehow always managed to be cool. Despite the clunky packaging and egalitarian price tag. Or perhaps because of it.When founder Brigadier Kapil Mohan (retired), Chairman and MD of Mohan Meakin and the creator of this iconic desi dark rum, recently passed away at the age of 88, social media saluted him with a rush of memories and memes. You know all the details by now, thanks to a flurry of press. How he was a teetotaller, and yet created the most popular rum in the country in 1954. And how Old Monk, brewed in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh, went on to develop a loyal fan following with virtually no advertising or marketing.A dip in sales, which set off alarm bells in 2015, triggered rumours that Old Monk would stop production, leading to an army of loyalists buying up and hoarding bottles in an emotional frenzy. Of the many posts and memes that emerged, one stands out: a picture showing a bottle of Dettol and a bottle of Old Monk side by side. Both are similar in shape and size, except for the labels, and the text underneath: Dettol, for external wounds. Old Monk, for internal wounds.This is commonly acknowledged to be the drink of the 70s, 80s and 90s. But millennials still dive in, from Chennai to Copenhagen. Even now, when its tougher to source in trendy restaurants and lounge bars, youll find it in homes and hip flasks. The drink, with its sweet, rich and pungent notes of vanilla, toffee and spiced pudding, has loyalists all over the world.Sample The Rum Howler Blog, which promises spirited reviews, where reviewer Chip Dykstra waxes eloquent about its opening notes of dark brown sugar accented by maple syrup and rich baking spices. He poetically continues to explain how they evolve into a scent of licorice stained molasses. Hints of soy sauce and exotic spice wander into the air with sugar-covered walnuts and pecans sitting underneath.On the whisky exchange, where it is labelled one of the largest selling rums in the world, almost all thanks to word of mouth, Jeffo304 says straight ice cold, best rum Ive ever drank. While another user says he tried this rum for the first time in Lagos, Nigeria, Excellent!Old Monk seems to bring out the poet in everyone: Mr Surgeon says, This is not just a rum. Once you take a sip, its like an orchestra that plays for you. Heavens come to protect you. Angels flirt with you...Indian fan clubs are no less spirited. On Facebook, look for COMRADE (Council of Old Monk Rum Addicted Drinkers and Eccentrics), a group of more than 2,000 fans of the rum. Theres the Old Monk Appreciation Society, with more than 3,000 members. And an Old Monk community followed by 18,000 people.Gareth, who runs this community, says he began it in 2015 as a page, called Saving Old Monk. He created a series of posts under the title in a world without Old Monk (...Men would not know the price of lemons.) The cover photo of the page read, Save the rum by having some, and it got nearly 4,000 likes in 24 hours. It garnered a following of 10,000 people in the first three weeks of its existence. Gareth says this is despite doing no marketing. I refused to advertise the page by putting money in, to keep in line with the way Old Monk does their marketing  organic and by word of mouth, only.He adds, I believe Old Monk tugs at the very fabric of a classic Indian gentleman, without squeezing his pockets dry. Its great to taste and suits most palates. It doesnt hail from a massive corporation, it doesnt try too hard by advertising, and above all, its almost too inexpensive to be true.Boozy benefitsDuring the 18th Century, it was common for sailors to receive rum as part of their benefits package. Not too bad eh? So the next time you want your benefits at work increased, you could possibly drop a few not-so-subtle hints to your boss or HR head."

Photo: BloombergMumbai: Indian sugar processors have undermined their own margins in order to meet government mandates on when to pay cane farmers, which required them to sell supply onto the market at the same time they agreed to pay more for sugar cane.India, the worlds second-biggest sugar producer, requires the processors to pay cane farmers within two weeks of harvest. The mills agreed in May to pay the farmers 11% more for their cane for the 2017/18 marketing year, which started on 1 October.Many mills struggled to raise funds from local banks to make the payments, said a senior official at the Sahyadri co-operative sugar factory based in Maharashtra.This has caused some mills to have fallen behind on the payments by an estimated 20 billion rupees ($312 million), said a government official who declined to be named.To meet the funding shortfall, mills boosted sugar sales which has caused the refined sugar market to drop by 13.1% to 3,189.50 rupees ($49.77) per 100 kg.The liquidity crunch forced a few mills to make distress sales. Sensing mills problems, traders also tried to bring down prices, said B.B. Thombre, president of the Western India Sugar Mills Association (WISMA).The rapid decline in sugar prices means margins in the current year are likely to be lower than the previous year, said Narendra Murkumbi, managing director of Shree Renuka Sugars , the countrys biggest refiner.The mills agreed to pay the higher cane prices expecting stable refined sugar prices, but have been caught out by the slump.The fall could slash profits for companies like Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd, Shree Renuka, Dwarikesh Sugar Industries and Simbhaoli Sugars by at least 15% from a year ago, said a Mumbai-based sector analyst with a brokerage.Mills raw material cost has gone up, but prices of the finished product, sugar, are falling, said the analyst, who was not authorised to speak to media.Simbhaoli Sugars said it is difficult to comment on margins now, while Dwarikesh and Balrampur declined to comment, citing regulations that limit communications before quarterly results, due in the next few weeks.Sugar prices may remain under pressure as the countrys sugar output in the next season could rise above the record 28.3 million tonnes produced in 2014/15, said Ashok Jain, president of the Bombay Sugar Merchants Association.It is now difficult to pay the assured price to farmers unless government intervenes to support prices, said WISMAs Thombre.The central government fixes the price that mills must pay growers annually, but some cane growing areas, especially the state of Uttar Pradesh, raise the price further to satisfy the demands of cane growers, a key voting bloc.

Photo: MintNew Delhi: Sugar production in India is likely to be 26.1 million tonnes in 2017-18, the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA) said on Thursday, raising its production forecast for the year by 4%. In early January ISMA had estimated production at 25.1 million tonnes.The latest estimate implies a 29% increase in sugar output year-on-year, from 20.3 million tonnes in 2016-17. Surplus production could lead to a decline in wholesale prices and pending payments to cane farmers.As of 15 December, Rs7,500 crores was due to cane farmers across India, according to ISMA. The current dues are lower than the dues of over Rs21,000 crore seen in 2015 following years of surplus production.Higher production in the 2017-18 sugar season (October to September) is due to better rains in growing areas and new varieties cultivated in Uttar Pradesh. Indias annual consumption of the sweetener is estimated at 25 million tonnes, leaving room for exports.Several sugar mills were unable to pay cane price to the farmers because of the recent fall in sugar prices which have started falling below the cost of production, ISMA said in a statement. It added that there was concern about sugarcane farmers getting affected due to their cane price arrears accumulating.Increasing dues to cane growers will worsen farm distress in states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka where falling prices of crops like pulses and oilseeds have led to a dip in farm incomes.To deal with the problem ISMA said it met the government twice this week. According to the association the government could initiate steps like mandating sugar exports for every mill. According to its statement, ISMA also requested the government to raise import duties to 100% (from the current 50%) to stop imports from Pakistan.ISMA said it is exploring possibilities of preferential import duties for Indian sugar for exports to neighbouring Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. If this happens early, it will ensure that all the extra stocks from India can get disposed of very fast, ISMA said."

He said the existing laws were also in conflict with Food Safety and Standard Act 2006.Singh said the existing provisions that provide for civic bodies to construct, operate and regulate slaughter houses would be changed. Singh said amendments to the two acts will take away from the civic bodies the role to construct and operate slaughter houses. He said amended law will make the civic bodies as regulator for the slaughter houses. He said slaughtering of animals outside slaughterhouses would be banned and a separate policy would be brought to set up the new slaughterhouses.The cabinet also approved amendment to section 24 (a) of United Provinces Excise Act 1910 to allow consumption of liquor in model shops. The governments rules provided for consumption for liquor in model shops but a Public Interest Litigation had challenged this provision and the Allahabad High Court had found sale of liquor for consumption in model shops against provisions of section 24 (a) of United Provinces Excise Act 1910. UP has 385 model shops and government expects to earn a revenue of Rs 1221.72 crore from them.An umbrella support agreement to be signed with National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) for transfer of state highways to the NHAI was also approved.The cabinet approved a proposal to set up permanent Lok Adalat in 24 districts in third phase.A proposal to expand crushing capacity of cooperative sector sugar mill of UP Cooperative Sugar Mills Federation Ltd situated at Ramala (Baghpat) from 2750 TCD to 5000 TCD and set up 27 MW co-generation plant there was approved. The cabinet approved a proposal to close down unit No 8 of Obra Thermal Power project that exceeded 36 years against its life of 25 years. The state cabinet decided to cancel the contract to the BHEL for repair and maintenance of the plant."

Mr. Togadia also threatened legal action against the special agency of the Ahmedabad police, which had called his disappearance as staged.The Crime Branch should stay within its limits and not become a tool to target people like me. I want to tell J.K.

These people had fabricated the entire CD to target Sanjay Joshi, Dr. Togadia said. J.K. Bhatt is hatching the conspiracy to target and malign RSS leaders with the instructions from Delhi.Leaking reportDr. Togadia charged the police official for selectively leaking the investigation report regarding his disappearance and also harassing his supporters and workers, who are helping him in dealing with false cases.On Tuesday, the Ahmedabad Crime Branch had held media briefing in which it shared the details of investigation into Dr. Togadias disappearance, calling its staged to evade arrest by the Rajasthan police.I want to ask Gujarat police what it had to do with this entire episode. The case was lodged in Rajasthan and police from there were dealing with it. What promoted the Gujarat police to get involved, he asked, reiterating his claim that he was being targeted for speaking on important issues like Ram Temple.On the Rajasthan case, he said that Rajasthan Home Minister had clarified that the case against him was withdrawn long ago, but the papers were not supplied to the court, which issued a warrant against him.Dr. Togadia defended meeting Congress leader Arjun Modhvadia in hospital where he was admitted for low sugar levels.

Out of this, Rs 12,690.43 crore is the amount due within 14 days of cane delivery. But as per official data, mills have so far paid only Rs 10,582.34 crore, translating into arrears of Rs 2,108.09 crore.Mills in the state started crushing operations this time on October 25. Significantly, till about a month ago, the unpaid dues werent much. In fact, cane arrears on December 1 were minus Rs 141.01 crore, as mills paid more than what was due before 14 days. The arrears rose to Rs 304.09 crore on December 15 and Rs 851.20 crore by December 29, before spiraling to over Rs 2,100 crore.These would only mount further because we have crushed only 485.93 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane and produced 49.73 lt sugar till now. Sugar output will top 100 lt this season and we are still barely halfway, said a Bijnor-based miller.Also Read | A new supply problem: Harvesting labour shortage adds to Maharashtra mill woesHe attributed the rising arrears to ex-factory sugar prices in UP crashing from over Rs 37 per kg at the seasons start to Rs 31.50-31.75 now. They were ruling at Rs 34 even in December-end, but have since plunged below Rs 32, which makes paying the SAP near-impossible, he claimed.But the problem isnt limited to UP. Maharashtra mills have also run up arrears of Rs 1,843.80 crore, based on latest data till January 15: Out of the Rs 8,342.20 crore due to growers at the Centres fair and remunerative price (FRP), they have collectively paid only Rs 6,632.93 crore, with some mills paying more than the FRP. On Wednesday, ex-factory rates of S-30 grade sugar from Maharashtra, at Rs 28.5-29 per kg, were even lower than for UP.A miller from Sangli blamed the situation entirely on traders manipulating the market. The 2017-18 season began with sugar stocks of 40 lt. That, together with projected production of 261 lt, translates into total availability of 301 lt. After deducting domestic consumption of 250 lt, the ending stocks on September 30 would be 51 lt.That is equal to 2.5 months of consumption, which is also the prescribed normative opening stock requirement. Given this fine supply-demand balance, how are prices being driven down like this?, the miller pointed out.However, Praful Vithalani, president of the All India Sugar Trade Association, attributed competition among millers to sell as the main reason for prices sliding. Mills believe that sugar output would go up significantly in 2018-19 and, hence, want to sell more now. And when prices are falling like this, traders obviously want to buy less, he noted.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Right now the rate is Rs. 3,160, almost 20 per cent less than the initial rate. I must mention that the production cost is Rs. 3,450/quintal which means that we are bearing the loss of at least Rs. 290/quintal, Mr. Guptara said.Suresh Rana, Minister for Sugarcane Development, said the government will ensure that the dues get paid as soon as possible."

Sugar prices (ex-mill Uttar Pradesh) declined to Rs 33,000-Rs 33,500 per tonne in January from Rs 36,000-Rs 36,500 in November. They were ruling at Rs 37,000-Rs 37,500 per tonne in September-October last year.Based on the current cane-crushing trends, we estimate domestic sugar production at around 26 million MT (metric tonnes) against an earlier estimate of 25 million MT in December 2017, said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior vice-president & group head, ICRA Ratings.This will translate into an increase in sugar production by 28% in SY (sugar year) 2018 from 20.3 million MT in SY 2017, mainly driven by an expected recovery in production in the key sugar-producing states Maharashtra and Karnataka, supported by relatively better monsoons during 2016 and 2017, he said.Further, sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is also expected to touch an all-time high of around 10.2 million MT in SY 2018, supported by higher acreage and better cane variety, resulting in higher yields and recovery rates, Majumdar added.Upward revision in sugar production estimate along with most mills liquidating the produce to repay cane payments resulted in correction in sugar prices in January, he said.While short-term pressure is likely to remain on sugar prices during this quarter, ICRA anticipates prices to stabilise in the coming quarter, although at somewhat lower levels than those anticipated earlier. Closing stocks are likely to remain comfortable at around 5-5.5 million MT, the agency said."

(Below) Aberdeen Blair was among the 1,500-plus recipients of the MDA programme in Sawai village.special arrangement/getty imagesA narrow road winds past dense vegetation, idyllic beaches and rain-soaked villages glistening in sunshine. Along the way, profusely blooming pinwheelflowers frame prefab homes built on stilts in a likeness of their lost predecessors, the prized patis, which were handwoven with palm leaves, rattan and lalang grass.Goats bleat, pigs grunt and hens squawk around the dwellings that were once closer to the shore but were flattened, like nearly everything else here, on December 26, 2004. Local memory divides Car Nicobars long and sometimes violent history more simply now: before and after the tsunami.Aberdeen Blair (89), chief of the Car Nicobar Tribal Council, remembers more. When I was small, we had no money, sugar or rice. We only had coconuts. My parents did not wear clothes like this, he says, pointing to his lungi and T-shirt. Blair smiles as easily and often as he shifts between Nicobari, Hindi and English, and goes on to add, I have jeans, too. Everything has changed. The laminated certificates and photographs on the wall behind him document the highlights of such a lifetime.Nicobar is Indias southernmost district. Car Nicobar is its northernmost island and headquarters. The Nicobarese are the largest (numbering 27,186 in the 2011 Census), most urbanised, and most influential among the six better-known tribes of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. Their indigenous peers survive tenuously in the hundreds (Jarawas and Shompen) and tens (Great Andamanese, Onge and Sentinelese).Preventable blindnessOther numbers appear in fading paint on the walls of the houses here. MDA, it says, followed by a date, for three consecutive years  2010, 2011 and 2012. Mass Drug Administration is the medical response to a public health concern that entails treating the entire population of a specified area with a prescribed dosage of pharmaceuticals.The first woman ophthalmologist in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Dr. Anita Shah (55), led such a project in Car Nicobar following the discovery of a hyperendemic and active infection of trachoma on the island. Trachoma is a contagious and preventable cause of blindness, rarely seen in India since the 1950s and 1960s. Blair and his 21-member tu-het (extended matrilineal family units of up to 100 people) were among the over 1,500 recipients of the MDA programme in the village of Sawai ( t-ka-sip in Nicobarese), west of the island.When I held eye camps in 2008, I noticed a steady stream of trachomatous trichiasis [sight-threatening conjunctival scarring, for which Blair was later treated] cases in Car Nicobar. My generation of ophthalmologists has hardly ever seen trachoma, let alone treat it. Yet I kept meeting young people in their twenties who had their lashes growing inward and eyelids fused. They lived in great pain, in darkened homes because they couldnt bear sunlight. I am a surgeon, not a community medicine specialist, but I knew a survey had to be taken up immediately, says Dr. Shah, Joint Secretary in the National Programme for Control of Blindness (NPCB) since 2008. She is a diminutive woman in the habit of providing precise instructions to her team, essential given the problems her location poses.The Andaman and Nicobar Islands endure severe inadequacies in intra-island transport, telecom, electricity, potable water and garbage disposal. Healthcare infrastructure is far from perfect. Nevertheless, a measure of confidence is inspired by the bustling sprawl of the G.B. Pant Medical College and Hospital in Port Blair, the referral medical institution for all the islands. This is where Dr. Shah is Deputy Director-Ophthalmology. The airy and clean B.J.R. Hospital in Car Nicobar, which she visits regularly, is one of two such district-level facilities.Dr. Shah had to tenaciously follow up for over two years to mobilise support for the Trachoma Rapid Assessment (TRA) in Nicobar 2010 survey by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Dr. R. P. Centre for Ophthalmic Sciences (RPCOS), New Delhi, and the Directorate of Health Services (DHS), Port Blair, with backing from the NPCB, Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. Islands are easily forgotten, she says matter-of-factly.In a far cornerThe Nicobar archipelago is separated from the Andaman cluster by the Ten Degree Channel, a minor international shipping route named so for its latitude north of the equator. The Indian Ocean tsunami arrived here at 7 a.m., roughly 40 minutes after the earthquake off the coast of Sumatra, and two hours before it reached the subcontinents southeastern coast. Car Nicobar, part of the Nicobar and Andaman Tribal Reserve Area and ringed by 51 km of silvery beaches, is approximately 1,450 km from mainland India.In Car Nicobar, the disused iron bridge in Kimious stands as forlorn evidence of the devastation. As a percentage of the total population, in India, the Nicobar Islands lost the most lives in the tsunami. The villages of Malaka and Kakana had the highest casualties. Mus was cut off by a subsidence of land and the pooling of backwater in several places. Tribespeople from Sawai, Arong and Teatop were pushed into the forests at the centre of the island, where they survived for a week without food or water before evacuation. They were moved out of overcrowded relief camps in Port Blair and elsewhere in the islands and resettled in Car Nicobar nearly two years after the tsunami. Dr. Shahs surgical outreach began after their return.Two teams investigated Dr. Shahs concerns by examining 7,277 inhabitants of 10 clusters selected for the highest risk of developing trachoma. The TRA found a very active trachoma infection rate of 50.8% in children aged 1-9 years, with the proportion of infected children in the surveyed villages ranging from 37.5% to 73%.We were shocked and surprised by the magnitude of the trachoma burden in Car Nicobar, says Dr. Praveen Vashist, Professor and Head, Community Ophthalmology Department, RPCOS, AIIMS, who made four trips to the island over the course of the project. I did not realise that the location was so difficult to reach. An MDA covering an entire tribal population in a remote location was a first for India. It was a different experience for us. Active trachoma infections in children occur without any symptoms. If they are not treated, they lead to irreversible blindness in adulthood. We found that, due to the tsunami, there were no children under the age of six in Kimious village.Trachoma occurs upon repeated infections from the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis. It thrives in congested living conditions among populations that have limited access to water and healthcare. It is transmitted by flies, and aided by poor personal hygiene and fomites (shared objects such as towels, utensils and bedding, which are likely to carry the infection). The 2010 TRA also notes, Co-habitation of Nicobari people with animals like pigs, hens, goats, dogs, cats etc. could be a contributory risk factor.Going the distanceDoctors travelled for the MDA by helicopters with few seats. Services were often called off in uncertain weather. There is no scheduled ferry to Car Nicobar and administrative personnel posted here face frequent shortages in the supply of basic groceries, including vegetables, which come from Port Blair. Dosage had to be measured individually (20 mg per kilo of body weight). Dispersed neighbourhoods were covered simultaneously to prevent the recurrence of infections. It was tedious and tiring work.Dr. Vashist says: The local team led by Dr. Shah was exceptional. Our work was made easier by the friendly Nicobarese people. We only had to explain to the chiefs, and the villagers would follow the instructions. Each of the 15 villages in Car Nicobar, distributed over 127 sq. km, elects a Captain for a five-year term. Blair is the head of their council for his lifetime.The operation to treat trachoma is quick and is performed under local anaesthesia as a day-case procedure. Patients can get back to work very quickly (a point emphasised before surgery, since lost working time is a major concern for them). The risk of wound infection is relatively low because of the good blood supply of the eyelid and therefore surgery can be performed in patients own villages.The medical team set up slide shows on the World Health Organisations (WHO) SAFE (Surgery for trichiasis, Antibiotics for infections, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement) guidelines in schools and community halls, and at venues near churches, such as the rebuilt chapel in Mus, a pilgrimage site that has the grave of Bishop John Richardson, after whom the district hospital in Car Nicobar is named.The late Padma Bhushan awardee was the first Nicobarese to be ordained an Anglican priest. Hes credited with establishing the village councils and authoring a primer on the Car language, into which he also translated the Bible. Blair has Bishop Richardsons laminated photo in his living room.Public health initiatives cannot succeed without the support of local communities, says Dr. Promila Gupta, Deputy Director General, NPCB, adding that blindness comes with considerable economic costs in terms of livelihoods lost.Blind curveWell over half a century ago, from 1959 to 1963, trachoma was a major public health problem in three States  Punjab (79.1% occurrence), Rajasthan (74.2%) and Uttar Pradesh (68.1%)  show data from NPCB. The National Programme for Control of Blindness was launched in 1976. The flagship Central government initiative emanated from what was originally the Trachoma Control Programme of 1963. It no longer lists the disease as among the leading causes of blindness in India, which today are cataract (62.6%) and refractive error (19.70%). The trachoma outbreak in Car Nicobar has been the only recent exception.On the days we had asked everyone in a village to be present, we would sometimes work till 9 in the night, says Yashumeri, 34, a cheerful staff nurse at the B.J.R. Hospital. Team members recall being welcomed with sweet tender coconut water everywhere they went. The Nicobarese call themselves holchu (friend), although the term can be used pejoratively by the islands settlers.Yashumeris familiarity with the area came in handy when refrigerators had to be commandeered to maintain the tricky cold chain for liquid azithromycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic that had to be transported from mainland India to Car Nicobar. A tablet substitute was eventually found for the second round of the MDA programme in 2011.Meticulously maintained registers list absentee and sick residents (for follow-ups), pregnant women (who were not included), and deaths. If someone missed a dosage, we would return to make sure they took it, says John James, 44, the first Nicobarese ophthalmic assistant on the island.I was so nervous when a prevalence survey was conducted in 2013, after the third round of MDA, admits Dr. Shah, who was hugely relieved to find that the active trachoma infection in children was down to 6.8% from the 50.8% that it was in 2010. This was, however, still above the 5% allowed by the WHO. Meanwhile, patients who had got their vision back and were free from pain began asking for eye drops. They took delight in how big their eyes suddenly appeared. ICE (information, communication, education) outreach and eyelid correction surgeries continue even now.Trachoma is hyperendemic in many of the poorest and most rural areas of 41 countries of Africa, Central and South America, Asia, Australia and the Middle East, says the WHO, which has been pushing the GET 2020 (Global Elimination of Trachoma by 2020) alliance since 1996. India is a partner. When Car Nicobar was again assessed in February 2017, trachoma prevalence was down to 1.6%.India moved to apply for trachoma-free status over a meeting with WHO officials on January 11, 2018, after the release of the National Trachoma Prevalence Survey 2014-17 by Union Minister of Health and Family Welfare J. P. Nadda in Delhi on December 8, 2017. The survey covered 10 districts from seven States and Union Territories, among them East Delhi, Bikaner, Banaskantha and Car Nicobar. It shows that the overall prevalence of active infection among children below nine years is only 0.7%. We expect to meet the 2020 target, Dr. Vashist says.Eye on the futureTime moves differently on Car Nicobar. The roar of the ocean is audible as a small group of men and women work silently. They are preparing the soil outside an (also prefabricated) elpanam or death house, next to a modest cemetery with a handful of crosses on cement platforms. The community gets involved in funerary tasks as it does with wedding festivities and shared parenting, the latter a custom known as haruk , which ensures that no child is orphaned. Access to Car Nicobar is highly restricted under the Andaman and Nicobar (Protection of Aboriginal Tribes) Regulation, 1956, and provides some protection to indigenous ways of life.The 2004 tsunami was not the first to devastate the islands: patchy records exist for major earthquakes in 1847, 1881 and 1941, and another tsunami that originated in Sumatra in 1861. But the last one has altered life here.The Central government adopted a one-size-fits-all rehabilitation policy to build nearly 10,000 twin (instead of freestanding) homes across 11 islands. Reinforced cement concrete, aero-con blocks and corrugated galvanised iron sheets imported by large contractors from mainland India at an average cost of Rs. 10 lakh per unit replaced locally sourced, natural building materials. Not enough thought was given to subsistence-specific locations, gender-sensitive land rights, natural ventilation suited to the tropical weather, and the ability to effect repairs with local materials.On the white-sands Malaka beach, named for the strategic strait near Aceh in Indonesia, a lush jungle has already claimed what used to be, before the tsunami, beachfront residential quarters for Indian Air Force officers. The island is no longer a family station for them. Nicobarese leader Edward Kutchat, it is said, granted land for this airbase in exchange for the coat that Jawaharlal Nehru was wearing when they met sometime in the early 1960s.The sun rises as early as quarter past five even on a January morning, and lights up the pristine coastline. The scattered debris of plastic garbage washed up by the waves is not immediately obvious, quite like its environmental implications. Even the twinkle in Aberdeen Blairs eyes will only hint at them. Dr. Shah, who appreciates his gentle way of speaking, never fails to visit the elder on her trips to the island.Blairs Prototype twin unit designed and constructed by Central Public Works Department is one of the 3,941 permanent shelters allotted to Car Nicobar in 2006. Rendered frail by age, Blair is mostly confined indoors these days. He credits the doctors at B.J.R. Hospital with treating a fracture of the tibia and saving his life when he had a stroke, some years after his close call with trachoma and blindness. Oh, I am very lucky, he adds, his hand making a sweeping gesture that included his sofa, TV, Nicobarese Bible, and polite grandson serving tea in ceramic cups. At least I have a place to live, you see?Public health initiatives cannot succeed without the support of local communities.Promila Gupta,Deputy Director General, National Programme for Control of BlindnessWhen I held eye camps in 2008, I noticed a steady stream of trachomatous trichiasis cases in Car Nicobar.

According to a trader in Anakapalli, Kandregula Satyanarayana, a majority of businessmen from West Bengal, Odisha and Bihar place orders from Anakapalli NTR jaggery market. But now, they are giving priority to UP and Maharashtra markets because of low prices when compared to Anakapalli market, he said.The first quality jaggery is priced at Rs 2,400 for 100 kg in Maharashtra and Rs 2m200 in Uttar Pradesh whereas the same kind of jaggery here is Rs 3,100. The difference of price is Rs 600 to Rs 800. Traders of other states which are traditional buyers of Anakapalli market are now placing orders at UP or Maharashtra, one of the businessmen of the jaggery market P Raghu said. He added that the farmers are not sending the jaggery lumps to the market after dip in prices.Not only this, Anakapalli jaggery lumps are in between 15 kg to 17 kg whereas UP, Karnataka and Maharashtra have been manufacturing smaller lumps. When the crop infections or fungal infections were showed their impact, farmers of Yalamanchili, Madugula and Chodavaram Assembly Constituency limits are now transporting the sugarcane to sugar factories.

The sleuths raided offices of the companies spread across Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Chandigarh, including those where the former minister's son, Rana Inder Partap, is a stake-holder.The 25 locations include homes and offices of businessman Sanjit Randhawa and chartered accountant firm Kansal Singla & Associates. Some 250-odd I-T officials, apart from a large number of police officials, are involved in the raids which started at 8 amsimultaneously at all locations. All attempts to contact Gurjit failed.Soon after the Congress government took over in Punjab in 2017, Amit Bahadur, Gurjit's former cook, had bagged the contract for a sand mine at Saidpur Khurd village in Nawanshahr with a bid of Rs 26.51 crore. Three other former employees of Gurjit's firm Rana Sugars Ltd had successfully bid for mines worth Rs 4.11 crore, Rs 9.21 crore and Rs 10.58 crore. This had led to allegations that all four were fronts for Gurjit who had allegedly sponsored them. Gurjit, however, insisted that he had nothing to do with his ex-employees.Some of the companies that were raided include Rana Sugars, Rana Polycot and Rajbir Enterprises. When contacted, Income Tax department's principal director Parneet Sachdev refused to give details.The department had started investigating the alleged scam in July 2017 and initially sought bank account details and the source of money deposited by Gurjit's four ex-employees - Kulwinder Paul, Balraj Singh, Gurvinder Singh and Bahadur from Punjab government. It had also sought details about the quarries they had invested in.Investigations had revealed that a common source had deposited the money in bank accounts of all four ex-employees of the minister. Following the development, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh had set up Justice Narang Commission to probe the scam and it had given a clean chit to Gurjit.On January 5, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) had issued summons to Gurjit's son for alleged violation of the Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) after he allegedly raised $ 18 million by floating foreign shares. The minister had finally resigned from the cabinet on January 16.Gurjit, who is Kapurthala MLA, was the richest candidate in fray in the Punjab assembly elections held in Fubruary 2017.

He was injured in an encounter with a police team in Sigma 4 area of Greater Noida on Monday night.He was rushed to the district hospital where he was declared dead on arrival.Sanjay, hailed from Amratpur Kalan village in Karnal, Haryana, and according to the police, had more than 36 cases lodged against him for murder, loot, extortion and abduction in different police stations of western UP over the past five years.Recently, the police claimed that he was allegedly trying to extort 50 lakh from BJP worker and businessman Pushkar Singh in Greater Noida.On Tuesday morning, when the police contacted his family members and village head asking them to collect his body, they allegedly refused saying that the gangster has only brought disgrace to the village.We have unanimously decided not to receive Sanjays body or perform his last rites in our village. He has only brought disgrace to our village with his acts. With his death, we hope that his family gets some closure as they have been troubled by him for long, Vikram, village chief of Amratpur Kalan, said.Sanjay is survived by a younger brother and mother; his father died a few years ago.His father Mahavir was a worker in a sugar mill and the family have had no troubles until Sanjay started his nefarious activities. Even in school, he was dismissed after class 3 as he was violent and used to beat up other students. Because of his activities, police would pick up his younger brother for questioning, Vikram said.The police said they are in talks with the family in order to reach an amicable solution.We are hopeful that by Wednesday, the family members will collect the body from the district hospital, Brijesh Verma, SHO, Kasna, said.According to the police, the encounter took place on Monday night around 10pm in Sigma 4 area of Greater Noida. The police received a tip regarding the presence of two members of the Mukeem Kala gang in the area.A team was immediately dispatched to apprehend the two men who were on a motorcycle.

They also fed bananas, sugar cane and watermelon to the rescued elephants Laxmi, Phoolkali and Maya, he said.Mr. Satyanarayan said that at the end of the visit, the family was presented an elephant footprint painting, Padhchinh, of Phoolkali along with a portrait of the majestic elephant.The Padhchinh is a unique series of artwork, born out of the collaboration of Singapore-based gifted artist Alpana Ahuja and the rescued elephants at Wildlife SOS, India.Translating into footprint in Sanskrit, Padhchinh symbolizes the elephants march towards a safer future.Perseverance is the keyThe first collection of Padhchinh paintings was unveiled in December 2013.Each footprint continues to be taken with tremendous patience, subject entirely to the elephants decision to participate in the process and largely influenced by bananas and other treats.The photo of Phoolkali was taken by Mumbai-based photographer Himanshuu Sheth.Phoolkali, who was blinded by her owners and used for begging on the streets, was rescued from Uttar Pradesh in 2012. Years of abuse and neglect had left her with terribly worn-out footpads and overgrown cuticles, which made it extremely difficult for her to walk or even stand.As part of her ongoing veterinary treatment, Phoolkali is given regular medicated foot soaks and her overgrown cuticles and footpads are trimmed and treated.For a greater causeMs. Ahuja said: It is a huge honour for me that a piece of art that I helped create with Phoolkali to support Wildlife SOS has a pride of place n the Canadian Prime Ministers home. I hope that the message of elephant conservation travels along with the art to Canada and more people from his country will support the wonderful work of Wildlife SOS to help protect elephants in India."

The agency also conducted searches at eight locations, including one in Hapur in Uttar Pradesh, one in Noida, and six locations in Delhi.According to the FIR, the bank filed the complaint on November 17, 2017.It was alleged that the Oriental Bank of Commerce sanctioned a loan amounting to Rs 148.60 crore in the year 2011 to the company (Simbhaoli Sugars). The loan was sanctioned for financing individual, joint liability groups, self help groups (SLG) and sugarcane farmers under the tie-up arrangement under the RBI (Reserve Bank of India) Scheme to 5,762 sugarcane farmers supplying sugar produce to the company which was dishonestly and fraudulently diverted by said company for its own needs.

The Nizamuddin Dargah (mausoleum) in New Delhi is visited by thousands every week. He had two disciples, both well-known poets of their time: Amir Khusrau and Amir Hasan Sijzi. Next to Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas shrine lies the shrine of Hazrat Amir Khusrau. It is called the Choti Dargah. This is the story of the shrine of Auliyas other disciple, Amir Hasan Sijzi.On a recent trip to Aurangabad, I visited Khuldabad, also referred to as the valley of saints. Most people know it as the burial place of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, but there is much more to the area. There is a reason why Aurangzeb had asked to be buried there.The valley of saintsWhen Sultan Muhammad bin Tughluq ordered in 1327 that his capital be shifted from Delhi to Deogir, which he named Daulatabad, he instructed the elites, nobles, officers, common men, and even the saints to shift with him.The Sufi saints, 1,400 of them, decided to settle in an area near Daulatabad. The shrines of these saints dot the area, which is why that place was initially called Rauza (shrine). After Aurangzebs burial it was renamed Khuldabad as he was given the posthumous title of khuld-makani (hw who resides in paradise). Famous saints such as Shah Raja Qattal, Shaikh Burhanuddin Gharib, Shaikh Muntajibuddin and Aurangzebs spiritual master, Shaikh Zaynuddin Shirazi, are buried there.It was while I was researching why this place is called the valley of saints that I found that Amir Najm al-Din Hasan Dihlavi ibn Khwaja Ala al-Din Sistani, commonly known as Amir Hasan Sijzi or Hazrat Amir Hasan Dehlvi, was also buried there. He too had been ordered to leave Delhi for Daulatabad, and was never to return.If Amir Khusrau captured Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas teachings in his songs and poetry, Amir Sijzi did the same in the famous compilation titledFawaid-al-Fuad, which contains the literary discourses of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. Unlike Amir Khusrau who became his disciple when he was around eight years old, Amir Sijzi became Auliyas disciple quite late in life, when he was already an established poet and called the Saadi-e-Hind. Amir Sijzi was born in Badaun in Uttar Pradesh in 1254 and died in Daulatabad in 1337.Saiyid Zaheer Husain Jafri, professor at the department of history at Delhi University, says that Fuad was the first book of its kind in India. It was for the first time that anyone had written about the day-to-day interactions, reactions and teachings of a Sufi Shaikh in his khanqah. He says: In this book, you find the principles of Sufism being talked about in the simplest of terms by the great Shaikh, and we also see that every section of society is represented. The Shaikh is not only talking to the elites but to the common man as well. Its not that Shaikhs didnt speak earlier, but a mature scholar, recognising the value of these discourses, recorded it for posterity. The entire book is in the form of conversations supported by examples. It is a lively speech that captures the readers imagination. It is also important because the saint himself checked the account for veracity. Very simply written, this book is an important historical, social and literary document as it records contemporary life and society.Professor K.A. Nizami has written in his preface to the English translation of Fuad by Bruce Lawrence: It soon found a distinctive place in Muslim mystic literature. In fact, Amir Khusrau offered to exchange all his works for it.The shrine and some sugarWhen I reached Khuldabad, I had to ask many people about this shrine. I was told to look out for a big gate with an old man sitting in front of it. This was to the west of Khuldabad and it seemed as though not many people visit this place. I found the old man, the caretaker, sitting in front of a big gate, which he opened when my car stopped there. He took me inside and I offered my prayers.It is believed that the original copy of the Fawaid-al-Fuad is buried with Amir Hasan Sijzi as per his will. The caretaker told me that children who cant talk are brought to this shrine and given sugar, which is believed to give them the power of speech. On hearing that I was a writer, the caretaker offered me some sugar to sweeten my pen. I pray that it works."

The music of Kashmir helped me in understanding the place. Sufiyana shayari was alive at that time. A sufi is a person without a base. He is of here and there. My Lucknow roots has given me etiquette and when you express them, you often get more than required. I saw Kashmir from the prism of culture. And then I saw it in the mirror of my heart. For me, Dal Lake was a lake of spirituality in which I got immersed. Along the way, I found weeds, which they keep removing from the lake. They hurt me because by then Pakistan had injected a fundamentalist undercurrent.On Zooni getting inordinately delayed We tried to fit in commercial actors in an artistic timetable. I agree I did it in Umrao Jaan as well but in Umrao Jaan nature was not visible. Here I wanted to connect all the emotions with nature. Kashmir allows it. Its spring showcases joy and its winter reminds of sadness and melancholy. I got a little too ambitious but it doesnt mean I got carried way. I am very good with time planning. I have recently completed 13-14 short films on time.On his friend and collaborator ShahryarHe was consuming himself. He was not a sufi. Every poetry has its destination. Shahryars poetry has its down destination and Faizs has its own. As I am not a poet, I can move from one destination to another. And I can stop at the destination that I like. But if you are a poet, you can stop at a destination only when you are worthy enough to reach there. I dont have to prove anything. But as a filmmaker, I faced similar challenges.On comparison between Umrao Jaan and Shatranj Ke Khiladi For me, Awadh was the biggest issue. It was my reason to make the film. For Satyajit Ray, I guess, it was the story. It was good, but I wanted the character of Wajid Ali Shah to have more punch.On his ability to take risks From casting Rekha as Umrao to making Shabana Azami sing in Anjuman, there is a long list. I have the sixth sense and being a painter I have the confidence that I can make something out of nothing. Sometimes this conviction fails as well, but it is the first prerequisite for any creative pursuit.On the relevance of Anjuman and Aagman, his films that didnt get much traction when they released Aagman continues to be relevant because the exploitative attitude of sugar mills in Uttar Pradesh continues. The farmers are unable to look beyond sugarcane crop. Anjuman talked about the advantage that exploiters take when the unity of society breaks."

Led by Palwal MLA Karan Singh Dalal, the Congress MLAs raised slogans while accusing the state government of forcing cane growers into bankruptcy.Khattar advised the Congress legislators to maintain the dignity of cane growers. He discouraged them to follow such practices.In the assembly, heated arguments ensued between Congress MLAs Dalal, Kuldeep Sharma, R S Kadian and agriculture minister O P Dhankar, social justice minister Krishan Kumar Bedi and labour minister Nayab Singh Saini over the plight of cane growers. The ministers claimed that the cane growers were being paid the highest price in Haryana and their produce was being procured by the sugar mills of the state, which were told to operate for two more months after the end of the crushing season.Sharma, Dalal and Kadian reiterated the government rider in procuring sugarcane on the state advised price (SAP). The increased price is just an impression as farmers are not able to sell their entire produce on those rates, hence they are forced to take sugarcane to the mills in Uttar Pradesh. Despite bearing the cost of transportation, the farmer is forced to sell his produce at throwaway prices, said former speaker Sharma.Like the zero hour, the discussion on governor Kaptan Singh Solankis address also attracted criticism from Congress MLAs. Referring to law and order, Sharma accused the government of failing to control the entry of Dera Sacha Sauda followers in the state when Gurmeet Ram Rahim was convicted of rape in August 2017. First the government allowed the dera followers to assemble in violation of the orders. Later, it used paramilitary force to control the mobs resulting in 38 deaths. Similar was the scene in the case of violence during the Jat agitation for reservation in February 2016. One MP, who provoked all, was set free, the police acted as a mute spectator and the action by paramilitary resulted in the deaths of innocent, he alleged.Odd man outTek Chand Sharma, the lone BSP MLA of Haryana, seems to be the odd man out. Notwithstanding the fact that his party supremo Mayawati had been taking a stand against BJP and its leaders, Sharma was all praise for chief minister Khattar and the saffron partys rule in Haryana."

Most assumed that Adityanath was simply cool towards the Trudeaus because of instructions from New Delhi. But insiders in Lucknow suggest that it is more likely that the Chief Minister acted on his own volition because of his unhappy experience with the earlier State visit of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his wife Sara, whom Prime Minister Modi had requested him to look after. The chief minister was irritated that the Israeli couple did not keep to the programme schedule and he had to cool his heels for over an hour. First, Sara Netanyahu took her own time to come down from her hotel room, holding up the visit to the Taj. At lunch,Ms Netanyahu abruptly left the dining table where Yogi was hosting a vegetarian non-alcoholic meal, and said she would prefer to sit outside. A short while later, her husband decided to join her, leaving his host red-faced.For this actress, a ministerial fanMinister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju is clearly a fan of Bollywood actor Huma Qureshi, as seen from his Twitter handle. Recently, Qureshi posted on Twitter asking for a translation of the label for a Japanese spread called Macha, to find out if it had sugar content. The minister, who should have been preoccupied with the Northeast, considering that elections were on there, responded promptly with a tweet saying he would have tried to translate it for her but he was busy in the campaign. He added another explanatory tweet, I am messaging you from a chopper while campaigning. Qureshis name finds an occasional mention in the ministers tweets such as clubbing her name with major stars like Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar and announcing that these actors are looking to do projects in the Northeast. Last year, Rijiju hosted the premiere for the movie Partition 1947 at the government auditorium in Delhi. Qureshi was the movies heroine.On poll tie-up query, ask RahulA journalist who met Sonia Gandhi in Parliament enquired whether the Congress would be joining the BSP in backing the Samajwadi Party for the two by-elections in Uttar Pradesh. Sonia suggested that the scribe speak to Rahul, since she was not the party chief. Even when the newsman reminded her that she continued to be the chairperson of the UPA, Sonia declined to comment. The partys younger generation believes the old guard is responsible for bringing the Congress to its present sorry state. As an example, they cite C P Joshi, who is general secretary in charge of 11 states, including the Northeast, Bihar and the Andaman Islands. During the recent campaign in the Northeast, Joshi was not present in the region for more than a fortnight. The selection of candidates for the Rajya Sabha seats will provide the first clue as to whether there is to be a generational shift in out-look. Rahuls long-time mentor Sam Pitroda is rumoured to be a possible Rajya Sabha candidate. Though he has taken Indian citizenship and has sold off his businesses, his friends say Pitroda is not interested as he prefers acting on his own, not as a team.In party in flux, drifting MLAsIt is difficult to keep track of equations in the AIADMK. E Palaniswami (EPS) is Chief Minister and O Panneerselvam (OPS) Deputy CM, so many assume that EPS is the boss. But in national politics, OPS is superior as he is party coordinator and EPS only co-coordinator. The general secretarys post remains vacant since Jayalalithaas death. Last week in Parliament, among the 37 AIADMK MPs, the only topic of conversation was actor Rajinikanths speech saying he had decided to enter politics because of the vacuum left by Jayalalithaa and ailing DMK leader M Karunanidhi in state politics.

5b17ba849855b75db2e7b04c,Sugar oversupply may hit profitability of mills,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sugar-oversupply-may-hit-profitability-of-mills/articleshow/63291206.cms,2018-03-14,"Coimbatore: Sugar wouldnt be sweet for sugar mills in the current season. With the sugar production estimated to set a new record by touching around 29.5 million tonnes in the 2017-18 sugar season (October-September) and likely to outstrip consumption by around 4-4.5 million tonnes, sugar mills may face pressure on prices and profitability in the near-term. The annual sugar consumption is pegged at 25 million tonnes.After hitting a low of Rs 31,500 per tonne in the first week of February, sugar prices picked up in the following weeks on the back of government initiatives such as the doubling of import duty to 100% and the imposition of limits on sugar sales by sugar mills.Prices, which increased to Rs 34,500-35,000 per tonne in the third week of February, have softened again and are currently hovering at around Rs 32,500 per tonne.Ratings agency ICRA has revised domestic sugar production for the 2017-18 season to around 29.5 million tonnes against its earlier estimate of at least 27 million tonnes. This has been driven principally by higher-than-expected sugar production in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Karnataka, said Sabyasachi Majumdar, senior VP and group head, ICRA Ratings. This in turn is likely to exert pressure on sugar mills debt coverage metrics and also adversely affect liquidity indicators, including cane payments. Under these circumstances, government support will remain critical for the sugar industry, ICRA said. We expect the closing stocks to significantly increase to around 8.5-9 million tonnes in SY2018 (sugar year 2017-18), Majumdar stated. The reverse stock limits imposed by the government are valid up to March 31, 2018. Hence this upward revision in the sugar production estimate along with the liquidation of sugar stocks, especially by several cash-strapped sugar mills, post March 2018, is likely to result in pressure on sugar prices from the coming quarter, he said.Sugar mills profitability is likely to come under stress on account of the higher cane cost of production (higher SAP or state advised price and FRP or fair and remunerative price for the current season) along with the likely pressure on sugar realisations during Q1 FY2019 (first quarter of 2018-19), Majumdar said.However, most major UP-based mills have by and large seen significant deleveraging over the last couple of years, which will help them withstand cyclical downturns better, he said. Given the increase in production levels, the fall in prices could lead to an increase in the cane arrears, he stated."

This is mainly due to 43% higher sugarcane production across India.The prices are likely to drop further as there will be more supply of sugar against demand in the coming days.Chairman of Bardoli Sugar Cooperative Pankaj Patel told TOI, This year sugarcane yield is higher compared to last year. This year we alone have 56,000 acre of sugarcane crop that needs to be crushed.Last year, we were able to give farmers rate of Rs 3,954 per 100 kg. However, this year it would be lower by at least Rs 700-800 due to bumper harvest, he added.A local farmer from Surat district Ketan Patel said, We have huge quantity of sugar coming from neighbouring Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, which sells at Rs 3,000 per 100 kg. As a result, our cooperatives are compelled to cut the prices to compete with them in market.On the other side, sugar cooperatives have to make payment to farmers every 15 days. We need Rs 40-45 crore to pay the farmers. So we have to cut prices and sell the produce to pay the farmers, Patel said.Last year, government imposed 100% import duty on sugar as a result local farmers were able to get good price. However, this year with production up by 43% in the country, the demand would not be more than 250 lakh tonne against production of 300 lakh tonne, former chairman of Madhi Sugar Cooperative Dilip Bhakta said."

Finance minister O Panneerselvam seems to believe in the axiom as he sees a tide in 20018-19, unmindful of the turbulence ahead that may capsize his yacht. The good news is Tamil Nadu will grow at 9% for the next year, much faster than India (7.3%), yet the benefits of this growth will not percolate to its people as the state coughs up large chunks of its revenue to fund interest payments and freebies.The best long-term investment seems to be the 25% increase in allocation for higher education that got Rs 4,620 crore; but spending on school education inched up just 1% to Rs 27,205 crore. Police got a 21% increase in allocation while health got a 14% increase. The freebies took up almost Rs 20,000 crore, the latest a provision of Rs 250 crore for scooters.With GST in place, the scope for increasing taxes or levies is virtually nil except with respect to petroleum products, liquor and property registrations.The budget presented on Thursday has a bit of everything yet a whole of nothing. With little or no fiscal leeway, Tamil Nadu continues to live beyond its means and, worse, it will do so at least until 2021with amounting revenue deficit.The sugar industry, which is witnessing its worst phase in 32 years, gets a reprieve in the form of a revenue sharing model between mills and cane growers, the third state to implement it after Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh.The state will also go in for direct procurement of cereals, include more services under its e-seva scheme and build an ultra modern food park across 450 acres in Tindivanam. With inbound project investments drying up, the states deputy chief minister hoped to reinvigorate the states traditional bastions by promising new textile and food processing policies, which he hopes will kick-start job creation. However, much depends on how soon these policies are rolled out. For long the state has been waiting for a new IT policy. The last one was announced eight years ago.Despite the temptation to splurge, the state has pulled back its spending and kept a tight leash on government finances. For one, the fiscal deficit -- the difference between total revenue and total expenditure of the government is termed as fiscal deficit -- for the current year will be sharply lower at 2.82% (against a budgetary provision of 4.14%) and for the next year, it will lower this deficit to 2.79%.But, the rising growth will not benefit the common man on street as the significant portion of tax revenues that will accrue will go towards interest, salary and pensions for government staff and funding freebies. The magnitude of this morass is such that 95% of revenue expenditure will go for fulfilling these three heads.The continued unabashed freebie culture will force the state to borrow more, especially when rates are rising, which in turn will result in higher interest payouts in coming years.The governments vulnerability will be exposed in the absence of sops to the farmers in the form of farm loan waiver, which is the national flavour. The state government missed the bus with no mention of cleaning up of its state owned units. Inefficient state PSUs are sucking away hard earned tax income. I expected some measures for cleaning up these entities, said M Ponnuswami , chairman, CII-TN. He said that slipping fiscal discipline was worrying.The governments decision to create additional land banks of 9,030 acres to allot to new investors is a welcome measure as it has become very difficult for investors to buy land in the state. We feared a steep fall in tax collection due to GST, but the collections are actually up, S Chandramohan, vice chairman, CII TN, said.Meanwhile, the government will replace 3,000 rickety old buses with new ones, with old sanctions for new buses, the state will replace its 4,593 buses during the next year. It will set up a bio park--Ticel Bio Park in Coimbatore, construct 1.30 lakh houses under hut-free village scheme. It will build 4.37 lakh new toilets allocating Rs 550 crore.It will spend Rs 20 crore to make Veda Nilayam, residence of former chief minister Jayalalithaa into a memorial and Rs 50.80 crore has been earmarked for Jaya's memorial in Marina."

Overall, mill owners have managed to pay about 71.59% of the total money they owe.Deepak Guptara, UPSMAs secretary, said that about 8001 lakh quintals of cane was crushed in 2017-18, from which 850.49 lakh quintals of sugar was produced in this season. He said that due to the record production of sugar, prices had fallen.Sugar pricesThe total investment in the production of one quintal of sugar is at least Rs. 3,450. Right now, the rate of sugar has gone down to Rs. 3,220 [per quintal], which means that we are bearing a loss of at least Rs. 230 per quintal, Mr. Guptara said.Sudhir Panwar, a former member of the Uttar Pradesh Planning Commission, who hails from the Shamli district, told The Hindu , What is happening on the ground is just the opposite of the ruling partys promise that farmers will get their cane [sale] dues in a maximum of two weeks from the start of the crushing season."

""Local peddlers take advantage of the dearth of checking drives on board trains and buses to smuggle in small consignments (5kg to 10kg), which are then sold in different parts of the steel city and elsewhere,"" he said.People who bring the consignment supply it to ""known selling points"" from where only ""known purchasers"" can claim their kick for the decided price. ""Consignments are transported to these selling points in customised bike or car compartments,"" the official said.While marijuana (a greenish-grey mixture of the dried cannabis flowers) is available for a market price ranging from Rs 4,000 to Rs 7,000 a kg, smack (an opioid) has a steeper price tag of Rs 150-200 per gram depending on the purity.""Ganja is smoked, often with tobacco, while smack or brown sugar is burnt using a foil and the smoke inhaled using a straw.

This is the largest seizure of exotic animals in the state so far, indicating that Guwahati is increasingly being used by traders as a conduit for illegally supplying exotic animals for sale in the international pet market.Police said one Pradip Kumar of Budaun district in Uttar Pradesh was arrested on Saturday when the animals were found in his possession during a vehicle search at Jorabat. Most of the species which were found with him are native to Africa and South America.Jorabat officer in-charge Partha Pratim Gogoi said Kumar sourced the animals from Aizawl, the capital of Mizoram, and was coming to Guwahati on a Tata Sumo to board a Delhi-bound train. ""We had information about a person coming with a large number of exotic animals from Aizawl. Our searches led to seizure of the live animals.

This is the fourth highest in the country. The top three states are Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra, that are also major producers of sugarcane.States like Gujarat, Punjab, Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu and Haryana, all of which have a much higher sugarcane production than Uttarakhand this year, have lower pending arrears.According to a written reply submitted by the central government in Parliament on Tuesday, Uttarakhand produced 2.72 lakh metric tonnes (MT) sugarcane in 2017-18, against 7.38 lakh MT in Gujarat, 4.82 lakh MT in Punjab, 4.38 lakh MT in Bihar and 4.24 lakh MT in Haryana.However, these states fare better in terms of paying their farmers. For instance, Andhra Pradesh which produced 26% more sugarcane has arrears worth 293 crore pending (80% less than Uttarakhand); Gujarat produced 7.38 lakh MT (171% more than Uttarakhand) but has arrears of 475 pending (11% less than Uttarakhand).The Sugarcane (Control) Order, 1966, states that the payment of cane price should be made within 14 days of supply to the mill, failing which the amount will attract a 15% interest per annum on the amount due after 14 days.When asked about the high pendency, finance minister Prakash Pant said it was largely due to the delay by private mills.All arrears for 2016-17 have been cleared. Last year too, the government mills made the payments. In this season, most of the mills are still operating. Only the sugar mill in Bajpur has stopped processing. The payments have started. Let the mills first finish processing and make whatever payments they can. We will make necessary interventions if government mills are unable to pay farmers.He however made it clear that the government will not extend any financial aid to private mills. Our responsibility is to put pressure on them to make timely payments. We will allow them to operate only if they have cleared previous dues, he said.Anand Shrivastav, commissioner, sugarcane and sugar, said the department was regularly sending notices to defaulting private mills.There are three private mills in the state and two of them are very regular in their payments. Only the Iqbalpur sugar mill is in a poor financial condition. It wont be surprising if it defaults this year too. They somehow managed to make their full payment for last year only by the crushing season of this year.Meanwhile, owing to high production and low demand for sugar, mills across the country are expected to incur losses this year as the price of sugar is falling. The central government recently said in Parliament that it has enhanced the import duty on sugar from 50% to 100% to help mills in making payments to the farmers.In this background, clearing pending arrears is likely to be an uphill task for sugar mills in Uttarakhand.Agreeing on this, Pant said, The mills are likely to incur loss this year because the price of sugar is falling due to high production. We will make arrangements for the remaining amount.He however added that since the government has replaced around 60% sugarcane with a high-yielding variety, the recovery (quantity of sugar produced from raw cane) this year has been very good.Expressing hopes for a positive result, he said, Whenever the recovery is more than 10%, it is seen that mills are in profit. On an average, this year the recovery has been 10.7%. Our estimate is that private mills will be in a better position this year. The loss due incurred due to falling prices of sugar should be balanced out with the high recovery.Meanwhile, despite the governments assurance that it will help government mills in paying their dues, farmers are sceptical. They say that in absence of strict actions, sugar mills in the state have become habitual in making delayed payments.The crushing season started in November but farmers have received payments only till January 15. The condition of sugarcane farmers in the state is very bad, said Jagdish Thakur, vice-president, Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, Uttarakhand chapter.Asked about last seasons payments, he said that many mills made the payments only in the first month of this crushing season.Farmers cant rely on mills. The payments are untimely and uncertain. We are forced to avail loans from banks by mortgaging our property. The Sitarganj sugar mill would have benefited many farmers in the Terrai belt. But since it has been closed, farmers have been hard hit as they now have to transport their produce to far off mills, he said.BLURB: Despite being 10th in terms of sugarcane production, Uttarakhand ranks fourth when it comes to pending arrears for 2017-18"

Thombre, the president of WISMA, said on Monday.In the northern Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, India's biggest sugar producing region, output is forecast to rise to 10.8 million tonnes, said Thombre, up from 8.8 million the previous year.The Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA), the national industry association for the world's second-biggest sugar producer, in March forecast a surplus of 4.5 million tonnes following output of 29.5 million tonnes for the marketing season that started on Oct. 1.The higher-than-expected surplus could pressure local prices even lower even after they fell last week to their lowest since December 2015.Globally, prices are trading near their lowest in 2-1/2 years and an expected surge of Indian exports after the country revoked its export tax last month should mean prices may drop even further.WISMA is revising its production numbers as mills are still processing sugar cane in both Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra though the processing season typically ends in March.""Sugar cane yields are much better than last year. Still many mills are operational in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh and they will continue crushing for a few more days,"" said Thombre.Last week, India mandated that mills must export 2 million tonnes of sugar to lower inventories and support local prices.On March 20, the country also scrapped its 20 percent sugar export tax as an added incentive for mills to export.Domestic sugar prices have fallen 16 percent in the past six months. In addition to the oversupply amid the rising production, mills were aggressively selling the sweetener to make payments to sugar cane farmers."

The CM said the committee has submitted its report that it will be of no use to renovate the existing mill as it will cost a lot, whereas setting up of a new sugar mill will be cheaper and more beneficial.As for the main agenda of the function, the loan waiver beneficiaries were 26,918 marginal farmers (owning up to 2.5 acres) from Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr who got cheques against loans of Rs 156.12 crore taken from co-operative societies and co-operative banks. The CM said that by now 1.02 lakh farmers have been covered under the waiver scheme that is meant for marginal and small farmers (owning up to 5) acres, at a cost of Rs 455 crore to the state. He underlined that this function was the third of its kind; the earlier ones were held at Mansa and Nakodar. He also reiterated that his government leads by offering farmers a waiver of up to Rs 2 lakh while Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra offered Rs 1 lakh and Rs 50,000, respectively.He noted that it is unfortunate that 10.25 lakh of Punjabs 17.5 lakh farmers are in debt. He promised a complete solution to the problem of farm loan in a phased manner as and when the state exchequer allows. He expressed concern over suicides being committed by the debt-ridden farmers. He held the 10-year misrule of SAD-BJP alliance  before Congress took power in March last year  responsible for the financial crisis in the farming sector. To make the assertion that he stands by the people in crises, he also mentioned the promise of a government job and financial help of Rs 5 lakh each to families of the men killed by terrorists in Mosul (Iraq).Later, he also took a dig at the opposition AAP and SAD MLAs boycotting parts of the recent Vidhan Sabha session over minor differences of opinion, and underlined that functioning of the state assembly costs Rs 70 lakh a day. Commenting on 23 days of non-functioning of the Lok Sabha, he said the functioning of the Lower House of Parliament costs Rs 9 crore a day and the MPs must discuss everything, instead of avoiding discussions. It mus here be underlined that Amarinder had particularly low attendance when he was most recently a member of the Lok Sabha (2014-16) before he quit and later became the CM.None of the six speakers made a mention of Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, who was conspicuous by his absence even as he is a local. Bajwas younger brother Fateh Jang was among the speakers. Amarinder centred his speech around farmers and did not talk at all about the problems of drug abuse and unemployment. He arrived by a chopper for which a helipad was made near the function ground.Six speakers, including the CM, addressed the gathering at the function that lasted an hour and a half, from 12.30 pm to 2 pm. Cabinet ministers Tripat Rajinder Singh Bajwa and Aruna Chaudhary, state Congress president and Gurdaspur MP Sunil Jakhar, and MLAs Barindermeet Singh Pahra, Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Fateh Jang Bajwa were the other speakers. Singer Pammi Bai and his troupe held the audiences attention from 10 am to 12.30 pm before the chief minister arrived.Others present on the occasion included MLAs Balwinder Singh Laadi, Arun Dogra, Sunder Sham Arora, Raj Kumar Chabbewal and Rajnish Kumar Babbi, former ministers Ashwani Sekhri and Gurchet Singh Bhullar, and the district Congress unit presidents of Gurdaspur and Amritsar, Ashok Chaudhary and Bhagwant Pal Singh Sachar."

Singh told the gathering that the State government had already made a budgetary provision for setting up a medical college at Gurdaspur to provide the best healthcare and diagnostic services to the people.He asked Jakhar to identify suitable land in consultation with the local MLA for the proposed medical college.As a token gesture, the Chief Minister handed over debt waiver certificates to six farmers one from each of the six districts of Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Amritsar, Tarn Taran, Nawanshahr and Hoshiarpur.Rs. 457 crore reliefHe also said that so far debt relief to the tune of Rs. 457 crore had been disbursed to nearly 1.02 lakh farmers in three different phases, covering the 16 districts.The Chief Minister said that after completing the debt relief scheme of cooperative loans, the State government would soon begin waiving farm debts from commercial banks, which would be completed by the end of the year.He pointed out that despite the massive financial crisis facing the State, his government was giving the maximum financial assistance to the farmers in terms of debt waiver relief of up to Rs. 2 lakh.This was the highest in the country, Capt. Singh said, pointing out that in the case of Uttar Pradesh it was Rs. 1 lakh, while Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra were waiving only Rs. 50,000 each."

According to the State Cane Development department data, the mills are yet to pay Rs. 8,108.94 crore to the farmers after buying their cane till April 4. This has led to a series of protests by farmers.On Tuesday, a large number of farmers took to the streets in Shamli demanding their dues. Shamli is the constituency of States Cane Development Minister Suresh Rana.The protesters, led by former member of Uttar Pradesh State Planning Commission Sudhir Panwar, demanded timely payment of the arrears and rollback of the increase in the electricity rates.The Yogi Adityanath government took votes of farmers on the promise that it will ensure payment of cane dues within two weeks. However, the tragedy is that the farmers are still waiting, Dr. Panwar, a farm expert, said.Biggest defaultersThe sugar mills in and around the constituency of Mr. Rana are the biggest defaulters.While the mills in Shamli owe Rs. 432.84 crore, those in Saharanpur Rs. 415.36 crore and in Muzaffarnagar Rs. 373.58 crore, as per the data.Deepak Guptara, secretary of the U.P. Sugar Mills Association, said the decreasing rates of sugar had affected the paying capacity of the mills. The total investment in the production of one quintal of sugar is at least Rs. 3,450. The rate of sugar has gone down to Rs. 2,920, which means we are bearing a loss of at least Rs. 530/quintal, he said.Chaudhary Vinay Kumar, vice-president of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, told The Hindu that the State government has miserably failed to keep its promise because of which the financial situation of the farmers has become really bad. The government is not taking action against the mill owners."

Compared with last year, the domestic ex-mill sugar prices are lower by 20% . The Centre helped the mills in 2015-2016 sugar season by paying Rs. 4.5 for a quintal of cane directly to farmers as part of the FRP.This reduced the liability of the mills towards farmers. The Centre should announce a similar scheme with a production subsidy of Rs. 10 to Rs. 12 a quintal in the current season which would cover a substantial part of the increase in FRP. The amount can be paid directly into the farmers bank accounts, ISMA said.Association sources said, the Centre announced MIEQ (minimum indicative export quota) of 20 lakh tonnes so that some surplus stock can be moved out. Exports are, however, not viable as globally there is excess production and the market is depressed. Prices are also low in domestic and international markets, the sources said.In the domestic market, the ex-mill price in Uttar Pradesh is Rs. 28.50 a kg of sugar whereas the cost of production is Rs. 35 a kg. The ex-mill price in Maharashtra is Rs. 27 a kg against production cost of Rs. 32 a kg. By the end of March, the all India sugar production for the current season (October 2017 to September 2018) stood at 281.82 lakh tonnes. This is 92.95 lakh tonnes higher than the preceeding season."

Yet this year, Maharashtra has broken a record and touched the highest sugar production in its history at 105.58 lakh tonnes.By the end of the season in May, sugar output in the state is set to hit 107-108 lakh tonnes. The previous record was in 2014-15 at 105.14 lakh tonnes. Maharashtra is the countrys second highest sugar producer, after Uttar Pradesh. This is record production and crushing is not yet over. But the state is likely to finish second behind UP whose projections are higher, said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.But the glut is worrying for sugar factories and cane farmers. Sugar prices have crashed by Rs1,000 per quintal from Rs3,600 to Rs2,600. This is making it hard for factories to pay cane farmers the price set by the Centre at Rs2,550 per tonne. Pending dues to the states cane farmers are at Rs2,277 crore.Nationally too, the picture is one of excess, with production 56% higher than last year. So far this year, sugar output has reached 304 lakh tonnes compared to 195 lakh tonnes last year, said Prakash Naiknavare, managing director of the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NSCSF). Nationally, payments due to farmers are worth Rs20,000 crore, he said.With factories making losses due to low prices, it is difficult for them to get new working capital in the form of loans, said NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil, NSCFC chairman. Many will not be able to function when the crushing season begins in October, he said. The cultivation area of water-guzzling sugarcane in India is expected to grow from 46 lakh hectares this year to 51 lakh hectares next year.The industry is pushing for export of 4 mn tonnes of stock to stabilize prices, with NSCSF writing to PM Modi. So far, Centre has increased import duty from 50% to 100% and scrapped export duty (earlier it was 20%)."

The sugar glut has brought the ex-mill price down to Rs 26-Rs 28/kg, against the cost of production of Rs 36/kg.Sources said after issuing a few warnings to the sugar mills for non-payment of cane arrears to the farmers, the government has realised the surplus production, falling global prices and huge losses being suffered by the mills need to be addressed. The meeting will deliberate on each issue. Until and unless there is price correction, there will be no improvement.

A note presenting all the proposals will soon be prepared to present to the Cabinet, said the statement.The proposal is to reduce the GST from 18% to 5%, Mr. Paswan told The Hindu , adding that the GoM would hold another meeting to finalise the details of the proposals. He said the government was looking for ways to incentivise value-added products, including molasses and ethanol, which could utilise the surplus harvest of sugarcane, and which would reduce the burden on the mills.The GoM is headed by Transport Minister Nitin Gadkari, and includes Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, as well as Mr. Paswan.Last month, the Food Ministry told Parliament that sugar mills had pending dues worth Rs. 13, 899 crore as on March 21. Industry lobbyist Indian Sugar Mills Association estimates that figure has now crossed Rs. 20,000 crore.Record highSugar production has hit record highs this year, crossing domestic consumption estimates and resulting in a crash in prices.

We have assured that the petroleum ministry will ensure procuring the entire ethanol that millers will produce, Pradhan told TOI.The proposals have come amid allegations from some farmers in Western UP and Haryana that millers have stopped issuing indents.

Of 43 mills in the state, seven did not crush any cane during the current season due to low cane availability or financial difficulties. Others have either completed crushing or are about to complete it.""I havent seen anything like this in my living memory,"" said Palani G Periyasamy, chairman of Dharani Sugars and South India Sugar Mills Association (SISMA). Mills operated for 300 days in a year a few decades ago. ""This year we will be lucky if we operate for 60 days,"" said a senior SISMA official.The impact has had a spiraling effect on sugarcane farmers, many of whom havent got their cane arrears from some mills. With an estimated cane availability of just 75 lakh tonnes, sugar mills are operating at just 20% to 25% of their rated capacity.The industry is currently going through an extended phase of distress due to factors like failure of monsoon, varietal degeneration, reduced recovery, decline in area under cultivation and the resultant reduction in capacity utilisation of sugar mills.The impact of the downturn faced by sugar mills is so severe that the state which consumes nearly 15 lakh tonnes of sugar a year will have to import 9 lakh tonnes this year. ""Sadly, for markets like Sankaran Koil (in southern TN), we are getting sugar from Maharashtra,"" the SISMA official said. As if adding insult to injury, Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra are projected to have a bumper crop which makes it viable to move sugar from Maharashtra to Tamil Nadu The sugar season starts in October and ends in the following September. ""This year while some mills have finished their cane crushing in February some have done it in March,"" industry officials said.From a peak of 254.55 lakh tonnes of cane crushed in 2011-2012, crushing fell to 119.04 lakh tonnes during sugar season 2016-2017. The estimated cane availability for the current season is around 75 lakh tonnes.Adding to the woes of the already stressed mill owners, sugar prices have crashed  prices hover around Rs32,000 per tonnes now.The TN sugar industry is burdened with massive debts which it finds difficult to service and repay. Some loans categorised as SEFASU 2014 and Soft Loan 2015 have been taken for payment of FRP (fair and remunerative price) during those seasons since sugar prices witnessed a massive fall and not for creating any asset, officials said.With piling cane dues, the Rs290 crore sugar industry in the state is hopeful that the budget announcements of an incentive package for the industry will help it tide over the crisis.The government has announced a revenue sharing formula for sugarcane growers in its budget. It will protect the interests of farmers by assuring them of the present state administered price (SAP) of Rs2,750 per tonne excluding transportation cost of Rs100, by paying the difference between the present SAP and the price received under a new revenue sharing formula as transitional production incentive directly to the farmers, said finance minister O Panneerselvam while presenting the budget.A back-of-the-envelope calculation shows that the cost of sugar for the mill is Rs4,000 per tonne, (at 25% capacity utilisation) while the selling price is Rs3,200.Introduction of Revenue Sharing Formula for sugarcane pricing, assures fair and remunerative price for the farmers and also enables farmers to get additional revenue over and above FRP, when the realisations from sugar and by-products move up. ""It is a boon for the sugarcane farmers as they are guaranteed of a minimum price and would get their due share out of higher sugar price in market and there would be certainty of payment. This also brings stability to the sugar industry since cane prices will get linked to realisation from sugar and its byproducts,"" said Periyasami."

We screened 1.20 lakh pregnant women in past three months and found 2% of them to be as diabetic. Thus, the programme is being extended to more districts, said Swapna Das, general manager (maternal health) National Health Mission, Uttar Pradesh.She said that UP was first state to have so many districts facilitating diabetes screening for pregnant women.The scheme is there in several states but just four of five districts are covered under it, she said while talking to media on the sidelines of a training programme for doctors held in Lucknow on Thursday.Dr Uma Singh, an expert in the programmme, said that ideally pregnant women should get blood sugar tested in the initial phase of the pregnancy itself.If the result is negative, the test may again be conducted during the 24-28 week of pregnancy. However, if the result is over positive i.e., over 140, diet advise is given to control blood sugar. And if the result is 200 or above, medication is provided.She added that the test was simple. The woman is made to drink 75-gms of glucose and then a blood test is conducted.We hope the programme reaches every pregnant woman in state as it will help reduce the complications for mother and child which is caused due to diabetes during pregnancy, said Dr Singh."

The NCP president and former union agriculture minister Sharad Pawar on Friday convened a meeting of sugar producers in Mumbai.A decision to constitute a committee of sugar experts to evolve a proposal seeking centres intervention along with workable measures to help both cane growing farmers, sugar mills and also protect the consumers interest were discussed at length.Amongst the three major recommendations made by Pawar were sugar export, use in ethanol and cogeneration. The surplus sugar production necessites exploring the market internationally. Giving a practical solution to the problem, Pawar said,  The government of India should initiate measures to facilitate export of sugar. The price difference between domestic market in India and International market which works to Rs 8 should be subsidies to the sugar producers. He advocated 30 -35 lakh tonne export of sugar to bring stability in the sugar prices and avoid its crashing down.The sugar production would be 308 lakh tonne. The sugar carried forward from previous year is 42 lakh tonne. The domestic sale would be 250 lakh tonne. The additional sugar would be 100 lakh tonne.The real concern is to find a solution to 100 lakh tonne. The NCP leader said the buffer stock of sugar was not the solution. As price mechanism works on the laws of demand and supply. When there is buffer stock, sugar cannot fetch good price as buyers psychology is not to shell higher rates.While sugar production in Uttar Pradesh is 109, Maharashtra is 106.77 lakh tonne. This compared to previous year 40 lakh tonne is almost 2.54 times more. The requirement in state is 24 lakh tonne. As a result 94.77 lakh tonne sugar will have to be exported or routed for industrial use.Urging the sugar mills to equip themselves with cogeneration plant and ethanol plant to optimise the use of surplus sugar cane, Pawar said,  The farmers are going to cultivate sugar cane when ever there is good water. As sugar cane is the only cash crop which provides assured minimu support price unlike any other crops.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b1b44f79855b76d57038c5e,GST Council puts up sugar cess for review,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//business/india-business/sugar-cess-put-up-for-review/articleshow/64036460.cms,2018-05-05,"NEW DELHI: Protest by some states, including Kerala, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh , prompted the GST Council to order a review of the plan to levy a cess on sugar to help sugarcane growers as they complained that the move would only benefit Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and poll-bound Karnataka, while discarding the basic principle of the new regime that focused on removing all additional levies. The cess would have helped government raise Rs 6,700 crore.During discussions on the cess, which stretched for over two hours, these states, with support from Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Pondicherry, argued that imposition of a cess on sugar will also make other states such as Kerala, West Bengal and Punjab demand a similar benefit for rubber, jute and foodgrains. There will be no end and will defeat the very purpose of GST, said a source, adding that some of the finance ministry officials were also sympathetic to this argument. While introducing GST, the Centre and the states decided to abolish all cesses and surcharges other than compensation cess (covering luxury and sin goods) for a period of five years.FM Arun Jaitley said after the meeting that cane growers were in deep distress as the cost of sugar production is over Rs 35 per kg, while the market price of sugar is around Rs 26-28 a kg. The cess on sugar was proposed to raise money to compensate farmers for a loss due to surplus production.The states opposing the cess suggested that UP and Maharashtra, which are grappling with the problem, should provide budgetary support as the move is only going to benefit sugar mills in their jurisdictions, although the cess will be paid by consumers across the country to help farmers.A panel under Assam finance minister Himanta Biswa Sarma , along with ministers from UP, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, will deal with issue of levy of cess on sugar and reduction of GST on ethanol and is expected to submit its report in a fortnight.Jaitley said that the discussions have thrown up several new aspects. How are such contingencies to be addressed in the GST regime, are they to be addressed by imposition of cess or are they to be addressed by temporarily increasing the tax or by some alternative method of revenue raising?The ministerial panel would make a recommendation to the council on the avenues to raise revenue to meet contingencies of this kind where the cost of commodity is much higher than its selling price."

The solution to the sugar mess is simple: The Centre and states should stop fixing cane prices, besides reserving areas for mills.With cane payment dues to farmers by sugar mills touching Rs 20,000 crore, and hardly a year to go for the general election, the Narendra Modi government is understandably in a bind. Not for nothing, the last week saw the Union cabinet approve financial assistance of Rs 5.50 for every quintal of cane crushed during the 2017-18 sugar season (October-September), to enable mills discharge arrears to growers against the fair and remunerative price (FRP) payable to them. The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, too, meet to discuss the levy of a special Rs 3-per-kg cess on sugar (whose proceeds would go to pay cane farmers) and lowering the 18 per cent rate on ethanol (produced by distilleries attached to mills).These moves dont address the root of the problem, which has to do with the political fixation of cane prices. It leads to farmers planting more area and mills producing excess sugar, causing its prices to crash  as they have, from Rs 36-37 to Rs 26.27 a kg, in the last six months. The resultant build-up of cane arrears, then, induces farmers to plant less. When that happens and sugar prices soar, governments intervene, this time in so-called consumer interest  by banning exports, allowing duty-free imports, imposing stock controls on traders and taking away the freedom of mills to decide when and how much quantity to sell at what rate. We have, indeed, seen all these measures  from pro-consumer to pro-producer  within the last two years. They are ineffective, at best, and market-distortive, at worst. The latest Rs 5.50-per-quintal assistance will barely cover the gap between the all-India average FRP of around Rs 287 and the Rs 215-220/quintal cane price that mills can afford to pay at current sugar realisations. The gap will be even more vis--vis the Rs 315-325/quintal price advised by states such as Uttar Pradesh. The proposed Rs 3/kg cess on sugar, over and above the GST rate, is a terrible idea. It will spur similar demands  on cloth for supporting cotton farmers, on tyres for rubber growers, and so on  while defeating GSTs goal of abolishing cascading of taxes.The solution to the sugar mess is simple: The Centre and states should stop fixing cane prices, besides reserving areas for mills. Once farmers have freedom to sell to mills of their choice, the latter would be forced to enter into contract cultivation arrangements and pay well to ensure uninterrupted cane supplies. Simultaneously, all controls on movement of molasses must go and baggase-based power plants be given the same incentives as those for solar, wind and other renewable sources. This is also the right time to make 10 per cent ethanol blending of petrol mandatory.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

However, Mayawati had claimed that the sale order for the sugar mills was issued by Siddiqui, who was later ousted from the party.The Yogi Adityanath government referred the alleged scam to the CBI on April 12, and asked the agency to look into the entire sale proceedings of 21 sugar mills, including use of bogus companies and documents in the purchase of seven closed mills in Deoria, Bareilly, Laxmiganj, Hardoi, Ramkola, Chittauni and Barabanki.In its notification, accessed exclusively by TOI, the Yogi government sought a CBI probe as the culprits could be from outside the state. Uttar Pradeshs principal secretary (home) Arvind Kumar told TOI, There were certain discrepancies in the sale of around 21 sugar mills, which were auctioned. The probe has been handed over to CBI.Sources told TOI that CBI has already started reviewing documents related to the sale and FIRs could be registered very soon. The agency will look into the role of politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen involved in the scam. The UP government has shared with the CBI an FIR registered at Gomti Nagar police station in November 2017 against two companies which bought mills  Namrata Marketing Pvt Ltd and Girasho Company Pvt Ltd, which sources said were bogus, and the enquiry report of the state government.The sale of sugar mills at dirt cheap prices was flagged by the Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) as well.It is alleged that the then Mayawati government had sold the 21 mills, of which 10 were operational, at rates much lower than the market price. Besides machinery, these mills were built over 500 hectares worth Rs 2,000 crore according to present day rates.The Mulayam Singh Yadav government, in 2004-05, had tried to sell 24 state-owned sugar mills but the move was stalled due to an intervention by the high court.The Akhilesh Yadav government didnt take any action in the scam between 2012 and 2017 despite a CAG report. Adityanath, immediately after coming to power, had said he would probe the matter as nobody can be allowed to sell such government properties at dirt cheap rates as the property belonged to the people."

The Samajwadi Party is not only raising questions, but also telling other opposition parties that the government is continuously engaged in fake encounters,"" the SP chief told reporters here.He demanded that the government should at least provide a list of criminals carrying reward on their head to substantiate its claim that those killed by the police were highly notorious, he said.Yadav demanded Rs 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of Narendra Gujjar, against whom, he said, a ""fake cow slaughter case"" was registered, and claimed that Gujjar was tortured to death in custody by the police in Meerut.""It is the duty of the government to see that everyone gets justice. Has the situation worsened to that extent where no one can plead for justice? Will the BJP now deprive the people of the state of justice?"" he posed.As many as 50 dreaded criminals have been killed in over 1,400 encounters in the past over one year in the state, while 3,435 history-sheeters were put behind bars following encounters.Yadav also referred to the death of the father of Unnao rape survivor in police custody.""The BJP says that we used to give Rs 50 lakh compensation when a Muslim died. Today, when a Hindu has died, why are you (the BJP) is not helping the Hindu. We do not believe in taking advantage by creating a rift between Hindus and Muslims. This is just a diversionary tactic,"" the SP leader said.He also blamed the UP police for the unrest in Aligarh Muslim University. ""If the government had wanted, then the situation would not have worsened,"" Akhilesh said.On reports of CBI probe into the sale of sugar mills during Mayawati regime, he said the investigation was being done keeping the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in mind.Attacking the BJP in the context of Kairana and Noorpur bypolls, he said, ""These people have been saying that if other parties win the bypolls, then Diwali will be celebrated in Pakistan. I never went to Pakistan, nor do I have a Pakistani visa. The BJP should tell who went to Pakistan discreetly.""Yadav contested the government's claim that it was taking care of sugarcane growers in the stateHe also demanded that the government should provide Rs 10 lakh assistance to families of Sitapur dog-bite victims. A total of 12 children have fallen prey to dog attacks so far.Referring to the investors' summit in UP and the follow-up visit to the US by senior UP minister Sidharthnath Singh, the former chief minister said, ""The companies with which the UP government has inked MoUs, do not have any balance sheet.

Multiple bidders had common directors, common shareholders, common addresses, common email IDs and phone numbers, but these glaring facts were ignored. These interlinked companies had formed powerful cartel to buy 21 sugar mills at a dirt cheap price, the report, tabled in assembly during the previous SP rule, adds.Despite a laid down procedure and a method to scrutinize bid documents, top IAS officers of chief secretary and principal secretary ranks didnt follow it and allowed the private bidders to literally walk away with sugar mills, the report says.In a disparaging remark, it adds: ""There was a lack of competition which affected the realization of fair value of sugar mills. In respect of these mills only Rs 166.85 core could be realised against expected price of Rs 291 crore. This resulted in short realization of Rs 124.70 crore.""""IAS officers in various committees formed for the disinvestment of the sugar mills of UP State Sugar Corporation Ltd (UPSSCL) and Uttar Pradesh Rajya Chini Avam Ganna Vikas Nigam Limited (UPRCGVN) wilfully chose to overlook even the net worth of bidders. The core group of secretaries for disinvestment (CGD) did not look into the fact that after purchasing the sugar mills how some of the companies would fund it as their net worth was far below the cost of the sugar mill they were bidding for. It seems a good number of bidders were proxy for other major groups to take away the sugar mills, on paper for themselves, but in reality for their masters,"" the report says.The report highlights on page 34 (para 5.2) that two firms which bid for the mills had the same address of New Friends Colony in Delhi mentioned on bid documents. Not only this, even the demand draft of Rs 50,000 attached with the bid documents were issued by the same bank on July 16, 2009 and bore the consecutive serial numbers - 528450 and 528451. The bid documents of these two firms also had consecutive serial number - 119636 and 119637 - of bank guarantee forms issues by the same bank on the same date.When the state government replied to the CAG that there was no opportunity to know about bank guarantee at the time of evaluation of bids, the CAG refused to accept the excuses of the government stating everything was available on the records of the companies.Not only the bank drafts, bank guarantees, directors and the share holders were common, the CAG investigation found even the common address, phone numbers, e-mail ID and correspondence address of Sarita Vihar , New Delhi, mentioned by two bidders in their EOI cum RFQ and financial bid was same. Besides, address and the phone number mentioned on the letter head of one bidder was the same as the work unit of another bidder.The CAG report highlights that in contravention to these guidelines of disinvestment, certificates depicting the paying capacity of the applications were not demanded by the management form the bidders. Two firms made payments which far exceeded their net worth but the management made no effort to satisfy itself about the source of funds of buyers and ensure fairness in bidding process to rule out its participation as a proxy of other bidders.Three bidders though did not meet the net worth criteria fixed on June 18, 2010 remained in the fray and purchased one, four and three mills respectively. Thus these bidders were unduly favoured by reducing the net worth criteria further to Rs two crore in July 2010,"" the report says."

That is roughly the same proportion of the sanctioned money utilised the same time last year. Amid complaints that the governments marquee Ganga-cleaning exercise was dawdling, Union Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari had promised, in October 2017, a visible change in the Ganga water quality by 2019. At that time, only Rs. 2,901 crore  or 17% of the sanctioned Rs. 16,000 crore  had been spent.A financial account from the NCGM says that as of March 2018, Rs. 20,601 crore had been sanctioned for 193 projects. So far, only Rs. 4,254 crore had actually been spent on their implementation. Figures for April are not immediately available.Sewage infrastructureAbout half the money, or Rs. 2,814 crore, had been spent on establishing sewage infrastructure. Only 24 of the 65 entry-level projects  meant for cleaning the ghats and establishing new ones and cleaning the river front and the river surface  had been completed. They had been allotted Rs. 492 crore.Ministry officials said that while delays characterised several major projects, there had been an uptick in the tenders being awarded in the last few months. Because of this, several of these projects would be rapidly completed in the year ahead.About 12,000 MLD of sewage is emptied into the Ganga across 11 States, from Uttarakhand to West Bengal. At present, the capacity for sewage treatment is just 4,000 MLD; of this, 1,000 MLD is functional.Coursing 2,500 km, the Ganga is the longest river within Indias borders. Its basin constitutes 26% of the countrys land mass (8,61,404 sq. km.) and supports 43% of its population. Even as the basin spreads across 11 States, five are located along the rivers main stem: Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and West Bengal. Much of its pollution load  chemical effluents, sewage, dead bodies, and excreta  comes from these States. Though the industrial pollution, volume-wise, accounts for about 20%, its toxic and non-biodegradable nature has a disproportionate impact. The industrial pollutants largely emanate from tanneries in Kanpur and distilleries, paper mills and sugar mills in the Kosi, Ramganga and Kali river catchments. The municipal sewage, at a billion litres a day, accounts for 80% of the pollution load."

Union Water Resources Minister Nitin Gadkari Thursday said that the governments spending this fiscal will witness a spike as more projects under the flagship Namami Gange scheme will be completed.The cleaning of the Ganga was one of the major poll promises of the BJP ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections. Gadkari said that efforts will be made to clean the river completely by December 2019.The Union Minister said that he had written to President Ram Nath Kovind requesting him to donate one-month salary to the Clean Ganga Fund (CGF)  set up by the Union government to aid efforts to rid the river of pollutants. He also plans to urge Prime Minister Narendra Modi, other ministers, MPs and MLAs, and the public to donate their one-month salary to the CGF.The Minister said that the CFG has received Rs 250 crore since it was approved by the Union Cabinet in September 2014. He added that all people should join the cause by donating whatever they can through digital transfer. Some people have donated even Rs 300 per month in the CGF. People can share Rs 500, Rs 1,000 or whatever amount, the minister said.Since 2015, the National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG), which is implementing the project, has spent only 20 per cent of the Rs 20,000 crore sanctioned by the government. 20 per cent of the amount was spent till March (2018). This year, there will be lot of expenditure as per my assessment, we will be able to spend 60 to 70 per cent of the funds, Gadkari told reporters.Under the Namami Gange programme, a total of 195 projects worth Rs. 20,959.54 crore have been sanctioned. This includes building sewage infrastructure, ghats, crematoriums and riverfront development, river surface cleaning, institutional development, rural sanitation, officials said. The Minister claimed that of the total 1,109 industry units grossly polluting the river, 358 units have been closed down. These include distilleries, sugar factories, paper mills and tanneries, he said.But it is not 100 per cent as yet I have only claimed that we will try to ensure improvement in the rivers water quality by 70 to 80 per cent till March 2019, Gadkari said.Union Minister for Drinking Water and Sanitation Uma Bharti said that all the 1,662 gram panchayats and 4,465 villages in the five basin states  Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal  have become open defecation free (ODF).

The Samajwadi Party is not only raising questions, but also telling other opposition parties that the government is continuously engaged in fake encounters, the SP chief told reporters here.He demanded that the government should at least provide a list of criminals carrying reward on their head to substantiate its claim that those killed by the police were highly notorious, he said.Mr. Yadav demanded Rs. 50 lakh compensation to the next of kin of Narendra Gujjar, against whom, he said, a fake cow slaughter case was registered, and claimed that he was tortured to death in custody by the Meerut police.It is the duty of the government to see that everyone gets justice. Has the situation worsened to that extent where no one can plead for justice? Will the BJP now deprive the people of justice? he posed.As many as 50 dreaded criminals have been killed in over 1,400 encounters in a little over a year in the State, while 3,435 history-sheeters were put behind bars following encounters.The former Chief Minister also referred to the death of the father of Unnao rape survivor in police custody.Creating riftThe BJP says that we used to give Rs. 50 lakh compensation when a Muslim died. Today, when a Hindu has died, why are you (the BJP) not helping the Hindu? We do not believe in taking advantage by creating rift between Hindus and Muslims. This is just a diversionary tactic, the SP leader said.He also blamed the U.P. police for the unrest in Aligarh Muslim University. If the government wanted, the situation would not have worsened, Akhilesh said.On reports of CBI probe into sale of sugar mills during Mayawati regime, he said the investigation was being done keeping the upcoming Lok Sabha polls in mind.Attacking the BJP in the context of Kairana and Noorpur bypolls, he said: These people have been saying that if other parties win the bypolls, then Diwali will be celebrated in Pakistan. I never went to Pakistan, nor do I have a Pakistani visa. The BJP should tell who went to Pakistan discreetly.Taking a jibe at Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, he said, The U.P. CM is not bothered about improving the law and order in the State. He is more bothered about the law and order of Karnataka (where he was campaigning for the Assembly elections)."

If JD(S) and BSP join hands with BJP to form a coalition government in Karnataka, the prospects of thecan run into trouble. Both SP and BSP see BJP as their arch rival.Senior SP leaders believe that Mayawati will not join the BJP-JD(S) alliance at the cost of unsettling her party in UP. ""UP is the home turf of BSP and the party's presence in the state is no match to what it can hope to gain politically as an alliance partner with JD(S) in Karnataka,"" a senior SP leader told TOI on Sunday. JD(S) has so far maintained that it will not go with any of the two national parties - BJP and Congress - to form the government in Karnataka. Reports say Congress may try to win over JD (S) by pushing for a Dalit CM if the two parties have to come together to form a coalition government.Analysts, however, don't rule out the possibility of Mayawati, under CBI lens for alleged irregularities in sale of sugar mills when she was UP CM, joining the BJP-JD (S) coalition government in Karnataka. In 2002, Mayawati became CM along with seven BJP MLAs as members of her cabinet. But things have changed since then.SP MLC Udaiveer Singh, one of the architects of the SP-BSP pact for Gorakhpur and Phulpur bypolls, said: ""BSP has to take a call in Karnataka.

The state government has ordered mills to continue taking sugarcane from farmers till the crop lasts. The sugar production this year is estimated to cross 120 lakh tonnes, highest ever in the state and in the country as well.With mills having to pay Rs 337 per quintal, highest price for cane in the country, to the farmers, the have risen to a high of over Rs 11,000 crore.We have been running from pillar to post to get some help and respite from this enveloping crisis. We knocked at the office of chief minister for an audience, but the CM was in Karnataka , chairman of a sugar mill in west UP and member of Uttar Pradesh Sugar Mills Association (UPSMA), told TOI on the condition of anonymity.This is first time when dues of cane-growers have risen to over Rs 11,000 crore in the recent past. It requires immediate government intervention to resolve the crisis, failing which the sugar industry might collapse, said a special secretary-rank officer in sugar department.The sugar mills, under the banner of UPSMA, are planning to submit a written memorandum to the government stating that they would have to shut down their units if the situation continues.Farmers in west UP have started protesting over delay in cane payments.All efforts to contact sugar minister Suresh Rana proved fruitless as he was in Kairana for the bypoll campaigning.Principal secretary, sugar, Sanjay Bhoosreddy , however, played down the claims of sugar millers and said that they were just trying to mount pressure on the government so that they could delaying payment to cane farmers which the government would not let happen.Bhoosreddy said that everyone knows that cane and sugar production has been high this year and that sugar prices would rise once the crushing season gets over."

The underpayment by private sugar mills is another story altogether, said N. Palanichamy, State president of the association.The association said that, of the Rs. 212 crore, the National Cooperative Sugar Mills in Alanganallur alone owed up to Rs. 20 crore. While the State government did not even bother to announce the State Advised Price (SAP) for this season, the mill has not even managed to pay the Central governments Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP) of Rs. 2,550 to all the farmers, Mr. Palanichamy alleged.According to the association, the pending dues included payment of share from the profits for the year 2009, which has not been done despite an order by the Madras High Court.When we staged a protest in front of the Chief Ministers house in March, we were assured that the pending amount will be paid in 20 days. However, nothing has happened since then, he said.The protesters also raised strong objections to the introduction of revenue sharing formula as per recommendations of the Rangarajan Committee, which according to them will bring down the remuneration they get by at least Rs. 300 per tonne.Arguing that the State government had chosen to do away with the SAP and instead opted for revenue sharing formula, the association said that the formula had not been accepted even in the Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled States of Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat.Stating that the option of sharing 70% of the sold value of sugar, molasses and other products with farmers as per the revenue sharing formula would end up benefiting the mill owners and affecting the farmers, the protesters demanded immediate withdrawal of the announcement. Instead, the government must announce an SAP of Rs. 4,000 for 2017-18, Mr. Palanichamy said."

(Photo: Praveen Khanna) Sugarcane farmers outside a sugar mill in Shamli in Uttar Pradesh. (Photo: Praveen Khanna)Uth gaya ganna, dab gaya Jinnah (Sugarcane has displaced Muhammad Ali Jinnah), says Jitender Hooda as he interprets the upcoming bypoll to the Kairana Lok Sabha constituency.For this 48-bigha (8.1 acres) farmer from Kheri Bairagi village of Shamli district and tehsil, the main issue in the election scheduled on May 28  necessitated by the death of BJP Member of Parliament Hukum Singh  is sugarcane.Kairana constituency has six sugar mills: four private (the Shamli factory of Sir Shadi Lal Enterprises, Rana Sugars factory in Unn, Bajaj Hindusthans in Thana Bhawan and Uttam Sugars in Shermau) and two cooperative (in Sarsawa and Nanauta).In the current 2017-18 season (October-September), the six mills have, as on May 18, bought sugarcane worth Rs 1,778.49 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315-325 per quintal. Of this, they were to pay Rs 1,695.25 crore within 14 days of purchase, but have so far disbursed just Rs 888.03 crore. That translates into Rs 807.22 crore in arrears  for a single constituency.How does it matter whether or not Aligarh Muslim University has a photo of Pakistans founder? Our only concern today is cane payment, says Hooda, who supplies to the Shamli factory, which alone has cane dues of Rs 190.33 crore. The other five mills, too, have sizable arrears: Unn (Rs 182.84 crore), Thana Bhawan (Rs 182.80 crore), Nanauta (Rs 115.66 crore), Shermau (Rs 80.79 crore) and Sarsawa (Rs 54.79 crore).Brahm Pal Singh, who grows sugarcane on 34 out of his 45-bigha holding in Laprana village of Shamlis Unn tehsil, is more direct. Their (BJP) manifesto stated that we will get full payment for our cane within 14 days of sale. The Minister for Sugarcane Development Suresh Rana is himself the MLA (member of legislative assembly) from Thana Bhawan. Yet, there been no payment after December 31 and this government is even allowing sugar imports from Pakistan, he alleges (the Commerce Ministry has clarified that only 13,110 tonnes was imported in 2017-18 and another 1,908 tonnes in the current fiscal till May 14).In the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, Hukum Singh garnered 50.54 per cent of the votes cast in Kairana. In the 2017 state elections, his partys vote share fell to 38.24 per cent, but it won four out of the constituencys five Assembly segments (Shamli, Thana Bhawan, Gangoh and Nakur) and lost only one (Kairana).This time, the BJPs candidate (Hukum Singhs daughter Mriganka) is up against a united Opposition, freshly emboldened by its success in preventing the saffron party from forming a government in Karnataka. Taking on Mriganka is Begum Tabassum Hasan, whose son Nahid is the Samajwadi Party MLA from Kairana. She is fighting on the ticket of Chaudhary Ajit Singhs Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which has a base mainly amongst the Jat peasant community.Religion is secondary. For us, she is the RLD candidate and we are all voting for Chaudhary saab, declares Yashpal Malik, a 40-bigha farmer from Lak. This village in Shamli tehsil has around 8,600 voters, of whom an estimated 6,600 are Jats who own 98 per cent of its 27,000-odd bigha farmland. Earlier, we had 1,450 Muslim voters, but they all left after the 2013 Muzaffarnagar and Shamli riots. Their going has affected us because they used for work for us as raj mistri (mason), badhai (carpenter), painters and also farm labourers. They lost lives, while many of our young boys were embroiled in false cases, he adds.Malik has supplied about 2,200 quintals of cane to the Shamli mill this season and received hardly a quarter of the Rs 7.15 lakh due to him at the SAP of Rs 325/quintal for early-maturing varieties.Recreating RLDs old Jat-Muslim alliance is what Ajit Singh, too, is attempting. Today, forget getting payments, you are actually having to beg mills to lift your cane. This is because they divided you on communal lines and your own party has not a single MP or MLA. You have a chance to vote again as farmers and not bother about the religion or caste of your candidate, he says at a rally in Shamlis Lisad village, where Jats constitute three-fourths of its 12,000-plus voters. This village also saw a dozen Muslims being killed in the 2013 violence, besides migration of all the communitys 2,000-2,100 voters.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which includes an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. That, plus 2.5 lakh Dalits (mostly Jatavs, who traditionally vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party), makes for a formidable combination on paper favouring the RLD candidate. The other main community-wise voters are Kashyap (2 lakh), Gujjar (1.4 lakh) and Saini (1.2 lakh), in addition to Brahmins, Banias and Rajputs, who have all strongly backed the BJP in recent elections.Rana, UPs sugarcane minister, concedes that payments to farmers are an issue. However, he blames it on ex-factory sugar prices crashing from Rs 36-37 to Rs 26-27 per kg in the last seven months. This isnt the first time we are having the problem of cane dues from over-production. But unlike in the past, when you had to burn the cane in your fields or dump it in canals, we will ensure that mills will run till the last stick is crushed, he promises farmers at Kela Shikarpur village in Thana Bhawan block.UP mills are likely to end up crushing over 1,100 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane this season, as against 827.16 lt in 2016-17 and 645.66 lt in 2015-16. As on May 18, they had procured cane valued at Rs 34,518.57 crore, of which Rs 33,375.79 crore was payable within the stipulated 14-day period. They have paid Rs 21,151.56 crore so far, leaving arrears of Rs 12,224.23 crore.Yes, there are cane dues, but our mills have already paid more than what they did in the entire 2015-16 season. We are doing everything possible to expeditiously clear the arrears, Rana tells The Indian Express.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It is being done for the welfare of the farmers. If they are happy the State will prosper, said the Chief Minister.The sugar mills in the State are yet to pay over Rs. 12,000 crore to the farmers for the cane they had bought in the beginning of the crushing season.After speaking at length on issues related to farmers, Mr. Adityanath slammed former CM Akhilesh Yadav for the 2013 Muzaffarnagar riots. Akhilesh Yadav can lend his candidate to other parties (RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan) but he cant come to Kairana to campaign because he has blood on his hands of the innocents killed in the Muzaffarnagar riots, he said."

(Praveen Khanna) All costs considered, cane cultivation promises a net return of Rs 7,500 per bigha, which is 62.5% more than the production cost. (Praveen Khanna)Why are farmers growing sugarcane, even as arrears payable to them by mills in the current 2017-18 season has crossed Rs 23,000 crore? The answer is simple: It is one of the few crops today thats still profitable to grow. The Indian Express spoke to a cross-section of farmers in Shamli district of western Uttar Pradesh (UP), to get a reasonable idea of what it costs to cultivate sugarcane on one bigha and the corresponding returns based on the price and yield of the crop from that area (5.9 bigha make an acre).The seed requirement for cane is generally pegged at 5 quintals per bigha. At the UP governments current state advised price (SAP) of Rs 325/quintal, the cost of the crop planted as seed comes to Rs 1,625. Field preparation and sowing expenses are around Rs 700 per bigha each. Spending on nirai and gudai (weeding and hoeing) is another Rs 1,500 per bigha.Coming to fertilisers, farmers typically apply 15 kg of di-ammonium phosphate (costing Rs 350), 50 kg urea (Rs 327), 10 kg muriate of potash (Rs 120), one kg sulphur (Rs 100), one kg zinc (Rs 100) and 2 kg Zyme (a plant growth regulator; Rs 100) per bigha. Crop protection chemical costs are even more: Rs 720 for 60 ml of Coragen (used against early shoot borer and top borer insect pests), Rs 250 for 20 mg of Dantotsu (to control white grub and termites), Rs 300 for 6g of Sempra (a weedicide), Rs 100 for 200g of Bavistin (a fungicide) and Rs 50 for 6g of Strepto-Plus (an anti-bacterial).Nutrients and chemicals together, thus, add up to over Rs 2,500 per bigha. The next item is water. Farmers give 15 irrigations on an average for sugarcane, costing Rs 50 each or Rs 750 per bigha (this is using electricity; pumping with diesel gen-sets will be five times more expensive). They also spend about Rs 1,000 on bandhai or tying and propping up the cane plants to prevent lodging after they have grown beyond five feet (this is done 3-4 times, each costing Rs 300-350).Finally, there is harvesting and transport. Labourers now charge Rs 40 or so for harvesting every quintal of cane, while loading and transport to the nearest purchase centre cost an additional Rs 10 per quintal. The average yield per bigha in Shamli is 50 quintals for CoJ-67, an old general variety, and 60 quintals for Co-0238, an early-maturing cane that has gained popularity in the last 3-4 years.All in all, the cultivation cost of sugarcane on a bigha yielding 60 quintals works out to roughly Rs 11,800 (say, Rs 12,000). On the other hand, the realisation from this crop, at the SAP of Rs 325/quintal for early varieties, would be Rs 19,500. It translates into a net return of Rs 7,500 per bigha, which is 62.5 per cent more than the production cost.We will not get this from any other crop. In basmati paddy or potato, theres too much of price uncertainty, while the government hardly procures any wheat here. Moreover, the agola (green top leaves) from sugarcane takes care of the fodder needs of our animals during the crushing season from November to April, says Ashok Malik, who farms cane on 20 out of his 30-bigha holding in Karoda Hathi village in Shamli tehsil.But there is a catch. The above costs dont take into account interest on working capital, which would be even more in a scenario of delayed payments. Factories are supposed to pay farmers the SAP on cane within 14 days of purchase, but Malik hasnt received money for even half of the 1,200 quintals he has supplied to the Upper Doab Sugar Mill in Shamli this season.Further, its not just what we spend from our pockets. There is also the imputed value of family labour, rent on owned land and interest on our capital assets. The Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50 per cent return after factoring in all these costs. After all, dont we have other expenses as well, including on quality education for our children and healthcare?, points out Jitender Hooda, a farmer from Shamlis Kheri Bairagi village, who cultivates sugarcane on 40 out of his 48-bigha land.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Your vote will send out a message to the entire country. It will point to what might happen in 2019, he said in the run up to Kairana bypollBarely 40 kilometers away, in Jat-dominated Bhainswal village, Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) leader Jayant Choudhury loudly declares to his supporters: This is not a by-election. This is a big fight.Shamli lies at the heart of Kairana Lok Sabha constituency that votes Monday in a by-election necessitated by the death of its member of parliament (MP), Hukum Dev Singh of the BJP. In 2014, Singh won this seat in western Uttar Pradesh by a huge margin in a bitterly polarised contest following unprecedented communal riots in the region.Four years on, the BJP is struggling to defend Kairana against a united opposition. Its candidate, Hukum Dev Singhs daughter Mriganka, is up against the formidable Tabassum Hasan, who is contesting on an RLD ticket and has the support of the Samajwadi Party (SP), the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and the Congress party as well.The stakes have increased for the BJP in Kairana following the defeat of its candidates to those of the SP, supported by the BSP, in by-elections to the Lok Sabha from Gorakhpur and Phulpur in March.The contest in Kairana is, doubtless, a crucial test of opposition unity. The tone and tenor of the campaign in the constituency also makes it a microcosm of the social issues and economic concerns that may potentially define the general elections of 2019.Take, for instance, the decision to field Tabassum as the opposition candidate. The social arithmetic is compelling. Kairana has about 1.6 million voters, of which an estimated 960,000 (60%) make up the new social alliance the opposition has stitched up  5,40,000 Muslims (33%), 2,80,000 Dalits (18%) and 1,40,000 Jats (9%), according to data available with political parties on both sides.The BJP is leaning on upper caste groupings, that account for about 2,80,000 voters (18%) with other non-Jat backward castes adding up to 3,60,000 (22 %). The BJP also hopes to chip away at some of the Jat and Dalit votes  especially the non-Jatavs who lack an affinity for Mayawatis BSP.The oppositions challenge is to keep its flock together while the BJP sees a chance only if it gets most of its core supporters to show up to vote. Simply put, Kairana is telling us that new social alliances are being forged. The equations of 2014 and 2017 might no longer hold.Also read: How will a BSP-SP alliance shape up? Key LS bypoll in Kairana may hold the keyTowards a new unityA split opposition and the unwavering support of the Jats helped the BJP score a spectacular sweep of western UP in the 2014 general elections that continued into the 2017 assembly polls as well. The BJP won four of Kairanas five assembly seats.But once the dust of the 2017 polls settled, the Jats seem to have suddenly found themselves confronting a new political reality they had perhaps not bargained for. The natural party of the Jats, so to speak, has for long been the RLD, which is now facing political extinction, having failed to even get either a single MP or an MLA elected.I will not say this is your last chance to resurrect your honour, but I will say that this is not the last time there will be attempts to undermine the Jat community, Brahm Singh Baliyan, a local RLD leader, tells the voters of Bhainswal.Complaints against the current regime resonate among the community. Jat leaders and village elders, in particular, are the most vocal. At election meetings, they allege that the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi had told the Supreme Court in an affidavit that it cannot pay farmers one-and-a-half times the cost of their produce.If that is not anti-farmer enough, they say, there is the Yogi Adityanath government in the state has almost doubled the cost of the electricity farmers use. No one, they bemoan, seems to be taking the Jat community seriously because it has lost its political clout.It is a fight to save the legacy of Chaudhury Charan Singh, says RLD spokesman Sunil Rohta, referring to the late Jat leader who became Indias prime minister in 1979 for about six months. Rohta says the fear of becoming politically irrelevant is bringing the Jats back to the RLDs fold.The Jats would have loved to see one of theirs contest Kairana, but they are willing to rally behind an outsider because they want to save the party symbol, says another RLD leader. They are voting for the handpump (RLDs election sysmbol). It doesnt matter who the candidate is.Tabassum Hasan was with the SP until a month ago and switched to the RLD after SP chief Akhilesh Yadav agreed to make RLD the contender for Kairana. Prior to joining the SP, she was elected MP from Kairana in 2009 on a BSP ticket.BJPs man in-charge of the elections in Kairana, Sanjeev Balyan, concedes that the Jats will mostly go with the RLD, which is why his strategy has been largely confined to mobilising voters from the upper caste and non-Jat other backward classes (OBCs) to turn up on the day of polling.Thus far, Balyan has refrained from holding large rallies. Instead, he has been holding street corner meetings, at which he often highlights an improvement in the law and order situation, the governments efforts to build roads, schools and hospitals and the danger of all these efforts being derailed if the opposition candidate wins.Back in Shamli, Nirwal is articulating a similar message. On May 28, you shall leave everything aside, come out in the open and cast your vote in support of PM Modi, he tells the crowd. If you stay home, it will not be one vote short for us, it will be one vote plus for the opposition. And if they win, everything you have dreaded will return to haunt you.But the politics of fear is not the only factor influencing the voters of Kairana. The failure of sugar mills in the region to make timely payments for cane procurement and the lack of intervention by the state government has angered farmers.Ganna, Jinnah and RanaSugarcane is Kairanas economic lifeline. The region produces more than 5 million tonnes of the crop annually. Farmers sell their produce entirely to the six mills that operate in Kairana. Mills procure sugarcane at a range of rates fixed by the government. Mill owners often tend to delay payments to farmers, especially when the market for sugar is down.This year happens to be one of those bad years; sugar prices have slumped nearly 25%. But the fallout on farmers has been more devastating.Across Uttar Pradesh, as of last week, farmers had not received more than a third of the Rs 33,376 crore that was due for payment from mill owners. It is even worse in Kairana, where farmers have yet to receive an estimated  890 crore, or 52% of the1,700-crore that was due to them.We have never seen a crisis like this. It has come to this because the government cares more for the mill owners than the farmers, says Ajay Kumar, a former MLA. In this election, they will pay a price for it.The irony is that the minister in charge of the sugarcane crop, Suresh Rana, belongs to Kairana. He was elected from the Thana Bhawan assembly segment. Rana told Hindustan Times that the payment crisis will have no impact on the vote of May 28.Few can agree with him, not even his own party colleagues. If this problem was not there, we would have won even without campaigning, says Balyan.Sugarcane growers are not the only ones taking the hit.The economy of this region revolves around sugarcane. When farmers dont get money on time, they defer their spending. The local traders have seen a slump in business. There is a cascading impact, said Ashok Choudhury, a local leader of the Samajwadi Party.The delays in payment extend up to 4-5 months in many cases, despite a new 14-day deadline set by the BJP government in the state. The anger amongst the farmers is palpable. The opposition is losing no opportunity to cash in on the mood.The latest in the string of barbs against the BJP is to mock the ruling party for obsessing over the founder of Pakistan Mohammad Ali Jinnahs portrait in Aligarh Muslim University.At the Bhainswal rally, Jayant Choudhury asks the audience: What do you care for? Ganna or Jinnah? The crowd responds: Ganna! Ganna! Some in the back rows add: We also dont want Rana, a reference to the minister in charge of sugarcane.Also read: Inside the riot machineThe bigger messageWhile the social churn ahead of the elections may have been in part driven by the sugarcane crisis and farmer distress, a wholly unexpected set of interventions are also assuming shape as Kairana readies for the poll.The riots of 2013, as is now well documented, not only drew a sharp line between the two major communities, what is less understood is that the violence and murders also unraveled an otherwise tightly interdependent ecosystem of the villages in Kairana.An overwhelming number of Muslims who fled their villages after the riots have chosen not to return. And many of them still do not want to. The blacksmith who fixed the Jat farmers equipment was often a local Muslim; the carpenter who made furniture was a Muslim, the mason who the village needed for house repairs was often a Muslim. In villages that have been deserted by Muslims, these services have now become expensive, and in some cases inaccessible. Jat farmers are feeling the absence of the Muslims economically the most, if not socially.Muslim labourers, on the other hand, rue the fact that they could no longer easily borrow cash from their Jat employers or the local Bania trader. They, more than ever dread, now dread falling short of cash.Talk of reconciliation and burying the bitter memories of the past is fairly loud and consistent. We are ready to live together, says Rajinder Malik, whose father heads the Gathwal Khap that allegedly incited the riots.Maliks village, Lishad, was one of the worst hit. All but one of its 250-odd Muslim families fled the village after 13 of their members died in the violence. As many as 102 first information reports (FIRs) were filed, involving 600-650 residents of Lishad.Although Malik maintains that the Muslims are to be blamed for the riots, he has worked to clear a third of these cases through mutual settlement. He hopes the 22 cases that are still pending in courts would be resolved soon.The surprisingly strong yearning for social peace in many villages that Hindustan Times visited suggests that polarisation is probably not sustainable in rural India, where economic interdependence requires social harmony.In a nutshell, the election in Kairana tells us that issues of economic distress and growing clarity about the need for social harmony are indicating a possible social realignment on the ground in time for the 2019 election. The mood is very different from 2014."

For Jats, an upper caste community, it is a shahi (royal) crop, which decides their status in the society, notwithstanding the arrears of mills which now run into thousands of crores.Jaipal Singh Chaudhary, a farmer with 20 bigha land in Mandawali village of Bijnor, cannot think of anything other than sugarcane despite having a debt of Rs 90,000. He sells his produce to Bilai sugar mill, which has the worst payment record in the region. Out of Rs 2.4 lakhs that the mill owes him, he has received only Rs 80,000 so far.But, despite the hardships, Singh never tried vegetable or fruit crops, which he said is not the domain of the upper caste Jats. Our forefathers have been involved in sugarcane cultivation. How can we move to any other crop? This is against our tradition. We are known by this crop, he says.Jats in western UP feel that it is below their status to abandon sugarcane crop in favour of alternative options.Anirudh Saroha, a farmer in Muzaffarnagar , says, It is a shahi (royal) crop that does not demand much attention. And, at the time of harvest, one just needs to employ cheap labour and get it harvested. Sugarcane is linked to our honour and status of our family. Even marriages are settled on the basis of how much land is under cane cultivation. We know that the payment structure is very bad, but then we cannot forego our honour because of that.When contacted, soil scientist and director (Research), Sardar Vallabh Bhai Patel University, Dr Ashok Kumar said, There is one more factor involved as to why sugarcane is favourite among a section of farmers. It is not a labour intensive crop. Rains or thundershowers have little effect on it. Then, unlike vegetables which require too much of nurturing and attention and need to be safeguarded against animals, sugarcane are less problematic. Jitender Hudda , another farmer from Thanabhawan town of Shamli, echoed similar sentiment. Market for sugarcane is easily available. There are a lot of sugar mills or collection centres. Regarding payment, sooner or later, it arrives."

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna/File) Kairana has come under the spotlight a couple of years back after local MP Hukum Singh claimed scores of Hindu families had been forced to move out of the area. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna/File)With the JD(S) and the Congress joining hands to keep the BJP out of power in Karnataka, all eyes are now on Uttar Pradesh where bypolls for the Kairana Lok Sabha seat and Noorpur assembly seat are slated to be held on May 28. The bypolls hold much importance for the ruling BJP after the recent drubbing in the Gorakhpur and Phoolpur bypolls where arch rivals Samajwadi Party tied up with the Bahujan Samaj Party to defeat the saffron party.Moreover, after a show of strength by a united Opposition during the HD Kumaraswamy swearing-in in Karnataka, the BJP must have felt the pinch, and a defeat in Kairana and Noorpur will make it obvious that regional parties together can combat the invincible BJP in the 2019 general elections. Unlike in Gorakhpur and Phulpur, the Congress has joined hands with the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party in a bid to deal another blow to the BJP in Uttar Pradesh, which has 80 Lok Sabha seats.Kairana hit the national headlines before the 2017 UP assembly elections after the local MP Hukum Singh raised the issue of Hindu exodus from the area. The bypoll in the seat has been necessitated following the death of Hukum Singh.To cash in on the sympathy wave towards Hukum Singhs family, the BJP has fielded his daughter Mriganka in Kairana. But RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan, who has the support of the BSP, SP and Congress, seemed confident too. Hasans candidature got a boost on Thursday after Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan joined the Rashtriya Lok Dal at a meeting held in Kairana in the presence of Jayant Chaudhary, the national vice-president of RLD.Now, there is no contest left in the bye-election. We are going to win with a huge margin in the range of 3-4 lakh votes, RLD chief Masood Ahmad said.On being asked about the issue of Hindu exodus, the candidates aired divergent views. The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has stopped, said Mriganka. Before the 2017 UP Assembly elections, hundreds of Hindu families had fled from Kairana out of fear and harassment. However, after the BJP government under Yogi Adityanath was formed, the law and order scenario in the region has improved, she added.Tabassum Hasan, however, outrightly rejected the reports of Hindu exodus from the area. There was no exodus from Kairana in the first place. Both Hindus and Muslims have been living here in harmony for generations. The exodus issue was flagged only to divert attention from important issues, to add a communal colour to the elections and divide voters, she said.Talking to indianexpress.com about his decision to withdraw his candidature, Hasan said, The basic reason behind my decision to withdraw is to defeat BJP. If I would have contested the election, BJP might have won. And I dont want communal forces like BJP to get stronger. Kanwar would have divided the Muslim votes, which form the major chunk of voters in Kairana, and thereby, would have weakened the united opposition candidate.Till yesterday, the BJP was in a strong position. There was a division of Muslim votes which would have taken place had I contested. And it appeared to me that BJP might win because of our internal family feud. And it would have sent a very wrong message in the entire nation. Thats why I decided to support Tabassum Hasan, said Kanwar.Mriganka, however, seems unaffected by Thursdays development and exuded confidence. The preparations are going all good and we are 100 per cent confident of winning the bypoll, she said.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which includes an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. That, plus 2.5 lakh Dalits (mostly Jatavs, who traditionally vote for the Bahujan Samaj Party (BJP), makes for a formidable combination on paper favouring the RLD candidate.The BJP candidate expressed confidence that Muslim voters will vote for development which has taken place in BJPs rule, both at the Centre and the states. BJP will get the support of Muslim voters. Definitely, a significant number of them would vote for development which is taking place in BJPs governance, be it state or Centre. And people are going to support Modi ji, Mriganka told indianexpress.com. She added that results of the Karnataka elections will not have any impact on the UP bypolls.However, it is not just the Muslim vote which the ruling BJP has to worry about. Convincing the angry sugarcane farmers remains a big concern for the ruling party. The farmers are losing patience over the delay in payment by the sugar mill owners.Kairana constituency has six sugar mills. In the current 2017-18 season (October-September), the six mills have, as on May 18, bought sugarcane worth Rs 1,778.49 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315-325 per quintal. Of this, they were to pay Rs 1,695.25 crore within 14 days of purchase but have so far disbursed just Rs 888.03 crore. That translates into Rs 807.22 crore in arrears  for a single constituency.Asked about the farmers concern, Mriganka said the situation has improved. The chief minister himself has taken a lot of interest in the issue. And he has himself addressed their grievances. And this problem arose because there was a bump in the production of sugarcane and the output was I think three times over. So, it was beyond capacity. But the payment that has been released is already more than what was happening in the previous years. And whatever payment is left, we updated it very soon. The farmers are with us, said Mriganka.(With inputs from ENS)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(File photo) Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday raised the issue of Muzaffarnagar riots and appealed to people not to give anti-social elements the opportunity to trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh. (File photo)Four days before the bypoll in Kairana Lok Sabha constituency, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath on Thursday raised the issue of Muzaffarnagar riots and appealed to people not to give anti-social elements the opportunity to trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh. Thrice in his speech, Adityanath named Jat youths Sachin and Gaurav, who were allegedly lynched in Kawaal village of Muzaffarnagar in 2013 after they accused Shahnawaz Qureshi for harassing their relative and allegedly killed him. That incident had led to a mahapanchayat meet that was followed by riots between Jats and Muslims in western Uttar Pradesh.Addressing a public meeting in Shamli in support of BJP candidate Mriganka Singh, the chief minister said, Polarisation is already done. I know. On one side, there are people who flared up riots in Muzaffarnagar and western Uttar Pradesh. Youths like Sachin and Gaurav were brutally murdered and they along with others were implicated. Then no other party spoke out. Only BJP workers raised their voice. Workers like Suresh Rana (now UP minister) and Sanjeev Balyan (former Union minister) were booked, Hukum Singh (former Kairana MP) was stopped from getting justice for people.Adityanath asked why SP and other parties were silent when Sachin and Gaurav were killed. If they get an opportunity again, they will follow the policy of appeasement and trigger riots in western Uttar Pradesh, he said, adding that riots had become an industry in western Uttar Pradesh in the past and that BJP government improved the situation.If they could, they would have stopped Kanwar yatra too, he said, adding that before kanwar yatra  the yatra passes through Shamli  last year, the administration told him about restrictions on use of microphones, conch shells and pellet drums. He said that on being asked about reason for the restrictions, the officials said some people feel bad about it. I said that if some people feel bad because of celebrations of our festivals, do we feel good with the festival celebration by others?Adityanath said his government withdrew the restrictions, and helicopters were used to keep a watch on anti-social elements and shower flowers on kanwar yatris. He said arrangements were being made to develop dedicated lanes at both sides of Gangnahar for the convenience of pilgrims. Ab nahi hoga to kab hoga (If not now, then when), he said.In an apparent reference to the controversy over a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah in Aligarh Muslim University, Adityanath said, Koi keh raha ki ganna ya Jinnah. Main keh sakta hun ki ganna hamara mudda hai lekin Jinnah ki tasvir bhi nahi lagne denge hum log (some people are chanting  sugar cane or Jinnah. I can say, sugarcane is an issue for us but we will also not allow Jinnahs portrait). The chief minister said payment of around Rs 984.88 crore has been done to farmers from sugar mills in Kairana and said he has taken responsibility to ensure payment to every farmer.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The workers of the Congress, SP and BSP have been actively involved in campaigning, says Mohammed Ahmed, a local Congress leader in Shamli, an Assembly segment of Kairana LS constituency.Local scribe Sachin Tyagi says that a success for the RLD in Kairana will certainly expedite the grand alliance in UP. An opposition victory will reflect coming together of the Dalits and Muslims, who are deciding factors in many constituencies in the western UP, Sachin told DH.A reversal, however, could derail the efforts to bring all the opposition parties on one platform, he added. Shifting of votes will be a big problem for the Opposition, Sachin said.The victory in the Monday bypoll is crucial for the RLD, which had drawn a blank in the 2014 LS polls and even its president Ajit Singh had lost in its stronghold of Jat-dominated Baghpat.Both Singh and his son Jayant Chaudhary have been toiling hard to woo the members of Jat community and the farmers.Non-payment of sugarcane arrears has also been made a big issue in the poll here by the Opposition though Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath tried to blunt the same by recommending a CBI probe into the reported irregularities in the sale of state-owned sugar mills by the then Mayawati regime."

Sugarcane farmer Udayveer Singh, who was on a dharna over non-payment of dues by sugar mills and an increase in rural power tariff, died on Saturday morning at the protest site. Singh, 58, was among the 50-odd sugarcane farmers who launched the protest on May 21.As news of Singhs death spread, the protest site swelled and hundreds of angry farmers from the sugarcane belt laid siege to the tehsil office. Leaders of Opposition parties, including the SP, RLD and Congress, rushed to the protest site.Baraut tehsil is barely 30 km from where Prime Minister Narendra Modi will, on Sunday, throw open the countrys first smart highway, which touches the western UP district of Baghpat. Initially, district authorities claimed that Singh may have suffered a cardiac arrest. Around 8 pm, nearly 10 hours after his death, the family lodged an FIR, which said Singh had suffered an unnatural death.At the protest site, Chaudhary Surender Singh, one of the leaders of the agitating farmers, said, Power bill has been raised to around Rs 1,600 every two months. Our dues have been mounting by the day. There are farms where the sugarcane has not even been harvested. The farmers are facing a crisis situation.The protesting farmers said that while the BJP had promised to clear their dues within 14 days of coming to power in the state, it instead raised the power tariff, aggravating the crisis for farmers such as Singh, who owned eight bighas in the nearby Jeewana village.The government hiked power tariff twice in the last five months. Sugar mills have closed. They are importing sugar from abroad. It is a grave issue. (Singh) sacrificed his life fighting for the interest of others, he is a martyr, RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary said.Chaudhary also pitched for Opposition unity, saying if parties can reach electoral understandings, they should make common cause with farmers as well.In neighbouring Kairana, where sugarcane dues have emerged as the biggest issue in the upcoming bypoll, the Opposition candidate is contesting on an RLD symbol.We will soon release last years dues. A proposal has been sent to the state headquarters. On tariff, we have promised farmers that a meeting will be arranged with the western UP power authority. We can only execute the policies framed by the government, SDM Arvind Kumar Dwivedi told The Sunday Express.Dwivedi said the current charge of using tubewells was Rs 180 for 1 Horse Power machine. The mills are supposed to pay around Rs 290 per quintal to the farmers, he said.In Jeewana, Singhs family members  his wife and three sons, the youngest in Class 10  huddled in the courtyard, waiting for his body to be brought.Baghpat ADM Lokpal Singh, who reached the spot around 6 pm, initially announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for Singhs family and later raised it to Rs 12 lakh.I will write to the government recommending that the compensation be enhanced to Rs 50 lakh as is being demanded by the farmers and the family, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Jaiswal is the minister in charge of Shamli district, while Surya Pratap Shahi is the minister in charge of Saharanpur.""Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary has been roped in since he hails from a farming background,"" a senior UP BJP leader said.BJP MPs Sanjiv Baliyan, Raghav Lakhan Pal, Vijay Pal Singh Tomar and Kanta Kardam have also actively campaigned for Mriganka Singh.The SP and Congress, however, termed the line-up of UP ministers as a sign of ""party jitters"".According to the locals, the major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers.RLD candidate Tabassum Hasan had accused the BJP-led state government of resorting to divisive politics.""Sugarcane growers in the region are feeling the maximum amount of pain, as no payments have been made to them by the state government,"" she told PTI, rejecting the official claim that the dues from sugar mills were being cleared.The issue was also raised during an election meeting of state minister Laxmi Narayan Chaudhary, who said that the dues accumulated from the time of the past governments had been paid out, and the rest would be settled soon.""In Uttar Pradesh, 10,828.59 lakh quintals of sugarcane were purchased by sugar mills from farmers during the BJP government in 2017-18, as compared to 6443.41 lakh quintals under the Samajawadi Party government in 2015-16. Similarly, Rs 21,186.56 crore payments were made during the BJP government in the state in 2017-18, in comparison to Rs 11,841.34 crore made during the SP government in 2015-16,"" BJP spokesperson Chandramohan said.Divergent views also emerged on the reported 2016 exodus of Hindu families from Kairana.""The area is adjacent to Panipat district in Haryana. The labourers (both Hindus and Muslims) from the area go to the neighbouring state to work in the industries there. They go in the morning and return in the evening,"" Hasan said while rejecting the claims of any such exodus.The RLD leader said the locked houses, even of Muslims who had gone to Panipat for work, were photographed and used as a ""propaganda"".""In Kairana, both Hindus and Muslims live in peace,"" she added.BJP candidate Mriganka Singh, on the other hand, said, ""The exodus of Hindu families from Kairana has stopped now. But hundreds of Hindu families had fled from Kairana out of fear and harassment before the 2017 UP Assembly elections"".Apart from Kairana, bypoll to Noorpur assembly constituency in the state will also be held tomorrow."

He had a loan of Rs 6 lakh and the banks had sent him a recovery notice.""Thousands of farmers from elsewhere in Baghpat and adjoining districts - from where the BJP plans to ferry crowds to Modi's rally - arrived in Baraut to join the protest, being organised under the banner of the Kisan Sangharsh Samiti.They held an impromptu "" panchayat"", attended also by khap (caste) elders and local politicians, in the evening and decided the agitation would go on till all the demands had been met.At night, 30 farmers were continuing the dharna. ""We can't let the death of one of us go in vain,"" Balroj said.Earlier, additional district magistrate Lokpal Singh met the protesters, announced Rs 12 lakh for Uday Veer's family and said he had applied to the state government to grant them another Rs 38 lakh. He said all the demands would be met.""The state government has raised electricity rates for tube-wells from Rs 100 per horsepower to Rs 150, whereas the rate is only Rs 35 per horsepower in Haryana,"" Jile Singh, a farmer leader, said.""The sugar mills in western Uttar Pradesh have refused to clear the Rs 1,000 crore worth of dues they owe the sugarcane growers anytime soon. Adityanath is ignoring farmers' interests.""Adityanath had repeatedly denied the farmers' allegation about unpaid dues over the past six months but is now trying to assuage them with assurances that few are willing to bank on.Arvind Dwivedi, subdivisional magistrate of Baraut, claimed Uday Veer ""had come from somewhere on some business and was not part of the dharna"".But Jile Singh said Uday Veer had been part of the dharna since it began and accused the administration of ""playing ugly politics against us"".On Monday, a by-election would be held also for the Noorpur Assembly seat in western Uttar Pradesh. Both at Kairana and Noorpur, the BJP is up against the combined strength of the Samajwadi Party, Rashtriya Lok Dal, Bahujan Samaj Party and the Congress."

The BJP fielded his daughter Mriganka in Kairana, while RLD nominated Tabassum Hasan, who was also supported by the BSP, SP and Congress.In Kairana, there are 12 candidates in the fray. The opposition was hoping that by consolidating the anti-BJP votes, they would be able to repeat the results of the Gorakhpur and Phulpur bye-elections, especially after Lok Dal candidate Kanwar Hasan pulled himself out of the bypoll fray and embraced the RLD (Rashtriya Lok Dal). The ruling BJP, on the other hand, would be making extra effort to retain both Kairana and Noorpur seats after todays polling.The major issues in this bypoll are law and order and the woes of sugarcane growers. The farmers in the constituency have been losing patience over the delay in payment by the sugar mill owners.The Kairana Lok Sabha seat has some 16 lakh voters, which include an estimated 5.5 lakh Muslims and 1.5 lakh Jats. That, plus 2.5 lakh Dalits (mostly Jatavs, who traditionally vote for the BSP, makes for a formidable combination on paper favouring the RLD candidate.

(Source: Twitter/ANI)EVM woes in MaharashtraBypolls for Lok Sabha seats in Maharashtras Palghar and Bhandara-Gondia constituencies were marred by large-scale malfunctioning of the electronic voting machines and Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT). Technical snags to the machines led voters to wait in long queues for hours, inviting criticism from across the political spectrum.In Palghar, 46 per cent polling was recorded while in Bhandara-Gondia it was 31 per cent.The Election Commission of India (ECI) described the reports of EVM/VVPAT malfunctioning as exaggerated. The Election Commission of India (ECI), in a statement, said, News reports surfacing in media alleging large scale failure of EVMs and VVPATs in the ongoing by-elections and interruption of polls in the states of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh are an exaggerated projection of reality.In Maharashtra, Shirish Mohod, deputy CEO and Media Incharge (Office of Chief Electoral Officer Maharashtra) said,  There have been certain cases of failure due to technical problems of EVMs and VVPATs during polling in 22 Plaghar and 11 Bhandara-Gondia parliamentary constituencies which have been replaced. These issues come up because of technical engineering problems and therefore, we keep reserve machines for replacement. Machines are replaced as and when required following a protocol.ypoll was held in Bhandara-Gondia following resignation of sitting BJP (MP) Nana Patole. He joined BJP. (Source: ANI) ypoll was held in Bhandara-Gondia following resignation of sitting BJP (MP) Nana Patole. He joined BJP. (Source: ANI)The state election commission officer said in all the places where machine problems were reported, people were given more time to exercise their francise by extending the time beyond official 5 pm.The Congress, NCP and Shiv Sena alleged that the breaking down of voting machines was a political ploy of the ruling BJP to swing the elections in their favour. They also raised questions as to why machines were procured from Gujarat.Senior NCP leader Praful Patel said, We have always warned EVM/VVPATs are being misused for the elections. If the EVMs/VVPAT are verified there should be no reason for its malfunctioning. He demanded provisions for alternative ballot papers along with EVMs/VVPATs.The NCP leader wondered why EVMs from Surat in Gujarat were used when machines were available in Maharashtra.The Maharashtra Pradesh Congress Committee president Ashok Chavan expressed serious concerns over the developments in Palghar and Bhandara-Gondia Lok Sabha by-polls.Almost 25 per cent EVM and VVPAT problems lead to hardships as voters had to stand in queue for long hours. We want repolling in all those places where machines broke down. Such instances make us suspect if ruling party was trying to manipulate the system. While dismissing the argument of the election commission about technical snag due to heat, Chavan said,  In the past elections have taken place during summer. Just a fortnight ago elections happended in Karnataka. In 2014, Lok Sabha polls were also held in peak of summer. If EVM cannot withstand summer heat, election commission should replace it with ballot paper.Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said their fears of BJP using all means to win the elections have been proved correct.Meanwhile, the BJP questioned the Opposition over why similar allegations were not raised in Karnataka where Congress formed the government along with JD(S).BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said, The opposition are raising questions on election commission which is an independent authority which is very unfortunate. They opposition should also explain if they have the same complains in Karnataka where they formed the government.The EVM/VVPAT failure is a pointer to ruling party trying to misuse the machinery to serve its own interest. The ruling party was going to polls keeping the remote and contril of EVMs/VVPAT in their hands, he observed. The Sena also demanded replacement of EVMs/VVPAT with ballot paper in elections.The bypoll in Palghar was necessitated following death of sitting BJP (MP) Chintaman Wanaga.

Now it is not 14 days but over 14 months and the dues to the farmers have only increased.When the BJP came to power, the dues were to the tune of Rs. 5,500 crore but now they are over Rs. 12,000 crore, he said.The place where Modi ji was speaking, was just a little distance from where Udayveer Singh passed away protesting against the policies of the BJP government. Why did he [the Prime Minister] not visit his family or, at least, express sympathies, Mr. Gohil asked.Only partly readyHe said the Delhi-Meerut expressway had four sections and only one of them was now ready.Even land acquisition had not taken place in the last section. It is like holding someone elses baby and claiming it as your own. As for the section inaugurated by Modi ji today [Sunday], former Finance Minister P.

(PTI)Lucknow: Prime Minister Narendra Modi's poll-eve rally and chief minister Yogi Adityanath's invocation of Muhammad Ali Jinnah couldn't save the BJP from a nearly 50,000-vote drubbing in the Kairana parliamentary by-election, which a jubilant Opposition portrayed as ""a prologue to the general election"".Rashtriya Lok Dal nominee Tabassum Hasan, who had the support of the Samajwadi Party, Bahujan Samaj Party, Congress and the Aam Aadmi Party, secured 401,464 votes against BJP candidate Mriganka Singh's 352,173, prevailing by 49,291 votes.The BJP suffered a double blow, losing the Assembly by-election in nearby Noorpur too. Samajwadi candidate Naeemul Hasan, supported by the RLD, Congress and the BSP, polled 94,631 votes to the 88,420 secured by BJP nominee Awani Singh, winning by 6,211 votes.Modi, who does not campaign in by-elections, had ignored Opposition protests to hold a rally in Baghpat, barely 60km from Kairana, a day before the polling to inaugurate the Eastern Peripheral Expressway.The Election Commission had ignored Tabassum's complaint that this was virtually a poll rally that violated the model code of conduct's ban on any campaigning 48 hours before the end of polling.The day before Modi's rally, 60-year-old farmer Uday Veer Singh had died of a heatstroke some 20km from the venue while protesting against the state government over sugar mills' failure to clear farmers' dues and against the hiked power tariffs for tube-wells - both key issues at Kairana.In his speech, Modi had tried to placate the farmers saying his government was serious about addressing their issues.The previous week, Adityanath had played on the rhyme between "" ganna"" (sugarcane) and ""Jinnah"" to say: ""Sugarcane is our priority but we won't allow anybody to hang Jinnah's picture.""It now appears that his assurance on ganna did nothing to assuage Kairana's 1.5 lakh sugarcane farmers and his bid to drag Jinnah into the campaign, seen as an attempt to polarise the voters, paid no dividends, either.RLD vice-president Jayant Chaudhary said: ""The Prime Minister failed to influence the by-election although he went out of his way to hold a rally in Baghpat. I also want to say that the ganna won even though the BJP (tried to stoke) anti-Jinnah sentiments. We hope our alliance will continue.""Senior Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Samajwadi chief Akhilesh Yadav and BSP boss Mayawati didn't campaign in the by-elections.Akhilesh jeered at Adityanath on Thursday. ""I was terrorised hearing the chief minister's statement and couldn't muster the courage to campaign in the by-elections,"" he told a news conference, implying Adityanath was looking to stoke sectarian violence.He added: ""It is the defeat of the government, which cheated the farmers and tried to divide society on communal lines. This is the beginning of the BJP's final exit.""Naeemul, the victorious Noorpur candidate, said Modi and Adityanath had lost both communities as the Muslims felt ""isolated"" and the Hindus felt ""cheated"".""Speak on issues, what use is speaking drivel? They used to say there was no alternative to them, God has brought the alternative before us.... We'll make them bite the dust next year,"" Tabassum said.Om Prakash Rajbhar, backward class welfare minister in Adityanath's government and president of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party, outlined the danger that Opposition unity posed to the NDA.""There are nine lakh voters of the RLD, Samajwadis, BSP and the Congress and seven lakh of the BJP. Obviously we had to lose,"" he said.""I hope the government soon implements a sub-quota within the OBC quota to prevent the most backward castes from going over to the rival camp.""Deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma put a brave face on the twin defeats. ""Caste politics and local issues dominated the by-elections, but there will be national issues in the general election, and we shall repeat the 2014 victory.""The BJP office in Lucknow wore a deserted look.

Contesting on a Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) ticket, Ms. Hasans thumping victory once again underscored the importance of the grand alliance as her candidature was supported by the Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).Ganna vs. JinnahKairana is the third straight defeat for the BJP in Lok Sabha bypolls in U.P. after Phulpur and Gorakhpur. It was being seen as a battle between ganna (sugarcane) and Jinnah.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths repeated reference to Mohammed Ali Jinnahs portrait in the Aligarh Muslim University during the campaign was seen as an attempt to polarise voters on religious lines.The Opposition, however, campaigned against the Modi governments failure to get the sugarcane farmers their dues from the various sugar mills that stood at over Rs. 12,000 crore.The Palghar Lok Sabha seat in Maharashtra brought cheer to the BJP as its candidate Rajendra Gavit defeated Shiv Senas Shrinivas Wanga by 29,572 votes.But the votes polled in favour of the BJP fell sharply from 5.33 lakh in 2014 to to 2.72 lakh in this election. In Bhandara-Gondia, the other Lok Sabha seat from the State, NCPs candidate Kukade Madhukarrao Yashwantrao, defeated the BJPs Hemant (Tanubhau) by over 48,000 votes. The Congress had supported the NCP in these elections.In Nagaland, however, BJP ally Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP)s Tokheho Yepthomi won the Nagaland parliamentary seat by a margin of over 1.5 lakh votes, trouncing C.

Ajay Nagabhushan (second from right), Commissioner of Cane and Director of Sugar, releasing the compendium of research articles status paper, in Mysuru on Friday.M.A. SRIRAMThe State government will phase out low-yielding variety of sugarcane and replace it with high-yielding ones in three years to improve productivity and help augment sugarcane farmers income.This was stated by M.N. Ajay Nagabhushan, Commissioner of Cane and Director of Sugar, here on Friday. Delivering the inaugural address of the 21st meeting of Sugarcane Research and Development Workers of Southern Karnataka, Mr. Nagabhushan said Karnataka has around 4 lakh hectares under sugarcane cultivation of which nearly 50% is under the high-yielding variety  in terms of productivity per acre and percentage of sugar recovery per tonne of sugarcane crushed. But cultivation in the remaining 2 lakh hectares is of the low-yielding variety, and this would be phased out.It will be done over three years for which the government plans to bring 2,000 hectares under the high-yielding variety this year (2018-19), 20,000 hectares in 2019-20, and the remaining in 2020-21.We are preparing the availability of seeds for the programme and the government has released Rs. 5 crore for the purpose, said Mr. Nagabhushan. When translated to revenue, this works out to an increase in farmers income by Rs. 16,000 per acre of sugarcane cultivated, he added.The scheme follows the Uttar Pradesh model where a similar programme was launched a few years ago, consequent to which the average State sugar recovery increased by 1.5% from a low of nearly 9.5%.The official also hinted at modernisation of sugar factories in the State under the cooperative sector, besides training of manpower through a separate programme to be initiated by the government. He said there were nearly 60 sugar factories in the State while 30 more were likely to come up this year. This indicated that there was scope for improvement in productivity given the capacity increase in irrigation.The two-day meeting of sugarcane research and development workers is being jointly organised by ICAR-Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, UAS-Bengaluru, and sugar industries of the region."

Its late May and the mercury is soaring, but at Malakpur, the air is thick with the smell of molasses.The sprawling plant, which in many ways epitomises farm distress from mounting cane payment dues, lies at the far end of acres of fields on the outskirts of Baraut town in western Uttar Pradeshs Baghpat district. Workers, the ones remaining after the mill has shut for the current crushing season, crowd around its unswept corners.Set up in 1998 and belonging to the Umesh Modi Group, the mill crushed 146.27 lakh quintals of sugarcane between October 24, 2017, and May 14, when it closed. This was worth Rs 459.01 crore at the UP governments State Advised Price (SAP) of Rs 315 per quintal for general varieties. While mills are required, by law, to pay the SAP amount within 14 days of cane purchase, the Malakpur factory has till date disbursed a mere Rs 32 crore. That amounts to less than 7 per cent of what is due to its 34,000-odd farmers.The Kairana bypoll result now in, Narendar Rana from Bhadal village in Baraut tehsil says that the ruling BJPs defeat is proof that farmer anger cannot be wished away.

The 58-year-old died on May 26 morning, five days after he, along with other farmers, launched an agitation at the Baraut tehsil office over the pending cane dues. While the exact cause of his death is yet to be ascertained, it made headlines simply for the timing two days before a crucial by-poll in the neighbouring Kairana parliamentary constituency. Jayant Chaudhary, the vice-president of the Rashtriya Lok Dal, whose candidate was fighting the election, rushed to pay his respects to Udayveer, whose body was displayed by the protesting farmers. Congress president Rahul Gandhi also referred to the farmers death in a tweet.On May 27, a day after Udayveer died, Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the area, addressing a rally barely 30 km from Baraut in the same Baghpat district, after inaugurating the Rs 11,000-crore Eastern Peripheral Expressway.The Kairana bypoll result now in, Narendar Rana from Bhadal village in Baraut tehsil says that the ruling BJPs defeat is proof that farmer anger cannot be wished away.

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Payment to farmers by mills is made against parchis or receipts, specifying the weight of the particular batch of cane supplied and the price payable for that quantity. Each parchi represents roughly 20 quintals or one buffalo buggi (cart) load of produce. Farmers in western UP usually describe the payments owed to them in terms of parchis. Thus, Virender Singh of Badarkha village says he hasnt been paid for 75 parchis; Jaivir Malik from Chandanheri quotes 50 unpaid receipts; Karam Veer Singh from Sanauli cites 70; and Om Prakash Singh of Barauli 12. Rakam Pal, from Sanauli, is awaiting payments on five receipts against cane from a meagre 4 bighas of land (5.9 bighas make an acre).Udayveers eldest son Prahlad says he had grown sugarcane on 12 bighas and was owed over Rs 1.8 lakh by the Malakpur mill against the 29 parchis (about 580 quintals) of cane that he had supplied this season. He had not got a single rupee from them. On top of it, my father had a loan of Rs 2.5 lakh and unpaid electricity bills. A few days before he died, my younger brother Sagar told him about the Rs 30,000 tuition fees owed to the local private school where he was studying. He said that his name may be struck off the rolls if the payment was not made immediately.While the district administration announced compensation of Rs 12 lakh for Udayveers family, Prahlad says they are yet to get the money.Prahlad worked as a driver with the courier services company Blue Dart at Delhis T3 airport terminal until his fathers death, but is now back home.

It should start paying in the next few days.But how that would take place is not clear. Dwivedi himself admits there are no easy or quick solutions.The SDM says he is also looking into the increase in power tariffs for agricultural tubewell connections effected by the Yogi administration  from Rs 100 to 180 per horsepower per month. The farmers call this steep given the average13-HP electric pumpsets used by them for irrigating their cane fields. I have promised them a meeting with the managing director of the Paschimanchal Vidyut Vitaran Nigam (the power distribution utility in the western UP region). But there is not much we can do if the hike was a decision taken at the level of the state government, he adds.Meanwhile, at the Baraut tehsil office, the farmers continue their protest, camping under a large banyan tree. The next step, they say, would be a mahapanchayat, where they would invite leaders from the RLD, SP, BSP and Congress, to force the government to act. Satyendar Singh, who owns 21 bighas in Loyan village, not far from the Malakpur mill, is owed Rs 4 lakh for the cane that he supplied in the just ended season.

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)On the morning of May 17, Harvinder Singh of Chitta Sher village in Beas, the town named after the river in Amritsar district, went to check his fields near the river. What he saw in the water scared him.For the first time, I saw the water had turned dark. I saw dead fish floating. My first thought was something really bad had happened to the river, he says.Harvinder was right. In the early hours of May 16, a security guard at the Chadha Sugar Mill in Kiri Afghana village in Gurdaspur, barely a kilometre from Beas, called up a manager to inform that the molasses stored in a tank at the mill was boiling over. The mill is located on a sand rise, and due to the gradient, it was flowing into a drain that connected with the Beas.The management of the sugar mill, owned by the wife of the late liquor baron Ponty Chadha, battled to control the spill over the next day and a half. By 2 pm on May 17, nearly 10,000 kilolitres had flowed into the drain, and from there into Punjabs most important river, affecting the network of canals that feed off the Beas and Satluj in Punjab and Rajasthan. The Harike wetland ecosystem at the confluence of the Beas and Satluj was also affected.Dead fish floated downstream and into the canals for three days after the spill. Over 3,000 cusecs of fresh water had to be released into the Beas to flush the molasses.The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has fined the mill Rs 5 crore, and ordered criminal prosecution of the management. As per the PPCB report, the sugar mill was storing molasses in two bricklined 20-ft deep tanks, neither of which was meant for the purpose.While the PPCB rejected the managements excuse that it had processed sugarcane more than its capacity during this season, this is a story being repeated across sugarcane-producing areas in Punjab and other states.For every quintal (100 kg) of cane crushed, mills produce around 10.7 kg of sugar and 4.6 kg of molasses, which is sold mainly to distilleries for manufacture of alcohol. With mills in India expected to crush over 300 million tonnes (mt) of cane in the current 2017-18 season, it translates into a record 32.2 mt production of sugar as well as 13.9 mt of molasses. This is against the 20.26 mt sugar and 9 mt molasses in 2016-17.Read | A sugar rushDead fish floated downstream in Beas for 3 days after molasses spill. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Dead fish floated downstream in Beas for 3 days after molasses spill. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)Across major cane-growing states, molasses stored in the open is now a common sight. Punjabs 16 sugar mills alone produce an average 30 lakh quintals of molasses annually. This season, a bumper sugarcane crop has sent this up to 38.64 lakh quintals, apart from the molasses held over from last year.Good weather and improved cane varieties  especially Co-0238, covering 63.5 per cent of Punjabs total sugarcane area  have boosted the cane yield. We have recorded average yields of 89 tonnes per hectare in 2017-18, compared to 57-75 tonnes in the last few seasons, says Punjab Cane Commissioner Jaswant Singh.Distilleries in Punjab have the capacity on paper to consume 25 lakh quintals of molasses. In reality, though, they use up only 17 lakh quintals. Mills manage to sell around 5 lakh quintals to other states, while the rest is carried over.With no space to store molasses in tanks, mills are dumping the dark brown syrupy liquid in open pits.In one such open pit in Bhogpur near Jalandhar city, molasses, coagulating into yellow lumps in parts, shimmers in the 40 degree heat. The black tarpaulin lining the pit, 8-ft deep and 60 ft x 60 ft in size, is held down by bags of cement and sand around the edges, to ensure it does not give under the weight of the liquid. Next to the pit stands a round steel tank, 65 ft in diameter and 35 ft high, also filled to the brim. Behind the tank is a wall, marking the boundary of Punjabs first cooperative sugar mill.Read | A farmer death, and the story of a Baghpat millThis is not a scientific method (to store molasses) and there can be serious problems if the liquid comes into contact with soil and water sources, warns Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) Chairman Kahan Singh Pannu.District Health Officer of Jalandhar Sewa Singh also admits a brewing health hazard. Such pits should be made with proper brick and cement lining, so that molasses doesnt seep into the soil. And there should be proper sheds over them, says Singh.A senior officer of the Bhogpur cooperative mill says they are helpless. We have two steel tanks with total 65,000 quintals storage capacity for molasses, which is what the mill produces every year. But this time, we crushed at least 4 lakh quintals more cane, producing around 20,000 quintals extra molasses. Since there was no time to make a new steel tank, we simply dug the pit. According to him, the mill was forced to dispose of some of the surplus molasses at Rs 100-120 per quintal.B S Gill, the general manager of the Bhogpur mill, says, What is lying in the open is actually quite less now and will not spill out. We will even shift it to the tanks in a day or two, once some space is created by the sale of molasses there.At Wahid Sandhar Sugar Limited, a private mill in Phagwara town in nearby Kapurthala district, molasses lies in a kuchcha 100 X 100 feet and 10-ft deep pit, also lined with tarpaulin. Its owner Jarnail Singh Wahid says the mills tanks can store one lakh quintals of molasses, but this years production has been 2.80 lakh quintals.We kept the molasses for a few weeks and now we are selling at abysmally low prices, just to get rid of it. When there is no market for it, what can we do? he says. If the government can decide the State Advised Price for sugarcane, what stops it from fixing a minimum rate for molasses and making it compulsory for distilleries of Punjab to buy from mills in the state first?R S Jhingar, chairman of the Nawanshahr cooperative mill, one of the largest in Punjab, says, We sold molasses at Rs 685 per quintal a couple of years ago and last year the rate was Rs 550 per quintal, but this year we lost heavily in both sugar and molasses.The Punjab State Federation of Cooperative Sugar Mills recently floated a tender for sale of molasses at the nine factories under it. The tender had to be cancelled. The reason: the low quoted rate of Rs 85 per quintal.But there is worse news emanating from Uttar Pradesh. Mills in the state have had to sell molasses free of cost  and, on top of it, bear the cost of transportation to distilleries.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Currently director of the Sugarcane Breeding Institute (SBI) at Coimbatore, he isnt as well-known as Norman Borlaug or M S Swaminathan. Yet, the wonder sugarcane variety, Co-0238, bred by him has sparked no less a revolution, particularly in Uttar Pradeshs (UP) ganna heartland. It is probably also a reason for the present crisis in sugar  that of overproduction and India becoming permanently surplus in the sweetener.In the 2012-13 crushing season (October-September), UP farmers grew cane on 24.24 lakh hectares (lh) and its mills produced 74.85 lakh tonnes (lt) of sugar. In the current 2017-18 season, the cane area is only 22.99 lh, but production of sugar by UP mills has already hit 119.22 lt as on June 1. It is likely to cross 120 lt when crushing operations end in another week or so.Sugarcane farmers sitting on a dharna at the Baraut tehsil office demanding their dues from sugar mills. The protest began on May 21. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Sugarcane farmers sitting on a dharna at the Baraut tehsil office demanding their dues from sugar mills. The protest began on May 21. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)The above 60 per cent increase in sugar output, despite area under cane shrinking, is largely due to Co-0238. Bakshi Rams variety, first planted in 2013-14, covers 12.08 lh or 52.5 per cent of UPs total cane area this season. It has led to average cane yields in the state rising from 61.63 tonnes per hectare in 2012-13 to around 77 tonnes in 2017-18. Thats not all. Co-0238 also gives more sugar from every tonne of cane crushed compared to other varieties. In 2012-13, the average sugar-to-cane recovery ratio for UP mills was 9.18 per cent. This season, it is close to 10.9 per cent.The production revolution from higher cane yields and improved sugar recoveries  thanks to unsung breeders like Bakshi Ram  is not an unmixed blessing, though.The sugar economy of India has traditionally been hostage to violent cyclical output oscillations. The typical sugar cycle is one of three years of high production followed by two years of sharp decline. Thus, 2000-01 to 2002-03 were good seasons in terms of output, while 2003-04 and 2004-05 were not. The same pattern was repeated over 2005-06 to 2007-08 (good) vis--vis 2008-09 and 2009-10 (bad).However, with advances in plant breeding  SBI and the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute are field-testing 20 drought-resistant clones in six locations of Maharashtra; these can save seven-eight out of the normal 34-35 irrigations over a 12-month crop duration (and even more through drip/sprinkler systems)  the old cycle of two-in-five bad production years is pass. Instead, we now have one-in-five or even one-in-seven bad, as seen from 2010-11 to 2016-17 (see chart below). Moreover, the recovery from declines is much sharper than before: Indias sugar output this season is projected at a record 322 lt, a 59 per cent jump over the 202.62 lt of 2016-17.Read | A farmer death, and the story of a Baghpat millThe effects of moving to a permanently surplus situation are already being felt. Sugarcane is relatively profitable to grow. The average returns over cost of cultivation, estimated by The Sunday Express based on interactions with a cross-section of farmers in UPs Shamli district, work out to around Rs 7,500 per bigha or Rs 1.09 lakh per hectare. The green top leaves from cane take care of the entire fodder requirements of a farmers cattle during the crushing months from November to April. Also, it is a hardy crop that can withstand ola (hail), pala (frost), aag (fire), paani (waterlogging), nilgai (Asian antelope) and jungli suar (wild boar), to quote a Shamli farmer. Plus, there are no pricing and marketing uncertainties in cane. Mills are required, by law, to pay farmers a fair and remunerative price fixed by the Centre  UP has an even higher State Advised Price or SAP  within 14 days from the date of delivery.But these stable arrangements are bound to collapse in a regime of permanent surpluses. The 320 lt-plus sugar production for the country in 2017-18 will far exceed its annual domestic consumption of 250-260 lt. And with breeding breakthroughs and water-saving technologies practically rendering the sugar cycle redundant, surpluses are set to be recurrent  except in extreme drought years, when even irrigation from canals and groundwater is not possible.In such a scenario, sugar prices, far from rising, are more prone to falling. We have seen it this season, as ex-factory realisations in UP have collapsed from Rs 36-37 per kg in October to Rs 26-27 levels in May. That has, then, resulted in mills being unable to pay farmers the SAP. In UP alone, mills had bought sugarcane worth Rs 35,103.27 crore at the SAP during the 2017-18 season, as on June 1. Out of that, they were to pay Rs 34,549.28 crore within the stipulated 14-day period, but have so far disbursed just Rs 21,978.37 crore. It translates into arrears of Rs 12,570.91 crore.Read | Mounting molasses, and a scare in BeasThose dues may come down gradually, as crushing ends and mills sell sugar over the next few months. But the next season from October 2018  save in the unlikely event of a spectacular recovery in sugar prices  may start with Rs 7,500 crore of cane arrears in UP. Worse, the country as a whole would have opening sugar stocks of at least 100 lt (320 lt production, plus 40 lt carry-forward from 2016-17, minus 260 lt consumption). And going by reports of planting so far, there is every possibility of output in the 2018-19 season going up further to 340 lt.Simply put, India has too much of sugar today and the situation will only worsen in the coming season. For the Narendra Modi government  already smarting from a defeat in the recent by-polls in UPs Kairana parliamentary constituency, where ganna payment was the main issue  this could present a major challenge, ahead of the big national elections in April-May 2018. That is also the time when cane arrears usually peak. No ruling party would want that to happen.Next week, the Modi government is expected to take a few decisions in the hope of propping up sugar prices. On the agenda are the creation of a 30-lt buffer stock from sugar lying with mills (the government will bear the interest and storage costs on this sequestered quantity); the imposition of a minimum price of Rs 30-32 per kg; and fixing of factory-wise monthly sale quotas (what used to earlier be called the release order mechanism). Whether these can really address a problem of permanent surplus is, of course, a moot point.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He cannot count on them doing so again, as a crash in commodity prices and surging fuel costs stoke anger in the countryside.Four years ago, Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept Uttar Pradesh, Indias most populous state, winning 73 of 80 seats, as the rural poor  swayed by promises of higher crop prices  deserted the rival Congress party.Now, facing criticism for not improving living standards in the countryside, where 70 percent of Indias 1.3 billion people live, analysts and farm economists said Modi would find it hard to repeat the feat in a general election due by May 2019.While it is risky to predict election outcomes in India, where religion and caste remain important issues  not to mention the influence of fickle regional parties  interviews with some of the states millions of farmers suggest rural angst could cost the government dearly.No doubt, there was a wave for Modi in 2014, but farmers are disenchanted with him now, said sugar cane grower Uday Vir Singh, 53, plonking down on a wicker chair and smoking his hookah.

Nearly half a dozen farmers sitting with Singh on a hand-woven rope cot, and many of others in Kairana  which elected a joint opposition candidate from a small regional party in a key by-election this week  accused Modi and the Uttar Pradesh administration, also run by the BJP, of failing to live up to their promises and overlooking the concerns of villagers.Modi is a very good salesman but we are not going to fall prey to his glib talk again, said 55-year-old Narendra Kalhande, who grows cane on his 2.5 acre farm. Farm Minister Radha Mohan Singh defended the governments record, citing initiatives on irrigation, crop insurance and electronic trading platforms for farmers to sell produce.For farmers, Prime Minister Modis 48 months have been much better than the Congresss rule of 48 years, Singh told Reuters, referring to the main opposition party that dominated Indian politics for most of the years since independence from British colonial rule in 1947.CRISIS IN COUNTRYSIDEHigher inflation and sluggish growth helped Modi trounce Congress, which had long counted the rural poor as its core constituency, in the 2014 election. Small farmers had been hit by rising living costs but benefited little from rising food prices because of the web of middlemen in Indias agricultural markets.Since then the economy has picked up, recording its quickest pace of expansion in nearly two years in the first three months of 2018, helped by higher growth in the farm sector. But lower food prices, weaker farm wages and modest crop procurement rates  the result of a shift in focus from the subsidies favoured by Congress to investment under the pro-business BJP  have hurt most of Indias 263 million farmers, who typically own less than 2 hectares of land.In the past year, Modis popularity has fallen by 12 percentage points among farmers, according to a Mood of the Nation survey published last week by the Lokniti, part of the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies (CSDS), a research institute.Next years election would be fought on farmers issues, said Yogendra Yadav, a leading academic-turned-politician. Farmer organisations in some states began a 10-strike on Friday, in which they have said they will stop selling produce to protest a steep drop in the prices of an array of farm goods.Farm Minister Singh said his government had yet to hear from farm leaders but was ready to listen.COMMODITIES CRASHPrices of pulses, a key crop for Indian farmers, have fallen 25-30 percent below state-set support prices, as higher imports and bumper local crops bumped up supplies. While the government announces support prices for more than 20 crops each year to set a benchmark, state agencies actually buy only rice and wheat at the support level.Vegetable prices, especially onions, cabbage and tomatoes have fallen 25 percent from last year, largely because of the lack of refrigerated trucks that could take the perishables to the consuming big cities. Milk prices have also dived by more than 25 percent in the past year as a global glut has brought exports to a near halt.Farmers in Charkhi Dadri, three hours drive west of the capital New Delhi, recently dumped tomatoes onto the road in protest after buyers offered a quarter of a rupee per kilogram for a crop that costs at least 6 rupees ($0.09) a kg to produce.Jai Bhagwan, 54, borrowed 12,000 rupees to grow onions on a plot of about half acre in Jhajjar, an area otherwise famed for pottery. When his crop was ready, Jai Bhagwan could get only 1,200 rupees.I could not even recover my labour cost, said Jai Bhagwan, who was in New Delhi recently to participate in a farmers meet. Prakash Singh, also from Jhajjar, spent 6,000 rupees to grow green chilli, but the crop fetched him barely 200 rupees.Im in debt up to my eyeballs. But I cant sit idle, so Ill have to borrow more to grow something else, Singh said.Ashok Gulati, a farm economist who advised Indias last government, said there were three policy options to support farmers: building state buffer stocks to soak up excess supply, acting to boost exports or building capacity for processing farm commodities into end products such as milled, dehusked pulses or vegetable oils.Most of those measures would require long-term structural changes, however, and analysts predict in the run-up to the election Modi is likely to announce more populist, short-term fixes such as higher guaranteed prices for crops and farm loan waivers.Many farmers complained they are still reeling from disruptions caused by the launch of a new nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in July 2017 and a ban on high denomination bank notes in November 2016. Blaming the shock move for exacerbating farmers financial woes, Gulati said: Expectations were high from the government, but the fact is that the plight of farmers is far worse now than what it was four years ago.Modis drive to purge black money from the economy by removing, at a stroke, 86 percent of the cash in circulation, made it difficult for farmers, who survive on cash, to buy inputs like seeds and receive payments for their crops.In Kairana, all 35 farmers Reuters spoke to agreed that abolishing 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes had made things worse.POWER SURGEFarmers in Uttar Pradesh, home to 220 million people, are also angry over a sharp rise in the pump price of diesel and a steep hike in electricity tariffs. Many farmers in the state use diesel to run tractors for ploughing and trolleys for moving their produce to wholesale markets. They depend on electricity to operate irrigation pumps.Diesel prices have shot up by more than 40 percent to record highs and electricity tariffs have surged by more 20 percent in the past two years, said Shri Pal, a farmer from Shamli.Villages account for most of Indias diesel consumption and thats why higher prices pinch farmers the most, but diesel in India is much more expensive than Bhutan, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, said Hannan Mollah, a former lawmaker and a senior official of the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Kairana and Shamli lie in the sugar cane belt of Uttar Pradesh, the top sugar state of India, the worlds biggest producer after Brazil. Soaring global output has caused a collapse in sugar prices, leading to losses for mills who now owe nearly 23 billion rupees to cane growers.A BJP spokesman, G.V.L. Narasimha Rao, said the government has streamlined timely payments to cane growers. That has not been enough to satisfy farmers such as Ram Lakhan Singh, a cane grower from Shamli. Most sugar mills have not paid us a single rupee since December and the government has connived with them to deprive us of our rightful dues. Trust me, cane farmers will think twice before voting for the BJP.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

However, a decision was deferred as the GoM is awaiting a legal opinion from the Attorney General on the original proposal to levy a sugar cess.On Sunday, the five-member GoM, led by Assam Finance Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, also explored a reduction in the GST on ethanol to 5% from the existing 18% levy and increasing the government subsidy for export of sugar.Kerala Finance Minister T.M. Thomas Isaac told The Hindu that the possibility of a uniform 1% hike in GST across all slabs was discussed.Out of it, 0.5% can be kept with the Centre and rest with the State. That money can be used to fulfil the needs of all farmers, not only sugar cane, by respective States in the form of welfare fund and even the Centre can chip in when necessary. But imposing a cess would mean betraying the very principle of GST, Mr. Issac said. At present, the GST rate slabs are pegged at 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%, while certain goods are zero-rated.The fund would be to extend financial aid to farmers in case of situation that has arisen for sugar cane farmers and the States will have control over their share for disbursal .Sugar cess opposedKerala had already expressed dissent to the move to impose a sugar cess at the GST Councils meeting on May 4. Apart from Mr. Sarma and Mr. Isaac, the GoM includes Ministers from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu.Maharashtra Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said the GoM has decided to submit its report to the Council within a month, and is awaiting the Attorney Generals opinion on whether cess on GST can be imposed for welfare purposes, since it can only be imposed for compensation purposes.The Council will take a final call on the GoMs report."

Analysts viewed the result as a bellwether for a general election due by May 2019.Modi needs to placate India's 50 million cane growers, whose numbers make them an influential political lobby, to smooth his route back to power next year.India, the world's biggest consumer of sugar and No. 2 producer after Brazil, has in the past created government stockpiles, or buffer stocks, to tackle supply gluts caused by yo-yoing output.Late last month Reuters reported that the government would approve the proposal that would require sugar mills to stock 3 million tonnes of sugar in their warehouses, with the government paying the carrying costs for the commodity.The plan would cost the government around 12.15 billion rupees ($178.5 million).Other than building a buffer stock, the government is also expected to offer cheap loans to sugar mills to expand their ethanol production capacity and fix a floor price to ensure that retail rates do not fall further, the sources said.Shares of sugar companies such as Dhampur Sugar Mills Ltd, Mawana Sugars Ltd, Balrampur Chini Mills Ltd and Avadh Sugar & Energy Ltd jumped on Tuesday in anticipation of the measures.Sugar prices have dropped to their lowest in 28 months, exacerbating financial woes of sugar mills. Citing their poor financial health, mills have said they are unable to pay cane farmers on time.Mills now owe nearly 220 billion rupees, which could leap to a record 250 billion rupees in the current 2017/18 season.Rising cane arrears have angered farmers.New Delhi scrapped a 20 percent tax on sugar exports in March, and in April asked mills to export 2 million tonnes of sugar to cut back inventories.The government also approved a plan to provide financial support to cane farmers for produce sold to sugar mills."

The package is part of the governments efforts to address the ongoing agrarian crisis in the country and offset its political impact.According to a government official, the package includes three elements. A buffer stock of 30 LMT (lakh metric tonnes) of sugar will be created with Rs 1,200 crore.This money will be directly transferred to accounts of sugarcane farmers. Rs 4,400 crore will be used to increase ethanol production to divert sugarcane away from sugar mills which are unable to dispose of their inventories. The government has also decided to ensure a minimum sale price of Rs 29/kg for sugar.To be sure, a creation of buffer stock need not lead to the government buying sugar from the market, and might actually entail the government agreeing to bear a part of carrying cost of unsold inventories of sugar mills. A spokesperson of the Indian Sugar Mills Association declined to comment on the package citing lack of exact details.A crisis in the sugar industry shot into limelight after the BJPs defeat in the Kairana Lok Sabha bypoll.The region is dominated by sugarcane farmers who have been protesting against the non-payment of dues by sugar mills. According to media reports, pending arrears of sugarcane farmers in Uttar Pradesh alone are to the tune of more than Rs 12,000 crores.According to statistics from Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, sugarcane production in 2017-18 was the third highest ever in the country at 35.5 million tonnes."

As sugar prices crash, factories have not been able to pay farmers their dues worth Rs 1,913 crore.Restive cane farmers have threatened an agitation. Why should farmers be punished for improving their production? asked Raju Shetti of Swabhimani Sanghatana. We will launch an agitation outside the sugar commissioners office in Pune if the dues are not cleared by mid-June.The sugar belt in Western Maharashtra , which has the highest concentration of sugarcane and factories, owes the most to farmers.Mills in Pune division owe around Rs 843 crore, while those in Kolhapur division owe Rs 506 crore.Sugar factories in the Aurangabad circle owe Rs 237 crore.Caught in a bind, claim sugar millsWe have issued notices to defaulting factories but will wait before taking further action since they are making an attempt to pay, said state sugar commissioner Sambhaji Kadu Patil.Nationally too, the glut is a crisis. The estimated output this year is 320 lakh tonnes, 58% higher than last year, according to the National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories (NFCSF). Sugar prices have dropped from Rs 3,600 to Rs 2,750 per quintal. And pending cane dues to farmers are estimated at Rs 20,000 crore. More than half these dues are from Uttar Pradesh, Indias top sugar producer.The sugar mills say they are caught between the price crash, which has eaten into their funds, and the fee set by the Centre to be paid to cane farmers at Rs 2,550 per tonne. This is known as the Fair and Remunerative Price (FRP).We are making losses of Rs 825 per tonne. Besides FRP dues, we have to pay for harvesting and transport worth Rs 650 crore, which is not included in FRP calculation in Maharashtra, said a representative of Maharashtras Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation. Also, 71 cooperative factories owe banks around Rs 650 crore. These have been converted into short margin and need to be repaid before factories can regain the sugar stock hypothecated to banks.The Centre has increased import duty to 100% and removed export duty. to boost exports and reduce stock. We are hoping government helps control prices by declaring a price under Essential Commodities Act and retains a 30 lakh tonne buffer stock, said Prakash Naiknavare, MD of NFCSF. The industry is also hoping for an increase in the Rs 55 per tonne cane incentive."

His utterance about Sitas birth had gone viral on social media and invited nationwide criticism, compelling the BJP leadership to ask him to exercise restraint.Taking a dig at the saffron party and PM Narendra Modi , Gohil also said he never used either God or his mother to gain mileage in electoral politics. He said there were people in Indian politics who get their mother queued up for voting to get peoples sympathy and mileage in vote politics. I personally take care of my mother. I will never ask my mother to stand in a queue just for the sake of vote politics, he said.Gohil said former President Pranab Mukherjee , who has been invited by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) to its Nagpur event, would surely caution the Sangh parivar of the dangers involved in the divisive policy they are pursuing to win elections.He said Bihar tops the country in terms of youth power with 58% of its population below 25 years of age. He, however, lamented that the youths in the state were frustrated and directionless owing to hollow promises of PM Narendra Modi and chief minister Nitish Kumar.Modi had won 2014 Lok Sabha elections on a number of promises and all have turned out to be mere jumlas (gimmick). Be it two crore jobs per year to unemployed youths, remunerative prices to farmers or revival of closed sugar mills in Mithilanchal, all have remained distant dreams even after four years of the NDA government at the Centre, Gohil said.He said more jobs were provided to the youths each year during the tenure of former PM Manmohan Singh than PM Modi has been able to provide during his four-year regime so far.Accusing the Modi government of failure on all fronts, Gohil cited the steep fall in GDP due to ill-conceived demonetisation, ill-implemented GST resulting in incalculable damage to small and medium industries, prevailing uncertainties in the banking sector, ever-increasing farmers suicides, price rise on account of unprecedented hike of excise duty on diesel and petrol.Modi ji has an obsession for power and he can go to any extent for that, alleged Gohil, who attended an iftar organized by party MLA Bhawna Jha here on Sunday.Congress legislature party leader Sadanand Singh , who was also here, said the state is being run by two engines which, instead of being in sync with one another, are pulling in opposite directions, resulting in a situation where law and order is at its lowest ebb, farmers are in acute distress, education is in a mess, contractual employees are agitating and corruption has assumed phenomenal dimensions."

Cabinet will take a decision.According to sources, the bailout package will come just days after the BJP lost Lok Sabha bypoll in Kairana constituency in Uttar Pradesh, the countrys largest sugarcane producing state.

The Rs 8,000-crore package will include provisions for the creation of a sugar buffer stock of 3 million tonnes, interest subsidy on Rs 4,500 crore loan to mills for expansion and creation of new ethanol capacity among others.Just last month, the government had announced a Rs 1,500 crore production-linked subsidy for sugarcane farmers to help millers pay cane payments.The current crisis in the sugar sector is primarily due to a substantial glut in the domestic market, which in turn has brought mill prices of sugar below the cost of production resulting in massive losses. Currently, the average ex-mill price of sugar is in the range of Rs 25.60-26.22 per kg.The current package will be in addition to the measure she government had already taken, like doubling the import duty for sugar to 100 per cent and removed export duties.

Loans taken by TN sugar industry from banks/financial institutions must be rescheduled with three years moratorium period and a longer repayment period in view of the worst drought witnessed in 141 years, said Palani G Periasamy, president, South Indian Sugar Mills Association (SISMA), Tamil Nadu. TN sugar industry requires a special package in view of continuous monsoon failure for the past five yearsand failure of both the monsoons in 2016, he said. TN sugar mills should be exempted from export obligations  Minimum Indicative Export quotas (MIEQ) allotted by the Food Ministry to each sugar mill  as their sugar production during the current season is just 6 lakh tonnes as against the states annual requirement of 15 lakh tonnes, he stated.With capacity utilisation for sugar mills in TN slumping to 25% during the current season (October-September), cost of production has gone up, SISMA said. With low sugar prices, TN mills could neither pay FRP (fair and remunerative price) on time nor service nor repay the loans, it said. From a peak of 254.55 lakh tonnes of cane crushed in the 2011-12 season, mills crushed only 119.04 lakh tonnes during the 2016-17 season. The estimated cane availability for the current season is around 75 lakh tonnes. Cane arrears to farmers have piled up to nearly Rs 300 crore in the state. Stating that the sugar industry needs structural changes for long-term sustainability, Periasamy, who is also the chairman of Dharani Sugars and Chemicals, said that cane price should be linked to the sugar price. Mills responsibility should be restricted to only 75% of realisation from sugar, he said. Otherwise, excess cane should be converted into ethanol and the entire quantity of ethanol must be procured by oil marketing companies at remunerative prices, he said. TN cane farmers should be paid the already announced subsidy directly without linking the same to export obligations. Otherwise, most of the sugar mills in TN will not be able to start their crushing operations during next season, Periasamy said. The union government has announced several measures including creation of 3 million tonnes of buffer stock and fixed minimum selling price (MSP) for sugar at Rs 29,000 per tonne to help the industry. The government intervened to support the industry following the fall in the sugar prices from a high of Rs 37,500 per tonne (ex-mill Uttar Pradesh) in October 2017 to a low of Rs 26,500 per tonne in mid-May 2018.This resulted in losses for sugar mills and cane arrears crossing Rs 20,000 crores in the country."

Which is why, while the Oppositions celebrations after besting the BJP in another round of by-elections may be premature, Indias principal party cant any longer afford to take victory in the 2019 general elections for granted.This isnt just about a more united Opposition challenge: truth is, from Kairana in western Uttar Pradesh to Bhandara-Gondia in Maharashtra, the BJPs vote share is showing signs of decline, a first indication of creeping anti-incumbency. That the election setbacks have come in the north and west is also significant: it was, after all, a north-west India tidal wave that propelled the BJP to a famous win in 2014. Nor can the BJP claim that Narendra Modi did not campaign in the by-elections: a day before the polling in Kairana, the prime minister was in the neighbouring Baghpat district, flagging off a new expressway and promising achche din to the region. And the BJPs UP Hindutva mascot, chief minister Yogi Adityanath, was even more omnipresent, even raking up the communally-charged issue of removing a Jinnah portrait in the Aligarh Muslim University.As it turned out, May 2018 was not quite May 2014: then, against a backdrop of the Muzaffarnagar riots, the BJP succeeded in achieving an unprecedented communal polarisation and swept western UP. This time, the more prosaic issue of ganna  as exemplified by farmers demanding their sugarcane dues  defeated the divisive politics of Jinnah. So, are we seeing the revival of a fresh political narrative ahead of the 2019 general elections where local concerns trump the national issues that play out in TV studios? Well, yes and no.Local issues do matter at election time, especially when they play out through the prism of strategic alliances on the ground. This is exactly what happened in Kairana where the entire anti-BJP Opposition backed the Rashtriya Lok Dal candidate, giving them a strong arithmetical advantage that enabled them to play the ganna card with confidence. But amplifying the act local messaging over 543 constituencies spread across 29 states in a general election is a huge challenge: the competitive instincts of political parties mean that while they might be ready to cede space in a by-election, they are unlikely to be as generous in the ultimate parliamentary test.Moreover, the BJP will determinedly make the 2019 elections a made for TV presidential contest, posing the issue before the voter as Modi versus who? Besides, in a by-election, voter turnout tends to be low, but in a general election the sheer size and resources of the BJP-RSS election machine could give the momentum to the saffron brotherhood.And yet, as Karnataka and now Kairana have shown, the notion of political invincibility is also part of a myth-making factory. Modi and his lieutenant Amit Shah have built a larger than life image for themselves by convincing the Opposition that they are indestructible. But to draw a cricketing analogy, as Indias stunning 1983 World Cup win over the mighty West Indies and the magical turnaround in Kolkata against Australia in 2001 showed, even seemingly unbeatable rivals can be outplayed provided there is sufficient self-belief.From an Opposition that has been pummelled and outwitted at almost every stage for the last four years, we now at least have the emerging contours of a potential challenge. At the heart of it, is the ultimate political weapon: the netas survival instinct. Nothing else explains why the Congress has virtually surrendered to a HD Kumaraswamy while forming a government in Karnataka, or the fact that a Mayawati is ready to forget past animosities.Not that the dominant party is simply going to lie down and let the Opposition walk all over them. Within days of the by-poll setbacks, there are signs of the Modi-Shah duo getting into course correction mode. The massive aid package to the sugar industry is perhaps a belated recognition that post-Kairana the ganna farmer needs a break. Expect more such sops in the coming months as the NDA government prepares to dip into its petrol tax-rich coffers to share the booty with the aam aadmi. That Shah is now busily courting allies and even high-profile celebrities is another pointer to the future: in the run-up to 2019, the BJP will need to relearn the art of winning friends and influencing people. Ekla chalo re is a stirring song but it doesnt necessarily make for good politics.Post-script: A day after the Kairana results, a WhatsApp forward from a BJP supporters group was sent to me by a friend. It read: See what happened in Kairana: 35 per cent Muslims voted as a bloc while we Hindus are divided and fighting over petrol prices! In the months ahead, as the stakes get higher, expect the communal pitch to intensify further.Rajdeep Sardesai is a senior journalist and authorThe views expressed are personal"

These mills are mostly in the states of Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh . In the case of Tamil Nadu, most of the private sugar mills have paid their FRP through borrowings, while cooperative and public sector mills have cleared the arrears with high interest cost through advance from the state government.Fixation of minimum sugar price of Rs 29 per kg for the domestic market may not ensure cost recovery for sugar mills in TN due to poor recovery and low capacity utilisation precipitated by drought. Further, the proposed financial assistance to ethanol projects will not provide any immediate relief to the sugar mills in the state due to low availability of sugarcane, Palaniswami pointed out, among other issues related to the sugar industry in the state."

(File) After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. (File)Even as it is struggling to get sugar mills to discharge over Rs 12,500 crore worth of cane dues to farmers, the Yogi Adityanath-led BJP administration in Uttar Pradesh can take credit on another front: Procurement of wheat by government agencies in the state for the current 2018-19 rabi marketing season has almost touched 50 lakh tonnes (lt) and looks all set to surpass the all-time-high 50.63 lt achieved in 2012-13.We will be closing procurement operations on June 15. With two more days to go and also more updated information for the previous days, the total figure will cross the 2012-13 record, a senior official from the UP Food and Civil Supplies Department told The Indian Express.He said that the state and central agencies had procured the roughly 50 lt of wheat  from the 2017-18 crop, harvested and marketed after April  from over 10 lakh farmers. We opened 5,000-odd centres in 75 districts of the state and ensured that the farmers got the official minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,735 per quintal. In addition, we gave them a Rs 10/quintal incentive for grain that was brought to the centres after proper cleaning and drying, he added.After the high of 2012-13, procurement of wheat from UP had almost stalled, before the present government took over in March 2017. Even during the last marketing season, official procurement touched 37 lt, as against only 8 lt during 2016-17. This year, we set a target of procuring 50 lt out of the states total 350 lt wheat production. That target will be exceeded, the official pointed out.Meanwhile, wheat procurement by the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state agencies across India had, based on information received as on Wednesday, reached 353.59 lt. This is again more than the original target of 320 lt, though below the 381.48 lt high of 2012-13. The higher-than-expected procurement this time comes in the wake of the countrys wheat output hitting a record 98.61 million tonnes (mt), surpassing the 2016-17 crop size of 98.51 mt.Besides wheat, government agencies had, as on June 11, also procured 356.81 lt of rice during the ongoing 2017-18 kharif marketing season (October-September). This is already the second highest procurement after the previous seasons 381.06 lt. For rice, too, the production of 111.62 mt in 2017-18 was the highest ever achieved by the country, ahead of the previous years 109.70 mt.Guaranteed MSP-based procurement of wheat and paddy has made the two grains the preferred growing option for farmers, especially in a scenario where prices of other crops have been prone to extreme market fluctuations. With roughly 36 per cent of the countrys wheat and 33 per cent of paddy being bought by government agencies, the market for these crops has practically ceased to be significant. That, in turn, means putting more pressure on the already stretched storage capacities of FCI and other state-run agencies.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b2588f69855b722ac49b0f3,A not-so-sweet relief: Govt’s scheme for cane farmers benefits traders,https://indianexpress.com/article/india/a-not-so-sweet-relief-govts-scheme-for-cane-farmers-benefits-traders-5216375/,2018-06-14,"Farmer at Sugarcane farm in Maharashtra. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna) Farmer at Sugarcane farm in Maharashtra. (Express photo by Praveen Khanna)How successful will the Narendra Modi governments recent package for cane farmers be, in helping clear payment dues to them by sugar mills, is open to question. Whats clear right now, though, is that it is neither mills nor farmers, but sugar traders who are laughing their way to the bank.Consider this: till May 19, ex-factory prices of S-30, the most-commonly traded grade of sugar in Maharashtra, averaged as low as Rs 2,515 per quintal. But precisely around that time, the sugar trade was abuzz with talk of the Union Cabinet considering four proposals, as part of a package to expedite payment of cane price arrears worth over Rs 22,000 crore to farmers during the current 2017-18 crushing season (October-September).The proposals included the creation of a 30 lakh tonnes (lt) buffer stock, imposition of a minimum ex-factory price, restoration of the earlier system of monthly mill-wise sugar sale quotas, and higher rates for ethanol procured by oil marketing companies under the 10% blending-with-petrol programme. The stories of the likely package, interestingly, came after a meeting that the former Union Agriculture Minister, Sharad Pawar, had with top officials at the Prime Ministers Office on May 15. The said proposals were reportedly discussed in that meeting the very day when counting for the Karnataka Assembly elections also took place.But as the news of an impending Cabinet decision gained currency  Union Food Minister Ram Vilas Paswan himself confirmed the proposal to build a 30-lt sugar buffer on May 31  prices also began firming up. By the month-end, average ex-factory rates in Maharashtra had climbed to Rs 2,750 per quintal.On June 6, the day the Union Cabinet approved the package  which included the 30 lt buffer stock (to be held in mill godowns, but with the government bearing the interest, insurance and storage expenses), fixing of a minimum ex-factory price of Rs 29 per kg, and bringing back monthly sale quotas  the S-30 rates touched Rs 2,900 per quintal. They have since risen even further to Rs 3,175 per quintal (see chart).The above increase of about Rs 660 per quintal in just over three weeks  in Uttar Pradesh (UP), factories that had sold at Rs 2,500-2,520 are now realising Rs 3,300-3,350 per quintal  has, however, benefited neither mills nor farmers.The reason: The governments decision to fix artificially low sale quotas for mills, which has created a scarcity in the market and pushed up prices. But the high prices are of little use, as mills cannot sell more than the quotas allocated to them. Doing so will attract penal provisions under the Essential Commodities Act.On June 7, just a day after the Cabinet decision, the department of food & public distribution fixed the maximum quantity of sugar that mills could sell in the domestic market during June at 21.01 lt. By the time this was notified, many mills had already sold a lot of sugar and even exhausted a significant part of their quotas for the whole month. Today, you have a peculiar situation where prices have gone up and mills have sugar in their godowns, and yet they cannot sell, an industry source noted.According to him, the ones really making a killing now are traders, who had stocked up when rates were as low as Rs 2,400-2,450 per quintal in Maharashtra. They are benefiting hugely. Mills, on the other hand, can do nothing, except watch prices going up. And if they cannot sell sugar, it is not possible to pay farmers either, he added.A UP miller also questioned the manner in which the sale quota for June was distributed among individual factories. Out of the total 21.01 lt, as much as 8.14 lt has been allotted to mills in Maharashtra, followed by UP (6.25 lt), Karnataka (2.62 lt), Gujarat (0.87 lt), Punjab (0.53 lt), Bihar (0.50 lt), Haryana (0.47 lt), Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh (0.41 lt each), Tamil Nadu (0.36 lt) and Uttarakhand (0.30 lt).Its not clear how Maharashtra has been given a higher quota, when we (UP) are producing 120 lt this season, as against their 107.08 lt. Also, while Maharashtra mills have to only pay the Centres FRP (fair and remunerative price) for cane, we are obliged to give the UP governments much higher SAP (state advised price). Our payment arrears, too, are more (at Rs 12,601.48 crore versus Maharashtras Rs 1,768.29 crore, as on end-May). So, we should have got a bigger sale quota, the miller argued.The industry source quoted earlier was also cynical regarding the sustainability of the current sugar prices. Artificially restricting sales through quotas cannot take care of the underlying surplus due to the total availability at 360 lt  from 320 lt production in 2017-18 and 40 lt opening stocks  far exceeding estimated domestic consumption of 250 lt. Even the 30 lt buffer stock created out of the surplus will eventually have to be released into the market, he noted.Farmer leader and Member of Parliament from Maharashtras Hatkanangle Lok Sabha constituency, Raju Shetti, alleged that the Centres sugarcane package has only enriched traders. The market is now with them. If there are sale quotas for mills, why shouldnt these apply for traders as well? In any case, how does high sugar prices help, if mills cannot sell at these rates?, he asked.The convenor of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangathan, V M Singh, said that the much-touted Rs 7,000-crore package for sugarcane growers was actually worth no more than Rs 1,175 crore. The so-called package includes Rs 4,440 crore of bank loans to mills for expanding their ethanol production capacities and Rs 1,500 crore as incentive for 20 lt of sugar exports. The first is subject to mills actually availing the loan facility (on which the Centre will provide interest subvention of Rs 1,332 crore over five years), and the second is conditional on mills exporting, which is not possible when global sugar prices are currently Rs 22-24/kg, compared to domestic ex-factory realisations of Rs 32-33, he stated.Singh claimed that the only substantial element in the package was the 30 lt buffer, on which the carrying cost of Rs 1,175 crore would be borne by the Centre. But even this money will provide additional liquidity of only Rs 2 crore per mill, as against their average cane dues of Rs 50 crore. Many mills in UP owe farmers more than Rs 200 crore each.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b27f2c69855b72445d1fa46,Sweet nothing,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/sweet-nothing/article24176717.ece,2018-06-16,"A little over a month after the Centre proposed a special cess under the GST to help alleviate distress among sugarcane farmers, the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs approved a Rs. 7,000- crore package for the sugar sector last week. This package, with a mix of assured minimum pricing and special incentives for increasing molasses and ethanol production to gainfully mop up the glut of sugar in the country, is independent of the cess proposal that was expected to raise Rs. 6,700 crore. To put this in perspective, sugar mills dues to farmers stand at Rs. 22,000 crore. Under the proposed bailout scheme, the government will procure sugar from mills at a fixed minimum price to help them clear dues to farmers, and also offer them other financial assistance. Only about Rs. 1,175 crore, however, will be used towards procurement of refined sugar from mills to create a buffer stock of 30 lakh tonnes. This is a fraction of the 63.5 million tonnes output expected in the two sugar seasons from October 2017 to September 2019. With the record output, sugar prices have dropped from an average of Rs. 37 a kg in the previous season to Rs. 26 in the current season. The bailout plan promises to pay Rs. 29 a kg. Sugar mills say this is below their production cost of Rs. 35 a kg, though it may dissipate their immediate liquidity problems to an extent.Rating agency Crisil reckons that the fixed price for sugar at mill gates and the buffer stock will at best help mitigate about 40% of the outstanding arrears to sugarcane farmers. And as production will rise again in the coming season, so will the extent of arrears. The rest of the package will take time to materialise, with Rs. 4,440 crore of loans and Rs. 1,332 crore of interest subsidies for greenfield and brownfield distillery capacities. Over time, this could help to use excess sugar for the manufacture of alcohol or ethanol, but it will not be soon enough to address the present crisis. All said and done, the Centres sweetener for the sector does little to address structural problems and sticks to old-style pricing and stock-holding interventions instead of signalling a shift to market-driven cropping decisions. The political compulsions driving the bailout are obvious, given that the sugarcane crisis was a rallying cry in the by-election in Kairana in Uttar Pradesh, which the BJP lost. But that is no excuse for not thinking the package through. Perpetuating the complex web of state controls in a politically-sensitive sector is no solution. The best way to address the problem of excess supply in the long run is to ensure some linkage between the price paid for sugarcane and the end-products it is used for; and encouraging the feedback from market prices to inform farmers future cropping decisions. The current sops-driven solution could distort the agriculture sector further."

It is 11am but I am told Hasan fell asleep after sehri - the pre-dawn meal of fasting Muslims during the month of Ramzan - and she is still sleeping. These days, only the mornings are somewhat easy for her. In the evenings, she is busy attending iftar parties organised by various political parties. She is the toast of iftars, everyone wants to invite her after she dealt a stunning defeat to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in the recent Kairana Lok Sabha bypolls.It is not long before Hasan enters the drawing room dressed in a white and pink cotton salwar-kameez. She says, ""Everyone is congratulating me as if all of them were desperately waiting to see me win.""The 47-year-old is now the only Muslim MP from Uttar Pradesh - a state with 19.26 per cent Muslim population. Hasan, who will begin her stint in this monsoon session, says, ""Being the single Muslim MP from UP, everyone will keep an eye on me. I feel I have a huge responsibility now as a politician.""The Kairana seat fell vacant after the sitting BJP member, Hukum Singh, passed away this year. Hasan, who belongs to the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), was backed by the Congress, Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Samajwadi Party (SP).Many regard the Kairana defeat of the BJP as the preview to a BJP-mukt UP in the 2019 parliamentary polls. In the 2014 polls, the BJP had secured 71 out of 80 seats in the state. But this March, the party lost two bypolls, one in Gorakhpur and the other in Phulpur. Kairana fell in May - it was the third big loss in a row.But this is not the first time that Hasan has won this parliamentary seat. She won it in 2009 too. ""But this win gives out the message that when the Opposition is united, the BJP and its communal agenda can be defeated.""Hasan is wary of the BJP's ""communal agenda"". She has witnessed it in her own constituency. In 2013, a year before the BJP came to power at the Centre, 62 people died in communal violence in Shamli, the area under her jurisdiction, and neighbouring Muzaffarnagar. BJP leaders, including the late Hukum Singh, Sanjeev Balyan, Sangeet Som and Suresh Rana, were booked for instigating violence. After the riots, came the issue of mass Hindu exodus from Kairana. Singh blamed the Muslims for it, though much later, questions were raised about the authenticity of such claims.In these bypolls, the BJP played the Jat vs Muslim card. But Hasan claims she got over 80 per cent of the Jat votes. ""These Jats are Hindus. Why do you think they supported me? Ram, Krishna, Allah, all were with me,"" says Hasan, who won by 50,000 votes.Shortly before the bypolls last month, the BJP and Bajrang Dal also raked up the issue of ""reverse"" love jihad. Earlier, they had alleged that Hindu girls were being lured away by Muslim men and dubbed the phenomenon ""love jihad"". This time round, they alleged that Hindu men were being made to join Islam with the promise of a job and marriage with a Muslim girl.Hasan laughs at this. ""The biggest love jihads have happened in the homes of BJP leaders. The party's national spokesperson Shahnawaz Hussain's wife, Renu, and minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi's wife, Seema, are both Hindus. Who will talk about them?"" she asks, and then adds indignantly, ""Is this even an issue?""The BJP never talks about issues that matter, she lashes out. She points out how around the time of the Kairana bypolls, the party created much hullabaloo over a portrait of Muhammad Ali Jinnah that has been in Aligarh Muslim University for decades. Opposing the BJP's attempt to divert from real issues, RLD leader Jayant Chaudhary coined the slogan, ""Jinnah nahin, ganna chalega... Not Jinnah, sugarcane is the real issue here"". It was a nod to the statewide problem of non-payment of dues to sugarcane farmers by sugar mills.Currently, the unpaid dues stand at Rs 1,000 crore. Hasan says, ""Plus, the price of compost has gone up, the power tariff for tube wells has increased and soaring diesel prices are also taking a toll on farmers. Why doesn't the BJP talk about all this?""She seems to believe that no attempt by the Hindutva brigade to resurrect the Hindu versus Muslim debate can help the BJP anymore. ""The fact that I am sitting in front of you as an elected MP is the biggest proof of that. Our strategy is to keep a direct connect with the people, raise real issues in Parliament, solve people's problems. That's the only way to defeat the BJP in 2019,"" she says, as she pulls her white embroidered dupatta to cover her head. ""Dhul chatayenge in sabko... We will make them bite the dust.""In this hour-long meeting, for the first time, Hasan speaks with so much aggression. She is otherwise not much of a talker; one has to prod her for detailed answers. And she is very soft-spoken, too. I cannot help but ask how she hopes to survive in the male-dominated Parliament. ""Don't go by this side of mine,"" she says. ""I can be tough if need be.""In a resolute voice she tells me she doesn't really want anyone to project her success as a triumph of woman power. In fact, she clearly says, she doesn't want to play the woman card for her political gains. ""I won not because I am a woman. My opponent, Mriganka Singh, daughter of Hukum Singh, is also a woman. The fight was equal.""Hasan grew up in a family of wealthy farmers at Saharanpur in west UP. She and her two sisters enjoyed absolute freedom at home. Her younger brother, Mansoor, tells me, ""All important decisions were and are still taken by our sisters. Our parents never listened to the sons much.""Her maternal grandfather, Shafquat Jung, was a Congress MP from Kairana between 1971 and 1977. Her father, Akhtar Hasan, was the pradhan, or chief, of the Sarsawa block in Saharanpur. Hasan tells me she had watched both of them at work closely and understood the tricks of the trade well before she took the plunge. She was also aware of the risks one takes in elections. She learnt how to garner the support of grassroots workers, too. ""A lot of women don't understand politics even if they join it. They cannot even decide whom to vote for; they do as the men in their family want them to do. That never happened in my case.""The political training continued even after marriage. Her father-in-law, also Akhtar Hasan, was a Congress MP from Kairana between 1984 and 1989. ""He was an astute politician,"" says Hasan. She adds that while the older generations in both families were Congress loyalists, she and her husband, Munawwar Hasan, were closer to the SP.Munawwar was elected to the Lok Sabha from Kairana in 1996 and Muzaffarnagar in 2004 on an SP ticket. Later, he joined the BSP. All through his political career, Tabassum sat through political meetings, played an active role in a lot of inner party decision-making and co-ordinated with party workers at the ground level. When Munawwar died in an accident, she assumed charge and fought the 2009 elections on a BSP ticket. ""I had to take his legacy forward,"" says Munawwar's widow, who has since joined the RLD.I tell her she has the reputation of being quite the party-hopper, to which she replies, ""I always changed parties for the welfare of the people.""Since her victory, Hasan has been targeted by various pro-BJP sites on social media. In those posts, certain controversial statements have been falsely attributed to her. A Facebook page titled ""Yogi Adityanath-True Indian"" quoted her as having said, ""This is the victory of Allah and the defeat of Ram."" This post was shared over 3,700 times. Hasan finally lodged a police complaint and an investigation is currently underway.She says, ""I would like to ask the BJP, if you are fighting so much for Muslim women and their issues of triple talaq and talking about ""sabka saath, sabka vikas"", then why are you so worried about a Muslim woman going to Parliament."""

From the current 80, the number is likely to be pared down to 50, sources said. This was one of the key agendas of the meeting between the Chief Minister and the senior functionaries of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh -- the ideological mentor of the BJP -- which took place in Delhi yesterday, the sources added. The two-hour meeting in Delhi was attended by RSS executive head Bhaiyyaji Joshi.Reducing the number of ministries will involve substantial merging and scrapping and could lead to a reshuffle. A judicious trim, which would help the government improve efficiency. could be vital at this point, in view of next year's Lok Sabha elections.Yogi Adityanath -- who replaced the government of Akhilesh Yadav following a sweeping mandate in last year's assembly elections in the state -- had formed a 47-member cabinet. But he had inherited the huge number of departments from his predecessor. Currently, at least 30 ministers hold more than one department.Last year, Niti Aayog had suggested bringing down the number of departments in keeping with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's maxim of ""Minimum government and maximum governance"". The government's policy think tank had been tasked with helping the Yogi Adityanath's government to fulfill Prime Minister Narendra Modi's promise of development.After that, a committee was formed under a senior cabinet minister to give recommendations in this regard. The committee had recommended that number of departments be brought down to around 35.Uttar Pradesh sends the largest number of lawmakers to parliament - 80, of which the BJP had won 71 seats. Party insiders said alarm bells had started ringing when the party lost three Lok Sabha seats this year to the united forces of the Samajwadi Party and Mayawati.One of the seats was Gorakhpur - held for five consecutive terms by the Chief Minister. The other was Phulpur, held by his deputy Keshav Maurya. Last month, the party also lost Kairana - a seat in the heart of UP's sugar belt -- which was seen as signal from farmers unhappy with mounting cane arrears.Yesterday's meet also discussed the matter of next year's Kumbh mela in Allahabad. The BJP is making careful preparations for the religious gathering, attended by lakhs, in view of the next year's general elections."

It will also provide incentive for those farmers whose recovery from sugarcane will be higher than 9.5 per cent.FRP for the current 2017-18 season is Rs 255 per quintal and the government's farm advisory body CACP has proposed Rs 20 per quintal hike for the next season.In the meeting, PM Modi apprised cane growers about the various decisions taken to clear sugarcane arrears.""In the last seven to ten days itself, more than Rs 4,000 crore of arrears have been given to the farmers as a result of new policy measures enforced,"" the Prime Minister said.He assured farmers that states have been asked to take effective measures for liquidation of cane arrears.Cane arrears stood at Rs 22,654 crore as on June 1 and now have come down to Rs 19,816 crore, as per official data.To boost farmers' income, PM Modi called for use of sprinkler and drip irrigation, latest farming techniques and solar pumps as well as solar panels in their farms.He emphasised on value addition of crops, judicious use of farm waste, and up to 10 per cent reduction in chemical fertilisers by 2022.Mentioning about his recent interactions with industries, the Prime Minister said corporates have been asked to invest more in value addition, warehousing, storage facilities, better quality seeds, and market linkages for improving income of farmers.PM Modi also highlighted the steps taken by his government during 2014-15 and 2015-16 season when cane arrears had crossed Rs 21,000 crore.Elaborating on the government's plan to ensure 10 per cent blending of ethanol in petrol, he said it would be a long-term solution for providing stability in the sugar industry.To help loss-making sugar mills pay sugarcane growers, the centre has taken various initiatives during the last five months. These include doubling of import duty on sugar to 100 per cent, scrapping of export duty and announcement of the Rs 8,500 crore package.The package includes creation of buffer stock of 3 million tonnes of sugar, providing soft loan of Rs 4,500 crore with interest subsidy for expansion of ethanol capacity besides a production-linked subsidy worth Rs 1,500 crore to clear sugarcane arrears of the farmers.On Wednesday, the government hiked prices of ethanol extracted from final or C-molasses by Rs 2.85 per litre to Rs 43.70 per litre and also fixed for the first time the rate for ethanol produced from B-molasses (called intermediary molasses) at Rs 47.49 per litre for the 2018-19 season beginning December.This move will help boost production of ethanol, used in blending with petrol, and also enable mills to divert some of the sugarcane juice during the surplus crop year.Sugar production of India, the world's second largest producer but the biggest consumer, is estimated to touch a record 32 million tonnes in the 2017-18 marketing year (October-September), against 20.3 million tonnes output in the previous year.This year's expected production is much higher than the annual domestic demand of 25 million tonnes. The problem of plenty has led to crash in prices of sugar below the cost of production."

What connects the two sugar bowls  one in western Uttar Pradesh and the other in the Cauvery basin in Karnataka  are people like Singh who earn a living by making jaggery out of sugar cane. Around Holi, he arrives in Mandya with a team of 10 people and takes charge of one of the many rural jaggery units in the district, some 100 km from Bengaluru. By Deepavali, he is back in Muzaffarnagar.But Singh is not a happy man these days. Many of Mandyas famed jaggery units have either closed down or suspended operations mainly because of the fluctuating prices of the sweet lumps. A severe labour shortage is another reason. Unreliable power supply has increased the production cost as the units have no option but to run on diesel. Add to these the lack of water to support the rain-fed sugar cane crop. Now with a good monsoon in the Cauvery basin, people hope the closed units will spring back to life.Singh, who has 30 years of experience in jaggery-making, works in a unit at Dodda Byadarahalli village in Pandavapura taluk. There are plenty of orders during festivals and the wedding season, he says. But the local labourers remain unskilled and are not interested in the work. Singh earns Rs. 1,000 and his team Rs. 800 each for making 1,500 kg, or 300 boxes, of jaggery  the minimum daily production.But the prospects are turning bitter by the day. Of the 530 registered units in seven taluks of Mandya, at least 65% are facing an acute shortage of sugar cane and over 50% have become non-functional in recent weeks, say officials at the District Industries Centre and the Agriculture Department. The Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee used to collect 2,400 to 2,600 quintals of jaggery a day. But now, the arrivals have dipped to between 1,000 quintals and 1,300 quintals, forcing many traders to shut shop. The still-functioning units face complaints of excessive use of chemicals. Food scientists have been suggesting chemical-free processes.( Muralikumar is a Special News Photographerof The Hindu based in Bengaluru )"

With an 8% increase in acreage under sugarcane and adequate rainfall expected to lead to a bumper crop, the resultant production glut could hit farmers hard in an election year.Satellite images from the latter part of June show that the total acreage under sugarcane in the country is estimated to be around 54.35 lakh hectares this kharif season, an 8% increase from the previous year, according to a statement by the Indian Sugar Mills Association.High yieldWith farmers switching more of their acreage to a cane variety with a higher sugar yield, ISMA expects mills to produce a record 350-355 lakh tonnes of sugar next year, even higher than the 322 lakh tonnes produced this year.Next year, the conditions are likely to be tougher than ever before...We expect to produce at least 90 lakh tonnes more than needed for domestic consumption, ISMA general secretary Abinash Verma told The Hindu . And we will start the next marketing season [in October 2018] with at least 100 lakh tonnes carried over from this years record harvests.In May 2018, mills pending dues to farmers had crossed Rs. 22,000 crore, according to the Food Ministry. Soon after the ruling BJP lost a key by-poll in Kairana in the heart of Uttar Pradesh sugarcane country, a slew of relief measures including a sugar production subsidy were announced.By the end of June, the arrears had dropped to Rs. 18,000 crore and is likely to drop further, partly spurred by the Centres sugar relief package. However, as farmers start harvesting and selling this years kharif cane crop from October, and mills struggle with their bloated inventory, those dues are likely to rise again to at least Rs. 25,000 crore by the summer of 2019, according to industry sources.One way to reduce that inventory and increase cash flow to mills, and ultimately to farmers, is to increase exports.We will aim to export 60 lakh tonnes next year  a huge challenge  and we will still be left with 130 lakh tonnes, said Mr. Verma."

Inventory is rising, but mills are not exporting sugar due to lower returns,"" said one Mumbai-based dealer with a global trading firm.India has so far contracted to export 275,000 tonnes sugar from its record production of 32.25 million tonnes, dealers said.The glut is likely to swell in the 2018-19 season starting October 1, with Indian production expected to jump by almost a tenth from the current year to between 35 million tonnes and 35.5 million tonnes, the ISMA said.Uttar Pradesh, the biggest producer, could churn out 13-13.5 million tonnes of sugar in the next year, the association said.That would be up 12 per cent from the current year, with the ISMA saying farmers have devoted a bigger area to high-yielding varieties of sugar cane.Maharashtra's sugar output is estimated at 11-11.5 million tonnes in the new season, up from 10.71 million tonnes, the ISMA said.

The rally in Roza area is PM Modi's fifth public address in Uttar Pradesh in three weeks, indicating the importance of the state - which has 80 Lok Sabha seats - in BJP's calculations ahead of the 2019 general elections. Most of the farmers who have turned up to listen to PM Modi are sugarcane farmers. The farmers have been demanding better prices for their crop. PM Modi assured them that they will be given the best facilities.The BJP in the centre will ensure respect for all farmers. This is the reason why for the families of sugarcane farmers, many decisions have been made.You will get all the profit for the sugarcane you grow.A minimum price has been fixed for sugar so that there is no scam.We are resolving to break obstacles that the previous government had placed.We decided to deposit money directly to the bank accounts of farmers. Earlier, this was given to sugar mills, but we said no.Today, farmers don't have to worry about urea. They don't have to suffer lathis; they don't have to go to the market to buy urea. Earlier, urea was illegally diverted to factories. This has stopped now.In Shahjahanpur, there is a huge fertiliser factory. From here, urea goes throughout the country.In four years, look at how much progress has been made. Before us, only 40 crore litres of ethanol was made. After our government's decisions, 160 crore litres of ethanol will be refined.Farmers have the power to make gold from soil if they get water.When we electrified villages, it was very strange to see how some parties started holding meetings and speaking against us. They said ""gaon main gayi, ghar main nahin gayi."" I want to ask, if electricity has not reached village homes for 70 years, are the previous governments not responsible? Did Modi come and uproot electricity poles and remove electricity meters?"

Vinay Reddy, who walked out of the TRS, are in the fray in Balkonda and Armoor from BSP and BJP respectively.In Jukkal, Arunatara is contesting from the BJP as the Congress has denied her a ticket.Mixed verdictsThe district had given mixed results in 2009 with the BJP, Congress, TRS and PRP winning one seat each  Nizamabad, Bodhan, Yellareddy and Balkonda, while the TDP secured five  Armoor, Dichpally, Banswada, Jukkal and Kamareddy.In that election TRS and TDP were alliance partners. While the TDP contested five and won all, TRS contested in four, secured just Yellareddy where E. Ravinder Reddy won, a second hit.In 2004 the Congress and TRS were in alliance, and the former bagged six seats, and the latter won three.Culture factorsThe district has 17.17 lakh voters with more female voters at 8.94 lakh, while there are 8.25 lakh males. Youth voters aged between 20 and 40 years constitute a large chunk in all constituencies. Over 1.6 lakh new voters got enrolled in the list.As the district borders with Maharashtra and Karnataka, it has a mixed culture and traditions. Cultural influence of both the States is significant on voters of Jukkal, Bodhan, Banswada and Yellareddy.Further, a considerable number of north Indians live in the city. Muslim constitute at least 25%. The erstwhile undivided district basically is an agrarian economy with literally no industries worth the name.The TRS, which announced its candidates earlier than others is going all out to retain all the nine seats, while its opponents, the Congress-led Peoples Front is trying to catch up after announcing all candidates. The BJP has also pitted candidates in all constituencies. Though BLF (Bahujan Left Front) is also fielding its nominees, its campaign is low key.Points, counterpointsThe campaign will hot up with the arrival of star campaigners. Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has already addressed meetings at three places and Congress star campaigner Rahul Gandhi spoke at Kamareddy. Union Ministers J. P. Nadda and Santosh Gangwar campaigned, while Prime Minister Modi, Amit Shah, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and others are expected to join the BJP campaign.The Opposition mainly targeted its attack on the TRS failures in not keeping its promises of double bedroom houses, three-acre land for Dalits, employment for youth, and takeover of the Nizam Sugar Factory (NSF). The latter trained its campaign on Kaleshwaram, SRSP restoration scheme, 24-hour free power, Rythu Bandhu scheme and insurance cover for bereaved families of farmers.Poll issuesReopening and takeover of NSF, exclusive rights for district on Singur and Nizam Sagar waters, setting up of a turmeric board, Lakkampally SEZ (mega food processing park), withdrawal of cases on farmers for demanding Godavari water for kharif, and beedi workers welfare are voters issues."

Pandu and Gopi Kishan of Shiv Sena are also contesting. Pyramid party and BLF have also fielded their nominees.The constituency consisting of four mandals -- Navipet, Yedapally, Renjal and Bodhan -- has 1.96 lakh voters and women top the list with over one lakh, while the rest are men voters. Muslim minorities have 57,000 votes while Seemandhra settlers have 5,000 votes. Muslim minorities hold the key in deciding the result.Being located on the border of Maharashtra and also closer to Karnataka, it reflects a multi-cultural atmosphere. Mr. Sudarshan Reddy, who achieved hat trick wins in 1999, 2004, and 2009, unsuccessfully contested the last election as he was defeated by Shakeel by over 15,000 margin. The latter was defeated by the former in 2009.The Congress nominee has a fair image and contributed for the constituency development as Health, and also as Irrigation Minister. He played a key role in fulfilling the long cherished dream of Government Medical College in Nizamabad and the sanction of Government Nursing College in Bodhan. As the Minister, he was instrumental in sanction of some lift irrigation schemes on the Manjeera. Governments failure to reopen the Nizam Sugar Factory is one big disadvantage to the TRS and people in villages though have been benefited with Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Raos schemes, they are apparently not happy with Shakeel as he has a record of being not available to people most of the time. He is largely depending on the TRS governments welfare schemes and also minority votes. As he has a good team of party workers, he is aggressively darting ahead in his campaign. He is also said to have some cases against him.Reopening of NSF and also Nizamabad Cooperative Sugar Factory, roads, drinking and irrigation water, closure of Yamcha scheme, which supplies drinking water to 70 villages, non-completion of four-lane road from Jankampet to Basar are the major issues in the constituency. A lot of unemployment youth are also there in the constituency.Waking up early morning before the dawn, the 70-year-old Sudarshan Reddy is setting out for campaign in villages and is leaving no stone unturned for his victory. Congress workers are also following him with the same enthusiasm. The BJP is also trying its luck and hopes that voters would turn to it after Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths meeting on Tuesday."

If the horticulture department authorities are to be believed, this might be the very first in Western Uttar Pradesh.The farming of the dragon fruits is being practice here at Salava village of Noorpur area. The pink-coloured fruit, which is cultivated in Florida, Caribbean, Australia and South East Asia was grown by a farmer here in his 5-bigha land. He had started cultivation last year, but since the fruit appears after nearly 18 months, the fruit has finally started showing signs. The horticulture department authorities say that if cultivated properly, it can lead to an income of Rs 1 lakh in one year on a one-bigha land.Talking to TOI, Adesh Kumar who is a graduate and first dragon fruit grower, said, I had watched a video of dragon fruit farming on YouTube , last year. Later, I gathered knowledge about the crop, its market and profit. I contacted a Maharashtra-based NGO, which provided me dragon fruits plant for Rs 50 to Rs 80 per piece.I had carried it here from Maharashtra and developed infrastructure for the crop. First, I had installed cemented pillar in the fields and put a cemented wheel on the top of the pillar. The plant of the fruit develops in the shape of vine which climbs up the pillar. Around 400 plants were installed in the area of five-bigha land. I have spent around Rs 5 to 6 lakh to develop infrastructure and install plants in five bigha of agriculture land here, Adesh Kumar said.He further said. The plant starts bearing fruits after 18 months of installing plants. First year, it bears less fruits but later its numbers get increased. It is a season crop and bears fruits for 15 years. If all things go well, farmers can earn Rs 1 lakh in a year from one-bigha land by practicing farming of dragon fruits after deducting all expenses.Stating about the use of dragon fruits, he claims, Dragon fruit is beneficial for the consumers. It maintains cholesterol and sugar in the body and increases platelets in the blood. It costs between Rs 50 to 100 in the market. It is sold in metro cities of India and demand is increasing fast.Talking to TOI, district horticulture officer of Bijnor district Narpal Malik said, Adesh is the first dragon fruit grower in West UP. I have visited his fields. The crop is growing very well and started bearing some fruits. The climate of Bijnor seems to be conducive for dragon fruit crop. Our department will felicitated him for growing this crop successfully. Other farmers will also be motivated for adopting such type of technique and new crop. Kumar presented an example for the farmers who are doing only traditional farming such as sugarcane, wheat and paddy."
5ce5c99ae8e3fc56af40ef46,Well-being of society at root of rigorous rituals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/well-being-of-society-at-root-of-rigorous-rituals/cid/1674931,2018-12-11,"Modern day Chhath has emerged as the most revered and popular community festival of Bihar, in which all strata of society participate with equal zeal and sincerity though with many new manifestations and amendments. But the worship of the Sun God, which constitutes the essence of the festival, has been prevalent in the Magadh region and in other parts of Bihar for millennia.Though the role of fire got minimised in Aryavarta (present day Uttar Pradesh) after the Later Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC), its use increased further east, in the Bihar region, from 600 BC onwards as new settlements emerged in Magadh.The pre-historic settlements of the hilly and the jungle terrain of South Bihar regions and Northern Jharkhand were the source of the sustenance for nature worshippers, including the followers of the sun/fire cult. In recent times, more than 42 rock shelters/cave settlements belonging to the pre-historic as well as early historic period have been deciphered in the districts of Nawada, Jamui, Giridih and Jamui.The Taradih excavations of Bodhgaya have unearthed artefacts since the Neolithic period. Several fire pits have been found which also justify the worship of fire/sun god as continuity since pre-historic times.The Aryanisation of the Magadh region, since 600 BC, superimposed the Rig Vedic (1500-1000 BC) concept over the local tradition of the sun/fire cult in the area.The first manifestation of the Sun God in the Mahabodhi pillars of Bodhgaya in the art form during the Saka-Kushan period is thus natural. As such, we also find Sun God appearing on Kushan coins during AD 200-300.The rapid march of the Magadh Empire during 600 BC and the subsequent rapid urbanisation of the Magadh region further regenerated and popularised the local prehistoric sun/fire cult among the urban gentry and the ruling elite of Magadh region.LINK BETWEEN WORSHIP OF SUN GOD AND MOTHER GODDESSWorship of the Mother Goddess is associated with the fertility cult, which had its origins in primitive agricultural societies of the world. Discovery of idols of Mother Goddess in various matured forms at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation prove beyond doubt that the worship of Mother Goddess has been popular in India from pre-historic times.The Mahabodhi Pillars of the Saka-Kushan times have revealed two distinct images carved out of stone: (i) The Sun God and (ii) The Primordial Mother Goddess.While the image of the Sun God was conceived during the Rig Vedic phase, the Primordial Mother Goddess was still in the pristine form, as the River Goddess and was conceived from the folk traditions of Aryavarta.With the evolution and the advancement of the agrarian economy in Aryavarta, the worship of Mother Goddess emerged as the most popular form of worship in the folk tradition.The River Goddess slowly evolved in the mindset of the village communities of Aryavarta during the Late Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC). The concept of the River Goddess of Aryavarta travelled far and wide during 600 BC to AD 300 from Northwest India to Eastern India in the Indo-Gangetic belt and was popular among the people of the time in general and the village communities in particular. The Mahabodhi Pillar depicts the River Goddess as sitting on a ghata (vase or kalash) and black-clouds representing two elephants are pouring water on her head by their trunks, signifying heavy downpour during rainy season. Later, the River Goddess has been identified as the Gaja Lakshmi form of Goddess Lakshmi in the Brahmanical pantheon but it also survived in its pristine form, in the folk tradition of Magadh (in particular) and Bihar (in general) in the form of Chhath Puja.Interestingly, the most significant utensils used on the occasion of Chhath Puja are a holy pot (kalash) and the chaturmukh dwip. The kalash signifies the Mother Earth or Mother Goddess, which proves beyond doubt the inter linkage between the Sun God (male divinity) and the Mother Goddess (female divinity).The Chhath Puja is directly rooted to the well being of the agricultural society as the worship of the Sun God is directly related to the harvesting season of two major crops of Bihar: kharif and rabi. The harvesting time of kharif crops is the month of Kartik (October-November); and that of rabi is Chaitra (March-April).The present form of Chhath Puja was conceived during the medieval period. The various aspects of Chhath Puja got crystallised with the stabilisation of the medieval period as we can see the devotees urge the Sun God to provide them good health, male progeny and wealth (good harvest and monetary gain), a general urge for all classes of the agrarian feudal society of the central Gangetic plain of Bihar.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COCONUT, PAAN AND BANANASSeasonal fruits and vegetables (of the Bihar eco-system) are needed for Chhath Puja, but the only exception is coconut which is known as Kanchan Phal. It signifies that coconut is resistant to rotting for months due to its sclerenchymatous outer cover and can be safely transported from one part of the country to another. In the ancient and the medieval period coconut (but not the green coconut) was very much part of Bihars dietary supplement.Significantly, betel leaf (paan) and bananas had been brought from the Southeast Asian eco-system in the ancient period, probably by Brahmin and Buddhist monks, but both had been internalised in the cultural traditions of India. Both paan and bananas predate the medieval Chhath Puja traditions and are essential part of the rituals.Of late, pineapples and oranges have also become a part of the Chhath Puja offerings.Orange is unknown in the wild state, it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia from ancient times but now, it is available in the market due to the availability of rapid communication. Similarly, pineapples, a fruit of the eco-system of northeastern states, are now readily available in Bihar during the Dala Chhath of Kartik.The use of some of todays common fruits, vegetables and pulses is not seen in use by devotees due to their origin from other eco-systems like potatoes (Latin America), onion (Central Asia), apples (Central Asia), lentil (Central Asia), cauliflower (Syria and Europe), cabbage (Mediterranean countries) among others. Instead, the local edibles are in use e.g. sweet potato, singhara, pomelo, Bengal gram (chana dal) and turmeric saplings.Jaggery (gur) from sugarcane is the traditional sweetener of Indian cultural tradition and is an essential part of Chhath Puja festivities.But now some devotees also use sugar crystals, popularised by the British who opened sugar mills in north Bihar and elsewhere during the early decades of the 20th century.The author is a research writer and freelance journalist.

We have also created 79,000 posts for teachers in various categories. There will be no foul play in employment opportunities for the youth. Anyone trying to fiddle with job opportunities for the youth will land in jail and his property will also be confiscated, said Yogi.Yogi laid foundation stone for infrastructure projects worth Rs 168.68 crore in Ghaziabad, including a political training institute, to come up at a cost of Rs 130 crore. He also formally commissioned projects worth Rs 55 crore in the city that had already been completed. After the public meeting in Patla, the chief minister flew to Indirapuram on a chopper where he participated in the ongoing Uttarakhand Mahagothik Mela.The CM also laid the foundation stone of the new bridge over Hindon river on GT Road. It will be constructed at a cost of Rs 19.43 crore after dismantling the old British-era bridge that has been lying closed for the past one year.The project will be undertaken by UP State Bridge Corporation Limited. The Ghaziabad Development Authority has decided to provide funds for the project after the state public works department backed out."
