The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

Photos: P.K. Badiger and SANTOSH SAGAR: Farmers of two districts marked the new year in an unusual manner. Utter frustration and helplessness drove cabbage growers of some villages in Belagavi district to feed their fresh crop to cattle, while tomato growers in Raichur distributed the produce for free.The crash in prices is being attributed to a glut in the harvest as well as the shortage of cash caused by demonetisation. This has resulted in traders refusing procurement, or quoting low prices.The price of cabbage crashed to Rs. 1 to Rs. 1.2 a kg in some of the wholesale markets in Belagavi district whereas in November, it was selling at Rs. 700 to Rs. 800 a quintal.Tomato growers in Raichur are also in dire straits. When a few farmers brought their produce to the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee yard in Raichur, commission agents and traders refused to offer them more than Rs. 1 a kg. Helpless, they began giving away nearly six quintals of tomatoes for free in the Teenkandil locality of the city.Such a low price does not even meet the cost of cultivation, let alone transportation expenses, said a farmer. There is no point in taking the produce back home as not only is tomato a perishable commodity, it will also incur more transportation charges.A bountiful yield has hardly brought cheer to these farmers. Lakshmanagowda Kadgamdoddi, district president of the Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, alleged that the price crash was a strategy of APMC traders and commission agents, who purchase from tomato growers in other regions and States on credit. Hence, there was no demand for the produce of local growers, who were being forced to sell at whatever price the traders quote, he said."

PHOTO: N. BASHKARANN_BASHKARANA 25-year-old female elephant was shot dead by two men in Ulipandaa village on the fringes of Jawalagiri reserve forest on Monday night.The animal was found dead with two bullet injuries on her forehead on Tuesday morning by the locals, who alerted the officials. The elephant was part of a small migratory herd from the North Cauvery Wild Life Sanctuary that stretches from Karnataka to Tamil Nadu.The accused, whose identity was not known, were from the same village and had allegedly indulged in wild boar hunting in Ulipandaa in the past. Hunting of wild boars is an offence in Tamil Nadu, though the Central government had declared the species to be vermin in a few States.On Monday night, the accused A.Basavaraj (34), son of Anumadhappa, and his friend T.Madesh, son of Thimmarayappa, were reportedly waiting in a tomato field. Basavaraj had taken the land adjoining the tomato field on lease for cultivation.The duo and three other men were waiting for the wild boar, when they spotted the elephant grazing afar. Basavaraj allegedly used his country-made gun to shoot down the elephant.On Tuesday morning, a team consisting of officials from the Forest Department, including Conservator of Forests, Dharmapuri, Ashish Kumar Srivastava, District Forest officer, Hosur, Rajendran, along with Hosur Sub Collector Senthil Raju, accompanied by the police reached Ulipanda on receiving the alert from locals.The Forest Department has booked the men under Section 9, 39 and 51 of Wild Life Protection Act, 1972, and under Section 25(1)(A) of the Indian Arms Act 1959; and under Section 9 B (1) (b) Indian Explosive Substance Act , 1908.The police arrested Madesh and picked up two others in the village, while the prime accused, Basavaraj, is not traceable.Firing unprovokedMr. Srivastava told The Hindu that the accused could not have shot the elephant in self-defence as there were no signs of aggression.A Revenue Department official similarly, said the the accused had taken time to aim at the head of the elephant that was grazing at a distance.A parallel report will be submitted by the Revenue Department to the government.The three-tonne elephant could not be shifted along the difficult unmotorable terrain of the village. Hence, an autopsy was carried on the spot and was buried at the same spot.Quite a few instances of shooting with illegal country-made guns in Thally and Denkanikottai area have been reported over personal enmity."

Prakash Kammardi. This situation has arisen as there is a bountiful harvest of various crops because of good rains in other States as well as countries. Either the cheap crops from other States are entering our markets or there is no demand for our produce in other markets because of glut in their own areas, he said.It is like rubbing salt into the wound of farmers who have already suffered crop losses owing to serious drought or floods as they may have to not only suffer reduction in yield, but also crash in the prices, notes the The Perspective and Forecasting report by the KAPC.According to the commissions report, what has complicated the matter is the impact of demonetisation. This has prevented the recovery of prices of some crops besides leading to a dip in the price of others owing to poor cash flow in the markets, Dr. Kammardi said.The commissions report has pointed out that the prices of tomato and onion have crashed by 84 per cent and 70 per cent respectively, when compared with the earlier level; and that of copra and arecanut have seen a dip of 47 per cent and 7 per cent respectively after demonetisation.The commission has suggested to the State government to take up the issue with NABARD as well as the Union government to increase the daily money withdrawal limit for farm traders in agricultural produce marketing committees (APMC) in the interest of farmers.Pointing out that the norms related to monetary withdrawal limits from banks were relaxed for tea growers of some areas, Dr. Kammardi sought similar benefit to be extended to APMCs as nearly 41 per cent of the trading of farm produce takes place in these markets.This is one of the worst harvest seasons for farmers in terms of prices in the last several decades. This has resulted owing to glut in production in other States/countries coupled with the impact of demonetisation.T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, Chairman, Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission"

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."

The seer, who has been strongly propagating conservation of native cow breeds, was speaking at the Mahamangala of Mangala Gou Yatre organised at Kulur.Asserting that the study of indigenous cattle breeds assumes profound significance, the seer said there should be dedicated universities to study the benefits of cattle products. The cattle has better health benefits that can also get rid of the problems plaguing the country, he said. Karnataka Bank MD and CEO P Jayaram Bhat said the apathy towards traditional agriculture is the result of ignoring cattle-based agrarian activities. Such confernces reinfuse agriculture and spread the significance cattle to the world, he remarked.Dr Sadana from Karnal in Haryana said Panchagavya (prepared using five products of cow - cowdung, urine, milk, curd and ghee) is not just sacred, but also has medicinal value and is rich in proteins. It also helps in keeping nerves and nano particles in the body, he said. Veterinary expert from Bengaluru Dr K P Ramesh said an estimated 40 Desi breeds have survived in the country. Four among them are considered for high yielding milk, 10 with dual benefits and remaining used for laborious works, he added.He said Indian breeds are capable of facing any changes in weather and it is the only reason why most of the scientists across the globe are conducting research into such interest aspects in the cattle, he added.The change in crop pattern, especially by growing tomato in the fields rich with black soil earlier meant for cotton is also a reason for depleting cow breeds. Krishna valley breed is on the verge of extinction due to this reason, he added. Chairman of Agri System Foundation, Coimbatore, Dr E Vadivel said Panchagavya also helps in increasing crop yields. This fact has also been proven in field experiments, he added."

Farmers growing tomatoes are a happy lot as a sudden spurt in prices has brought smiles on their faces but the increased rates are burning a hole in the consumers pocket.A month ago tomatoes were being sold for as low as Rs 5 but today they are available for Rs 30 to Rs 40 depending on their size and quality. Nagaraj of HOPCOMS told DH that tomatoes are supplied to the city from Mysuru taluk but for the past one week only 500 kg of tomatoes were arriving at market places every day. The supply was insufficient to meet the demand. He said a decline in supply was contributing to the recent hike in prices.Farmers who had taken up tomato cultivation on a large scale a few months ago had to face huge losses as the prices crashed due to a bumper yield. With the procurement price going below Rs two per kg, farmers were badly affected. A crate (20 kg) of tomatoes was fetching them around Rs 50 but unable to meet the transportation cost, most of the farmers left the fruits to rot in the plant.With the region affected due to severe drought, only a few farmers equipped with pump sets are growing tomatoes and are seeing a good profit with each kilo of tomato (depending on the quality) fetching them approximately Rs 40.TN dependent on stateWith the neighbouring state Tamil Nadu also facing a shortage, tomatoes grown in Karnataka, especially from Chamarajanagar district, are being supplied in large quantities to Erode, Coimbatore, Madurai, Mettupalayam and also to Kerala.Thanks to the demand, traders are camping in the border district to directly purchase tomatoes from farmers who are being paid Rs 20 per kg at their doorsteps. The direct sales have resulted in tomatoes not reaching markets and also effecting a sudden hike in prices. Only 200 crates of tomatoes are being supplied to the market every day in Chamarajanagar district. Some farmers in Gundlupet and Hanur are growing tomatoes extensively to supply to the Kerala market."

Those conquistadors  the Spanish and the Portuguese  sailing in on their schooners, clippers and frigates, touched down in India and brought with them these fruits of labour from the New World. With the infusion of these vegetables  especially the chilli  Indian cooking techniques were never the same again.While that's history for you, here is a lesson in statistics. India produces the highest quantity of chillies in the world. We are also the world's biggest exporter and consumer of the product. Over one-third of the country's chilli is produced in one region  the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana belt, which also gives us one of our most prized peppers, the diabolically hot Guntur chilli.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Nagaland to Rajasthan , our soil produces some of the world's most bewildering variety of chillies. Take the examples of the Kashmiri mirch (flavourful yet zingy) or the byadagi from Karnataka (pungent and eye-watering). And then there are those northeast bombshells  the dalle from Sikkim and the dhani lanka from Meghalaya, Tripura and Bengal.And finally, above all else, is the bhoot jolokia. Cultivated across the northeast, especially in Assam , Nagaland and Manipur, it is also called naga mirch, u-morok and ominously, the ghost chilli. Consistently proven to be one of the hottest peppers in the world, it was at one time being considered for use in tear gas shells. A bite of the bhoot jolokia can numb your mind and transport you into an otherworldly zone of intensely painful euphoria. It's not for the faint-hearted. All of this is to point out that whether the chilli came from Mexico or wherever else, nowhere is it as celebrated as in India. From curries and pastes, to pickles and salads, there's some mirchi in almost everything we eat. Chillies are a rich source of Vitamin C and are loaded with antioxidants that help fight cancer. They act as digestives and have no calories. It's time we stopped being apologetic about our hot and pungent food and embraced its fiery goodness. After all, what's life without a little mirchi?This is amma's special recipe from the kitchens of Andhra and its not for the faint-hearted. Andhra cuisine is famous for its spicy dishes and mamsam guntu, as the name suggests, uses the eye-watering Guntur chilli in liberal doses. Made with chicken or mutton, this delicacy really rubs it in with a pungent mix of chillies and ground condiments and also a generous helping of green chillies to top up the heat. As you bite into the succulent pieces of meat, be sure you'll shed tears. Whether these are of joy or regret depends on your capacity to weather hot food. You can try this dish with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee. Trust us, it will be an unforgettable experience.Taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling.

With the onset of the tomato season, farmers have moved away from jowar for higher returns.In Shivamogga, the cost has risen steeply as a tonne of fodder, which cost about Rs. 5,800 in March/April 2016, is now being sold at Rs. 11,000 to milk producers coming under the Shivamogga Milk Union Ltd., which covers Shivamogga, Davangere and Chitradurga districts.The situation is similar in Dakshina Kannada and Udupi, where the cost of fodder has increased from Rs. 11 / Rs. 12 to Rs. 15 / Rs. 16 a kg.Sources in the Karnataka Milk Federation acknowledged the shortage but said the federation was confident of sailing through the dry season as many places in the high milk-producing centres had received rainfall.The Animal Husbandry Department confirmed that there was a shortage of fodder.We have established fodder banks but they can meet only part of the demand. Fodder is being given at highly subsidised cost of Rs. 2 a kg, an official said."

I had cultivated tomato on a two-acre plot and invested Rs. 2 lakh. Now, at the time of harvest, the rates have crashed, said Nagarajappa, a farmer in Mallasandra, Kolar taluk. I am going to suffer a loss of a minimum of Rs. 1.5 lakh, he said.Currently, tomatoes are being cultivated on an estimated 9,850 acres of land across Kolar district.Most farmers are struggling to get the produce into the market, and they feel it is not worth the effort. We are not even able to cover the cost of labour and transportation, K.M. Nagaraj of Srinivasapur taluk said.Varying pricesThe lack of standardisation in prices is also cause for concern.For instance, a 15 kg box fetched only Rs. 25 at Srinivasapur APMC yard on Saturday, which is less than Rs. 2 per kg. However, at Kolar APMC, the rates were marginally better: a 15 kg box was going for anywhere between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 (about Rs. 4 per kg) on Saturday.Only a month ago, tomatoes fetched on an average Rs. 150 to Rs. 200 for a 15 kg box, which is around Rs. 13 per kg. Farmers were relatively happy with this price.A farmer can reap profit only if they get at least Rs. 300 per 15 kg box. The government should come forward to provide relief to the farmers, said P.R. Suryanarayan, president, Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha district unit, Kolar.Price variations are forcing farmers to leave tomatoes to rot in the field. Dumping of tomato on the roadside has become a common scene in the district.However, while there is a glut in the market as more farmers have taken up tomato cultivation, the slump in demand in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu is being seen as the main reason for the crash in price. Farmers in these two States have cultivated tomato on a large scale resulting in lesser demand for Kolar tomatoes, claimed farmers."

An abundance of the produce has led to a crash in prices, dashing the hopes of farmers.While farmers in Kolar, Karnataka, dumped tomatoes on the road after the prices collapsed to a new low of Rs. 2 per kg last week from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a month ago, violent protests broke out in parts of Telangana after a good yield of the commodity in the two Telugu-speaking States brought down the prices from a high of Rs. 10,000 per quintal last year to a measly Rs. 2,500 this year.In Maharashtra, the demand for tur, which rode a wave of high prices last year, plummeted after its production went up from 4.44 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 20.35 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. So was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the State into despair.While most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.After the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned Dr. R.S. Deshpande, former Director of the Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.Most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.Chilli woesA long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.However, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from April first week. As the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even Rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior Telangana Agriculture Department official told The Hindu . But, it was not to be. The Centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in Telangana with a support price of Rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another Rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.The crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in Maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.Few takers for grapesThe suicide of 36-year-old Manik Randive and 25-year-old Chetan Vasal, both from Nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.Despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. According to Shriram Gadhave, president, Vegetable Growers Association of India, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full. The average input cost per acre of grape was Rs. 3 lakh. Yet farmers were selling their produce at barely Rs. 2 lakh, he said.According to him, in April last year, more than 95% of the grape harvest was plucked by wholesalers and wine-makers from farmers gardens.Farmers even received a decent rate of Rs. 40-42 per kg. This year, barely 75% of the picking had been completed while the average rate was a paltry Rs. 8 a kg.Dent in tur pricesTur dal, which hit the headlines last year with its skyrocketing prices, has suffered a dent in its demand this year after large scale production. In Maharashtra, production of tur went up from 4.4 lakh tonnes last year to 20.35 lakh tonnes during 2016-17, bringing down the prices by a huge margin.The total purchase by the government through its agencies at a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 5,050 per quintal was only around 4 lakh tonnes while another five lakh tonnes had been sold at rates lesser than the MSP through the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC). Several lakh tonnes remain unsold.But, even during the season of scarcity, rarely do farmers benefit. For instance, even though a consumer paid almost Rs. 220 for a kg of tur dal last year, the farm gate price was just Rs. 45 to Rs. 50, said Dr. Deshpande. Does it take Rs. 170 to convert whole tur to edible tur dal, he wondered.Echoing Dr. Deshpandes views on the cobweb phenomenon, Mr. Srinivas, a progressive farmer from T. Narsipura near Mysuru, said he gave up tomato cultivation this year as many farmers began growing the vegetable on a large scale in the region after it realised a good price.( With inputs f romLaiqh A Khan in Mysuru, B Chandrashekar in Hyderabad, Shoumojit Banerjee in Pune and Alok Deshpande in Mumbai )"

Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in Maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.Whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. But whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. For one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. For instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. Thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.Price fluctuationsSecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. Grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. This comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. When farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. Farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.Such competition though is precisely what is missing from the Indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. Red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. The result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in India is wasted because of it. This, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. Wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. This significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. By some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. Thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing Indian farmers."

Its their ATM in fact. The rural economy here would have been battered but for African Tall Maize (ATM).The crop is providing an assured and steady income for farmers while also boosting dairy farming with a regular supply of fodder for cattle. ATM, a low water-intensive crop, is being grown throughout the year now as a fodder crop.Concerted efforts by local farmers, the Karnataka Milk Federation (KMF) and the Kolar district administration in encouraging cultivation of ATM are now paying dividends.Suresh is among the many farmers in Doddahasahalla village of Kolar taluk who have entered into an agreement with the local milk cooperative union to grow ATM. ""Earlier, I used to grow tomato or other vegetables, he says. The problem with tomato is that you are never sure of the income. If all goes well, I might make Rs 1.5 lakh per acre in one season and almost nothing the next.""Fed up with unpredictable rains and unreliable support prices, Suresh decided to grow ATM. Now he is assured of around Rs 50,000 per acre with the ATM fodder pre-sold to dairy farmers in his village.M Venkatesh, a farmer of E Kamballi village is an ATM fan too. ""Earlier, it was difficult to get fodder, especially in the summer.We used to import dried fodder from Andhra or Tamil Nadu which is not good for cattle,"" he said. It was also a costly affair, as each kilo of dry fodder costs Rs 10-15. Due to ATM initiative ,farmers like Venkatesh are now getting fresh fodder for less than half that amount.Dry fodder, according to Dr Chennakeshava, deputy director of animal husbandry, causes a lot of complications for cattle. ""Apart from causing blisters in their mouths, dry fodder results in kidney stones among cattle and reduces the quality and quantity of milk produced,"" he said.Dr Srinivas Gowda, deputy manager of KMF, said that since November 2016, the states Animal Husbandry Department and KMF have distributed almost 70,000 mini-kits of ATM seeds. He said agreements are being made with farmers to grow all the fodder that is required to feed cattle in the district. ""ATM fodder has increased the quantity of milk generated by two to three litres per animal, he added.Speaking to New Indian Express, Dr K V Thrilok Chandra, deputy commissioner of Kolar district, explained that such a project was essential, as 90 per cent of the 2.76 lakh heads of cattle in the district were milch cows. ""Since starting this project, the solid not fat (SNF) content of milk too has increased, making farmers eligible for incentives offered by the state government,""he said.Though there are several other projects to improve water availability, and others are being implemented in the district, the ATM project has impacted many people in a short period. Maintaining that Kolar is the first district where fodder cultivation is being taken up on a large scale, he said the model can be emulated elsewhere to ensure income security for farmers."

Thanks good monsoon, the third advance estimates of foodgrain production is 273.38 million tonnes in 2016-17, higher than the second advance estimates in of 271.98 MT and final estimates of 251.57 MT in 2015-16. Farm growth for the full fiscal has zoomed to 4.9%, compared with a near flat 0.7% expansion in 2015-16. If the forecast of the India Meteorology Department (IMD) for this year holds true, the grain output will set a new record, boosting the growth rate. This is good news for the economy. After two years of back-to-back drought, in 2014-15 and 2015-16, we can look forward acche din (better days) in future.Increased production does not necessary mean more income for farmers. In fact, the pattern of bumper crops and dejected farmers has become a recurring feature of Indian agriculture. Farmers in some states are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka and pulses cultivators in Maharashtra are confronted with a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Even Punjab, known as the granary of India, has turned into a hotspot for farmer suicides. The Centre last month informed the Supreme Court that over 12,000 suicides had been reported in the agricultural sector every year since 2013. The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu accounted for over 87% of them.According to the Economic Survey 2016-17, the average annual income of a rural household in 17 states is a paltry Rs 20,000, less than the annual mobile bill of some upwardly-mobile citizen in a city. This is primarily because the benefits from his labour are cornered by intermediaries in the market. Instead of the policy obsession with agricultural growth rates, the focus must shift to ensuring fair deal to the farmers. Apart from effective implementation of marketing reforms recently initiated by the Centre through the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act, this require more and better managed investment in agriculture. In 2014, the BJP had come to power promising profitability in agriculture by ensuring a minimum of 50% profits over the cost of production, cheaper agriculture inputs and credit, introducing latest technologies for farming and high-yielding seeds, and linking MGNREGA to agriculture. After three years in power, the government is nowhere near even partial fulfilment of those promises."

A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

But what has come as a reprieve was that the prices of essential veggies such as onion and tomato, had stayed below Rs 30 per kg.Summers usually see rise in vegetable prices due to water shortage and decreased arrivals of produce. Traders say that almost all supplies to Chennai are coming from other States and hence the transport cost adds to the vegetable prices. They say the prices have been on the rise for last one week.In the wholesale market at Koyambedu, onion, which was sold at Rs 12 per kg, is now sold at Rs 17. Tomato and potato, which were sold at 15 per kg, are now sold at Rs 25 and beans sold at Rs 60.Sales are dull. When the cost is high, people tend to buy less; they buy something like half kg instead of 1 or 2 kg. But, only when we increase the prices we get decent profit, says Badriswamy, vegetable vendor, Koyambedu.Traders say most of the vegetables and fruits are transported from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In such cases, the cost of production and transportation falls on the vendors and traders and as a result, price rise happens and burdens the buyers.This is the case every year. Vegetables and fruits are very essential. Demand will always exist, but sometimes it is not met with sufficient supply. Hence the price rise to which Ive clearly reconciled myself, says Rathna.In Aminjikarai market, prices are at peak. Brinjal is sold at Rs 80 per kg and tomato at Rs 30. A sack of onion, earlier sold at Rs 400, is now sold at Rs 800 and 1 kg onion is sold at 20 kg.

S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said several vegetables are now at least 40% costlier than last month. Usually, the prices of vegetables that escalate during summer begin to drop from mid-June. But, as the drought situation continues across the State and also in neighbouring States, vegetables may remain expensive till July, he said.Onion, tomato and potato are the only vegetables that are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per kg. Cabbage and snake gourd are also being preferred more by some customers as they are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kg in the wholesale market. Several customers have cut down on their volume of purchase. Beans and carrots are expensive.Low yieldP.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flower Merchants Welfare Association, said: Even the locally grown green chillies and brinjals are priced high this month as the yield is less across the State.

Traders at the Koyambedu market noted that 1 kg of tomato costs up to Rs. 45 in the wholesale market and Rs. 5-Rs. 10 more in the retail market.The market gets only around half of its usual 60 truckloads a day.Traders said Koyambedu usually gets tomatoes of different varieties from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. As summer was harsh this time, the yield has been less.S. Chandran, president of Koyambedu Vegetable Market Licensed Merchants Association, said, Many customers are buying only a quarter of what they usually purchase, especially when it comes to tomatoes, carrots and beans that are costly. This has pulled down the sales by 30% in the wholesale market. While carrots cost up to Rs. 55 a kg, beans are priced at Rs. 65. Green peas and small onions are also among the expensive vegetables and are being sold for Rs. 100-Rs. 110 a kg in the wholesale market.Change likelyTraders expect the prices to stabilise slightly when the Tamil month of Aadi begins in mid-July as weddings and functions are not held then and the demand will come down.

There is no definite cause for the increase, with middlemen at Vashi APMC blaming ambiguous causesfrom November's demonetisation to the farmers' strike in June as well as ""inclement weather"".Contrary to traders' claims there is no visible shortage either. Good quality, robust red tomatoes are available at all markets in Mumbai. Curiously, retail rates are rising even as wholesale rates continue to fall.APMC trader Shyam Yadav said, ""Wholesale rates rose to Rs 55-60 per kg over Friday-Saturday. On Monday, they dropped to Rs 36-40. Let us see what happens tomorrow.""Conversely, retail rates were Rs 35-40 per kg over Friday-Saturday, perhaps due to leftover stocks, which spiralled to Rs 60-80 Monday as retailers charged their pound of flesh. ""I bought half a kilo for Rs 30 to tide over the next two days.

Moreover, Shravan observances are set to begin on July 10 for north Indian communities and July 24 for Maharashtrians and Gujaratis. During this time families avoid onion and garlic and rely on tomato.One of the largest middlemen in the tomato trade at APMC Vashi, Javed Memon, cited a slew of reasons which seemed tough to swallow. ""This price increase is an outcome of notebandi. Recently there was also the farmers' strike in Maharashtra. Moreover, I am told the seeds have failed in south India. So this season we are relying on tomatoes from Maharashtra where a heat wave has beset certain growing areas. Also, remember that farmers have not been getting a good rate for their produce since the past year and a half. It is time they made some money.""Asked when customers would get relief, Memon said, ""Don't think of customers. Why think of customers alone, think of the farmer as well."" TOI asked if farmers were getting good rates at present. ""Well, not to their satisfaction. After all, the quality of their tomatoes is poor,"" the middleman said, adding prices would remain high till end-August.Mumbai receives its quota of tomato from cultivated areas in Karnataka, as well as Satara, Sangli and Narayangaon in Pune."

A scene from the Ernakulam market on Tuesday.Thulasi KakkatThere seems to be no respite to the common man as vegetable prices in the district continue to remain largely high, with tomato, onion and carrot being especially costly.At the Ernakulam market, small onion was sold at a wholesale price of Rs. 90 per kg and a retail price of Rs. 100 whereas tomato and carrot were sold at Rs. 52 and Rs. 60 and Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 respectively. Prices were even higher in some other markets.On an average, vegetable prices continue to be 20 per higher than what it was a month ago, though prices of some vegetables have dropped slightly, said K.K. Ashraf, vice-president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.Price of shallotsThe only relief seems to be the declining trend in the price of shallots after touching a high of Rs. 130 recently, though the ruling retail price of Rs. 100 per kg is a far cry from Rs. 65 in April. Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

According to an official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka.In May, tomato cultivators in Kolar were dumping their crop by the roadside as prices had crashed to as low as Rs. 2 a kg in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard. This month, however, the tide has turned. Rates have doubled and, in some cases, increased four times since June. Kolar district is one of the biggest producers of tomato in Karnataka.The reason for this change in narrative is a massive loss of the crop in some of the major tomato growing States in the country.Huge damage to crops, particularly in Nashik in Maharashtra, is the main reason for increase in demand from Kolar. Plus, damage to crop due to diseases and pests in non-traditional areas such as Mandya has added to the scarcity, said M.S. Raju, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department.According to A. Vishwanath, an APMC official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka. Another APMC source said that there has been interest even from Punjab. On June 4, a quintal was being sold at the APMC for a minimum of Rs. 314 and a maximum of Rs. 1,400 depending on quality and variety. On July 4, the price range was from Rs. 667 to Rs. 5,334 a quintal. On Wednesday morning, the average rate was around Rs. 5,000.In the retail market, consumers were paying Rs. 10 per kg a month ago. Now, they have to shell out as much as Rs. 50.Search for alternativesA reduction in supply from other States and districts combined with the produce from Kolar being shipped out of Karnataka has led to a scarcity and a steep hike in prices in the local market.This has led to experimenting with other local products.

Fall in production in neighbouring States owing to climatic factors has led to an increase in prices of many vegetables.Tomato and okra are among the vegetables that have shown a significant increase in recent days. In Chala, tomato costs between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg, but retail prices elsewhere in the city go up to Rs. 80 a kg.Shallots continue to make homemakers shed tears, with prices ranging from Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale to Rs. 140 in retail shops for the best quality.SeasonalSays a commission agent at Chala: Prices are on the rise owing to a drop in production. This is seasonal. Take onion for instance. As onion prices are low in producer States following bumper production, not many farmers will be inclined to grow onion. Those who do will get a good price next year as prices will increase when supply dwindles. This is also the case with shallots. With less stock availability, prices are bound to shoot up. However, there has been a dip in wholesale prices of shallots, he points out. Though shallots havent been reaching the market from Tamil Nadu, an improvement in climate in the crop-growing areas in Karnataka holds out some hope for a further reduction in prices.Yet there are vegetables such as thadiyan kaya which cost Rs. 35 a kg now. I dont remember it exceeding Rs. 20 a kg in recent times, he says.Another wholesale agent says that following a shortfall in tomato production in some States, traders from there reached Karnataka markets, affecting the supply to Kerala. The prices have shot up this much within a fortnight, says a retail vegetable seller.While cowpea (payar) is available for Rs. 40 a kg at Chala, the nadan variety costs Rs. 90-100.Green chilli has not lost its bite either, with prices hovering around Rs. 60 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 70 for retail.Carrot cost around Rs. 60, though cheaper ones can be had for Rs. 45 a kg, says an agent for a farmers producer company. There are three to four types of carrots and beans available, and prices vary for each. Carrot, from Rs. 54 the day before, has increased to Rs. 62. Beans is priced at Rs. 62.Daily fluctuations too have a role to play, and over the course of a week, prices may show a substantial increase or decrease. For instance, okra that cost Rs. 57 a kg a week ago has dipped to Rs. 36 for wholesale and Rs. 40 for retail. Drumstick price too has come down to Rs. 50 a kg. Indian cucumber though is expensive.One retailer at Chala says good quality carrots are available for less than Rs. 50 a kg. But okra in his shop costs Rs. 50 a kg, though it used to cost less than Rs. 20 a kg a month ago.QualityA couple of retailers say they stock the best quality and hence prices are on the higher side for their veggies. Yet, this argument does not go down well with customers who complain of being fleeced.Price intervention, however, does not work much, say the traders.Prices of vegetables that are expensive now will come down in a month or so, some say. Yet others think the trend will continue till Chingam."

Even as the State got its share of rains, price of the vegetable continues to skyrocket.Sources said, tomato is priced at `70 to `80 a kg in the open market which is almost three times the cost of the vegetable that was being sold at `25 a kg a month ago.The unprecedented price rise has been attributed to supply crunch. While the Capital city requires 100 tonnes of tomato daily, it is now getting half of it. Apart from the locally grown crops, the State depends mostly on Karnataka for the vegetable.According to traders, the red vegetable was priced at `100 a kilo at the Unit-IV market on Thursday. The price, however, came down to `70 on Friday though in some areas it is being sold at `80 a kg.Secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the price fluctuation in the market depends on the demand and supply. The supply has been very less from the tomato producing States, he said.Blaming the State Government for the situation, he said, farmers in Keonjhar and Angul region were forced to sell tomatoes at throwaway price during summer. The Government could have purchased the vegetable from the farmers at a reasonable price and stored it for the season. Unfortunately, despite repeated demands, it has failed to set up required number of cold storages, he pointed out.The traders alleged that the retail price is high compared to the wholesale price as the Government has failed to control it. The retail price is 20 to 30 per cent high than the wholesale price, Panda said claiming it should be 5 to 10 per cent depending on the commodity.

The impact is also felt all over the South and the northern States. Currently, the crop is not raised in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan due to adverse climatic conditions. These two States are the usual competitors to the Madanapalle grades.During the last one month, the tomato trade has been playing truant with not only the farmers, but also agents from across India, and the domestic retail market in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Bellary (Karnataka). The price which stood at Rs. 20 a kg in the first week of June started taking giant leaps week after week, and now reached a level virtually creating panic among the public at Rs. 100 a kg.Alarming dip in arrivalsAs per the latest trend, the wholesale market price on Monday stood at Rs. 78 per kg (first grade) and the second grade at Rs. 48-54 per kg (based on quality and size). The arrival for the day was 241 metric tonnes. There had been an alarming dip in the arrivals since a week from 400 MT last week, followed by 311 MT on Thursday last and 277 MT on Sunday. In contrast, arrivals peaked to 750 MT per day in June-July 2016.The first grade stock, forming 40% of the arrivals, is exported to the metros in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and MP and some malls in Tirupati, Chittoor and Srikalahasti in the district. The second grade is sent to the urban centres of Chittoor district with a mind-blowing retail price at Rs. Rs. 90-100 a kg in vegetable markets and petty shops.This is double the wholesale price. Same situation is reported from elsewhere in towns of surrounding districts of Anantapur, Kadapa; and bordering Kolar and Chikballapur districts of Karnataka, while the price is even slightly up in the border areas of Tamil Nadu. The steep hike is attributed to the damage of the stock during transit, escalation of transportation charges and poor shelf life.Turns invisibleThe impact is clearly felt on the hotel industry and households.A majority of home-makers are forced to substitute the prized vegetable with tamarind juice. The roadside eateries and pani-poori carts are doubly cautious while using it; and it has turned invisible in salads of considerably big restaurants and bars. Though most customers tend to avoid buying it, retail and petty traders are not affected by the scenario, with the smooth disposal of small stocks thanks to a limited number of customers essentially in need of the temporarily unreachable vegetable. Meanwhile, traders said the situation would ease by mid August."

The cost at the Koyambedu wholesale market itself was `90, with the price steadily increasing as traders from far-flung areas sauntered in to buy.Traders reckon that the trend is likely to continue for some more months.In the markets of neighbouring Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka where the crop is usually auctioned, we have to offer higher procurement price because of competition from traders from North India, M Thiagarajan, president, Koyambedu Vegetable, Fruit and Flower Sellers Welfare Association told Express.The cost of tomato has gone up northern states, prompting more traders to visit Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, he added. This has led to a sharp fall in arrivals in Chennai which usually gets 800 tonnes of tomato a day. It has shrunk now to 400 tonnes.Apart from the meagre quantity of tomato from Krishnagiri, which accounts for only about five per cent, the traders at Koyambedu pick up bulk of the produce from Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka.We used to get tomatoes from Dindigul, Theni, North Arcot, Vellore, Dharmapuri, Kaveripattnam etc. But because of the failed monsoon and farmers not getting enough money for their produce, there is a scarcity, added Thiagarajan, urging the State government to look into the issue.Vendors, too, have demanded timely action from the government to solve this problem. Water scarcity and other woes faced by farmers must be addressed soon to prevent the prices from rising further. Skyrocketing prices are a pain to both vendors and public, said S Senthil Kumar, a trader at the market.While the price of tomatoes has gone up substantially, those of other vegetables, though slightly high, are more or less stable, said M Abdul Khader, joint secretary, Koyambedu Wholesale Merchants Association.A key ingredient in Tamil cuisine, tomatos steep price is really burning holes in the pockets of people here. Just seeing the prices of tomatoes makes me faint. It adds further strain to our weekly budget, said S Mythili, a homemaker from Vepery.S Sundari, a domestic worker lamented that her family was forced to have curds instead of curries and rasam for which tomato is an indispensible ingredient."

But due to incessant rain in that state, movement of vehicles has been affected in last one month. We see supply of close to 150 truckloads of vegetables every day, but now hardly 50 of them are arriving. Again, this is a month of marriages and functions, so a lot of supply is going there.

Consumers are perplexed with the sudden rise.Tomato is something that we use almost in every recipe. With the prices shooting up, it has become very difficult for middle class people like us.

Traders said the prices will continue to soar for the next few weeks due to the lack of supply from the local region.The Tamil month of Aadhi begins on Monday. It is the month of festivals and ceremonies, and feasts are held in temples throughout this month. Accordingly, the prices of vegetables go up during this season due to the increased demand. However, this year the price of tomato, which was Rs 30/kg during the same season last year, has already touched Rs 80/kg in the wholesale market, indicating that this is also going to be an expensive festive season. Central Market tomato traders association president R S P Sekhar said that they usually get around 10,000 boxes of tomatoes daily at the market, with each box containing 15 kilograms of tomatoes, but now the supply has dropped to only 4000 boxes.The price of one box of tomato in the wholesale market was Rs 1,000 on Sunday, and it sold at Rs 60/kg in the Central market, but the better quality fruits were priced at Rs 80, he said. The same was witnessed at the farmers markets in the city.K Ramesh of Viswanathapuram, said that he had gone to the Chokkikulam farmers market, where he was not given the liberty to pick the tomatoes. ""I was told all the fruits were good and that one kilogram cost Rs 80, so I bought half a kilogram because he price is too high to be burdened with a couple of rotten tomatoes,'' he said.In Anna Nagar, S Ganeswari purchased a quarter kilogram for Rs 24. ""A kilogram was being sold for Rs 96 and the trader told me he would give it for Rs 95 if I purchased a kilogram. Who wants to buy tomatoes for so much?'' she said. V Chellam , a trader, said that the supply from the local farms in Theni and Dindigul district, where tomato is usually cultivated in thousands of acres, was almost nil at present and the market was getting its supply from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh . ""There doesn't seem to be a possibility of getting supplies from the local farmers at least for the next two months, so the price will only continue to go up and may touch Rs 100 in the wholesale market soon,'' he said."

This has forced them to hike rates urging us also to maintain the same. There will be no relief until this changes,"" said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.TOI had reported last week that poor rain in Maharashtra and Karnataka had led to a serious shortage in crop output. Resultantly leading to the low tomato produce and subsequent shortage.Weather parameters in Goa have also played foul for vendors in Goa. ""While supplying freshly-harvested tomatoes to the state, some of the stock got ruined after being hit by rains along Goa's ghats. Tomatoes unlike onions and potatoes cannot be hoarded and are easily perishable,"" said another vendor.They further added that rates will continue to remain high for another fortnight or so. Until then, tomatoes continue to be out of the common man's reach.Sharing his thoughts on the scenario, agriculture director Ulhas Pai Kakode said, ""Currently, there is low tomato stock in the market available for sale, therefore the exorbitant rates.

But their efforts fell through as they could not get credit without providing non-agricultural assets as collateral guarantee, pointed out Executive Director G.V. Ramanjaneyulu of Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA).The 30% tax on farmers cooperative societies was a big dampener and just like the IT sector, there should be a tax holiday for farmers cooperative societies to get them into the market system, he suggested, at a recent workshop on Bangaru Telangana and Sustainable Development Goals attended by government officials and agriculture experts.While the proposed Rs. 4,000 financial assistance per acre to be extended to farmers by the Telangana government was welcome, it would do well to adopt Karnatakas model of having a State-level price mechanism to compensate farmers if prices fell below the floor price. Meagre farm incomes as against rising cost of living, lack of support systems for credit access or for marketing the produce, high cost of production and no commensurate support prices have resulted in growing debt burden and farmers suicides, observed Dr. Ramanjaneyulu.The government, which brought out agricultural action plans, should also be submitting review reports and data related to how many farmers got the credit and minimum support price etc., should be kept in the public domain. And, when prices of vegetables like tomato suffer wide variations from Rs. 1 a kg to Rs. 100 a kg, States should not brook delay in pushing for one country, one market to benefit both farmers and consumers.Farmers have been cultivating only three to four main crop varieties across all areas increasing the risk factor as all areas would not be suitable for all crops, therefore cropping pattern changes has to be crucial. For instance, cotton being cultivated in 40 lakh acres this season could be a risky proposition. Same goes with paddy, a water intensive crop, he says.Dr. Ramanjeyalu also alludes to the fact that TS accounted for the highest fertiliser consumption in the country which means the farmers cost of production has only increased even as the soil health took a hit."

Picture by Ashwinee PatiTomato prices have soared in the past month, from Rs 25 per kilogram to Rs 100-Rs 110 per kilogram in Bhubaneswar. Lelin Mallick of The Telegraph speaks to traders, residents, and experts to find out the rationale behind the price rise The problem Tomato was being sold at Rs 25 a kilogram in various city markets just a month ago. The state's tomato farmers resorted to agitation in March and dumped quintals of the fruit on the roads to protest against distress sale. The price of the crop had even dipped to Re 1 per kilogram in Keonjhar, Angul and Bargarh during the summer, spurring the Opposition Congress and the BJP to demonstrate against the government. Reason behind the price rise The city is dependant on Karnataka for supply tomato with 20 trucks arriving daily. It has come down to three to four trucks over the past few days. Traders said the city's daily requirement was 100 tonnes of tomato, the supply of which has come down by almost 80 per cent. Traders fear that the price would touch Rs 100 in a couple of days. The city is reliant on Bengal, Karnataka and Himachal Pradesh for the crop. Low yield in Bengal led to a stop in tomato imports to the city. Besides, fresh crop from Karnataka reaches the city in a week. Traders said the state capital never depended on locally grown tomato during monsoon. Price difference The wholesale price of the fruit is Rs 60 per kilogram but when it reaches the retailers, the price rises by Rs 20 (around 30 per cent). Traders attributed the difference to the crop's perishable nature. They also said the crop couldn't be stored for long. Improvement likely Traders said the situation was likely to improve in a week or two. ""We have to wait for fresh produce, either from Karnataka or Himachal Pradesh, which may take another one to two weeks,"" said secretary of the Raw Vegetable Merchants' Association, Kabiraj Swain. State's role The state government attributed sale of tomato at throwaway prices in various districts to over production of the crop. But it had failed to set up adequate cold storages to store tomato, which has been witnessing frequent price rise along with onion. Public opinion ""The crop used to be sold at cheaper rates in the summer, but the state government failed to arrange proper facility to store the crop. If the government had managed to store the crop properly, the price might not have skyrocketed during the rains. Tomato has become a luxury even for the middle class,"" said Deepak Panigrahi, a sales executive and resident of Bhubaneswar."

An Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) official told TOI that demand for French beans dips in the rainy season."" Because of that, supplies to the markets also come down. Excessive rains tend to affect some crops adversely,"" he said.Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said French bean prices have been on an upswing for about a month now.""Before Friday, French beans were sold at Rs60 per kg in the retail market. On Friday however, the price doubled, to Rs120 per kg. On Friday, the wholesale markets had no supply of French Beans, which caused the prices to rise,"" Pathan said of the situation.Tomatoes too are being sold between Rs80 and Rs100 in most retail markets. Kailash Kolhe, a vegetable vendor in Koregaon Park, said, ""We buy tomatoes from wholesalers at Rs70 per kg, and sell them at Rs80 per kg. Intense rain spells in tomato growing regions is ruining the crop, apart from making the harvested tomatoes pale in colour,"" Kolhe said. With 50% less supply of tomatoes in the market, the cost of tomatoes has continued to spiral upwards in the last few weeks. With less availability of tomatoes, the prices will continue to remain this way, stated sources from APMC.However, improved production is supposed to bring down tomato prices from mid-August and September.According to sources in the market, during last month's farmers' strike, many tillers had destroyed their standing crop as they were not sure how long the strike would go on for. Incessant rains too played spoilsport, bringing down production. However, the APMC hopes that things would improve and markets would normalize by August.Dilip Khire of Pune APMC added that incessant rains had damaged tomato crops and supply from farmers had depleted, which had caused the prices to rise over the last two months. Gadhve said that Narayangaon, which is one of the largest tomato suppliers, was seeing only 25% supply in the last two months.""There are about 70-80 villages in Narayangaon that supply tomatoes. With less production, we are only getting 200 metric tonne instead of 800 metric tonne of tomatoes during the same period last year,"" he said. He further added that the tomatoes coming from North India, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have reduced.Meanwhile, vegetable vendor Nanasaheb Awate from NIBM Road said that since the wholesale prices of tomatoes had gone up, he can no longer afford to buy it, and so stopped stocking the vegetable at his stall.""The prices of all vegetables increased during the monsoon and tomatoes are practically impossible to get. For the last three days, my vegetable vendor has not been keeping tomatoes at his stall, so I've not been able to buy,"" said working professional Nina Shah."

The price of tomato is shooting up faster than the Sensex. The buzz in the markets is that a dip in production across the country has led to a shortfall in supply, coinciding with the season when local produce is not available. The price of tomato has increased by almost Rs 40 a kilo in the Maniktala market since Metro first highlighted the upswing on July 11. The produce currently available in Calcutta markets is mostly from Karnataka. Tomato becomes dearer between late June and early or mid-August, when the city becomes dependent on supplies from Karnataka. The markets are flooded with produce from within Bengal for around five months before that. Several retailers said the price rise this year was abnormal. College teacher Debayan Basu, who lives in Maniktala, bought tomato for Rs 120 a kilo last week. ""I do not remember when I last paid so much for this vegetable,"" he said. Compared to Maniktala, the price of a kilo of tomato is at present lower in New Market (Rs 80) and Lake Market (Rs 90). Abhijit Kumar Nandi, head of the department of agricultural economics at Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswa Vidyalaya, linked the abnormal price rise to less than normal production in the last crop year (July to June). ""During the 2015-16 crop year, tomato production in India was very good, because of which farmers did not get the price they expected,"" he said. After taking a price hit in the 2015-16 crop year, wary farmers apparently scaled down production in the subsequent year, which meant less supply to markets like Bengal. ""The total area under tomato cultivation was smaller in 2016-17 because farmers did not want a rerun of 2015-16. They preferred growing other crops instead. They feared that they may again incur losses if supply of tomatoes is higher than demand,"" Nandi said. The second factor in the price rise is that produce from Bengal has long disappeared from the markets. Tomato is grown in the state in winter. During that period, the price of the vegetable plummets because of abundant supply. Besides farmers reducing the area of cultivation, climatic conditions have had a role to play in the quantity of production this year. Tomato being essentially a cold crop, the shortening of winter is having an effect on productivity."

As prices touched 120, the sale of tomatoes decreased due to the drop in buying capacity of people. Markets across the city started to take less orders of tomatoes from us. This has naturally brought down the prices,"" said R Soundarrajan, a wholesale dealer in Koyambedu, which is the market from where other smaller dealers take orders.Along with tomato, prices of other vegetables have also begun to drop.

Varamahalakshmi Vratha on Friday marks the beginning of a three-month-long season of festivities.Traders at the agricultural produce and marketing committee (APMC) premises in Kolar, which happens to be Asia's second-largest tomato market, attributed the dip in prices to increase in supply.""Though the demand for tomatoes has remained constant for a month, supply has increased by 20% to 30%, with the produce coming from places like Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh and Challakere of Chitradurga district in Karnataka. Favourable weather has resulted in a good yield in these places and farmers are bringing in additional truckloads of tomatoes to Kolar every day.

(Hardeep Singh) A week after the state food and civil supplies department directed traders to fix the retail price of tomato between Rs 75 and Rs 80 per kg, residents in Ranchi are continuing to pay anything between Rs 100 and Rs 120 a kilo. Homemakers rue that the rates are fluctuating from not just market to market, but from vendor to vendor. While Saraswati Singh of Piska More was lucky to purchase tomatoes for Rs 60 per kg at Naga Baba vegetable market on Tuesday, Babita Sharma of Upper Bazaar had had to pay an additional Rs 20 at the same market a day before. ""It is so confusing and unfair. Retailers are fleecing customers because there is no one to govern prices,"" said Babita. Surabhi Sinha, another resident of Piska More, and Nisha Singh of Booty More sounded equally annoyed. ""Last (Monday) night, I bought a kilo of tomato for Rs 120. When I told the shopkeeper about the government directive on retail price, he asked me to find another vendor if I wanted a better rate,"" said Surabhi. Nisha said few people had the time and energy to hop markets for a reasonable price. ""We are suffering because the government hasn't implemented its order."" The vegetable market at Sector-II in Dhurwa seemed to be the most reasonable one. Rajni, a local resident, said she struck gold at Rs 60 per kg. Sudama Sahu, a farmer who sells vegetables on Kanke Road, admitted that the price of tomato hadn't stabilised. ""Vendors in posh areas like Ashoknagar and Morabadi are charging more,"" he said. Jharkhand imports its tomato stocks from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. Madan Prasad, a wholesaler at Pandra Bazar Samiti, said the wholesale price was between Rs 45 and Rs 50. ""Retail price shouldn't be more than Rs 70 in that case, but vendors are fleecing people,"" he added. Minister Saryu Roy, who had ordered the tomato price cap on July 24, said he was unaware of any variation. ""If any individual vendor is ignoring the government directive, he or she will face the music,"" Roy promised."

The price has gone from Rs 20 per kg earlier this week to Rs 25 now.""Vegetable suppliers from the neighouring states are slowly running out of their existing onion stock. The rates will continue to remain high until the new crop is harvested there,"" they said.Weather parameters also played spoilsport resulting into loss of fresh stock.""Onions that were en route from Kolhapur and Nashik to Goa got soaked and spoiled on their way to the local markets. Therefore, the increase in rates,"" said vendor, Sadiq Shaikh.Tomato rates that continued to remain high for a large portion of July have considerably lowered this month. From going at Rs 80 per kg until earlier this week, the ripe reds have now come down to Rs 60 per kg. The rates are far lower in wholesale and at the horticulture run outlets across Goa. Tomatoes are sold at Rs 55 per kg at wholesale outlets, while horticulture outlets are selling it at Rs 45 per kg.""The tomato production in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the tomatoes are sourced from, is slowly normalizing.

(Photo| ANI)LUCKNOW: Pricey tomatoes today spurred a fresh round of protests by Congress workers who parked a cart full of tomatoes in front of the UP Legislative Assembly and sold the kitchen staple at Rs 10 per kg.The party had earlier come up with a ""State Bank of Tomato"" that is being operated from the Youth Congress office here.Tomato prices have hovered around Rs 100 per kg in major cities with supplies being disrupted due to heavy rains.Congress workers led by state secretary Shailendra Tiwari stood in front of the Assembly with a cart full of tomatoes with a banner ""Tamatar ke aaye acche din"" (good days have come for tomatoes) and sold it at Rs 10 per kg per person.""This is our way to protest the soaring tomato price.We are selling it to the common man to show our concern for them. It's ironical that the government has not taken any initiative to open subsidised counters for selling tomatoes or to check its price,"" Tiwari said.The 'tomato bank' has some interesting schemes to offer like providing the commodity on easy loan as also a locker facility, 80 per cent loans on tomatoes and attractive interest rates for depositing tomatoes, especially for the poor.The idea behind the bank is to lodge a protest and to create awareness among the people about the commodity being sold at such high rates.Prices of tomato have shot up about four times since the beginning of June when tomatoes were being sold at about Rs 25 per kg in the Delhi-National Capital Region market.Industry body Assocham had said recently that ""Tomato prices may not immediately ease as flooding in some of the growing states has led to damage to the crop.""Unlike onion and potato, the shelf life of tomato is very short and it needs cold chains and modern warehouses for storage and transportation, it said.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha are the major tomato growing states.The country produces around 18 million tonnes of tomatoes."

The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture. Hopefully, the promise of doubling farmers incomes by 2022 will lead it to respond differently this time round.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
,,,,,,,5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

With Bakrid preceding Thiruvonam by two days, on September 1, the trade fairs too began slightly earlier this year, aimed at tapping into the demand of the twin celebrations. ""At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market',"" said K V Thomas MP, speaking after launching the Onam Trade Fair set up by Supplyco on the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises in Kaloor.Thomas said agencies like Supplyco play a key role in preventing the price hike of essential goods. ""There was a time when wholesale traders use to collect goods from FCI warehouses. But most of them would in turn keep the stock in their own godowns, resulting in increasing number of cases related with the hoarding of goods. They later sell these goods in the black market. This prompted the then government to introduce the Food Safety Bill.This helped government agencies like Supplyco play a major role in providing supplies to the common man,"" said Thomas. The MP said the government is taking a favourable stance towards Supplyco godowns. ""Supplyco should use these favourable conditions for the benefit of consumers,"" said Thomas. ""A new programme named Karshakamithram, mooted to attract more students towards agriculture, will be launched in schools soon. One lakh curry leaf saplings will be distributed on September 11.""THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF ONAMKochi: Every year, the weeks leading up to Onam season are marked by the soaring prices of vegetables. This year, with only about a two week-countdown left for the festival, it is not easy to assess the price trend in the market. Some of the essential vegetables are priced high, but the prices of others, which hit an all time high last month, have come down. For instance, the price of shallots saw a record high price of D140 per kg in July. This month, however, it has come down to D85 per kg. The main reason for the price hike in shallots was the drought in Tamil Nadu from where the produce reaches Kerala. Now, the wholesalers are getting more supply from Andhra Pradesh which is reflected in the reduced price, said N Rajan, a vendor in Kaloor market.However, customers complain vegetables sold cheaply in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka become costly when they cross the border into Kerala. The price increases three or four fold when it reaches here, said Prasanth Jacob, a customer. Raw banana costs only D30 per kg in Coimbatore. However, a customer here has to pay a minimum of D70. Likewise, tomato which is available for D15 per kg in Tamil Nadu gets a weightier price tag here, costing D60 to D70 per kg. The other items that witness a hike in price in August are beetroot, amaranthus, beans, cow pea and drumstick. The price of green chilly and carrot have reduced slightly. ""The prices were fluctuating during the first two weeks of August. However, it is likely to go up by the end of this month, added Rajan.The where and when of fairsSupplyco fairs will be organised in all taluks in Ernakulam. Essential commodities, including red chilly, coriander, black beans, bengal gram, tur dal and vegetables will be available at prices lower than the market price. The trade fairs will function from August 20 to September 3, a day ahead of Thiruvonam. ""There will be special festival offers and gift coupons for consumers,"" said marketing manager R N Satheesh. Every customer making purchases of more than Rs 2,000 will be issued a gift coupon for a lucky draw. The first prize winner will get one sovereign gold, while the state-level winner will get five sovereigns of gold. The vegetable stall at Supplyco fair is set up by Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council of Kerala. Vegetables like carrot, potato and cabbage are brought from Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Munnar. The special programme 'Onathinu Oru Muram Pachakkari', an homegrown, organic vegetable initiative, was also launched in Ernakulam today.Daily marketprice- Retail(August 21)Source: VFPCK.Price in Rs per KgAmaranthus: B23Banana nenthran: B58Banana (njalipoovan): B80Beetroot: B48Bittergourd: B50Brinjal (long): B38Carrot: B48Cowpea: B58Onion: B32Shallot: B85Tomato: B56Snake gourd: B40Beans: B55At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market'K V Thomas, MPEvery customer making purchases of more than Rs 2,000 will be issued a gift coupon for a lucky draw.

Road, in Malleswaram and other areas.The KSPCB had first banned PoP idols and their immersion in waterbodies in 2014. The ban was reintroduced in 2016, but stating a delay in communication, idol makers approached KSPCB with a plea to permit sale of idols that had already been manufactured. The KSPCB temporarily relaxed the ban on the condition that the idols be scientifically disposed. It reiterated that a complete ban would come into effect this year.Lakshman, chairman, KSPCB, told The Hindu , The board had directed the BBMP and other municipal corporations to ensure that the ban is followed in letter and spirit. It is their responsibility to ensure enforcement by conducting raids and inspections. But this was not done. If the direction is not followed, KSPCB will take appropriate action against the bodies.Stating that the authorities concerned have not done much to enforce the ban, N.S. Ramakanth, member, Solid Waste Management Expert Committee, BBMP, said, The KSPCB has conducted half a dozen meetings in this regard, but has not been able to achieve anything. As citizen representatives, we recommended placing boards at waterbodies stating that immersion of PoP idols will not be allowed. Except near Yediyur lake, this has not been done anywhere else. With PoP idols already making it to the markets, we foresee lake pollution this year as well.An eco-friendly messageAround 150 civic leaders trained by Bangalore Political Action Committee (B.PAC) have been conducting awareness programmes in their respective neighbourhoods. Apart from this, we are conducting make your own clay Ganesh workshops in 20 wards. We have already covered 11 wards, including B.T.M. Layout, Koramangala, Shanthinagar, K.R. Puram, and made around 2,500 clay idols. In the next two days, we will be covering the remaining wards, said Sushma Mahabala, programme head, B.PAC, which has roped in artists from Karnataka Chitrakala Parishad to conduct the workshop.From Ganesh to a plantA Ganesh that grows into a plant remains a popular eco-friendly innovation. Sasya Ganapathi, a company started by four friends this year, has created and sold 1,000 such Ganeshs.Ganesh Chathurti is something that most people celebrate. We thought we could spread a green message through the festival. Thus was born Sasya Ganapathi, says co-founder Bharath Srinivas.The kit includes a 1 ft clay Ganesh idol, which is filled with fertiliser and a potting mix. Pot and seeds are provided separately.After the festival, people can immerse the idol in the pot. When it dissolves, the fertiliser mixes with the soil, following which seeds can be added. We offer tulsi, ladies finger and tomato seeds, said Mr. Srinivas. A year of experimenting preceded the launch of the product.Another start-up  GrowShareSustain  has come out with a similar concept where a clay Ganesh idol is a seed ball. After the festival, the idol can be immersed in a container. As the idol dissolves, the seed balls merge into the clay and soil. With enough sunlight and water, saplings will sprout within a week."

(Above): Workers in the final stages of pack gherkins with acid preservatives and vinegar in Ranebennuru in Haveri district, Karnataka. (Below) The gherkin is a demanding crop; even a one-day delay in picking the fruit makes it unviable. A farm hand in Ranebennuru, Haveri district.Sudhakara JainManzoor, a farmer barely in his 20s, picks up a small prickly fruit. He scrapes at its rough green skin, which is covered in hair. I know for sure you cant eat this, he says. He speaks of a large company, whose local agents contacted him with seeds, contracts and promises earlier this year. It is actually medicine, he adds, with some confidence. When he puts it down, he washes his hands thoroughly, and uses a stone to exfoliate the fingers. Pesticide, he says, corrodes the skin, turning it rough and whitish.Neat rows of strings and poles divide his one acre farm into grids. Water marks the channel in the middle, and the creepers clinging desperately to strings are beginning to wilt with disease.Manzoor is astonished to hear that people in other parts of the world eat the medicine that he grows. No one has told him that in the West, pickled gherkin is a condiment, as common on dining tables as pepper. Confounded, he calls his neighbours, who have been growing gherkins in their village Thimmapura in Haveri district, close to the River Tungabhadra in Central Karnataka. They laugh. No, it cannot be. When our children come here, we have to keep an eye on them. If they eat it, they will fall sick. It fills the stomach with gas, says Rajappa, another young farmer who has been growing gherkins for the past five years.The recent rains have transformed the undulating plains into a quilt of green. In these chequered fields sliced up only by roads and irrigation canals, rice, maize, sugarcane and millets have been the traditional crops. Its only over the past decade that the gherkins have slowly established a foothold.But the bad news is that this seasons crop has been washed out by unseasonal rains. The three gherkin crops in a year are typically grown from April to June, August to October, and December to February.Discussing gherkins with farmers inevitably leads to narratives of agrarian distress, migrations, and failed bore wells. Amid the vinegar flavours of gherkin processing centres in Karnakatas agro-processing zones spread across eight districts, managers and exporters list out their concerns. These range from the Goods and Service Tax, which shrinks their working capital, to the international outrage over Russian military aggression, to even the weather in Vietnam. A bumper crop in that country could affect the fortunes of the crop back home in India, and thus the lives of Manzoor and Rajappa.A crop like no otherWith little domestic demand, the foreign crop is like no other in the State, and perhaps in the country. Seeds sealed in neat packets are brought in all the way from Europe. Export companies engage farmers through contracts, and it is in the unpredictable agrarian environs of Karnataka that the alien fruit is birthed.The fruit, however, undergoes a series of chemical treatments before being shipped thousands of miles again, with its final destination ranging from the restaurants of Madrid to the supermarkets of Manhattan.In the 1990s, as information technology (IT) and the outsourcing boom transformed Bengaluru, a few hundred kilometres away, exporters found in the relative warmth of districts such as Kolar and Bagepalli the perfect conditions for the cultivation of gherkins. Just like the IT boom, this one, too, was founded on cheap labour.For more than a decade, this sector saw on average an annual growth rate of 20%. Export companies popped up like mushrooms in food parks and SEZs. While banks announced special loans, agriculture policies dangled special incentives, and gherkin contract farming spread across the State. The gherkin revolution has turned many impoverished farmers into lakhpathis, stated a 2006 report by the Institute for Social and Economic Change (ISEC) in 2006.By 2014, over 1.31 lakh farmers in southern India were engaged in gherkin cultivation. The sectors exports touched Rs. 1,200 crore, an impressive feat considering that a decade ago, exports were barely worth Rs. 180 crore.When it was dropped into the State two decades ago, the fruit did not have a local name. Now it goes by the odd term medicine cucumber. Most say that it is a corruption of the Kannada word,midi, meaning small. Farmers in areas where gherkins are just making an entry into the landscape think that the name is on account of it being made into medicine (some believe it cures piles), or, perhaps, because the fruit leaves a bitter aftertaste, like a tablet.Karnataka, where gherkin cultivation covers 20 out of the 30 districts, accounts for more than 60% of Indias production, with the neighbouring States of Andhra Pradesh, Maharasthra and Tamil Nadu chipping in.Similar to the dynamics in the IT sector, where a policy announcement on the other side of the world tends to echo through the air-conditioned corridors of Bengaluru, the gherkin industry is also highly vulnerable to the headwinds of global events.The Russia problemIn 2014, parts of central Karnataka saw copious monsoon rains even as large parts of the State battled drought. The perfect conditions yielded a bumper crop. But just a few months before the monsoons arrived, something unexpected happened: Russian soldiers took over the courthouses and government buildings of Crimea.The Russian annexation of Crimea had begun. Despite international outrage, a referendum was conducted. Eventually, a pro-Russia government was installed to govern the peninsula where no gherkins are grown.As Russia faced sanctions from Europe and America, suddenly, Indias largest importer of gherkins found itself unable to afford the fruit. Thousands of miles away, in nondescript villages of Karnataka where news from the outside world is hard to come by, company agents were suddenly obsessed with the Russia crisis.A conversation in Hemodre, a village in drought-prone Sira taluk near the Andhra Pradesh border, triggers an impromptu gathering of curious farmers. Beeresh, 30, the local agent, is called in to explain the dynamics of gherkin cultivation in the village.Beereshs job is to talk to farmers, perhaps even give loans (sometimes from his own pocket), so that they shift to gherkin cultivation. He has to ensure enough produce to meet the targets, which are decided by the companies based on the export orders they have received. The credit he gives to the farmers is later deducted from the payments made for the gherkin produce.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough, he says. With the cut in supply, his commissions have dropped. He is now in a debt of more than Rs. 2 lakh, which he hopes to pay off when the market stabilises.About 200 km away, in a recently refurbished factory that sticks out incongruously in the maize and sugarcane fields of southern Ballari district, the air smells of the acid preservatives in which gherkins are stored.Srinivas R., the factory manager, explains what happened when Crimea was annexed. In 2014-15, the factory handled 14,000 tonnes. We prepared for a bumper crop, and suddenly the orders dipped. The rouble had crashed, from 38 to 83 roubles to a dollar. The Russians were no longer able to buy gherkins in bulk from here. We had tonnes of gherkins with no buyers, he says. Within a year, the acreage sown in the area reduced by 40%.The setback reverberated through company balance sheets. Exports to Russia came down from Rs. 234 crore in 2014-15 to just Rs. 90 crore in 2016-17. Russia remains the key, for it is the only importing country that takes lower-grade gherkins which are often rejected by European buyers.The crisis devastated the industry. At least five companies with significant investments  some owned by hotel, telecom and steel tycoons  have folded up. These are difficult times, compounded by international and domestic problems, says Mune Gowda, who heads Exotic Agro Pvt. Ltd., and is the Treasurer of the Indian Gherkin Exporter's Association. Even the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production, he says. In the past three years, a quarter of the gherkin farmers have stopped production for various reasons, estimates the association. Production has dipped by over 70,000 metric tonnes. Making up for the loss of the Russian market by tapping the European one proved difficult as the latter is choosy and has strict compliance norms and certification requirements.The foreignerDomestically, cultivating gherkins comes with its own problems. Unpredictable weather takes a toll on the crop. The gherkin itself is a demanding crop that takes its pound of flesh from the land on which it is sown. It acts like a foreigner who lives here, says Ranganath at Hemodre village. He is relatively less enamoured of the cucumber. He is not taken in by the promise of high yields. If the wind changes direction for an hour, it falls sick, he says.Gherkins need constant care, which isnt easy given the harsh realities of farming in India: monsoons are erratic and prone to failure; rural distress has sparked large-scale migrations and reduction in the availability of labour; tropical diseases sweep across large tracts; and groundwater reserves are dwindling. This constant battle has made the farmers christen the fruitkiri kiritarakari(irritating vegetable) andsoutekaye savasa(problematic cucumber).A little more than a month after the seeds are sown, gherkins pop out of the base of the flower, yielding fruits incessantly for the next two months.It is here that the trouble begins. If it is not picked within a few hours of flowering, it grows exponentially in size, and for the farmers, the bigger it is, the smaller their returns. The gherkins are graded according to their size and there are five grades in all. The smallest gherkins (160 of them can fit in a crate) could fetch Rs. 32 per kilo. The biggest (less than 30 in a crate) fetch just Rs. 2. If transportation of the plucked gherkins is delayed, up to one-third of the produce could be lost.We need 15 labourers a day just to pick the fruit. Most of the youth have gone to Bengaluru or Hyderabad for jobs. If we delay the picking by one day, the gherkin grows and becomes unviable for us, said 41-year-old Siddarameshwara in the remote Udramappanahalli village of Sira taluk. His crop this year has been ravaged by mildew, which sets upon gherkins when it rains.Its because of these reasons that despite his success with the crop in the past 10 years, he has confined gherkins to just 0.5 acres of his 12-acre farm. As white, stringy fungus envelops the gherkin, he hopes that the winter crop can compensate for his loss. However, in the slight chill of the winter lurks the melon fly which, farmers say, no quantity of pesticide can effectively contain.More disconcertingly, the crop guzzles water. If the field is not irrigated daily, gherkins become shrivelled and bent, unsuitable for export. For the 50 days or so that it flowers, farmers have to draw water from their borewells. If maize needs water thrice in two weeks, the gherkin needs it every day. Maize is grown twice a year; gherkins thrice a year. For all the three seasons to yield sizeable profits, it needs more than 150 days of irrigation.The guru of gherkinsEight years ago, it was the sight of a group of Spaniards inspecting gherkins in Bagepalli, just 100 km from Bengaluru close to the Andhra Pradesh border, that enthralled villagers. Taking them around the clusters of gherkin villages was B. Srinivas, whose company acted as a conduit for the bigger companies and farmers. The Spaniards had told the gherkin growers that the produce here was the best they had seen.Having taken to the gherkin sector in 1998, it was he and a small band of agents who persuaded farmers to try this new crop. Agents and company facilitators propped up. Bollywood-style films on gherkin management were shown to farmers to attract them to the crop. Gherkins, it was believed, could lift the region out of poverty.Srinivas remembers the gherkin rush. Farmers would line up for seeds. We could even do large swathes of 30 acres in each village. Things were easy back then.Over 1,000 acres of gherkins  a limit constrained only by the volume of the companies export orders  were sown in 2006-07. Money flowed as advances to farmers, agents kept a steep commission from the output, and for farmers, gherkins did translate into money.Then the inevitable happened. By the late 2000s, the rains started failing, and one by one, the borewells went dry. Groundwater dipped in places from 400 feet to more than 1,200 feet. In places where the borewells ran through the summer, they now stopped two months before the rains, and later, didnt function even in the winter. Gherkins, with their immediate need for water, were the first to be affected.By 2011, the number of red farmers  those with debts  rose dramatically, and the agents had to look farther for suitable land, with some going as far as Srisailam in Andhra Pradesh. It just didnt work out. We would get half an acre in one village and a couple of acres elsewhere far away. The debts kept rising. I had to get out, Srinivas says.In the hustle of the Bagepalli market, the man who many farmers and agents say was the guru of gherkins in the region now runs an agro-business focussing only on traditional vegetables and maize seeds. Just three agents operate now, and struggle to cumulatively cover 50 acres.Cycles of debtDrought and international price fluctuations have left behind a cycle of debt  unpaid loans for field agents and gherkin farmers, who, in turn, have to pledge a greater share of future gherkin production.In the past decade, the prices of the seeds, all imported, went up from 6 paise to 68 paise per seed. If tomato seeds cost Rs. 700 for 10,000, the cost for gherkins is up to Rs. 10,000. The returns, however, havent kept up. In the same period, the price of premium gherkins has gone up from Rs. 8 to Rs. 32 per kg.In some areas, agents have racked up debts of more than Rs. 50 lakh. Agents like Gangappa in Bagepalli who claims to have nearly Rs. 70 lakh in debt from farmers in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, have pinned their hopes on the recent rains that have filled up tanks. They hope that these farmers can repay the debt by cultivating gherkins again.The rains have indeed given life to the dry lands of Bagepalli, Sira and central Karnataka, which glimmer now in various shades of green. There is slight optimism in the corporate offices of exporters too: a steady year can blunt Indias reputation as an uncertain producer that frequently misses shipment dates. But is it possible that, somehow, the U.S. and Russia would normalise relations and bring Indian gherkins back on Russian tables?Well, the fruit is fickle and vulnerable, and uncertainties loom, much like the dark vestigial monsoon clouds that threaten to wash out this seasons crop.I used to contract 250 farmers. But due to the Russia problem and other issues, we were asked to cut down on acreage as demand dipped. Now there are 150 farmers, but they dont do it regularly enough.BeereshA local agentEven the U.S. has started importing from Mexico, while Vietnam is catching up in gherkin production.Mune GowdaHead, Exotic Agro Pvt.

Farmers in state have already suffered successive droughts since 2015, and more rains could result in huge losses for them. Experts feel there will be a surge in post-harvest diseases if such moist conditions persist throughout October. Dr N Nagaraj, Professor of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) told Express that if it rains heavily during October, farmers tend to harvest their crops early.Due to such showers, it becomes a problem for farmers to dry and store the produce. As a result, post-harvest diseases such as formation of moulds will increase and hurt revenues of the farmer, he said. Quoting the example of an experimental plot of UAS, he said that the plot of land that used to give 200 kg of harvest might provide a maximum harvest of 140 kg of vegetables this year. Perishable crops like tomato are affected by diseases such as Phytophthora Late Blight. Other crops such as papaya, chillies and vegetables will be affected due to spell of rains, he said.Crops such as moong bean, maize, jowar and ragi too are not exempt from the consequences of such weather. Paddy is among the few crops that will not be affected much, he said. However, rains effect ragi, when earheads are growing in the plants. If water stands in the ragi form, the earheads will sprout, leading to loss for farmers, he said. Shivkumar Naiklal, scientist at Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell said that overcast conditions also effect crops which are about to flower. He said that 99% of the State had adequate moisture in soil, after two years of moisture stress due to drought."

Visitors kept away from the market which was inundated by Monday's rainfall.Traders blamed the water stagnation on the failure of the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority (CMDA) to clear the path for rainwater to drain into the Cooum river. Rainwater from the market complex drains into the Cooum through a channel near Daniel Thomas Matriculation School on Poonamallee High Road ""Despite repeated requests, CMDA refused to clear the water channel. Even worse, about four acres of land near the school has been bought by a restaurant chain which has blocked the area. If the restaurant is allowed to come up, it will permanently seal the channel,"" said advisor to the Koyambedu Vegetable Market Wholesale Traders Association, V R Soundararjan. ""Footfall reduces every monsoon due to poor maintenance of the market complex. Authorities must ensure that traders dump vegetable waste only in bins. Fogging must be carried out regularly to control mosquito breeding in the market complex,"" he said.Traders said prices of vegetables have gone up due to heavy rainfall that damaged crops in Karnataka and western Tamil Nadu . Only the price of potato, which costs Rs 15-18 per kilogram, has remained stable since the last few weeks. The price of tomato rose from Rs 20/kg to Rs 40/kg while that of beans has gone up from Rs 30/kg to Rs 50/kg. Carrot, which was sold for Rs 30 two weeks ago, is now being sold for Rs 50/kg. The price of cabbage has gone up from Rs 15/kg to Rs 40, and so has that of drumstick from Rs 60/kg to Rs 100."

Manimegalai, a home maker from Puliyakulam whose family budget is dependent only on her husbands income, increase in the price of some of the vegetables has led to changes in the daily expenditure.The weekly Uzhavar Santhai used to be a boon for mid and low income families. Now, farmers who sell vegetables directly have also increased prices citing changes in retail market. Hike in the price of coconut has forced us to replace thengai chutney with sambar or thakkali chutney . Luckily, price of tomato has not increased as much as it shot up in July, said Ms. Manimegalai. Quoting some of her neighbours, she said families are buying vegetables in bulk and storing them in refrigerator when prices are low.A vendor from a neighbourhood grocery store near Sivaram Nagar said that sale of vegetables has come down as as she was, with no option left, already selling them at a few paise/rupee higher than the price of vegetables at bigger retail stores.For vegetable buyers in the city, prices of small onions, coconuts, and tomatoes have shot up during the last few days, making many reluctant to buy these. Even in the weekly markets, the prices are high. I have stopped buying small onions, says Jothimani, a resident of Ramanathapuram.Prices of small onions is expected to hover around Rs. 120-140 for another two to three months and prices of tomatoes will come down in a fortnight, said M.R. Palanisamy, Deputy Director of Agriculture Marketing here.According to M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, small onion prices might touch Rs. 200 a kg in the retail market. This is mainly because of drought last year and recent heavy unseasonal rains in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers are not benefiting from the price rise.The wholesale price of small onions is about Rs. 140. If we used to get 2,000 bags of small onions in the market a day, it has dwindled to 200 bags now. Coconut prices are up because trees dried in Pollachi area and many have cut down the trees because of drought earlier this year. It will take another three months for arrivals to pick up.Prices of most of the vegetables are above Rs. 50 a kg. It will take one or two months for the prices to stabilise. Farmers who cultivated small onions on about 950 hectares in Thondamuthur area saw a bumper crop this season. They did not get a good price last month.Traders and farmers who had stored small onions were getting good prices now, said trade and official sources.The prices were between Rs. 60 and Rs. 100 last week and increased to Rs. 115 to Rs. 120 now in the wholesale market.The retail price at Uzhavar Santhai on Wednesday was between Rs. 130 and Rs. 135. Bulk buying by the traders for exporting to Middle-East countries might also be a reason for the price rise, said Mr. Palanisamy.However, the prices of country tomato which was just about Rs. 30-a-kg last week has increased to Rs. 35- 38 per kg in Uzhavar Santhais on Wednesday. The prices of tomato is expected to come down in a fortnight, when farmers in Madukkarai block will begin harvest. Tomato was cultivated in 370 hectares in Madukkarai block and 80 hectare in other blocks in Coimbatore district, he said.Farmers Association (Tamilaga Vivasayeegal Sangam) secretary P. Kandasamy said farmers decided when to sell produce based on their needs than on market price.Most often the market intelligence reports were of little help to them as they did not, so far, factor in movement of produce from other States to the city.Having seen prices crash in local markets due to arrival of vegetables from other States, the local farmers had begun taking their needs into account to sell produce.The Government should ensure farmers get a stable price throughout the season, Mr. Rajendran said.(with inputs from R.

In just one village, Parsuli, an estimated 100 quintals was either fed to cattle or left to rot in the crop fields. After a relatively better marketing season that lasted till the first week of January, retail prices plunged.Far away, farmers in Erode district in Tamil Nadu were a worried lot after the retail price of cabbage crashed. From Rs 12/kg last year, it dropped to as low as Re 1 per kg. In Chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.Not fetching more than Rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. The deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.This is primarily because of higher production. Whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. A higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.T Rajaganesh, a farmer in Erode district, asks: ""Farmers spend at least Rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. Add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than Rs 50,000 a month.Since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least Rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. How can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of Rs 1 per kg?""In the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about Rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. For the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre.Till the first week of January, when I travelled to meet tomato farmers in Durg, the prices were much better - about Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. But, with the advent of tomato crop from Karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.Now, let's take the case of chana. According to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about Rs 3,600 per quintal, against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.With production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. Even wheat price has remained below MSP by 6-8% in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.In February last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at Rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of Rs 5,500 at Tandur market in Telangana.Meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in Chhattisgarh poured in again in early March. This is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg. In fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.Karnataka modelAfter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. While the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.It is here that I see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by Dr TN Prakash, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission. He has called for making the Minimum Support Price of crops to be legally binding. He said: ""Consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above MRP and can approach the courts. But, even after 70 years of Independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""For the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than MSP in various parts of the country. At times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. Even the introduction of the Unified Market Platform in Karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 eNAM (National Agricultural Market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.The concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. eNAM in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.In addition to 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, state governments must work out MSP for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.Many states already have a Farmers' Commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.The immediate need is to convert them into State Agricultural Prices Commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in Karnataka. If Karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the MSP announced by the Centre, I see no reason why other states cannot."

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also. Due to this, the supplies are now coming in only from Maharashtra, said Padma Harsha , deputy director of department.Predictably, J Ananthaiah, selection grade secretary, agricultural market committee at Malakpet , said that the daily procurements have dropped from nearly 40,000 bags per day to 10,000-15,000 onions bags per day, thus pushing the rates northwards.The steep jump in costs has adversely impacted traders in other markets whove stopped selling onions. We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock. If the situation continues, we may be forced to keep our shops shut, said Mohammed Abid , a vegetable vendor at the Erragadda Rhythu Bazaar.Not just onions, prices of other vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrot too have registered a more than 200 per cent rise in price rise as compared to the last winter season. While one kg of tomato cost 8 in December 2016, the price has now shot to 26 per kg. The price of carrot has increased from 16 to 50 per kg.Onions and tomato are basic vegetables. With the price rise, we are now forced to purchase these vegetables in lesser quantities, said Vijayalaxmi, a housewife from Kokapet. The steep rise in cost of vegetables has driven inflation to an eight-month high of 3.93 per cent."
