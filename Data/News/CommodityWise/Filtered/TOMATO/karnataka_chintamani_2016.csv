A survey of the area did not yield any sign of the leaf miner, said the scientist. However, he said that scientists were on the lookout for any isolated case.The pest is reported to have originated in Latin America and spread through infected fruits and packaging materials to Europe, Africa, the Middle East and Asia. The pest is crossing borders and devastating tomato production in both protected and open fields, said Dhana Raj Boina of the National Institute of Plant Health Management, Hyderabad, in a recent presentation before a group of scientists from Kerala.Given its aggressive nature and crop destruction potential, it has quickly become a key pest of concern everywhere, he said. The pest was detected in October 2014 in Pune, Maharashtra, and was then reported from Karnataka.Director of the Bangalore-based National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources Abraham Vergese said that tuta absoluta had mostly been found in tomato in India. About 90 per cent of the cases have been in the particular crop. However, he said, it could also infect crops like brinjal and potato and had been found in these crops though on a smaller scale.His advice to Kerala farmers is not to import saplings since Karnataka has already confirmed presence of the pest. He said that imported tomatoes should be randomly checked for infection and infected fruits destroyed. He also said that farmers should be trained to detect the symptoms of attack by tuta absoluta.Deploying pheromone traps in all stages of the crop has been found effective against leaf miner.Use of sticky traps or water-oil traps with pheromone bait; deployment of parasitoids and predators too are effective."

Prices of several vegetables are down by as much as 50% in the wholesale markets. Retail markets, too, reflected the decrease.This, say traders, is because of the rich harvest in the state and neighbouring regions.More than 300 lorry loads of vegetables are pouring into the Koyambedu wholesale market every day compared to the 250 lorries that were coming in a day two weeks ago.Broad beans, which cost `Rs 50 a kg two weeks ago fell to `Rs 30 a kg and the price of a kg of cabbage had dropped from `Rs 20 to `10, said V R Soundararajan, advisor to the market association in Koyambedu However, the price of toma toes, the most sought after vegetable, only dropped by a mere `Rs 5kg from ` Rs 30kg.The price, however, is ex pected to drop further, said M Saravanan, a wholesale tra der, adding that farmers in Karnataka's Mulbagal region, the main source od supply to the city , had reaped a rich tomato crop this time.Green peas, which had soared to `150kg, fell by more han half to `70kg, while the cost of cauliflower, popular during this period, dropped o `25kg from `35 kg, he said.

Among other efforts, it plans to revive karunkanni, a cotton variety getting extinct. It will convert cotton into value-added products, including naturally-dyed yarn, and sell it to other khadi units for cloth production. It has roped in traditional farmers in Athoor and Reddiyarchathiram blocks in Dindigul district to raise this variety. Similar efforts are on to revive 23 traditional cotton varieties throughout the country.These points were highlighted at a workshop on Revival of desi cotton and contemporary khadi held at Gandhigram near here on Monday. Trust secretary K. Siva Kumar said that the proposed facility would procure the entire produce from farmers and add value to it. The main aim was to end farmers marketing problem. This short staple yarn was best suited for producing bandage cloth and bed sheets.The natural dying unit would use cotton to make naturally-dyed yarn to tap emerging markets. Seeds would be supplied to farmers and the unit would act as a full-fledged model centre for organic cotton and value addition. It would also facilitate formation of a federation of desi cotton producers in the State, he added.Ananthoo of TULA Organic Clothing said that 97 per cent of cotton produced in the country before Independence was of traditional variety. The British, who tried to kill native varieties, and introduce foreign varieties could convert just three per cent of farmers. But, after Independence, Indian scientists had successfully killed traditional varieties and converted 97 per cent per cent of farmers into hybrid cultivation. Now, khadi units were using foreign cotton. Production and input costs for traditional varieties were very less when compared to those from Egypt and the US, he added.Other varietiesKrishna Prasad of Sahaja Samrudha, a peoples movement in Karnataka, said that 23 traditional varieties, especially Bengal Desi, Pundur, Kaala cotton, Wagadh, Karunganni, Jayadhar and Pandrapura, were being raised in the country for the past 1,000 years. Efforts were under way to revive these varieties. All Indian varieties had been grown as inter-crop to channa, coriander, chillies, pulses, tomato and onion, he said.Traditional cotton grower Visvasam of Vellode said that 500 acres of karunkanni variety had been raised in Reddiyarchatram and Athoor blocks. Owing to lack of marketing facilities, many farmers had shifted to other crops. These farmers would be encouraged to grow this variety. Besides Dindigul, Karunkanni was grown in Kovilpatti and Vilathikulam only, he added."

Of them, 5,650 or 4.29 per cent, were farmers. Of these, 64.5 per cent were marginal and small farmers.The Bureau also reported that 25.6 per cent of farmers suicides were due to bankruptcy and indebtedness. According to the Niti Aayog head Arvind Panagaria, who conducted a survey in 2008, 20.35 per cent of these suicides were due to drinking and gambling, 16.81 per cent due to failure of crops, 2.65 per cent due to indebtedness and fall in agricultural prices each.The remaining 57.54 per cent were due to other reasons like discord in the family etc. In 2014, 4,400 farmers committed suicide due to drinking and gambling and 1,250 due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices while 3,672 farmers who committed suicide were marginal and small farmers.Suicides committed by farmers due to drinking, gambling and family discordsetc, cannot be termed as agriculture related though persons committing suicides were farmers. But suicides due to failure of crops and fall in agricultural prices are farmer-specific.Farmers are distressed because of three reasons: their landholdings are uneconomic and unviable; failure of crops due to floods and draughts; and fall in agricultural prices. After Independence, the number of marginal and small land holdings has increased due to land reforms. For example, when land reforms were implemented in Karnataka in 1971, the number of land holdings with less than two hectares was 29,22,000. By 2011, it was 59,87,000.According to the Department of Agriculture in Karnataka, the size of the land holding should be 2.56 hectares to be economically viable. The average size of land holdings of these marginal and small farmers also increased, though marginally, from 0.60 in 1971 to 0.81 in 2011, still leaving the holding economically unviable. It was quite natural that the number of suicides by these farmers also increased.To alleviate the problems of the marginal and small farmers, some people have suggested providing them with improved inputs. But the proper solution to the problem lies in encouraging cooperative farming. If farmers can pool their land by forming a cooperative, then the problem of unviability of the small holdings can be overcome as they will get the benefit of economies of scale. While a single small farmer cannot on his own dig a borewell or buy a tractor, a cooperative farm can easily do so. This may also to a great extent help the small farmers in overcoming the problem of fall in prices of agricultural produce.While a single small farmer may not have the capacity to store his produce and sell it only when he gets a better price and, hence, has to opt for distress sale, a farming cooperative can create such storing capacity and sustain itself when the agricultural prices fall. It is only then that a small land holding can become economically viable and prevent the losses.Since a farming cooperative with large tracts of land in its possession can go for multiple cropping, even if the prices of one or two of its produces fall, no member will be ruined because he will be sharing the profits earned by the cooperative from other produces.Agricultural pricesFailure of crops, which accounts for 16.81 per cent of the suicides committed by farmer, happens mostly due to floods or droughts which are natural phenomena. While crop insurance can be an answer to floods, irrigation could be the answer to droughts.The loss to farmers due to fall in agricultural prices is a man-made phenomenon. Since the demand for agricultural produce is by and large stable, the reason for the fall in agricultural prices is over-production.For example, if tomato fetches a good price in any one year, all farmers opt to grow tomatoes with the result that in the next year, there is over-production and the prices fall. There have been instances when farmers have thrown away their produce on the roads as they could not get a fair price.Some people have suggested solutions sans markets to this problem of fall in agricultural prices. They suggest that a floor price for agricultural produce should be fixed by law and no one should be allowed to sell his produce at a price lower than the statutory price. But then, the problem of fall in agricultural prices is not legal but an economic one and therefore, a legal solution to an economic problem will not ultimately work.Some have suggested the solution of a government intervention in the market by fixing support prices. But since the problem is one of over-production, this will only increase the financial burden on the government rather than solve the problem.The prices of agricultural produce in the markets fall when there is more supply than demand. The demand for agricultural produce, as compared to industrial produce, is more or less fixed. Hence, the demand cannot be reduced. But supply can be regulated to equalise with the demand. In the first instance, supply can be contained at the time of production itself. Since the demand is known, if the farmers can plan their supply, the fall in prices that happens due to over-production can be prevented.To achieve this, production will have to be meticulously planned at the national or at least at the state level. Secondly, if the far-mers can store their produce when the pri-ces fall and wait till the prices rise, they can overcome the problem of excessive supply.If large cooperative farms are encouraged and farming cooperatives can form a federation, it should be possible to plan what to produce and how much to produce depending on the demand. Only such solutions can solve the problems of the farmers and prevent them from committing suicides."

To keep the competition alive, all major parties like AIADMK and DMK have fielded heavyweight candidates.Pennagaram is known for abject poverty and lack of employment as well as lack of educational opportunities. Though the constituency has more than 2.26 lakh people, about 50% of them migrated to other districts and states in search of employment. About 10% have shifted to neighbouring towns for higher education.This constituency had seen 14 general elections and one byelection since its formation in 1971. Of them, DMK has won 4 times while PMK, AIADMK and Congress won twice each and Gandhi Kamarajar National Congress (GKNC) and Janata Party won one time each. Vanniyars form the majority of the population here. Senguntha Mudaliar, Vaniba Chettiyar, Muslims and SC/STs are also present.Ramadoss won the 2014 Parliamentary election with a margin of 77,146 votes against his rival AIADMK candidate P S Mohan. Of the 4.68 lakh votes that Anbumani got, more than 90,000 were from Pennagaram constituency alone and he got over 34,000 more votes than the AIADMK candidate. ""Keeping this in mind, Anbumani is contesting from Pennagaram constituency as it should be a cakewalk for him,"" said a PMK functionary.Jayalalithaa, who was rattled by Anbumani's victory in 2014 election, has fielded K P Munusamy, former minister for municipal administration and rural development of Tamil Nadu. Though he is from Krishnagiri district, he rented a house in Pennagaram once he was announced as the candidate for this constituency.Former MLA P N Periannan's son P N P Inbasekaran of DMK is contesting for the second time from this constituency. Though he was defeated in 2011 election by CPI candidate N Nanjappan, this time, Inbasekaran and DMK party supporters are hoping that the anti-incumbency factor may work in his favour.The sitting MLA of the constituency N Nanjappan is also contesting with support from DMDK-PWF-TMC alliance. He is confident of repeating the 2011 results where he got 80, 028 votes while DMK candidate Inbasekaran secured only 68,485 votes. ""With the DMDK-PWF-TMC alliance, our victory is even more secure this time,"" said K Rajasekaran, a CPI cadre.Pennagaram, a backward constituency, mainly depends on agriculture. Acute water scarcity has forced many farmers to give up agriculture and migrate to other towns or Karnataka in search of employment. All contestants have promised to take steps to reduce water crisis and increase employment.Anbumani assured that he would open a government arts college, a military research centre, processing units for tomato and tamarind and SIDCO for employments. ""We really hope that he will keep his promises. Most of the villagers have decided to cast our votes in favour of Anbumani,"" said K Balamurugan, one of the villagers.K Mahaboob Basha, an autorickshaw driver said he would support PMK candidate Anbumani this time as he was dissatisfied with the work of the sitting MLA.

It now costs Rs 30-35 at the Koyambedu wholesale market in Chennai. This is due to a shortage as the yield has been low.Tomatoes are sourced from Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border and the central and southern districts of Tamil Nadu. Since the yield is low, some tomato consignments are being diverted to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, where there is a shortage. So the prices have increased in Tamil Nadu. Retail prices in different parts of Chennai varied from Rs 60 to 90 on Monday. In Madurai, tomatoes, which were sold for Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kg in May last year now costs as much as Rs 70.Experts are blaming climate change for the price rise. Tomato crops in thousands of acres were lost due to high afternoon temperature that prevailed in the months of February and March, says project officer of the Center of Excellence for Vegetables K Srinivasan. ""Tomato is a temperature-sensitive plant. The flowers open up and pollination takes place during the Feb- March season when the afternoon temperature is around 35 degree Celsius. But this year, temperature had soared to above 40 degree Celsius in many places, affecting the crop,"" he told TOI.Such a change in temperature has not been witnessed in the past five decades, he says. ""The stigma of the plant has to be supple to aid pollination, but this year, most of the plants developed rigid stigmas, which affected the flowering process,"" he added.In the southern region tomato is cultivated in about 8,000 acres in Dindigul district, mainly in Palani, Reddiarchathiram and Oddanchathiram blocks. However, the area under cultivation was reduced to less than half because the plants were not able to survive the heat, farmers said. One such farmer, K Sundaramoorthy from Dindigul, lost his entire crop due to the prevailing temperature and lack of rain.In Madurai, another vegetable that has become costly is the green chilli, which is selling at Rs 90 in the retail market and Rs 70 in the wholesale market. ""This is due to the high temperatures, which has affected the flowering of crops,"" says K Vivekanandan a farmer from Theni. The supply to the market had come down from 10 truck loads last week to just two to three loads now.Farmers say that the price of the tomatoes will come down only after the monsoon sets in, in June. ""The prices are going to keep skyrocketing because there is no production of tomatoes throughout Tamil Nadu at present to meet the market expectations,"" added Thiagarajan.In Trichy, the areas around Vaiyampatti near Manapparai account for a considerable production of tomatoes. According to horticulture department officials, around 50 hectares in Vaiyampatti are involved in tomato production during March, April and May."

Experts say no change is likely for at least a month.The city's supply of tomatoes is down by almost half, largely because of limited cultivation this year in areas like Nashik and Narayangaon. Other vegetables particularly cauliflower, green leafy vegetables, capsicum, chillies and garlic also face a similar scenario. Their rates have also soared over the past few weeks.According to those dealing with the commodities in the wholesale market, the situation is particularly worrisome this year with rainfall hardly picking up evenly across the state.

Describing the problems affecting the supply, Gule said, ""The inflow of vegetables is down by more than 40%. Besides tomatoes, prices of coriander and other green leafy vegetables are sky-rocketing. The problem is the lack of water in all vegetable growing districts. Unless the monsoon compensates for the drought, the situation is unlikely to change.The only saving grace has been onion, which has been cultivated in abundance this year, so its prices are stable till now.""The situation this year is completely different from the summer of 2015, when tomato growers sold their produce at throwaway prices, said city-based retailer Amol Tambe. , a city-based retailer who buys directly from them. ""Such was the glut of the tomato crop last year, that farmers actually got very poor market rate for their produce in the summer months. Prices, however, had surged around October and November 2015.

Chillies too are hot on the trail of tomatoes, with rates in the range of Rs80 to 120 a kg, in retail market.As summers make the vegetable prices go up, rates of some items are higher than those of the tomato. For example beans, tinda (apple gourd) brinjal and methi (fenugreek) are in being quoted at Rs120 a kg. Traders say rates of other vegetables are up due to the cyclical high reached in summers. Tomato rates have gone up beyond the normal range, touching double the last summer's level. Other veggies are priced in the range of 60 on an average. The cheapest are onions and potatoes at Rs15 to 25 a kg respectively.In the normal course, markets in Nagpur get their supplies of tomato from Sangamner near Nashik and parts of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. The drought has brought down the supplies from the regular centres to a low. Traders have discovered a new supply source at Chomu, 40km away from Jaipur in Rajasthan. Representatives of major dealers in the city are camping at Jaipur to get as much stock as possible.However, the variety is nowhere close to the bright red tomatoes coming from Karnataka which are generally preferred by the consumers.

The Australian weather office said on Tuesday that most of the subcontinent can expect good rainfall this week and that the monsoon would move northwards.Vegetable production has suffered because the absence of pre-monsoon showers prolonged the hot weather and created a water scarcity, particularly in parts of western, northern and central India where rainfall was 60-100% below average.As a result, tomato prices have doubled to Rs 80 per kg in many parts of southern India and Maharashtra but onions are down 21% from last year, while wheat and rice have risen only marginally.Lower production during 2015-16, a drought year, has affected the market sentiment for corn, cotton and pulses like chana, urad and tur. ""Maize prices will remain bullish till October,"" said Rajiv Yadav, vice-president (grains and oilseeds), Noble Agri. The industry has approached the government demanding duty-free import of maize.Traders say they are preparing to import wheat as production may be 10 million tonnes lower than official estimates, but the agriculture ministry officials disagree and stand by their comforting estimate of 94 million tonnes. Sugar prices are also likely to remain firm at Rs 40 per kg due to the big fall in area under sugarcane in Maharashtra. High prices of pulses also have a positive impact as it is likely to encourage much higher sowing by farmers, leading to a better supply situation later on, traders said.Data from the weather office shows the monsoon should have reached Bihar by June 10 and touched eastern UP and northern parts of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh by June 15. But it has so far only reached Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as it stagnated after striking Kerala and Tamil Nadu a week late.Crop planting is 7% lower than last year, according to government data, but sowing will rapidly accelerate once the monsoon reaches parched northern and western regions. Madan Sabnavis , chief economist at CARE ratings, said the situation was not worrisome as of now but he would worry if the trend continues because farmers may shift from rice to pulses or from pulses to oilseeds.""If it goes into July, definitely there is cause for concern because what happens is that when the monsoon comes in late, there's a tendency for farmers to switch crops ... That's where the danger lies... one has to be on guard in terms of the distribution of the rainfall across geographies as well as distribution across the three crops,"" he said.Certain regions of peninsular India, like coastal Andhra Pradesh, have received rainfall in excess of the norm by 89%. The IMD has forecast above-normal rainfall for the June-September monsoon season this year. Rainfall is forecast to be 6% above normal."

The scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources (NBAIR), Bangalore, worried about the pest's spread, have also initiated efforts to get wasps and predatory bugs to serve as its natural enemies and design long-lasting sex traps to suppress its population. The pest, Tuta absoluta, emerging from Peru's Andean region, reached Spain in 2006, then spread to France, Italy, and Greece, jumped across the Mediterranean into northern Africa, moved into eastern Africa and the Middle-East before it was spotted in Maharashtra in 2014. Since then, scientists have observed the pest - also called the tomato pinworm or leafminer - on farms across Gujarat, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu where they have caused slight to extreme damage, even in fields where farmers had sprayed pesticides. ""It is unclear why this is so. It is possible the pest is resistant to the specific pesticides that were sprayed, or the pesticides may have killed predators that could have been natural enemies of this pest,"" Chandish Ballal, a senior entomologist at the NBAIR, told The Telegraph. Ballal and her colleagues have called for intensive surveillance efforts to look for this pest in major tomato-growing states such as Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Although the pest prefers tomatoes, scientists have seen it feed on potatoes and eggplants (brinjals) in other countries. Tomato farmers across the country and the ketchup, sauce, and puree industries may face a serious threat if this pest is not controlled, the NBAIR researchers have warned in a paper published on Sunday in Current Science, a journal published by the Indian Academy of Sciences. The pinworm's rapid spread has caused concern among crop scientists across the world. Last year, plant protection scientists and policy-makers met in Berlin, Germany, and decided to intensify quarantine measures and explore the effectiveness of using natural predators against the pest. ""When the tomato leafminer invades a country, it can cause between 80 and 100 per cent crop losses unless farmers and countries are ready with counter-measures,"" said Rangaswamy Muniappan, an entomologist and director of the integrated pest management innovation laboratory at Virginia Tech in the US. ""The pest can move in multiple ways - the moth itself is tiny and can move only from farm to farm, but commercial transport of tomatoes can take the pest from one part of the country into another, and it probably crosses borders and oceans through tomato exports or nursery seedlings,"" Muniappan said. The NBAIR scientists have spent the past year looking for other insects that might serve as natural enemies against the South American pest. Their studies suggest that two wasps, Tricogramma Presiotum and Trichogramma Achaea , may serve as promising biological predators to curb pinworm populations. Another entomologist, Kesavan Subaharan of the NBAIR, is trying to develop a controlled-release trap based on pheromones - chemicals secreted by female moths of Tuta absoluta that attract the male moths. The traps are intended to lure and capture adult male moths and disrupt the reproductive cycle. ""Pheromone traps are a proven technology when the males are trapped, the females have no one to mate with, they can't lay eggs, the population is suppressed,"" said Subaharan, who leads a team that has developed a technology to keep a pheromone trap active on a farm for up to 45 days. The insect has not been reported from the US yet but the country's government agricultural officials are also concerned. ""Our domestic tomato industry could be severely affected,"" Devaiah Muruvanda, a senior risk manager for the US agriculture department, had said in a media release issued by Virginia Tech last year. ""The United States is taking it so seriously we haven't even given permits to do research (in laboratories) in order to prevent any possibility of the insect's escape (from the labs into farms)."""

Also, the problems of poor quality fertilisers and transplantation seeds, fall in prices, torture by middlemen and loans have been haunting farmers. Both the central and the state governments must seek reports from the horticultural and agricultural departments to rush to the rescue of the growers, the Raitha Sangha member demanded.Coconut trees have also been affected by diseases, causing a great loss to the growers and, hence, the government must initiate research towards finding a solution to the problem and providing compensation to the formers, the members said and demanded a compensation of Rs 35,000 for each dried up coconut tree.Speaking further on the matter, the farmers said, A coconut and areca board must be formed.

In June, tomatoes were selling at nearly 100 a kg.Koyambedu wholesale traders association advisor V R Soundararajan who has been in the trade for nearly five decades, said, ""I have never seen such a steep fall in prices in all these years. There is a lack of cash flow in small businesses, which has reduced the income. Farmers are devastated at the price fall.""The veteran trader said the sudden rise in tomato price to 100 a kg two months ago was due to lack of supply.""Vegetables such as tomato, carrot and beans that are brought in from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh to Tamil Nadu, were diverted to Maharashtra and Odisha where the summer crop had failed."" Though there is excess supply now, a fall in demand is causing prices to plummet.Traders said the fluctuation in prices will crush the farmers.

While Karnataka is the largest producer of arecanut and coffee in India, it stands third in coconut production. The market turmoil has hit arecanut and coconut right around harvest, when supplies are most abundant and grain prices are at seasonal lows.""For the last 15 years, farmers in western ghats and the coast have benefited from both increased production and higher price - leading to rising rural income and declining poverty rates. That happy story may now be nearing its end - which could be the precursor to a renewed crisis in the agriculture sector of the state which is struggling to overcome from the spate of farmer suicides last year,"" N Raghavendra, agriculture expert from Shivamogga, said.The price of a quintal of high-quality red arecanut has plummeted to Rs 24,000-Rs 25,000 from Rs 35,000 last year, while other normal varieties ranges from Rs 18,000 to 20,000. The crisis, the growers complain, is due to abundant supply from Saarc countries after India opened up the market last year.""We have been getting cheap quality arecanut from Sri Lanka and it's being procured by Gutka-manufacturing companies. More than 1.01 lakh tonne of arecanut was imported till August 2016,"" said Ravi G, a member of Malnad Arecanut Marketing Cooperative Society.The situtation of coconut growers is no different. They are in a deeper crisis owing to price crash partly because of imports and bumper harvests in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. The price of coconut, which until recently cost between Rs 20 and Rs 30 in the wholesale markets, crashed to below Rs 10, the lowest since 2006. A quintal of copra was hovering around Rs 6,500- Rs 7,000 in Tiptur, a major copra market of the state, while it was Rs 16,000 to Rs 20,000 a year ago.The coffee season has also ended on a tepid note for growers. The farm gate price of the new arabica parchment is still hovering between Rs 7,500 and Rs 8,500 per 50 kg bag compared to Rs 10,000-Rs 11,000 last year. Attributing the current downtrend to excess global supplies and recession, Naveen Somaiah, a grower in Kodagu, said: ""The future looks bleak for us considering the problems we have been facing with shortage of labour and high production cost.''MSP for cash cropsWhile the Centre has assured it would look into the request to restrict import, chief minister Siddaramaiah, who held a meeting with growers last week, told them that the state could not intervene since there's no provision to declare minimum support price (MSP) for cash crops. The growers want the state to set up revolving fund to tackle the crisis.Tomato growers see redThe price of tomato has plummeted to Re 1 per kg following heavy arrivals at wholesale markets across Karnataka. At retail shops in tomato-grown villages, it was being sold at Rs 5-Rs 6 per kg while in the wholesale market, the price was Re 1 per kg on Sunday, said APMC officials. Farmers held a protest in some places by spilling the vegetable on road demanding government's intervention.State bags awardThe Karnataka government has bagged the 'DL Shah Award-Platinum' at the 11th national quality conclave hosted by the Quality Council of India.

While farmers occasionally raked in the moolah, they were often let down by the cropping pattern in vogue in the district.Major marketsTirupati, Kalikiri and Madanapalle are considered the major agricultural market yards in the district. Farmers from the mandals bordering Karnataka and Anantapur prefer selling their produce at Madanapalle while those in the central areas like Chittoor and Piler go for Kalikiri market which is considered to be strong enough to tilt the price balance. The Tirupati market yard is more accessible to the farmers of the eastern mandals.A 30-kg box of tomatoes was sold for Rs.100 at Kalikiri on Friday. Pegged at Rs.250 a fortnight back, the price of the tomato box witnessed a rapid slide within a short time.Maqbool, a farmer from Kalikiri, who invested Rs. 45000 for growing tomato in his one-acre farm land burnt his fingers by losing half of his capital, leave alone getting a profit.We invested Rs. 2 lakh on our two acres only to lose everything, laments R. Ramakrishna, a dejected farmer of Kamalla village in Yerravaripalem mandal. Already reeling under losses, the farmers are in no mood to bear the labour, transportation cost and market commission and hence are either leaving the crop in the fields or dumping it on the roadside.A gambleTomato cultivation has become such a huge gamble in Chittoor district that farmers seldom feel sad about the mounting losses, but hope against hope to strike it rich in the elusive next season. Though we suffered losses this time, we are planning to go for tomato again. As the northern states witness floods and huge crop losses by November, we hope to see the prices soar and recoup the lost money, reasons Rayavaram Srinivasulu, a life insurance agent who turned into an agriculturalist of Piler.Such wild guesses and weird predictions are common for the farmers who prefer not to deviate from their age-old farming practices."

Babu. The field day was organised by the Indian Institute of Horticultural Research (IIHR), whose researchers have developed the hybrid.Arka Rakshak is being sought after by farmers in different States and a few foreign countries owing to its high-yielding potential, wherein farmers have collected 19 kg a plant. Another attraction is its resistance to diseases such as leaf curl virus, bacterial wilt and early blight, which helps reduce cost of cultivation by 10 to 15 per cent in terms of savings towards cost of fungicides and pesticides, according to scientists. The third advantage is long shelf-life which makes it ideal for long distance transportation.G.

Another official from Tamil Nadu said they would prefer taking up its cultivation on small tracts of land in different parts of the State on an experimental basis.However, the officials team was concerned over taste preferences as Arka Rakshak is said to be a tad bit sweet, while culinary preparations in Tamil Nadu favour sour tomatoes.A.T.

Since the inter-state transport between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is remain suspended due to the reports of arson and violence in Karnataka, the lorries laden with vegetables were diverted to different markets in the State. Some loads were diverted to Tiruchi as well.On Wednesday alone, five lorries carrying carrot arrived in Tiruchi. They were all sent to various farm fresh vegetable outlets and a selective ration shops being run by the Department of Cooperatives in the districts. Similarly, Gandhi market also received a few loads in addition to the regular arrival. A senior official of the Department of Cooperative said that this was the first time that the farm fresh outlets received vegetables from Krishnagiri. The Department had alerted the salesmen of farm fresh outlets about the possibilities of further arrival of loads from Krishnagiri.However, the sudden arrival has not had its impact on the rate of carrot, which was sold between Rs.30 to 35 per kilo in the retail market. But, market sources said that the rate might come down a bit if Tiruchi market got more loads in the next few days.Meanwhile, various associations of Gandhi Market have expressed solidarity to the bandh call given by a section of farmers associations.A wholesale tomato merchant in Gandhi Market said that all whole sale and retail outlets would be closed for a day on Friday. Most of the associations had supported the decision."

Chilli and other vegetables grown in the region have a good market in Tamil Nadu.Thousands of farmers who have grown varieties of vegetables using underground water and by judicious water management have also given up harvesting as the prices have crashed.The farmers have grown bullet chilli, beans, cabbage, potato, brinjal and flowers in hundreds of acres expecting good prices in Tamil Nadu market during Navaratri season.Farmers in Bommanahalli, Attigulipura, Siddaiahnapura, Chikkahalli, Chatra, Ankashettypura, Ramasamudra and other villages depend on Tamil Nadu markets particularly Coimbatore, Erode, Salem, Mettuplayam and Madurai. They send around 8-12 truckloads of veggies through commission agents daily.With prices of chilli crashing from `25 to `7 a kg, potato bag from `750 to `400 and beans from `35 to less than `8 a kg, they have stopped harvesting.At a few places, the farmers have dumped chilli in drains and many of them are allowing visitors and villagers to take away bag full of veggies for free.A few manage to take vegetables in Karnataka-registered vehicles to the border and shift them to Tamil Nadu-registered vehicles by spending extra money.Nagrajappa, a farmer, said they would have got good money in Tamil Nadu markets if there were no Cauvery issue. The water sharing dispute has paralysed normal life in borders and cut off transportation.There are no takers for white beans, brinjal and tomato as the farmers have dumped truckloads of vegetables in Chamrajnagar and Mysuru markets. They are also marketing at Beggur market hoping that buyers from Kerala may come. I have grown cabbage investing thousands of rupees on pesticides. But, there are no takers now, said Kumar, a farmer.Vegetable commission agents have also pulled down their shutters as vehicle owners are not ready to take risk.Nanjundaswamy, a commission agent, said they have suffered huge losses and Cauvery issue has affected the farming community across the border the most.How can the farmers prosper if he has no market?, he said.Shivamurthy of Ankashettypura, shows a notice from a bank to appear before the court.

While onions are selling for for Rs. 2 - Rs. 6 in the wholesale market and averaging Rs. 12 in retail outlets, a kg of tomatoes is going for a relatively high Rs. 25 a kilo.Based on the trading price last season, farmers changed their crop patterns growing more onions and fewer tomatoes, leading to an imbalance in the supply-demand cycle. This, in turn, has affected prices, say traders.The crash in onion prices is the result of glut in the market. Last year at this time, onions were selling at Rs. 60 to Rs. 80 a kg. However, traders say that the high prices onions fetched last year is the precise reason why this year has seen rates plummet. Its a cycle. Following the high prices for onions last year, the acreage of onions has increased many fold this year across regions in Maharashtra, North Karnataka and Chitradurga. We have also seen a good crop across regions and the market is being flooded with onions, resulting in the crashing prices, said Ravi Kumar, of Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association, APMC, Yeshwantpur.Cauvery issueThe Cauvery dispute also played a role in this scenario. Tamil Nadu is one of the major buyers of onions from Karnataka. However, owing to Cauvery dispute, the movement of goods was disrupted, taking away a major market, which has further led to the crash, Mr. Kumar added.The situation is so bad that many farmers in North Karnataka are not even harvesting the crop, for that will only add to their losses. Despite having a good yield, several of them are forced to leave the crop as it is and plough the farmland so that it can become manure for the next season in Hubballi and surrounding districts.With tomatoes, the situation is the exact opposite. Following a period of prices that were as low as Rs. 6 a kg in the wholesale market, tomatoes are now selling at Rs. 25 in the wholesale market and Rs. 30 in the retail market.A senior procurement officer with a prominent retail chain in the city said that following the low prices during the last crop, many farmers in Kolar and Devanahalli belt did not grow them this season. Tomato is a three month crop.Muniswamy Gowda, a farmer in Devanahalli, who has planted tomatoes said that the acreage had reduced by more than 70 per cent for the present crop in his area, and has fetched him a good price.Furthermore, the lack of rain and humidity has brought down the quantity of the crop resulting in climbing rates for the available crop, said N.N. Sriram, a tomato cultivator in Kolar."

A period of three weeks in June even witnessed the residents to wait for the arrival of loads at Gandhi Market to buy tomatoes.However, the prices had begun to dip from July. The prices went down to Rs.18 a kg in the retail market during Deepavali season.Thanks to the heavy arrival of loads, the prices have come down further. It is sold at Rs.5 to 6 in the wholesale market. It is quoted at Rs.8 in the retail markets and vegetable stores.To cash in on the cheap prices, a number of hawkers have hired mini load carriers to sell tomatoes at the doorsteps of customers. They quote Rs.20 for three kg of high class tomatoes.Since the cost of tomato is cheap, we have taken a mini van for selling tomato in villages. It sells like a hot cake. Each customer buys at least three kg, says V. Mohanraj of Marabanur near Alampatti.He adds that he sells about 500 kg on an average per day as against just 100 kg on normal days.One kg of tomato is enough for my family for two days. Since the rate is cheap, I have bought three kg. I can make a try with tomato based dishes, said P.

This held true at small retailers and vegetable shops in the cities and towns that Express checked out.There are small differences, but all marginal. The perishable commodities  tomato was a common casualty  did witness a downturn, but mostly due to stock clearance sale in the evenings. But the figures may not tell the full story. This is not stability, insist traders, who have been having few visitors and minimal sales. The fall in demand starts at 40-50 per cent and climbs higher for hawkers. Its this decline in demand that is keeping the price steady, a perilous equilibrium.Veterans in the trade who have learnt to look beyond the immediate told Express that the situation could change if cash does not return to the market in the next few weeks and if stocks dry up. What the low demand conceals are stories about farm produce that could not be brought to the market due to supply chain disruption following the cash crunch. In some cases, harvests have been postponed as the price offered is less than what is required to pay the farm hands.Every acre that is not cultivated and every tonne of produce not reaching the market will add up to a sharp decline in supply in the coming months, the period when markets are hoping to stabilise with the expected arrival of currency. If the fears prove to be true, a price inflation may be around the corner.Express does a status check across South India and Odisha on the impact of demonetisation on prices and sales of small retailers and vegetable and fruit shops.KOCHIWhat when the stocks are over?Shibu B STwo weeks into demonetisation of big currency notes, markets have been able to maintain steady prices. Being a consumer state, Kerala depends upon other states for most of the essential commodities. Usually, wholesale dealers stock up goods by October-end, ahead of the Christmas season, explained Ernakulam Broadway Shop Owners Association (BSOA) joint secretary Joseph DSilva. But traders expect prices to go up in the coming month on the basis of the cash flow and arrival of stocks from other states.However, there is a dip in demand. For instance, a retailer who used to buy 500 kg of onion before demonetisation is now buying only half of that quantity, DSilva added. Another reason for the steady prices is that a major chunk of the transactions between wholesale dealers and retailers in Kerala is being done through credit. The major crops produced here like coconut and pineapple and pepper have suffered a drop in its prices, said P Solomon of Pushpa Stores, Ernakulam Broadway.VIJAYAWADASales down to 20 per centS Guru SrikanthMarkets in Vijayawada have gone into a freeze since the demonetisation of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 currency notes. Merchant associations say business is not even 20 per cent what it used to be at this time of the year. However, there has not been much of an impact on prices of essential commodities. Only volumes have come down. With no money in the market, outstanding payments, outstanding receipts and loans have been affected. The situation has impacted sales, particularly of perishable commodities, said Vakkalagadda Bhaskar Rao, president of Vijayawada Chambers of Commerce and Industry.In the first week after Prime Ministers announcement, prices of vegetables fell by 10-20 per cent in the wholesale market, but rose slightly in the second week. On November 25, they were back to the same level as on November 8. Normally, prices surge when demand is high and/or supply is less. But with demand and supply plummeting, prices have been stable. Simply put, the market has come to a near standstill.BHUBANESWARRise in prices plus drop in salesHemant Kumar RoutUnlike in the southern states, the currency crisis has resulted in a rise in prices of some essential commodities in Bhubaneswar as well as a drop in sales.Prices of pulses and spices have increased by at least 10 per cent and that of wheat and flour by 20-25 per cent. However, there was no significant change in the prices of rice, potatoes, onions, milk, edible oils and poultry products.In consonance with other states, Bhubaneswar markets have witnessed a reduction in prices of fruits and vegetables by 10-15 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively.The arrival of winter produce along with lack of consumer demand is helping to keep vegetables prices low. Some vegetables are now available at 30-50 per cent less.Sudhakar Panda, general secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations, said the rise in prices of pulses, wheat and spices is due to supply chain kinks  mainly transportation problems  that have arisen due to demonetisation.HYDERABADConsumers tight-fistedJ Deepthi Nandan ReddyBarring a few exceptions, demonetisation has left prices of essential commodities untouched, but prices of perishable goods such as vegetables, fruits have decreased considerably. Vegetables such as tomatoes were in fact dumped in the Hyderabad markets last week as there were few takers. Consumers have either not been able to access small notes of valid currency or having gained access to such notes have been reluctant to part with them.This tight hold on cash has badly affected vegetable and meat sales and prices. For instance, tomatoes sold at Rs 20 per kg before demonetisation are now available for Rs 10. Prices of other vegetables have also dropped as sellers lowered prices to dispose of produce. Buyers have become scarce, said Mohammed Ibrahim, a vegetable vendor at Mehdipatnam in Hyderabad. Further, due to rumours and apprehensions of transport being affected post-demonetisation, the price of salt touched Rs 60 immediately after November 8. However, the situation soon returned to normal.BENGALURUDIp in prices of perishablesAkram MohammedPrices of essential commodities like rice and pulses have not seen much difference in Bengaluru post demonetisation, but prices of perishable commodities like fruits and vegetables are down by 20-30 per cent, according to Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchant Association. Prices of pulses have been more or less stable but volumes are low. There are three issues here. First, sales have come down. Second, perishables are being sold at lower prices since they cannot be stored for a long time. Third, small vendors have been hit really hard.A vegetable trader Kamraj K said he procures two small truckloads of vegetables every day. However, in the last five days, he has cut it to one. Sales are down by 70 per cent across all foods. Bharath Shah, chairman of the food processing and internal trade cell of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said, I fear this situation will continue for another six months if we dont bring money back into the market.CHENNAISmaller traders take the hitSushmitha RamakrishnanThe severe shortage in cash has prompted people to tighten their purse strings, bringing less money in the commodity market in Chennai. There is much less supply, as small traders have refrained from buying the usual quantum in a sluggish market. But there is no resultant increase in price due to the lack of demand.The shops in Chennai that Express visited said their sales have been down by half in the aftermath of the demonetisation drive. But that has not had an impact on prices.Even in cases like potatoes where the price is supposed to have an upward revision around this time has not happened.In this currency-driven business, they have no money to procure supplies due to restriction on cash withdrawal. In that, the smaller traders are at a severe disadvantage vis-a-vis the retail chains which have the network to ensure interrupted supply.Thus, while the smaller ones are seeing a fall of 50 per cent and more in sales, the networked shops have had a beneficial time."

Suffering from back-to-back drought for two years, demonetisation has struck a severe blow.I am sure it will be sometimes before a clearer picture emerges. But all efforts to paint a bright picture for agriculture are now beginning to fall apart. While the serpentine queues in the urban areas show no signs of ending even after a month of demonetisation, the picture in the rural areas remains too bleak. With the bank branches not getting adequate cash, I know of villages where the farmers had to return empty handed even after seven days of queuing up.What makes it worse is the fact, as Prof Ram Kumar of Tata Institute of Social Studies points out, that nearly 81 per cent of the villages do not have access to bank branches.Despite the Ministry of Agricultures claim of a higher sowing of rabi crops as compared with the area sown in previous year, reality checks portray a different picture. The area under wheat sowing was being deliberately compared with the sowings accomplished in 2015, the year of drought. When you compare 17.4 million hectares of wheat sowing achieved by December 4, with the corresponding figures of 21.3 and 20.9 mn hectares in 2013 and 2014 respectively, it reveals the shortfall.While much had been written about the difficulties encountered by the farmers in undertaking sowing operations, they faced severe blow when the market crashed post demonetisation. Even a month after, the mandis in several cities are partially operating.With the demand subdued, prices have fallen across the board Only a day ago, farmers in Paththal town in Chhattisgarh dumped tomatoes on the national highway to express their discontent at the decrease in prices. With trucks failing to arrive this year, the rich tomato pocket of Chhattisgarh saw prices lowering to 50 paise per kg. Again, a few days back, farmers distributed potatoes free-of-cost outside the Vidhan Sabha in Lucknow.Vegetable and fruit growers have been hit the hardest with prices slumping to as low as 45-50 per cent. Cauliflower in Bihar and tomato in Andhra Pradesh were selling at `1 per kg; nearly three lakh tonnes of potato seed in cold storages in Punjab found no buyer; dairy farmers found themselves at the receiving end on failing to buy fodder for cattle. Many such reports have been pouring in from across India. With no government succor, arhtiyas (money lenders) came to farmers rescue at many places, especially after the cooperative banks or societies became non-functional.Considering that 2016-17 witnessed a normal monsoon except in Karnataka and parts of Telengana, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, I was expecting some kind of revival in the farm economy.Knowing that the farmers are not being paid a remunerative price for years, they have to depend on the rain gods to bail them out of dire situation. And this year, the rain gods didnt disappoint. However, the demonetisation move proved to be a big blow for the farmers, the impact of which would be felt by them for quite long.hunger55@gmail.com"

To resolve this crisis, scientists at DFTRL have developed a range of produces to minimize the post-harvest loss of tomato crop incurred by farmers.The scientists have developed technologies that are affordable and user-friendly to farmers, self-help groups and small and medium enterprises as the target beneficiaries. The wide range of products include tomato sambar paste, tomato rasam paste, tomato curry paste, green tomato chutney, tomato sauce, hot filled tomato pulp and tomato chutney, with a shelf life of 6 to 9 months.DFRL has already started giving training for farmers in a few villages in Chickballapur, Chintamani and Suttur. According to DFRL officials, response from farmers has been good, especially in Chintamani where many came forward with many suggestions. Demonstrations were held as part of the training programme and handbills in the local languages were distributed to farmers.On Sunday, DFRL along with Spoorthy Janaabhivruthi Samsthe, conducted an awareness class for farmers of Ahalya village about various products made of tomato.Speaking after inaugurating the awareness workshop, Rakesh Kumar Sharma, director, DFRL, said, ""There were instances of farmers selling tomato for Re 1 per kg, and some even throwing it to the street. After seeing the plight of farmers, our scientists have come out with various technologies and products.""He added, ""In the days to come, we are planning to set up a registered body at Ahalya village. Here, farmers can sell tomato and can get better price for their produce. We are ready to buy value added tomato products to assist the farmer in generating the earnings.

Shut out of banks and starved of cash for inputs like fertilizer, seeds and pesticides, farmers across the south have slashed their rabi sowing, at some places by more than half the normal acreage.In Ballari, farmers who had already sown crops when Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes were withdrawn from the market on November 8 are not much better off and face the risk of losing the investment they had already made. One farmer, Lepakshi Naidu in Hosapete taluk, Karnataka, said he had sown 30 acres of chilli prior to November 8 and now with banks allowing him to withdraw no more than Rs 2000 per day, he was unable to pay workers. The loss of crop over 30 acres could cripple his hopes, he said.Pesticide dealers confirmed that rabi sowing is down by 80 per cent in Ballari and by at least 40 per cent in Telangana, where a fertilizer trader said he would normally do business of Rs 20-25 lakh per day, but had not sold a single bag of fertilizer all week. Farmers across the peninsula said they would trade their produce for a deep discount if only they would be paid in low-denomination bills. But with no one having small notes, that was a remote possibility.For tomato farmers in Odisha, prices have fallen so low (Rs 2 per kg in Bargarh) that it was not even worthwhile to transport it to the market. Traders have been absent from auctions in the vegetable markets, and the only consignments moving are those that had been paid for before November 8. Not that such farmers are happier.Most have put their money in the bank and are now effectively shut out of any access to it. All told, its been a vicious cycle for farmers be it in Tamil Nadu, Kerala or Telangana. If in Kerala farmers are unable to repay their loans because their procurement incomes have been delayed, cultivators in Nalgonda, Telangana, said the loans from moneylenders and deposits in banks are out of reach as well while they pay interest on loans."

However, the T.N. officials too remained stubborn, demanding that the elephants be driven towards Karnataka. The Bangarpet range staff had even brought the tranquillizer guns to dart at the herd, in case they kept entering their limits.The Divisional Forest Officer (Chittoor West), T.

Kumuda, a resident of Mettukuppam, said she had been making curry using tomatoes, instead of readymade purees.Since I picked up a lot of tomatoes, I would be making gravies at least three times this week. If only the weather had been better, I could have made dry tomato powder with chillies, she said.Wastage growingAnother worrying factor was the growing volume of wastage due to low sales.S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Wholesale Licensed Merchants Association, said about 20-30 per cent of the perishable goods were wasted daily for want of buyers.Traders noted that usually the price of vegetables begins to drop in January and February. But, this time, vegetables became cheaper in December itself."

The herds have retreated to the thickets of the neighbouring States. But the prowling of two lone elephants at the tri-State junction continues leaving the farmers in about 100 fringe villages in a grip of tension as they expect the return of the herds to their fields any time.During the last five years, movement of the wild elephants, numbering over 70 and split into five or six herds, between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon in the Kuppam region.Two herds had barged into the fringe hamlets of the two constituencies in the third week of December, and the forest personnel could drive them back into the thickets of TN and Karnataka in separate operations during the last couple of days.Since August, the farmers of the Kuppam mandal have been familiar with the presence of a lone elephant moving along the borders of Tamil Nadu. Another single elephant problem surfaced a couple of days ago in Santhipuram mandal, when it got separated from a herd of seven pachyderms.The farmers who are generally used to drought conditions mostly rely on horticulture crops. Since November, stretches of banana, potato, tomato and beans plantations suffered the ire of the marauding tuskers in many villages. With Sankranthi just two weeks away, the farmers get ready to harvest their crops.However, the man-animal conflict has forced them to abandon night vigils. This gives them an additional headache: scope for theft of motor pump sets and other electrical gadgets and cables by miscreants. Danger also lurks for farmers while moving in the fields during 10.00 pm-2.00 am shift of power supply. In the last two years, five farmers had been killed in the attacks of wild elephants. At the same time, seven pachyderms were reported killed in the same region, due to infighting among the herds and electrocution in the fields. The last quarter of 2015 had witnessed the presence of large herds in the V.Kota and Ramakuppam mandals.Forest Range Officer (Kuppam), Kalappa Naidu, said all efforts were under way to prevent the man-animal conflict in the region, including strengthening of solar fencing, digging of elephant proof trenches and talks with the TN and Karnataka forest department officials, seeking their coordination in monitoring the movement of the wild elephants.Movement of the wild elephants between the two neighbouring States has become a regular phenomenon"

,,,,,,,58d6c963a3d24b1894a6b23c,Here's why rates of some vegetables are seeing a dip,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/heres-why-rates-of-some-vegetables-are-seeing-a-dip/articleshow/56228798.cms,2016-12-29,"NEW DELHI: Tomato and other vegetables prices, including those of onion and potato, have come down after demonetisation. But the National Horticulture Board , which tracks horticultural produce markets across the country , has found that the fall has more to do with transporters' resistance to pick up the produce from farms than to a poor cash flow at the farmers' end.Ground reports, shared with the board, have noted a pattern where middlemen have been trying to misuse the situation, creating logistical problems, making lifting of produce difficult. This year, because of a bumper crop, the apparent non-cooperation of transporters hasn't yet affected retail vegetable rates as much. While some of the output is perforce being left to rot in the fields, much of it is still making its way to the retail markets, preventing an even steeper fall. The transporter problem, ground reports indicate, is particularly visible in some states such as Karnataka. This state had a bumper tomato crop this year.Though middlemen try to play with the market sentiment after demonetisation, the December, post-harvest fall in prices in one or the other region isn't unusual. Ground reports with the board noted that the transporters' resistance in certain regions needs to be probed.Comparative wholesale price figures of November 9 and December 27 from six major markets show that the fall pattern isn't uniform for all regions. Onion rates have actually risen in Chennai, Kolkata and Nashik.""The fall in the vegetable prices is nothing unusual at this time. We have noticed a steep fall in the wholesale rates of perishable items even in the past when certain regions had bumper crops. We have examples where farmers had to dump their produce because of logistical reasons transport or absence of cold chain"", said A K Singh, managing director of the National Horticulture Board (NHB). ""The current crisis may be attributed to a number of factors, including inadequate storage and absence of processing units closer to the farms,"" Singh said.Agriculture ministry officials too expressed doubts over the role of certain lobbies to create a situation where farmers had to dump their produce. India produces about 170 million metric tonnes of vegetables where the share of potato, onion and tomato together is nearly 50%. Potato accounts for nearly one-fourth of the total production. The government generally intervenes to boost its export after bumper crops. The D-G foreign trade on Tuesday removed the minimum export price on potato."
