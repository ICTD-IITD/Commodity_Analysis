A Mumbai Start-Up Will Now Keep Them Fresh for over a Month,http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/rotten-tomatoes-a-mumbai-start-up-will-now-keep-them-fresh-for-over-a-month/story-hf2ZtZW57cYPXgkNmuZBhL.html,2017-01-11,"Ever had to throw out the last few squishy tomatoes in your veggie crisper because they went bad too soon? Well, a Mumbai start-up may have just hit upon something to save those rotten tomatoes.Science for Society (S4S), a start-up by Matunga-based Institute of Chemical Technology (ICT), has developed a novel packaging technology  ProVegie  that will increase the shelf life of tomatoes by a month.Tomatoes, which are the largest growing commodity globally, including India, usually have a life of five to seven days. The countrys daily consumption of tomatoes is 40,000 tonnes, and post-harvest losses are anywhere between 20% and 40% every year due to poor handling, storage and transportation methods.Developed countries store tomatoes in cold storage that extends their shelf life to 20 days, says Vaibhav Tidke, chief executive officer of S4S. This storage method, however, wont work for Indian farmers since its expensive, and there is no constant electricity supply in villages.A survey of 50 vendors in the city found that unlike onions and potatoes, grocers dont store tomatoes since transportation over large distances damages them, leading to wastage. We want this to change. We want this category of vegetable to move to that of onions and potatoes, so a grocer can also stock them, said Tidke.For the last six months, the S4S team is building a mobile-operated machine that can treat and pack 10,000kg tomatoes per day. It will first treat tomatoes and then package them.ProVegie combines fundamental knowledge of how tomatoes respire and allows this respiration through specially designed packaging to create a self-stable product that will ease storage, transport and logistics, said professor Bhaskar Thorat, who heads the chemical engineering department at ICT, and served as an advisor to S4S.This new packing technology will retain the key nutrients, taste and aroma of tomatoes to serve consumer demands. ProVegie, which will be ready by May this year, is likely to be installed in Nashik, Pune or Aurangabad.According to the model developed by S4S, farmers will sell tomatoes to the start-up and can then take back the processed tomatoes, which can be stored for almost a month and sold in the market. At present, the team is creating a value chain, tying up with grocers, retailers, and companies manufacturing tomato sauces.The S4S team has decided against applying for a patent, instead opting for trade secret intellectual property route. ProVegie is designed to be remotely operated from any place with a mobile phone that will be configured with the SIM card in the machine. This is to ensure that the machine is not opened, said Tidke. So, the operators job will only be to load the tomatoes and see the packaged product."

Jadhavs dont feel tension. Mother Mandakini brushes off all talk of anxiety in the stands where the family sat, watching son Kedar, play his part in Indias epic chase of 351 against England late on Sunday. We know our boys ability. And you know how great Virat Kohli is. Bas, mag kaay tension? says the wiry lady, sitting ramrod straight with a sparkle in her eyes on an easy couch at their flat, wearing one of her favourite green saris as mediapersons troop in and out of the drawing room of the Jadhav house.The Jadhavs are part of a strictly middle-class neighbourhood off Paud Road in Pune  theres a girni (flour mill) around the corner, the clean pathway leading upto the four-storey apartment (where Jadhavs own two adjoining flats on one floor) is lined with trees and two wheelers alike. You are bound to bend down at the low roofed entrance to the building to mind your head and on a busy Monday, to admire the elaborate Rangoli someones drawn up to celebrate the Kedars 120.Two of his three sisters had headed to the Jadhav home in Vanaz  10 minutes off the Express Highway on which the international stadium had risen on the horizon few years ago  for Sankranti. Black saris and finery in tow, with the traditional til-gul (a soft sesame-jaggery sweet) exchange planned as a family reunion, the sisters met Kedar the day before the match, as the youngest son dropped by for the annual ritual. We never talk about cricket a day before his matches, and hes also very relaxed.Nothing fazes him, says sister Sucheta. Our father always had leadership qualities and has a confident personality. Every single person in the family is capable of handling biggest problems and weve always faced challenges headlong. All these qualities have trickled down into Kedar, she says.The excitement was palpable at the Jadhav household in Pune. The excitement was palpable at the Jadhav household in Pune.Father MS Jadhav retired from MSEB in 2003  a year before Kedar debuted in Ranji Trophy, and the family was happy that the four children had between them a English Literature PhD, an engineer, a Finance MBA and finally a sportsman.I used to wonder initially how come a good boy like Kedar drifted towards cricket, the father quips, before hes drowned out by protestations of the sisters and the mother. He never liked studies much, and he was always good at cricket. The good thing was though he would disappear for hours on end to play, he would always tell us where he was going. No sneaking away, no secrets, says eldest sister Charusheela.A 80m long rectangular pebble strewn playground  with a neat joggers walkway around it in the adjoining Lokmanya Nagar was where Kedar started his cricket. Its called the Jeet ground, though the original three-storey Jeet building facing the ground after which the tiny maidan took its name was razed down for redevelopment. Thats where the tennis ball cricket started. He would announce hed hit a big six and the ball would sail into the Jeet building terrace next ball, Sucheta recalls.ALSO READ | Kedar Jadhav: Tennis ball legend who hit an aceAll his katta friends ended up with strong arms and weary shoulders as he would make them bowl to him for hours. And he picked up his first nickname in the neighbourhood. They called him mini Sehwag, and he liked the name so he would tell people he is Mini Sehwag. There was never a shortage on confidence.The years spent waiting in the wings  he is 31 now  werent full of angst or frustration. Ive never seen him sad about not being selected for India when he was younger. He had great patience, even during those Ranji seasons when he wasnt consistent. He is so sure of himself that we werent surprised that he would make good the chances he got, says sister Sucheta. While hed vroom away on his Yamaha  the kit-bag getting drenched every monsoon on his long trips to Cadence Academy, the family decided to buy him his first car for purely utility reasons.A close knit family, Kedhar Jadhav never grew up as a spendthrift  though he was the baby of the family and much adored  and would hand his earnings to the family, and like in his childhood, borrow a minimal Rs 1,000 from his dad when he stepped out. Jadhavs known for his love for clothes, sunglasses and belts. He is also famous for his Salman Khan fandom since his teen days. It wasnt just how he celebrated his maiden ton in Zimbabwe  with the Dabangg hook step  its also his insistence on watching Khans films first day-first show in movie-mad Pune.Like father, like daughterThe star of the family though is one-and-half- year old daughter Miraya, whos inherited an uncanny love for dancing from father Kedar. She can watch Salman on TV and start dancing to the exact steps, though shes barely started talking. She dances to Jag Ghumeya though shed just learning the words, says aunt Sucheta.Wife Snehal and mother Mandakini  whos a little frail and was unsure of whether she could be at the stadium for 7-hour stretch  were not scheduled to travel, but the mother decided on a whim and then both baby and grandmum were packed up in woollens into the car to watch their first international.He loves stuffed brinjal and a tomato chutney, but I couldnt make it this time he came, his mother says, recalling how hed gorged on it after making a 327 in Ranji Trophy after beating Mumbai last season. On Sunday, he chomped on the Englishmen instead. We know his ability. It was great to hear people in stadium say with confidence that he would be Man of the Match, his mother says.

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."

It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers.It is the problem of plenty troubling the Chhota Udepur tomato farmers. Many tomato farmers have been forced to discard their crops, as there are no takers. And in the wholesale market, the price of one mound or 25 kg tomato has plummeted to Rs 20 which was Rs 500 last year during the same period.Shantilal Tadvi, 52, had hoped that the harvest of his tomato fields located in the Panej village of Bodeli taluka of Chhota Udepur district would bring cheer to the family this year. However, currently, his harvest of plump, heavy tomatoes is packed in 130 cartons, awaiting a pick up to Ankleshwar and southern Gujarat, where he has been traditionally supplying the fruit. Tadvi is expecting to make at least Rs 100 per maund but is unsure if his best quality crop will fetch the price. The ongoing wholesale rates for tomatoes are as low as Rs 20 per maund.Watch what else is making newsTadvi, like many other farmers in the district, is in distress. Last year, he says, the price for the tomatoes was as much as Rs 500 per maund. I have close to 133 maunds of the first round of harvest. The field will be ready for the second round of harvest soon. At the current wholesale price, I do not know how will I be able to sustain my family of six for the coming months.Many farmers in the district have simply discarded their crops for lack of takers. Through the approximately 15-kilometre stretch of the Bodeli-Naswadi road, lush green fields with red, mature tomatoes hanging in neat clusters wear a deserted look  in many cases the cherry red tomatoes fallen around the fields bear a testimony to the disinterest and helplessness with which farmers have abandoned the crops. This stretch has been a tomato belt for three states  Gujarat, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Another farmer Virpal Parmar says many farmers have been forced to throw away their crops to grazing cattle. Farmers are giving away tractors full of tomato vines to the grazers as they know that the crop will fetch no price in the wholesale market. Only those tomato growers, who have been able to produce heavy, large sized fruits will stand a chance of their produce being picked up this year as compared to the small, tart varieties. Most families are in deep distress, says Parmar.The sudden decision to demonetise the currency in November has had a cascading effect on the functioning of the APMC markets and the business of wholesalers, who are unwilling to deal in big numbers, says Parmar.A grazier, Valu Dhana, from Jasdan in Rajkot, has arrived in Chhota Udepur with a large cattle herd. Dhana says he has been fetching several kilograms of tomatoes from nearby villages to feed his cattle for the last one week. As the tomato harvest season came to a close, farmers started telling me to take away their discarded yields of ripe tomatoes as they have no value this year. I have brought in several tractors full for the last 10 days and the cattle are feeding on the tomatoes, says Dhana.Tadvi adds that the farmers are forced to do away with the crop as the cost of picking the fruit is costlier than its market value currently. Each labour has to be paid Rs 60 per day for plucking the ripe tomatoes. If the price is lower than Re 1 per kg in the wholesale market, it makes more sense to discard the crop than to waste money on harvesting it, says Tadvi.However, Chhota Udepur APMC Chairman Atul Patel says that the sharp decline in the prices is due to a bumper crop this year, and not demonetisation. There is a bumper crop this year and that is the only reason why the prices have fallen low. The farmers are discarding the crop right now because we do not have facility for cold storage and it is one of those harvests that is extremely perishable. The prices will soon increase as the season ends, Patel said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A lot of problems in the agriculture sector are due to floods and droughts caused by climate change, Swaminathan said, adding focus should also be on providing convenient loans to women farmers to encourage participation.Right to Food campaigner Dipa Sinha dubbed the Budget a continuation of disappointments, especially for women and child welfare. There is focus on maternity benefit, which is good, but the funds allocated for it will not be sufficient for its universal applicability, she said.

As local harvest of vegetables including tomatoes, chilli, lemon, coriander and bottle gourd is likely to go down, prices are likely to shoot up. Prices of vegetables are all time cheap since January due to extremely good local harvest. However, wholesale traders are expecting scarcity of vegetables as local harvest gets exhausted from March.Presently, homemakers are enjoying vegetable shopping as prices remained cheaper in January and February. Tomatoes in wholesale are priced at Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg where as it is selling at Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in retail market. Onion, which usually brings tears in eyes of the common man, is sold in Rs 10 to Rs 15 per kg in the wholesale while its retail market value is Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg.""From mid-March when local harvest of these crops would be finished, there is going to be trouble. From this period, we would be dependent on Maharashtra, Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh for vegetables and thus supply would be less which will add to the price rise. We are expecting a rise of 15 percent to 25 percent in vegetable price from mid-March,"" said Abdul Aziz, a wholesale dealer of fruits and vegetables at Mohana Mandi which supplies major chunk of vegetables in the city.According to sources, traders are also into hoarding of onions, potatoes and ginger sensing the upcoming scarcity.""We got bumper crop this time from Bassi, Kanota, Chommu, Chandwaji, Dudu and other nearby villages due to which the prices of vegetables were cheaper compared to last three years. Now, when local crop would be exhausted due to supply from mid-March , prices would be high. I think, prices of onion, potato, tomato, ginger, bottle gourd, pea, chilli and lemon would be affected,"" said Sadiq Ahamed, another wholesale trader at Mohana Mandi.Wholesale traders are expecting rise in vegetable prices from mid-March onwards. ""The season for peas would be over by then and we will have to get cold storage stuff for customers which would be selling at Rs 35 to Rs 45 in wholesale and Rs 45 to Rs 50 in retail markets,"" said Nanak Ram Saini, a wholesale trader of tomato and pea in Mohana Mandi."

Representational Image.This summer, tomato prices might see a spike as tomato plantations in Maharashtra have seen a sharp drop in output. Lack of ready cash with growers and an infestation of white flies is being attributed to the drop, which has affected the entire state. As against the 34,500 hectares of plantation used to cultivate tomato during summer, this year the state has seen 31,012 hectares of farmland used for the crop. The dip in area is significant in the tomato-growing districts of Pune, Nashik, Satara and Sangli.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Federation of Narayangaon in Junnar taluka of Pune district, claimed that demonetisation was to be blamed for the dip in cultivation area as farmers didnt have enough cash. Tomato is a cash-intensive crop as farmers require costly inputs on an average, an acre of crop would require Rs 70,000 as input cost, he said.Currently, demonetisation and a sharp fall in prices of almost all farm produces have shaken the economics of rural areas, making farmers wary of heavy investments. Bhise, who normally plants five acres of tomatoes, has only planted three acres of the crop this year. Another reason for lesser cultivation is the apparent infestation of white flies in tomato-growing areas. Increase in onion acreage in the last few years has increased the prevalence of white flies in these areas. This pest destroys tomato crop, so many farmers have not opted for tomato this season, he said.According to traders at the wholesale markets, lesser agricultural area for tomatoes would result in an increase in the price of the vegetable in the days to come.In June last year, tomato prices had crossed the Rs 70 per kg mark in retail markets in many parts of the state, as a severe drought had destroyed the rabi crop. This year, lesser cultivation may also result in a spike in prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

An abundance of the produce has led to a crash in prices, dashing the hopes of farmers.While farmers in Kolar, Karnataka, dumped tomatoes on the road after the prices collapsed to a new low of Rs. 2 per kg last week from Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 a month ago, violent protests broke out in parts of Telangana after a good yield of the commodity in the two Telugu-speaking States brought down the prices from a high of Rs. 10,000 per quintal last year to a measly Rs. 2,500 this year.In Maharashtra, the demand for tur, which rode a wave of high prices last year, plummeted after its production went up from 4.44 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 20.35 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. So was the case of grapes after a crash in their prices plunged the vineyard owners across the State into despair.While most farmers complain about the poor remuneration for their produce in comparison to the prices that prevailed in the previous season, agricultural economists have traced the reasons for the glut and the resultant price crash to the cobweb phenomenon.After the prices of a particular agricultural commodity shoot through the roof during a season of scarcity, farmers resort to boosting the production on the premise of the pre-existing demand and prices, leading to a problem of plenty, reasoned Dr. R.S. Deshpande, former Director of the Institute of Social and Economic Change (ISEC), Bengaluru, explaining the cobweb phenomenon.Most of the agricultural products that have now suffered a price crash due to their abundance had yielded a rich dividend in the previous season.Chilli woesA long duration crop, consuming up to eight months for harvesting, red chilli cultivation was expanded in both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh this year after the commodity commanded a good price last year.However, in the absence of minimum support price for the crop, categorised as commercial, the market dynamics of demand-supply kept the price low from the beginning of arrivals in the market this season from April first week. As the top quality red chilli yielded a price of even Rs. 13,000 per quintal last year, the farming community had hopes of good returns this year too, a senior Telangana Agriculture Department official told The Hindu . But, it was not to be. The Centre has, however, announced a market intervention plan to procure 33,700 tonnes out of the 7 lakh tonnes produced in Telangana with a support price of Rs. 5,000 per quintal and assistance of another Rs. 1,250 per quintal for other expenses.The crash in the prices of grapes not only soured the expectations of the vineyard owners in Maharashtra, but also claimed the lives of at least two farmers.Few takers for grapesThe suicide of 36-year-old Manik Randive and 25-year-old Chetan Vasal, both from Nashik, has been attributed to the poor price their grapes fetched.Despite a robust grape production, there were few takers as the prices had collapsed. According to Shriram Gadhave, president, Vegetable Growers Association of India, wine manufacturers are contending their stocks are full. The average input cost per acre of grape was Rs. 3 lakh. Yet farmers were selling their produce at barely Rs. 2 lakh, he said.According to him, in April last year, more than 95% of the grape harvest was plucked by wholesalers and wine-makers from farmers gardens.Farmers even received a decent rate of Rs. 40-42 per kg. This year, barely 75% of the picking had been completed while the average rate was a paltry Rs. 8 a kg.Dent in tur pricesTur dal, which hit the headlines last year with its skyrocketing prices, has suffered a dent in its demand this year after large scale production. In Maharashtra, production of tur went up from 4.4 lakh tonnes last year to 20.35 lakh tonnes during 2016-17, bringing down the prices by a huge margin.The total purchase by the government through its agencies at a Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs. 5,050 per quintal was only around 4 lakh tonnes while another five lakh tonnes had been sold at rates lesser than the MSP through the Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMC). Several lakh tonnes remain unsold.But, even during the season of scarcity, rarely do farmers benefit. For instance, even though a consumer paid almost Rs. 220 for a kg of tur dal last year, the farm gate price was just Rs. 45 to Rs. 50, said Dr. Deshpande. Does it take Rs. 170 to convert whole tur to edible tur dal, he wondered.Echoing Dr. Deshpandes views on the cobweb phenomenon, Mr. Srinivas, a progressive farmer from T. Narsipura near Mysuru, said he gave up tomato cultivation this year as many farmers began growing the vegetable on a large scale in the region after it realised a good price.( With inputs f romLaiqh A Khan in Mysuru, B Chandrashekar in Hyderabad, Shoumojit Banerjee in Pune and Alok Deshpande in Mumbai )"
,,,,,,,593bec567be9e04956d79822,A bumper farm crisis,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-bumper-farm-crisis/article18470885.ece,2017-05-17,"Farmers in some States are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka, and toor dal cultivators in Maharashtra are at the centre of a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Some speculate that high commodity prices last year caused farmers to respond by boosting production, which in turn led to the present price crash.Whether it is the wholesale mandi s where farmers sell their agricultural produce, or retail outlets where consumers buy them, price fluctuations are common. But whether such fluctuations can be explained as being due to mindless crop cultivation, as some speculate, is not as certain. For one, in the consumer market, commodity speculators usually dampen price fluctuations by managing supply according to consumer demand. For instance, when the supply of grains is abundant, speculators do not flood the market with all their stock but instead hoard the grains and sell them later when supply turns scarce. Thus, even if farmers engage in mindless grain production, speculators usually save the day for consumers by preventing steep rises and falls in grain prices.Price fluctuationsSecond, in the wholesale market, speculators can save farmers from similar price fluctuations by paying a competitive price for their produce even when there is abundant supply. Grain traders, to return to our previous example, who want to hoard supply expecting higher grain prices in the future would be willing to pay a better price to farmers today. This comes not out of compassion for farmers, but purely out of competition with other grain traders. When farmers are free to sell their produce to any trader they want, it is traders paying the best price who get hold of it. Farmers can also expect a more predictable price for their produce each season, reflecting stable consumer prices, thus preventing mindless cultivation.Such competition though is precisely what is missing from the Indian agricultural scene where the supply chain is broken. Red tape, including limits on stocking agricultural products, has prevented the growth of a robust market for commodity speculation. The result is lack of investment in infrastructure like that of cold storage; about 40% of agricultural produce in India is wasted because of it. This, in turn, has led to price fluctuations that have affected both the farmer and the consumer. Wholesale agricultural prices are determined by trader cartels that block competitive bidding. This significantly reduces the price farmers can get for their products, while boosting the profits of some privileged traders. By some estimates, farmers receive only 20-25% of what the final consumer pays for his product. Thus, a free market in agriculture can be the best antidote to the crisis facing Indian farmers."

In several parts of the state, protesting farmers destroyed stocks of vegetables and milk headed towards cities and clashed with police as the chief minister ruled out a blanket loan waiver.Wholesale prices of certain produce increased by Rs 5-10 on Thursday as only 430 trucks arrived in the Navi Mumbai APMC, compared to the usual 500.""Retail prices did not increase on the first day of the strike. But if the stir continues,and agitationists stop farmers who bring their trucks to Mumbai along the highway, they will have to take a detour via smaller internal roads. Supplies may then shrink as many will not manage to take a long detour,"" said Raja Patil a vendor from Khar municipal market. ""While 30-40% vegetable supplies for Mumbai come from other states, prices of items coming from outside Maharashtra remained constant. Supplies of capsicum and tomato were less than the daily requirement which pushed their prices up. Friday will be decisive,"" said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.On Thursday, hundreds of agitating farmers in western and north Maharashtra and Marathwada region poured milk and dumped vegetables on roads to denounce government's inaction. Meanwhile, the agitation's co-ordinating body said the strike will intensify after chief minister Devendra Fadnavis rejected two of their main demands in a press conference in Mumbai. The CM ruled out a blanket loan waiver and said the state government will have to study whether implementation of the Swaminathan committee report will benefit the state. The Swaminathan committee report suggested support pricing for all agricultural produce in the state. ""A complete loan waiver is not possible for the state. If we had to give a loan waiver to all farmers in the state we would require Rs 1 lakh crore which is not even the revenue of the state per year,"" said Fadnavis. The state's annual revenue is between Rs 85,000-90,000 crore.""There are 31 lakh farmers across the state, who are outside the banking credit system and we are working on a scheme to make them creditworthy again. That itself works out to Rs 30,500 crore. We will have to look into their pending loans for which a committee has been formed,"" said Fadnavis.He slammed farmers who stopped trucks on Thursday and threw the produce on the roads. ""How can these people, who are holding other farmers to ransom, call themselves farmers? A strike has to be voluntary. You can't force anyone to be a part of your group,"" said Fadnavis. The CM said the government has called people leading the protest for talks. He also warned milk co-operatives who are not accepting milk from farmers. ""We will dissolve their board and appoint a government administrator, if these instances continue,"" he said.Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said in Pune, ""The scenes of farmers resorting to strike are as heartbreaking as mothers shunning their duties towards children. It is definitely not a matter of pride for us that farmers are taking to the streets.""Several instances of stone pelting, burning and damaging of vehicles were reported across the state and police fired in the air to disperse agitators. Curfew was imposed in Yeola, Nashik, where a farmer and a policeman were injured in clashes. Most APMCs in Nashik, Solapur, Ahmednagar and Pune were shut though there was negligible support for the strike in Vidarbha."

Sandeep Gidde (34), an MBA, is a Sangli farmer who also works as an event manager hosting agri-exhibitions. And 47-year old Dhananjay Dhorde has a Bachelor's degree and owns a 15-acre farm in Aurangabad.Younger, educated farmers like them form the backbone of Kisan Kranti, the group spearheading the strike which has crippled vegetable and milk supply chains across large parts of the state. The apolitical, leaderless agitation has drawn support from 37 smaller groups. But its core members are between 30 and 50 years old. Few have participated in previous agitations even though they come from farming families.""Our fathers did `rasta-rokos' and hunger strikes but it led nowhere. So we decided to do something different. If you don't pinch the nose, the mouth won't open,"" says Rayate. Significantly , the Opposition's `Sangharsh Yatra' just two months ago created barely a ripple.Besides small meetings, the use of social media including Whatsaspp and Facebook helped the movement reach out to other groups, guided by Gidde's event management skills. ""I knew how to reach out to large groups of people effectively and what posts could go viral,"" he says.What drew the Kisan Kranti together was the devastating crash in prices of key crops like onions, tomatoes and tur dal over the last year. The issue touched a chord among farmers across districts.The price crash had pushed even prosperous farmers like Rayate deeper into debt. ""Grapes which cost Rs 25 per kilo to grow, fetch a price of Rs 10. Last month brinjals were selling at Rs 25 for 20 kg. It cost more to transport them to the mandi,"" he said.The final catalyst was a gram sabha meeting in Ahmednagar's Puntamba village in April where villagers initially considered boycotting sowing. Later they decided to boycott agricultural markets instead. ""They realized its only when urban food markets are affected that there will be pressure on the government,"" says G Patil, an agro-markets expert who is part of Kisan Kranti.The movement spread to the onion belt of Nashik and the milk producing regions of western Maharashtra including Sangli, Satara and Solapur. Marathwada's districts, mainly Aurangabad, also joined.The discontent among farmers in the north Maharashtra belt had escalated with the state's decontrol of agricultural markets last year, says Patil. ""Traders called a strike for a monthand-a-half and onion prices crashed to 5 paise,"" says Patil. Later, the glut in the onion, tomato and tur crop kept prices low. Farmers ended up dumping their tomato and onion crop. By November, demonetisation added to the crisis.Activists recall a similar agitation led by farmer leader Sharad Joshi in 1982 but this one has created greater impact. ""The idea spread so fast because its time has come,"" says Patil. ""The new generation of farmers are more aware.They understand issues like import subsidies and the fact that crops are sometimes imported at a higher price than domestic rates.""Kisan Kranti has also drawn professionals including lawyers and social workers, whom they rely on for advice.""We have drawn up committees for different tasks: legal advice, meetings with the government, administration and publicity ,"" says Gidde."

Deepak Joshi At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak JoshiThere has been a split in the ranks of farmers over the decision to withdraw their agitation after a meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Friday night.A large chunk of farmers criticised the delegation which met the CM and claimed that the strike will continue. The backlash against leaders who were part of the delegation which announced the withdrawal of the strike has been so strong that many of them were forced to make a clarification that the strike has not been called off yet.If farmers think I have made a mistake, then I seek forgiveness from them. If they feel that the strike should continue then I am with them, said Jayaji Suryavanshi, member of the Kisan Kranti Morcha.Suryavanshi seemed to have drawn the maximum ire from farmers who burned his effigies. Visuals of the chief minister speaking into his ears during the marathon four-hour meeting on Friday created a perception that he had struck a deal with the government.This is a decision taken by children of farmers and not by politicians. We have told the state government that if it does not stay true to its promise in the next four months, we will not allow the government to function, Suryavanshi had said soon after the core committee meeting with the CM in which the withdrawal had been announced. However, the backlash the decision received seems to have made many leaders including Suryavanshi rethink their position.Many local farmers were unhappy that the committee decided to take a decision without taking into confidence farmers from across the state.The committee should have heard what the government had to say and then come back and shared the details with farmers. They, however, announced the withdrawal of the strike without any concrete assurances from the state or taking people into confidence. For us they are not a core committee but a chor (thieves) committee and we will continue with the agitation, Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, which had become the epicentre of the agitation, said.The Maharashtra Kisan Sabha has also criticised the decision to end the strike.The CM has spun a web around farmers. He has not given any clear assurance. If others want, they can withdraw from the agitation but the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha will continue with its agitation till we receive loan waiver for farmers, said a leader of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha.Ajit Navale, general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said, The chief minister did not give a clear answer to any of our demands. The new October 31 deadline that has been declared is a farce the 4-person committee will only announce its findings that day. No concrete decision regarding the waiver of loans or implementation of the Swaminathan report has been taken.Fadnavis has said that the commission shall look into waiving of loans of farmers who have smaller lands. What about Vidarbha or Marathwada, where most farmers have 10 to 15 acres of land, said Navale.The Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna also criticised the withdrawal and claimed that the government was attempting to create a rift between farmers.I was first invited to a meeting with the CM but was detained by the Pune rural police at Dehu Road police station. I was allowed to go only after the announcement of the strike being called off. This is an attempt to create a rift between farmers, Sanjay Patil Ghanekar, leader of the Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna, said.Meanwhile, farmers in Nashik held a meeting on Saturday and decided to continue with their agitation including a state-wide bandh on June 5. The farmers meeting also heckled senior BJP leaders including Dindori MP Harishchandra Chavan and BJP MLAs from Nashik Balasaheb Sanap and Devyani Pharande when they tried to attend the meeting, forcing them to leave.In spite of the strike being called off, protests continued in areas like Dindori where women farmers blocked traffic on Kalwan Dindori road. In Saigaon near Yeola in Nashik district, onion and milk were thrown on the road. Similar agitations took place in Jalgaon and Parbhani as well.The decision to call off the strike seems to have had no impact on prices of vegetables which have kept on shooting up in cities like Mumbai. The wholesale price of capsicum jumped from Rs 60 on Friday to Rs 100 on Saturday. Carrot prices increased from Rs 40 to Rs 80, tomato from Rs 30 to Rs 80, brinjal Rs 40 to Rs 80. The price of a bundle of coriander jumped from Rs 100 to Rs 150.Vashi APMC saw nearly 175 vehicles coming into the market. However, the bulk of them were from outside the state.The prices are still high. The decision to take the strike back was taken only late on Friday. The market will remain shut on Sunday. We need to see how farmers react on Monday to the strike call that has been given. Only then will we get a clear picture on when prices can stabilise, Naresh Kor, a trader from Vashi APMC said.Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti said the people who negotiated with the government were novices and he would hold a meeting of all farmer leaders and groups in Nashik next week to chart out the course of action. The Shiv Sena also criticised the state government and claimed that the state, rather than trying to find a solution, had tried to create a rift between farmers.Rather than trying to sort out the problem, the government seems to have tried to create a rift between farmers. They are just prolonging taking a decision. This is nothing but running away from the problem. It has been the Senas long-standing demand that there should be complete loan waiver for farmers, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A truck carrying mangoes from Andhra Pradesh to Mandsaur was stopped in Bidwal area of Dhar district.Protesters threw the mangoes on road, to the delight of passers-by who collected the fruit. Police registered a case against the protesters.In Dewas, milk supply was badly affected and vegetable markets remained virtually closed. Dairies too remained closed and a fight between farmers and vegetable vendors was reported from Chapda area of the district.Prices of milk and vegetables have almost doubled in Neemuch district. Price of okra and tomato has risen to Rs 40 per kg from Rs 20. The price of milk has gone up to Rs 60 per litre from Rs 40.There was a scuffle between some vegetable vendors from a Dalit community and farmers when the latter stopped them from selling vegetables at Khawasha in the tribal-dominated Jhabua district.The agitation also crippled milk supply in Khandwa district.In Mandsaur district, police and revenue officials had a tough time getting 40,000 litres of milk from dairies distributed.Shortage of milk and vegetables was seen in markets in Indore district too. ""Five hundred policemen were deployed this morning for facilitating milk and vegetables supply,"" Indore deputy inspector general of police H C Mishra said.The state capital Bhopal too has started feeling the pinch. Prices of vegetables and fruits in city markets have shot up.In a surprise development, BKS's Indore-Ujjain division's treasurer Laxminarayan Patel said it supports farmers' protest. ""But we are against vandalism,"" he said.Asked why BKS came out with support on the third day of agitation, Patel said it was with farmers from day one.Senior Congress MLA Mukesh Nayak also supported the farmers. ""Farmers are unhappy with the state government and were unanimous about fighting for their demands,"" he said.Congress leaders today addressed press conferences across the state to express support for the protest.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had said late last night that all issues can be sorted out through talks.Farmers should not fall prey to those who have vested interests in such agitations, he said.Incidentally, farmers in neighbouring Maharashtra too are conducting a similar protest, blocking supply of milk and vegetables to cities."

The imminent onset of rains will destroy harvested produce as well as standing crops in the fields.""Approximately 250 truckloads of vegetables unloaded in Vashi on Sunday which is almost the same number as Saturday. Of these just 50 trucks were from Maharashtra , the rest from Gujarat, AP and MP. But few buyers arrived because of the uncertainty of the situation,"" said APMC trader Shankar Pingle.Pingle said other states were reaping the benefits of a local agitation. Deepak Sathe, owner of Byculla and Vashi's Sai Vegetables said, ""On Sunday, the wholesale rate of tomato was Rs 40-45, cauliflower and ladies' fingers Rs 45, capsicum Rs 50, green chillies and coriander Rs 60. I also deal with tomato farmers in Pune and Narayangaon who say they are barely finding buyers even for Rs 17-18 per kg. But see the exorbitant price Mumbaikars are being forced to pay.""Retail prices did fall marginally in certain areas like Dadar, Vikhroli and Bhandup but this was not enough to entice customers back to the market.Retailers opted to stay away from Vashi on Sunday for two reasons. Matunga vendor Rajabhau Patil said, ""We had vegetables left over from the previous day and we knew that few customers would step out to buy Sunday. Also there was the match between India and Pakistan. We cannot replenish our carts in such expensive times unless we are sure we will find buyers.""Several families tend to dine out or cook non-vegetarian fare on Sunday. This is another factor that prompts vendors to keep from adding stocks over the weekend. The trading community unanimously believes that the state should solve the impasse by inviting all farmers' groups for talks rather than pick and choose factions. Patil as well as Shankar Pingle, who was director in the NCP-affiliated APMC, echoed similar sentiments."

Farmers across Maharashtra have been on an indefinite protest since June 1, demanding, among other things, a complete farm loan waiver, implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendations, an increase in the procurement price of milk and a pension scheme. The strike has adversely affected supplies of vegetables and milk to wholesale markets across the state and led to an increase in prices.On Saturday, the state government announced a farm loan waiver of Rs 30,000 crore, the biggest such write-off for farmers in the state yet. The announcement caused a division among farmer leaders, with one section of the Kisan Kranti  the umbrella organisation which led the protest  becoming the target of others who said they were not taken into confidence before the waiver was announced.In todays meeting it was decided that we will carry on with our protest and a state-wide bandh will be on June 5. We also plan to hold a convention of farmers on June 8 where the future course of action will be decided, Ajit Navale, the general secretary of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha, said. The farmer leaders will meet once again on June 6 and will then hold a statewide farmers meeting on June 8 in Nashik. The farmers said they expect a complete shutdown of the state on June 5 and made an appeal to the common people to join the strike.A semblance of normality was restored in various agriculture product markets in the state. Vegetable-laden trucks under police protection entered various agriculture product market committees.There were stray incidents of violence. In Dalwat, nearly 300 protesters stopped a tomato carrying truck and offloaded its contents on the road. The mob is also alleged to have thrown stones at a police vehicle. The police opened fire in the air to restrain the mob. Farmers also protested in Hingolo district. A section of farmers said they were incited by the NCP to not sell their produce in the markets.At Barsi talulka in western Maharashtra, farmer Gahininath Parshuram Raut lodged a police complaint, saying: On June 3, I set out with my fresh farm vegetables towards Agriculture Produce Market Committee. I had vegetables worth Rs 1,600. I parked my vegetables in the market and was waiting for the money, but local NCP taluka chief Nandkumar Kashid and panchayat samilti group leader Sunderrao Jagdale warned we should stop growing vegetables. They destroyed my vegetables.Several farmers said the Congress and NCP, which controlled the agri markets, were exploiting them to serve their politics.

Thanks good monsoon, the third advance estimates of foodgrain production is 273.38 million tonnes in 2016-17, higher than the second advance estimates in of 271.98 MT and final estimates of 251.57 MT in 2015-16. Farm growth for the full fiscal has zoomed to 4.9%, compared with a near flat 0.7% expansion in 2015-16. If the forecast of the India Meteorology Department (IMD) for this year holds true, the grain output will set a new record, boosting the growth rate. This is good news for the economy. After two years of back-to-back drought, in 2014-15 and 2015-16, we can look forward acche din (better days) in future.Increased production does not necessary mean more income for farmers. In fact, the pattern of bumper crops and dejected farmers has become a recurring feature of Indian agriculture. Farmers in some states are regretting their abundant yields this year as the prices of agricultural commodities have crashed. Chilli farmers in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, tomato growers in Karnataka and pulses cultivators in Maharashtra are confronted with a severe crisis that has witnessed prices fall by more than half in a matter of just weeks. Even Punjab, known as the granary of India, has turned into a hotspot for farmer suicides. The Centre last month informed the Supreme Court that over 12,000 suicides had been reported in the agricultural sector every year since 2013. The states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu accounted for over 87% of them.According to the Economic Survey 2016-17, the average annual income of a rural household in 17 states is a paltry Rs 20,000, less than the annual mobile bill of some upwardly-mobile citizen in a city. This is primarily because the benefits from his labour are cornered by intermediaries in the market. Instead of the policy obsession with agricultural growth rates, the focus must shift to ensuring fair deal to the farmers. Apart from effective implementation of marketing reforms recently initiated by the Centre through the model Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act, this require more and better managed investment in agriculture. In 2014, the BJP had come to power promising profitability in agriculture by ensuring a minimum of 50% profits over the cost of production, cheaper agriculture inputs and credit, introducing latest technologies for farming and high-yielding seeds, and linking MGNREGA to agriculture. After three years in power, the government is nowhere near even partial fulfilment of those promises."

But a section of farmers outfits is not happy and want loans of all 1.34 crore farmers in the state to be written off. The demand is supported by Opposition parties and the BJPs main ally, the Shiv Sena. Significantly, two influential farmers outfits, the late Sharad Joshi-founded Shetkari Sanghatana and MP Raju Shetti-led Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, have decided to jump into the agitation. Shetti is an ally of the BJP. A 21-member core committee of prominent farmers leaders in the state has been formed, which will be meeting on June 8 in Nashik to decide on a future course of the agitation.Anticipating trouble and in the backdrop of the violence in neighbouring MP on a same issue, the state governments orders that prohibit five or more people from assembling at a spot will remain in effect till June 16 in Pune, June 17 in Kolhapur and June 19 in Nashik.In Mumbai, the vegetable markets received regular supply and prices stablised on Tuesday. The rates of tomato dipped to Rs40 a dozen, while cauliflower was priced at Rs 60 a kilogram. Fruits like chikoo dipped to Rs40 a dozen from Rs120 a dozen when the strike was at its peak on Friday.In a significant development, NCP chief Sharad Pawar called on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi apparently to seek his attention to the farmers agitation in Maharashtra. According to reports, Modi told Pawar that Fadnavis would take a call on loan waiver.Significantly, state governments hopes to get any assistance from the Centre to write off farmers loans suffered a setback as union urban development minister M Venkaiah Naidu, who was in Mumbai on Tuesday, categorically ruled out any loan waiver package or aid by the Centre to the state for the purpose. Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have announced loan waivers on their own and Maharashtra will have to follow the same, Naidu told reporters.In the backdrop of the agitations, Fadnavis met BJPs ministers late on Tuesday. The meeting was held to review the BJPs recently undertaken farmer outreach campaign Shivar Samwad (Dialogue with Farmers) across nearly 43,000 villages in Maharashtra, at his official residence Varsha. The review comes ahead of party president Amit Shahs visit to Maharashtra as a part of his all India 95-day campaign tour to review organisational strengths of the BJP across all states, on June 16, 17 and 18."

A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

(Express File Photo: Mayur Bargaje)After a 10-day gap, auctions in 305 Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) across Maharashtra finally resumed as farmers, who had been staging an agitation, decided to bring their produce to the markets. The core committee of agitating farmers, which met in Nashik on Thursday, had conditionally decided to resume agriculture supplies to the APMCs.The immediate impact was a sharp reduction in vegetable prices in the markets. At the Nashik APMC, a 20 kg crate of tomato that fetched Rs 200-250 10 days ago, before the strike started, was now selling at Rs 100-150. We are now afraid that the massive glut in the market, will lead to a massive fall in prices hitting farmers further, Neelesh Kor, a trader from Nashik APMC said.Many farmers had been expecting that due to the massive shortage over the past few days they would end up getting decent prices in the market. However, many of them returned disappointed. Before the strike, a bunch of 10 cauliflower heads would sell for Rs 100 to Rs 150 but on Friday, the price was between Rs 40 and Rs 50.We are scared of how long these prices will fall. We suffered over the past few days because we could not bring the produce to the market. Now we are suffering as the prices have fallen, Vishnu Sonawane, a farmer from Dindori, said. We have started the auction. Farmers suffered quite a bit during the strike as they would not bring the produce to the market. Over the past 10 days, traders were going to farms and picking up the produce. We hope that normalcy will get restored in the next few days, Jagdish Apsunde, a trader at the Nashik APMC, said.The core committee of farmers, while deciding to resume agriculture supplies to APMCs, had, however, laid down an ultimatum stating that if the state does not hold a meeting with the committee in the next two days they will hold sit downs before all government offices on June 12 and stage a rail and rasta roko across the state on June 13. The Committee has also stated that from Friday, it will not allow any minister in state government to hold any kind of function in the state.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

Peeling-off the political peels, there lies a core to the matter, which serially has the following aspects.Is farming the riskiest profession in this country, leading to so many suicides? Is a farmers income stability the same or even comparable to that of the wholesaler, retailer or consumer? Why does he have to take a heap of loans, and still continue to top-up? Why does the hand that tills the soil still considered synonymous with poverty? Are MSPs (minimal support prices) calculated on say, 25% above the costs, as retail elsewhere is protected by MRPs? All politicians being farmers (80% truly, the remaining by possession of land), enjoy tax exemptions, and earn their salaries, seem to have the cake and take it too!

Others may be linked to the frailty of human nature. The glaring blunder that one sees is that quite like the Imperial policy. Independent India found it easier to continue to enforce a camouflaged negative input policy (lagaan) on the farmer (In WTO parlance, it was once remarked that Indian agriculture was working on a negative subsidy). After consuming his voting powers, he was to be kept ignorant and disconnected so as not to be able to negotiate his grains in his market-linked product.Misinformation was to make him kneel down before his self -chosen ministers and beg for financial assistance so that he could he could replace himself as the second bull to till the soil once again.He was unaware of one crucial rightthat since he was the owner of the product, he had a right to negotiate for prices with his government, and that would also include international markets. I am not ruling out the democratic process of negotiations. No system was worked out. Our tanned sinewy brothers began to be seen hanging from trees, or slain by pesticides bought from loans, which was actually their own money, perpetually and systematically picked from his pockets. Cant blame anyone in particular, for we have had two farmer Prime Ministers (Ch. Charan Singh, Shri Dewe Gowda). I may vindicate the premise further. Why is loan waiver to the farmer a winning proposition for any political party, and has been tried by every political party!The book of politics is the same. Only editions vary.I had the honour of treating Indias first agronomist, Shri Sharad Joshi, the founder of the Shetkaari Sangathana in Vidarbha.Being a Rajya Sabha member, and for a while a WTO negotiator at that time, he would drop in casually, and often invite me to dinner at the India International Centre.On a particular day, he asked me how much a movie ticket cost twenty years ago. It was reasonable to guess, Rs. 20-25.At the time of the conversation, a PVR ticket was around Rs 500. Regarding onion, and tomato prices, I agreed they must have been around 10-15 then, and 15-25 now.He brought out his point that though the cinema gained 200 times in value (market links not denied), the man who grew the potato, at the most doubled his cost. This yawning gap was not sustainable once the markets get linked (invariably), nationally and internationally. This was the crux he told me.On the other hand, he added, it was not feasible that rice and pulses be sold at Rs. 100-200/kg.and in between lay the unpredictable and meandering river of politics! Sure enough, two months later, Mr Joshi dropped in for a chat, and told me that a politician had relieved him of his WTO duties. Neither he nor I was surprised. I had also begun to realize that even in medicine, mediocrity fetches the bulk.In Darwins quote, survival of the fittest, the word fittest perhaps denotes adaptability of a fox more than it denotes the strength of the lion, or the structure of the dinosaur.A wise government would like to take an opportunity in reforming the system.In its basics, the matter is of production of that which feeds the nation, as well contributes the largest chunk to the national economy, and the prices it should fetch in the market, so that the production is lucrative enough for people to invest and put efforts in this production.The answer lies in all the nitty-gritty that farming is about. Not to deny that government units may be working on it, the seed production units at much less subsidies, can increase yields many folds, for a component that grows naturally.Before one talks of outcomes, investments have to be made in infrastructure. Irrigation schemes, river linking have to pick up priority, much like that for industrial growth.I believe much information is being provided on fertilizers and indigenous soil additives as compost. They need to be capitalized on. I believe with better electricity farmers co-operative mini compost plants would be seen more frequently on the landscape.There is a case of hybrid seeds for certain crops, where there is enough evidence that there are no long- term effects on health. The damage done by pesticides should not be forgotten.Loaning to farmers at lesser rates has a limitation, and as other benefits as MNREGA, should be specific and should have checks that money is transferred, and that it is utilized for an agreed purpose.Finally, what the farmer requires are good fund managers. Money earned during a bumper crop is likely to flow to liquor barrels. It may be sagaciously invested for a rainy day or a non-rainy year.Advance advice on crop suitability worked on basis of demand or congestion of forward delivery chains nationally, and internationally is extremely crucial. Such knowledge is on the back of the palms of the commodity market players, as well as the government. Such information should be part of the fund manager and advisory units that should have every farmer enrolled in his area, and advice be given in one to one encounters. It is heartening to see a few apps by some Bangalore-based companies provide all such information to the farmers.Lastly, comes the question of the government allowing private participation in certain sectors in farming, exports, to make the outcomes comparable, publishable, replicable, and without intending much-reliable!Just heard the Chief Minister broke his fast on the second day. No further changes in the compost policy have been announced!Blog-breaking news! Maharashtra has just announced a loan waiver! Brave! Bharat and India are learning not to cheat on each other!Main chhahta bhi yahi tha, wo bewafa nikley,Usey samajhney ka koi to silsila nikaley(Maybe I wanted her to expose her disloyalty,Perhaps that was the only way to understand the affair)"

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

(PTI Photo, File) Nagpur: Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra on Monday. (PTI Photo, File)A HUNDRED years after Mahatma Gandhi led a movement of indigo growers against their oppressor landlords in Bihars Champaran district, farmers of Maharashtra launched an unprecedented strike early this month. But unlike the Champaran Satyagraha, this was a movement led by farmers themselves. It started with farmers from Puntamba, a sleepy village in Ahmednagar district, deciding at a Gram Sabha meeting in April to stop supply of all produce to cities from June 1. That resolution was subsequently adopted by farmers in villages across Maharashtra, culminating in a stunningly successful strike lasting almost 11 days.The striking farmers not only shut down wholesale produce markets and blocked highways to prevent delivery trucks from reaching urban centres, but also even dumped milk and vegetables on the streets. The Maharashtra government was, then, forced to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee of five ministers to hold consultations on the main demands that included a complete waiver of institutional farm loans and remunerative crop prices based on theM S Swaminathan reports formula of 50 per cent returns over cost. These demands were accepted in principle, following which the strike was called off. The collective might of farmers had clearly triumphed over the all-powerful state.The Maharashtra farmers agitation was remarkable for not only its seeming spontaneity and absence of any towering leader, but also it happening in an above-normal rainfall and bumper agricultural harvest year. Such protests one would have normally expected in the event of losses from drought, especially of the kind seen in 2014-15 and 2015-16.But as the accompanying table shows, the Maharashtra government infused around Rs 20,939 crore during the two consecutive drought years through time-honoured relief measures such as crop loss compensation, insurance claims and labour payments under MGNREGA. In addition, rescheduling of crop loans and reduced interest on these  plus the state governments ambitious Jalyukta Shivar programme of water and soil conservation in 25,000 drought-prone villages  turned out to be significant interventions.The trigger for the current farmers agitation has not been any natural calamity-driven distress, which was, on the whole, deftly handled by the state government. Instead, it has primarily been prices.A bumper crop resulting from good rains had ignited hopes among farmers of setting-off their losses from previous years. But what they encountered was a price crash across crops  from cereals and pulses to vegetables and fruits.Take pulses, where the Centre, in a bid to promote their cultivation to bridge domestic shortages, raised the minimum support price for tur (pigeon-pea) from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal. Farmers obliged by increasing production, but the government failed to honour its promise. Far from getting the promised rate, farmers had to dump tur for as low as Rs 3,000 per quintal. Even during peak summer, they realised hardly Rs 5 per kg for tomatoes, onions and other vegetables.In short, farmers suffered more with record production on the back of good rains than when there was crop failure from drought.A second trigger for the stir was the crop loan waiver announcement by a newly-elected government in Uttar Pradesh, which took place around the same time prices were crashing. Farmer organisations admit that waiving loans cannot be a real solution, but say that it will have a soothing effect in the present context. At the least, it will bring many farmers back into the formal credit system. Also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in UP, then why not in Maharashtra?What is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. The need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. And loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.That said, the Maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. Organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like FICCI and CII, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. Farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. In this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.The following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among Maharashtras farmers: * Insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. Similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* The photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. These images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n Drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in Maharashtra. They were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* A spike in suicides, including in northern Maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. The latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. The losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. These farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. They, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* A sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. The Oppositions Sangharsh Yatra and also a ruling coalition partners Atmakalesh Yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.These elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. This is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the American social scientist Robert E Park. And nobody could have imagined that the success of Maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The current prices of tomatoes have already soared to Rs 70-80 per kg in retail markets and would remain so for at least next two months.According to wholesalers, the prices have increased due to a heavy reduction in supply of tomatoes from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana after the rain.Tomato prices shooting up is a normal occurrence during the monsoon months, from June to September. This is because the stock spoils easily during the rain. Right now, we are getting our supply only from Himachal Pradesh, said Rajendra Sharma, president of Azadpur Mandi.The shelf life of tomatoes is not more than four days. Not all retailers have an access to cold storage. So, they tend to recover the losses by selling at a higher price, Sharma said.According to wholesalers, the situation will remain the same until fresh stocks arrive in the markets by August-end.On Thursday, the wholesale prices of tomatoes at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) market at Gazipur were between Rs 30 and 40.The soaring prices of vegetables have affected the sales of vendors in local markets.Till May-June, the retail price of tomatoes was Rs 40 per kg. As soon as the pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices climbed to Rs 60 per kg and finally soared to Rs 80 per kg by the end of the month. Due to a spike in prices, people do not buy more than half a kilogram of tomato at a time, said Abdullah, a vendor at Malviya Nagar vegetable market.Even coriander leaves and green chilies, which came complimentary with vegetables, are now being sold with a price tag of over Rs 10-15 for 100 grams. The increase in the vegetable prices has forced many to exclude these from their shopping list.Except for onions and potatoes, prices of all vegetables have increased by Rs 5-10 in the market. I used to buy vegetables for Rs 200 twice a week, but now the same quantity of vegetables cost anything between Rs 300 and Rs 350, said Aarti Malik, a resident of Geetanjali."

Even Rythu Bazaars have revised their rate cards increasing the prices by 20-30 per cent in comparison to last week, said consumers ruing how bitter gourd, cauliflower, carrot, capsicum and French beans too have become more expensive in the last few days.""I was shocked to find the local supermarket selling to matoes for `70.

While items like carrot, they said, was being transported to the city from Delhi, Indore, Ooty, Chikkaballapur, green chillies were being procured from Kurnool, Uttar Pradesh and Meerut ""There is a shortage of some vegetables which has led to rise in prices.

Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

In order to meet the operational expenses for my acre of tomato I had to borrow around Rs 2 lakh from a moneylender this year, he says.For Maharashtras farmers now, there is water but no liquidity In Tuljapur talukas Salgara Devti village in Osmanabad district, farmer and postwoman Archana Bhosale says everyone is being turned away from the local bank. Similarly, in Nandurghat village of Beed, local journalist and farmer Amol Jadhav says those visiting the Maharashtra Gramin Bank branch have been told instructions regarding fresh credit havent arrived yet.Across the state, lead bank managers for agricultural loans say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 promised by the government cannot be extended in the current circumstances where eligibility criteria have been repeatedly tweaked since the announcement and with no master circular from the Reserve Bank of India to all banks on writing off crop loan accounts that are non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.The government and the RBI will have to clearly state which NPAs are to be written off, only then can fresh credit be offered. And banks have seen next to zero recovery ever since the loan waiver demand began to pick up. With nobody making payments on old loans and with no detailed intimation from the government on how to proceed, local banks actually cannot offer fresh loans to anyone, though there are requests every day, says the lead bank manager in one of Marathwadas districts. The Maharashtra Gramin Bank, a regional rural bank, is the only one to have issued a circular to its branches on the loan waiver and fresh credit, but sources say disbursals have remained very low despite demand.The Gramin Bank services 17 districts, including all of Marathwada where the district central cooperative banks are mostly weak or defunct. Chief Manager for Credit and Refinance K D Joshi says a circular was issued as per the directives of the state government to all 408 branches, but concedes that there is confusion regarding eligibility. The criteria are changing daily. Now all loans disbursed since 2009 that are overdue as of June 30, 2016 are eligible, but the government has not issued a circular about this. Until there is a firm eligibility criterion, some confusion will remain, he told The Indian Express.Other bankers say farmers are also a confused lot, some hoping to have multiple loans in multiple banks written off, others simply unaware of the conditions to be fulfilled before the mortgage record can be wiped clean from their 7/12 land extracts. Meanwhile, the distressed district central cooperative banks inability to service customers has added to the slow pace of farmers accessing fresh credit. The Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) had, by the end of June last year, disbursed over Rs 1,200 crore in crop loans. Once known for its robust financial health, the bank has this year disbursed only Rs 61.41 crore  six per cent of its set target of Rs 1101.05 crore  till now. Chairman Narendra Darade blames the continuing impact of demonetisation for the situation. We do not have cash with us. How are we to disburse money to farmers, he asks.The confusion and consequent glitches in extending fresh credit to farmers eligible for the waiver comes after an already slow crop loan season for Maharashtras banks. By the end of June 2016, of the Rs 37,677.03 crore target for kharif loans, banks had disbursed Rs 20,889.20 crore  a healthy 55 per cent of the target. However, by the middle of June this year, of the targeted Rs 40,547.20 crore, only Rs 9,249.22 crore had been disbursed  barely 23 per cent of the target. On expected lines, district central cooperative banks that disburse around 40 per cent of crop loans have been the worst performers. They have disbursed Rs 5225.94 crore, or 40 per cent of their target of Rs 13108.38 crore. At the end of June 2016, these banks had disbursed Rs 10,451.77 crore of their targeted Rs 13,113.57 crore  80 per cent of the target.Simultaneously, sowing has continued despite the crisis in institutional credit. With healthy water levels in dams and local water bodies, nearly 40 per cent of the kharif sowing is now complete, with over 56 lakh hectares of farm land already sown in anticipation of the promised normal monsoon. At this time last year, only about 13 lakh hectares of farmland had been sown. Villagers say many have turned to private moneylenders in the absence of farm loans from banks. Worse, in some parts of Marathwada, villages actually completed sowing, enthused by the June rainfall, and a dry spell since the end of June has many worried about the likelihood of having to undertake a second sowing, called dubaar perni, a chronic and crippling additional cost for farmers in rainfed and non-irrigated parts.In Dhamangaon village of Ashti taluka, a drought-prone region, for example, a plentiful monsoon in 2016 has ensured theres plenty of water for drinking. But it hasnt rained since the end of June. If it doesnt rain in a week or 10 days, we will have to go in for a second sowing, says deputy sarpanch Dr Syed Bashir. Dhamangaons farmers have sown urad, moong, bajra and cotton and are now concerned about the young crops health at a crucial growth stage.With the weather office predicting a relatively dry July, farmers in Ashti expect they may have to sow a second time. If the promised fresh loans are disbursed now, the money will at least be handy for that, says Dr Syed. If it comes much later, whats the use?Minister of State for Agriculture Sadashiv Khot admitted to receiving complaints about non-disbursal of crop loans from various districts of the state. I will be meeting the chief minister on Friday and ask him to look into the matter. I will also be requesting the district guardian ministers to take weekly meetings with the lead banks and follow up about loan disbursal, he said. Khot signalled that banks who had failed to provide credit on time would face action.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

According to an official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka.In May, tomato cultivators in Kolar were dumping their crop by the roadside as prices had crashed to as low as Rs. 2 a kg in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard. This month, however, the tide has turned. Rates have doubled and, in some cases, increased four times since June. Kolar district is one of the biggest producers of tomato in Karnataka.The reason for this change in narrative is a massive loss of the crop in some of the major tomato growing States in the country.Huge damage to crops, particularly in Nashik in Maharashtra, is the main reason for increase in demand from Kolar. Plus, damage to crop due to diseases and pests in non-traditional areas such as Mandya has added to the scarcity, said M.S. Raju, Deputy Director, Horticulture Department.According to A. Vishwanath, an APMC official, traders from Gujarat, Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh are purchasing the product in Karnataka. Another APMC source said that there has been interest even from Punjab. On June 4, a quintal was being sold at the APMC for a minimum of Rs. 314 and a maximum of Rs. 1,400 depending on quality and variety. On July 4, the price range was from Rs. 667 to Rs. 5,334 a quintal. On Wednesday morning, the average rate was around Rs. 5,000.In the retail market, consumers were paying Rs. 10 per kg a month ago. Now, they have to shell out as much as Rs. 50.Search for alternativesA reduction in supply from other States and districts combined with the produce from Kolar being shipped out of Karnataka has led to a scarcity and a steep hike in prices in the local market.This has led to experimenting with other local products. Restaurateurs, for instance, are using lemon powder while householders are opting for tamarind.CFarmers are happy to see tomato fetching good prices after a long time. Rates are likely to go higherN.

Even as the State got its share of rains, price of the vegetable continues to skyrocket.Sources said, tomato is priced at `70 to `80 a kg in the open market which is almost three times the cost of the vegetable that was being sold at `25 a kg a month ago.The unprecedented price rise has been attributed to supply crunch. While the Capital city requires 100 tonnes of tomato daily, it is now getting half of it. Apart from the locally grown crops, the State depends mostly on Karnataka for the vegetable.According to traders, the red vegetable was priced at `100 a kilo at the Unit-IV market on Thursday. The price, however, came down to `70 on Friday though in some areas it is being sold at `80 a kg.Secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said the price fluctuation in the market depends on the demand and supply. The supply has been very less from the tomato producing States, he said.Blaming the State Government for the situation, he said, farmers in Keonjhar and Angul region were forced to sell tomatoes at throwaway price during summer. The Government could have purchased the vegetable from the farmers at a reasonable price and stored it for the season. Unfortunately, despite repeated demands, it has failed to set up required number of cold storages, he pointed out.The traders alleged that the retail price is high compared to the wholesale price as the Government has failed to control it. The retail price is 20 to 30 per cent high than the wholesale price, Panda said claiming it should be 5 to 10 per cent depending on the commodity. We are expecting a change in price after the arrival of fresh crop from Maharashtra and Hassan district of Karnataka in next 15 days, he added."

This staple item is selling for Rs 70-80 in most parts of the city as well as Thane and Navi Mumbai.Citizens have been tweeting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action. The holy month of Shravan began in north India on Monday. The fasting season according to the Maharashtrian and Gujarati calendar starts July 24. As families abstain from non-vegetarian food during this time, consumption of tomato rises.Traders have no explanation for the increase other than ""unseasonal rain"". They say the situation will continue through August. This is bewildering given that farmers were dumping produce in the streets as tomato rates crashed to Re 1 per kg a few weeks ago.In Andheri market, vendor Umar said, ""We are selling good quality fruit for Rs 100 because we are purchasing for Rs 75 in the wholesale market. This stock comes from Bangalore. The crop in Maharashtra has failed due to excessive rain."" Last week, the largest trader in APMC had cited a slew of reasons including ""demonetisation, farmers' strike and bad weather"".On Monday, buyers in Thane market, Bandra and Andheri restricted themselves to purchasing half a kg. Others chose to avoid tomato. ""The greengrocer cheekily asked me why I did not want to buy tomato since I had bought other vegetables. I retorted that at Rs 80 per kg, he was welcome to keep his produce,"" said Shiuli Banerjee of Malad.Kitchens are forced to explore alternatives. Borivli housewife Rosemary Fernandes recommended that households try vinegar while Maya Mirchandani of Andheri recommended thickening the gravy with sour curd or tamarind pulp. Banerjee suggested lime juice and kokum to add sourness, and gravies thickened with potato and cornflour to tide over the crisis.Prices of onion-tomato have maintained a steady average of Rs 15-20 per kg since 2014. In previous years, the country had seen a biannual spike in rates from March-May and October-December as traders cited ""seasonal shortages"" owing to the vagaries of monsoon. This inexplicable spike has brought consumers' worst fears back to haunt them."

The impact is also felt all over the South and the northern States. Currently, the crop is not raised in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan due to adverse climatic conditions. These two States are the usual competitors to the Madanapalle grades.During the last one month, the tomato trade has been playing truant with not only the farmers, but also agents from across India, and the domestic retail market in Chittoor, Kadapa, Anantapur and Bellary (Karnataka). The price which stood at Rs. 20 a kg in the first week of June started taking giant leaps week after week, and now reached a level virtually creating panic among the public at Rs. 100 a kg.Alarming dip in arrivalsAs per the latest trend, the wholesale market price on Monday stood at Rs. 78 per kg (first grade) and the second grade at Rs. 48-54 per kg (based on quality and size). The arrival for the day was 241 metric tonnes. There had been an alarming dip in the arrivals since a week from 400 MT last week, followed by 311 MT on Thursday last and 277 MT on Sunday. In contrast, arrivals peaked to 750 MT per day in June-July 2016.The first grade stock, forming 40% of the arrivals, is exported to the metros in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and MP and some malls in Tirupati, Chittoor and Srikalahasti in the district. The second grade is sent to the urban centres of Chittoor district with a mind-blowing retail price at Rs. Rs. 90-100 a kg in vegetable markets and petty shops.This is double the wholesale price. Same situation is reported from elsewhere in towns of surrounding districts of Anantapur, Kadapa; and bordering Kolar and Chikballapur districts of Karnataka, while the price is even slightly up in the border areas of Tamil Nadu. The steep hike is attributed to the damage of the stock during transit, escalation of transportation charges and poor shelf life.Turns invisibleThe impact is clearly felt on the hotel industry and households.A majority of home-makers are forced to substitute the prized vegetable with tamarind juice. The roadside eateries and pani-poori carts are doubly cautious while using it; and it has turned invisible in salads of considerably big restaurants and bars. Though most customers tend to avoid buying it, retail and petty traders are not affected by the scenario, with the smooth disposal of small stocks thanks to a limited number of customers essentially in need of the temporarily unreachable vegetable. Meanwhile, traders said the situation would ease by mid August."

(Bishwarup Dutta)July 10: Tomato prices have almost doubled over the past two weeks as the stock produced in Bengal in winter is over and the state is depending on the supply from Karnataka.Tomatoes in Bengal are seasonal whereas in the southern state, it's almost throughout the year, a trader in Koley Market, the largest wholesale vegetable market in the city, said.Prices were lower when tomatoes were in abundance because of production in Bengal and supply from Karnataka.Now that the Bengal stock has depleted, the supply has dried up in retail markets across the city and the prices have shot up to Rs 80 a kg.Two weeks ago, tomatoes were selling at Rs 40 a kg, the trader said.""The rise in the prices is because of supply shortage. Fifteen trucks used to arrive in the market daily. Now, the number has dwindled to seven or eight,"" another trader said.At Koley Market, the wholesale prices are hovering between Rs 60 and Rs 64 a kg.Bengal produces tomatoes in winter and they are available in the market for a couple of months.""December-February is the production period in the state.

Once the tomatoes from Nashik in Maharashtra start reaching the city, the prices will come down, he said.""Once the tomatoes from Nashik arrive, around August, tomato prices will drop again. The spike happens every year around this time,"" Rabindranath Koley, general secretary of the forum of traders' organisation, Bengal, said.About a decade ago, tomatoes were available only in winter, Koley said.

Rains across the country have affected supply of vegetables to Bengaluru.Abdul Hafiz, a vegetable supplier, points out, We get a lot of tomatoes from Nashik in Maharashtra. But due to incessant rain in that state, movement of vehicles has been affected in last one month. We see supply of close to 150 truckloads of vegetables every day, but now hardly 50 of them are arriving. Again, this is a month of marriages and functions, so a lot of supply is going there. This have invariably pushed up prices.Idrees Chaudhary, general secretary of Russell Market Traders Association says, Even at places like Devanahalli, Kolar, Bangarpet in Karnataka, from where we get vegetables, most of the crops have been damaged by rain.Interestingly, for several months, tomatoes were being sold for anywhere between `7 and a maximum of `20. Consumers are perplexed with the sudden rise.Tomato is something that we use almost in every recipe. With the prices shooting up, it has become very difficult for middle class people like us. We cannot limit our consumption, neither is our income going high any time soon. I guess we have no other option but to bear the brunt, said Nikhil Kumar, a software engineer.Venkat Krishna, a manager at the online food-startup hungermeals.com in HSR Layout, points out, We deliver meals at very affordable prices to offices and homes. With the sudden increase in vegetable prices, we cannot hike the rates of our meals. Our customers will not understand and we will end up losing them. Despite the loss, we have to serve the same quality of food to our consumers. We are hoping for prices to come down.A vendor at KR Market said, A lot of vegetables like capsicum, tomato, beans and other greens have been diverted for exports this year. This too has affected supply.However, traders are hopeful that the prices will come down in about a months time."

According to retailers, this is perhaps the first time that tomato prices have crossed the Rs. 100 mark, according to retailers. The higher quality tomatoes from Bangalore cost a bit more at Rs. 120 a kg in Mumbai, they said.Every monsoon, prices would go up to around Rs. 80 due to shortage, but this time it is worse. There is an acute shortage in the market, Harishchandra Gupta, a vegetable vendor in the western suburbs, said.Sources said the sudden shortage in tomatoes is a direct fallout of the state-wide protest by farmers last month. They said rampaging mobs of farmers demanding loan waivers had destroyed truckloads of tomatoes across the State. This, sources said, had forced a large number of marginal tomato farmers to destroy their standing crop as they feared the protest could continue.Small farmers were scared. The off-take from their fields had stopped. Fearing more loss, they preferred to uproot the standing crop much before the harvest and plant other crops. This has lead to a supply problem, which is expected to continue till August, a tomato trader said.In just two days, prices have gone up from Rs. 80 per kg to Rs. 100 per kg. Two months ago, tomato was selling at Rs. 16 per kg.This is the part of the year when Maharashtra supplies tomatoes to many parts of the country including north India. The shortage at in the State has not only pushed prices up in Mumbai, but also in U.P., Rajesh Kumar, a vegetable seller, said.Prices up at retail chainsAt supermarkets like Big Bazaar, tomatoes were selling for Rs. 85 to Rs. 90 per kg. Surprisingly, prices at the comparatively upmarket Godrej Natures Basket was lower at Rs. 67 per kg. Analysts said this is because such stores have long term supply contracts with growers.Tomato prices touched Rs. 80 in Mira-Bhayandar and Vasai-Virar, evoking strong reactions from homemakers. Its not possible to buy tomatoes any more, said Ruma Bose, a Vasai resident.Officials at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Corporation (APMC), Vashi said the supply of tomatoes has gone down by nearly half. While the demand across the city and its suburbs is more close to 3,000 quintal per day, today only about 1,290 quintal has come to the APMC, an APMC official said.Shivaji Pahinkar, secretary, APMC Vashi, said wholesale prices hovered between Rs. 45 and Rs. 60 per kg on Thursday. Declining to pinpoint why tomato supply has dried up, Mr. Pahinkar attributed it to the vagaries of crop production and market economics. We cannot say for sure why there is a surge in prices, he said, while ruling out GST as a factor.Regional mandis (markets) from where retailers procure their supplies are charging between Rs. 70 and Rs. 80 per kg, which is being sold in retail at Rs. 100. We are not responsible for the retail prices, said Mr Pahinkar. You can add 30% to our prices for transport and miscellaneous charges, he added.Ramkrishna Yadav, a vegetable seller at Mira Road, is not happy with the soaring prices.We plan on picking up a certain amount of vegetables at the wholesale market, but we come away with much less as prices are high. This has been the situation for the past fortnight.Ganesh Pinglay, a wholesaler in Vashi, said this price rise could be due to shortfall in production. A couple of months ago, tomato prices hit rock bottom, and farmers could not even recover their production cost, so they didnt go ahead with the second tomato crop. Now they will plant another crop, which should come to the market in another month-and-a-half, he said.Two months ago, tomato prices fell so much farmers couldnt recover production cost, so they didnt go ahead with the second tomato cropGanesh PinglayVashi-based wholesale dealer"

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

This has forced them to hike rates urging us also to maintain the same. There will be no relief until this changes,"" said vendor Sadiq Shaikh.TOI had reported last week that poor rain in Maharashtra and Karnataka had led to a serious shortage in crop output. Resultantly leading to the low tomato produce and subsequent shortage.Weather parameters in Goa have also played foul for vendors in Goa. ""While supplying freshly-harvested tomatoes to the state, some of the stock got ruined after being hit by rains along Goa's ghats.

An Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) official told TOI that demand for French beans dips in the rainy season."" Because of that, supplies to the markets also come down. Excessive rains tend to affect some crops adversely,"" he said.Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said French bean prices have been on an upswing for about a month now.""Before Friday, French beans were sold at Rs60 per kg in the retail market. On Friday however, the price doubled, to Rs120 per kg. On Friday, the wholesale markets had no supply of French Beans, which caused the prices to rise,"" Pathan said of the situation.Tomatoes too are being sold between Rs80 and Rs100 in most retail markets.

Intense rain spells in tomato growing regions is ruining the crop, apart from making the harvested tomatoes pale in colour,"" Kolhe said. With 50% less supply of tomatoes in the market, the cost of tomatoes has continued to spiral upwards in the last few weeks. With less availability of tomatoes, the prices will continue to remain this way, stated sources from APMC.However, improved production is supposed to bring down tomato prices from mid-August and September.According to sources in the market, during last month's farmers' strike, many tillers had destroyed their standing crop as they were not sure how long the strike would go on for. Incessant rains too played spoilsport, bringing down production. However, the APMC hopes that things would improve and markets would normalize by August.Dilip Khire of Pune APMC added that incessant rains had damaged tomato crops and supply from farmers had depleted, which had caused the prices to rise over the last two months. Gadhve said that Narayangaon, which is one of the largest tomato suppliers, was seeing only 25% supply in the last two months.""There are about 70-80 villages in Narayangaon that supply tomatoes. With less production, we are only getting 200 metric tonne instead of 800 metric tonne of tomatoes during the same period last year,"" he said. He further added that the tomatoes coming from North India, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka have reduced.Meanwhile, vegetable vendor Nanasaheb Awate from NIBM Road said that since the wholesale prices of tomatoes had gone up, he can no longer afford to buy it, and so stopped stocking the vegetable at his stall.""The prices of all vegetables increased during the monsoon and tomatoes are practically impossible to get.

Traders and APMC officials at the yard and farmers in the surrounding villages agree that a combination of a dip in tomato production this season and a sudden rise in the demand for Kolar tomatoes from other states has led to rocketing prices.Kolar APMC secretary T S Ravi Kumar said tomato production in the region had gradually gone down in the past few months due to various reasons  less rain, low pricing and increased temperatures which decreases the yield. ""The supply we receive at the APMC during this season has gone down by 50% compared with last year. At this juncture, the demand for stocks has also gone up from some of the north Indian states where the production has come to a standstill due to flooding and other reasons.

(Express Photo by Jasbir Malhi)In the past two weeks, prices of tomato, have soared from Rs 50 to 60 per kg to Rs 90-100 per kg in local vegetable markets. The wholesale rate, too, have gone up from Rs 40 per kg to Rs 55-60 per kg in one week. The prices is unlikely to change for at least two more weeks till the crop is not received from key tomato growing places including Nashik in Maharashtra.Though, every year during June to September, the rates of tomato goes up due to off season, but this year, the crop arrived quite late from Nashik due to heavy rains, which also damaged it to some extent. Due to the rise in prices, homemakers have been forced to cut its daily usage. Tomato is used in the preparation of almost every vegetable and pulses, but due to sky rocketing price we are trying to use it less as possible these days, said Sangeeta Sharma, a homemaker.We have been selling tomato between Rs 55 to 60 per kg in wholesale market and retailers are selling them at Rs 90 to 100 per kg for the past few days and it will continue the same for at least for 10 more days, said a wholesaler Prem Kumar in Jalandhars Maksundan vegetable market. Like Prem, another wholesaler said, We have been receiving very less supply of tomato from key growing states like Maharashtra, Karnataka and other southern states this year. Crops have been damaged in some areas due to heavy rain, which has affected the supply.Dimpy Sachdeva, president Arhtiya Assoication of Maksudan vegetable market, said that though high rate of tomato is a seasonal phenomena but this year the rates shot up much more high as compare to the rates which generally prevail in this off season. He said that they are yet to get the crop from Nashik which got delayed by two weeks due to heavy rains there.Retailers said that they have to bear the transportation charges to ferry tomatoes from mandies to local retail markets and their margins are not very high.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

(File Photo) Senior Congress leader Digvijaya Singh. (File Photo)The Opposition and the ruling BJP on Tuesday traded blame in the Rajya Sabha over distress in the agriculture community due to which farmers have been committing suicides in large numbers. As the House took up a discussion on the agrarian crisis, the Opposition blamed the government for the problem, accusing it of being insensitive towards the farmers issues. They also sought to find faults in various policies of the government. The ruling side hit back, saying the present miserable condition of the farmers was due to the Congress partys rule of 60 years.The BJP members said it was the Modi government which had initiated a slew of programmes for the welfare of farmers over the last three years.Initiating the discussion on the farmers distress leading to rise in the incidents of thier suicide, Digvijay Singh (Cong) accused the government of being insensitive to plight of the agriculturists.He referred to the police firing on a violent agitation by farmers in Madhya Pradesh recently and said the agriculturists faced bullets on the centenary of Champaran agitation in which Mahatma Gandhi had raised his voice against British exploitation.He termed the imposition of import-export duties on foodgrains as one of the biggest scams.He said despite the bumper crop, import duty on wheat was reduced initially to 10 per cent from 25 per cent and then to zero in December, impacting farmers adversely as imported wheat was avaiable at cheaper prices.Foodgrain imports, which stood at Rs 134 crore in 2014-15, have risen to Rs 9,009 crore now, he said.Singh alleged that it was the wrong import-export policies which had led to imports of Rs 1,40,268 crore in 2015-16 as against Rs 56,000 crore in 2011-12.Quoting agriculture scientist MS Swaminathan to say that import of agricultural commodities was like outsourcing farmers skill to outside, he said there was a need for fixing import-export levies by the Commerce Ministry in consultation with Agriculture Ministry.Expressing concern over 42 per cent rise in incidents of suicide in 2014-15 in the country, Singh said agriculture has been reduced to loss-making proposition despite it contributing about 17 per cent to the GDP.He also alleged that there was corruption in Food Corporation of India (FCI) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).The Congress leader alleged that after demonetisation, it was restrictions on cattle sale that had hit the farmers.He quoted Savarkar as saying that he was against ban on cow slaughter.Taking a dig at Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Singh said that others in the Cabinet were helpless as it was PM who decided everything.He alleged that the crop insurance policy was nothing but a way to benefit industrialists.Minister of State for Agriculture Parshottam Rupala, who spoke in the capacity of a BJP member, said it was the Congress partys rule of 60 years which had resulted in the miserable condition of the farmers.There should be a discussion on the policies of previous governments and what all they did for farm sector, he said.He said the Modi government had taken a number of steps for the betterment of the farmers.Listing out the schemes, he said Rs 50,000 crore has been allocated for PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY) and 22 schemes under the project have already seen the light of the day.Under the programme, plans for irrigation at district level have been formulated, Rupala said.Ram Gopal Yadav of Samajwadi Party said the farmers have been affected because of import of agri products, which he alleged was being allowed because of ulterior motives while farmers are being deprived of remunerative prices.The prices of many agri-items have fallen below the minium support prices and, in some crops, it is not enough to meet even the transportation cost, he said.Citing the example of tomato prices that have risen sharply to about Rs 100 per kg, he said the prices are low when crops are harvested, but these rise after farmers sell their produce in the market.He said the futures market was also responsible for the farmers plight.Yadav said the agri growth has largely been below 4 per cent in last 25-30 years and that the farmers economic condition would not improve unless there is a sustainable growth in the sector.Yadav said the government has put tractors and pump sets in higher tax rate under the new GST regime and demanded that these items should be exempted from GST.Food processing in the country is in such a bad shape that every year fruits and vegetables worth Rs 50,000 crore to Rs 60,000 crore rot in the country, he said.Food processing percentage in India is barely 4 per cent as compared to 80 per cent in nations like Brazil, he added.He wanted to know under what circumstances private companies were roped in crop insurance scheme which was handled by the government companies earlier.He also wondered as to why the government could not use technology so that Indian apples could also last more unlike those imported from the US.Prasanna Acharya (BJD) sought to know from the government why farmers are committing suicide and are protesting on streets if the agriculture growth was high.He said farmers are not getting returns for their produce and are being cheated, not by Monsoon but by the government. Demonetisation has further aggravated their woes, he added.While the new crop insurance policy is better than the previous ones, it is benefitting private insurers more, he said.He said the Centre and states should take steps to fulfill three main demands of farmers  price, pension and prestige.Munquad Ali (BSP) said farmers situation is very bad in the country and that there has been a rise in farmers suicides in the last three years.Why it is happening? Why the government is not finding solution farmers problems? .I request the government not to give false promises. Please work for the welfare of farmers, he said.Praful Patel of NCP pitched for modern farm technologies like genetically modified crops to boost farm income,.It is unfortunate. I am sorry to say that we have neglected science and technology. There may be different views on BT technology but we have data how it benefits. We need to take benefit of it, he said.Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh has always focused on indigenous (technologies) but there is a need to use modern technology to improve farmers income, he said and suggested the minister to keep open mind on the issue of technology.Patel also spoke about shortcomings in the new crop insurance scheme and suggested the government to keep a watch on private insurers who are implementing it.Vijaysai Reddy (YSRCP) said the government needs to introspect why 12,000 farmers are committing suicides every year despite the government coming out with new schemes.He demanded that the loan waiver announced in some states need to be implemented in letter and spirite, claims under new crop insurance scheme should be settled in 15 days, better credit facility and creation of special agri-zones for farmers for better realisation.R S Bharathi (DMK) attacked the Prime Minister for not meeting the protesting Tamil Nadu farmers in Delhi and demanded a special session of Parliament to discuss the farmers issue and a special law to address their woes.Rajani Patil (Cong) said, I dont think the number (of farmers suicides will come down if the government does not take steps.She attacked Modi for not visiting affected farmers in Maharashtra, saying the prime minister has time to travel around the globe but no time for farmers in the state.Turning to Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, she said the farmers situation is very serious. We dont want to hear about schemes in your reply. Tell me what relief you can give to our farmers. We want full loan waiver.Prabhat Jha (BJP) rejected allegation that the government was insensitive towards farmers plight and said maximum decisions had been taken over the last three years in the interest of farmers.He listed a slew of measures underaken like raising minimum support price for agriculture produce like wheat, rice, pulses and oilseeds.He said it was due to initiatives of the government that there was a record production of foodgrains in the country in 2016-17 at 271.98 million tonne (MT) including 108.8 MT rice and 96.64 MT of wheat besides 22.14 MT of pulses and 33.60 MT of oilseeds.On police firing during farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh recently, Jha asked the opposition not to link such incidents to politics.He reminded the Congress that 24 farmers had been killed in firing in Madhya Pradesh in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was the Chief Minister and said nobody linked it to politics.D Raja of CPI said the whole country is witnessing suffering of farmers and asked the central government to consider debt waiver which has been done by various states.Farmers committing suicides should be unacceptable to us, Raja said and questioned why various commission reports on agriculture were not being implemented by the government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Prices have surged drastically. We have reduced consumption but we cannot stop buying tomatoes, said Kiran Kumar, a Nehru Nagar resident.In the old vegetable market at Ambedkar Road, the wholesalers and those selling in retail are charging Rs70-80 per kg from customers, which is affecting the daily household budget.Tomato price rise will affect the common man while those with enough purchase power can still purchase the item. We have started using tomato puree and that too in low quantity as an alternative, said Preeti Singh, a Kavi Nagar resident.Officials at the agriculture marketing department said consumers will have to wait till November for a price correction as the local produce will start arriving by then.The price rise is the result of the exhaustion of the local produce, which is not coming in due to monsoon. Supplies at the Sahibabad vegetable market are mostly from Himachal Pradesh and from Pune. This is a yearly phenomenon, said Roop Singh, senior inspector.In March, when local produce was available, the wholesale prices ranged anything between Rs 900-Rs1,000 per quintal and retail prices were Rs 15-20 per kg. At present, we have wholesale prices of tomato ranging between Rs3,000-3200 per quintal and it is sold in retail at Rs50-Rs80 per kg, he added.Retailers have also cashed in and are selling at high prices in prime localities.

(AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh) Rag pickers look for reusable materials at a garbage dump littered with polythene bags in Lucknow. (AP Photo/Rajesh Kumar Singh)The challenge of solid waste management in Indian cities is now receiving belated but welcome attention and about time too. Rising incomes and changing lifestyles are generating more waste and of a different kind, but we are yet to set up systems to deal with the build-up. Swachh Bharat Mission provides an opening, but much more needs to be done on the ground.Waste was not such a problem in India until the 1970s. In our rural areas, food discards were returned to the soil. Food leftovers were fed to animals and the cattle-shed wastes were thrown in a pit to decompose and become manure for the next planting season. This returned both NPK (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) nutrients as well as micronutrients to the soil for healthy crops.Urban food discards were also recognised as a potential resource, not a waste. In Portuguese Goa, bullock carts would move from bungalow to bungalow, collecting kitchen leftovers for on-farm composting. This was the earliest Indian version of doorstep waste collection. In big cities like Bangalore, farmers would bring their produce to town for early-morning auctions, then move to the cement-ring waste bins at street corners and empty them to take back home and produce manure. In fact, they would fight over collection rights for this fertile resource. This age-old practice kept Indian soils rich in carbon, up to 4 per cent.All this changed with the beginning of the plastic era in the 1970s. Some readers will recall how plastic bags were initially cherished as a useful item for hoarding in our homes, carefully taken out for re-use when needed. As the bags became more common, poor quality, and disposable, we began throwing them away into our kitchen waste-bins. When farmers took such mixed waste to their farms, the fields wore a non-biodegradable plastic film, preventing rain from entering the soil and keeping seeds from germinating through them  an example of negative urban-rural connectivity.Two useful resources, biodegradable waste and plastic, when mixed together, became waste and remained uncollected. Add to this the mixing of other dry waste and the debris from construction and demolition down the supply chain of waste, and this assorted mixed waste presents a major management challenge for the municipal authorities.City managers forced to deal with this growing waste began collecting and dumping the same outside the city limits. Since nearby farms and villages did not want this mixed waste either, it often ended up along the sides of roads leading out of town. These convenient ribbons of no mans land were not managed or defended by anyone. When even these filled up with ridges of waste, cities found larger areas outside to create mini hills of mixed waste.These rotting heaps of waste, denied oxygen from the air, emit methane (CH4) which is over 21 times more potent as a heat trapping gas than carbon dioxide. They generate ammonia which smells like dirty urinals and nauseating hydrogen sulphide which smells like rotten eggs. The airless heaps also produce leachate, a black liquid oozing out from the waste. Imagine a rotten tomato in a plastic bag which turns to a smelly liquid, unlike a similar rotten tomato which is left in the open air and dries to powder. This example illustrates the importance of aerating the waste heaps.Waste heaps without adequate exposure to air take 25-30 years to slowly decompose, continuously releasing methane and leachate. This leachate seeps down into the soil and contaminates open wells and after a longer time even reaches and pollutes bore wells through deep natural water channels. When waste is dumped in low-lying areas or quarry pits, the hydrostatic pressure of so much water-logging forces the leachate into water veins even faster. There is no way to treat this deep underground contamination, which makes wells and bore wells unfit for drinking and even for irrigation for decades.Households need to be made to stop mixing biodegradable waste with dry waste (paper, plastic, glass, etc) and keep hazardous domestic waste completely separate. The segregation of waste at source into wet (compostable), dry (recyclable) and sanitary (disposable diapers and sanitary napkins) categories is now compulsory for all citizens of India in the Solid Waste Management Rules 2016. However, residents typically complain that the waste is mixed again in the door-to- door collection process. While demanding high standards for door-to-door collection, we must continue with our discipline at home.In 2003, Suryapet in Andhra Pradesh was the first Indian city to process its wet waste, recycle its dry waste and leave nothing for landfilling. Vengrula in Maharashtra and Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu are the latest of over 20 urban local bodies to achieve near zero waste to landfill. The wet waste needs to be collected and processed daily, either composted at home or taken to nearby locations for decentralised composting or biogas production or taken to centralised plants. At the very least, the waste needs to be stabilised as described below. The correct way to manage fresh waste is to expose as much of it to air as soon as possible. Worldwide, the standard way of doing this is to unload the waste in windrows, not high heaps.Windrows are long low parallel heaps of waste, not more than two metres high, which are designed to achieve the best conditions for aerating the waste. Only parking-lot type management is required to guide incoming vehicles on where and how to unload their waste, moving slowly forward and leaving the waste behind in a long row. Enough space is left between rows for a lifting tractor or earthmover to drive through and turn the waste in the windrow.The outer aerated waste should form the inner core of a new windrow, and the airless centre of the old heap now on the outside. Weekly turning of the waste, repeated at least four times, ensures that all parts of the waste are fully decomposed, like leaves on a forest floor, turning dark brown and with a sweet earthy smell. The process can be speeded up by the addition of composting bio-cultures (fresh cow dung or substitutes available in the market).Fresh waste windrows heat up inside, to about 55C to 60C in three to four days. After four turnings, there is about 40 per cent weight loss as moisture content declines and also about 40 per cent volume reduction. After this, no leachate or methane or smelly gases are released, and this fully stabilised waste is called compost, rich in microbes as well as humus, both wonderful for soil vitality.This bio-stabilising of biodegradable waste makes a city fully compliant with the SWM Rules 2016. Screening makes it more farmer-friendly and helps move useful fractions offsite to ensure continued long-term use of the same site for waste processing. The recycling of existing waste management space is one of the biggest advantages of waste stabilising and frees local bodies from the constant search for new sites to pollute and new urban rural battles over locations for waste processing.Ahluwalia is chairperson, ICRIER, Delhi, and former chairperson of the high-powered expert committee on urban infrastructure and services.

As they are used in almost all dishes, rise in prices of tomato and onions always disrupts the household budget.Wholesale price of onion has gone up from Rs 6-8 per kg to Rs 15-18 per kg. As per traders, the hike is because of incessant rains in Maharashtra , from where the state and city gets maximum supply.Another major reason is GST (Goods and Services Tax). ""Most of the transport companies have not revised their systems under GST so very few trucks are plying. Lack of carriage has hit supply, and in turn, the cost,"" said Arvind, a wholesale vegetable dealer of Dubagga.""Also, because of monsoon, the transportation time has increased from three to five days, which turns onions stale. More than 30% of them are discarded because of poor quality,"" said Sheraz Sadiq, another vendor.With seasonal vegetables already selling at a relatively high price because of heavy rains in the producing states, the overall cost of raw vegetables has sky-rocketed in the city.Housewife Shruti Singh said, ""Because of vegetables getting costlier, especially onions and tomatoes , the cost of each meal has gone up. Cooking chicken is cheaper than preparing a vegetarian dinner. Worst part is that though vegetables can be replaced by meat, there is no substitute for onions.""Bank employee Ritika Sharma said she has resorted to buying vegetables from wholesale market even though she has to buy a week's quota in advance. ""Shopping from mandi costs a little less than from street vendors, so I go to Dubagga mandi and buy whatever I want all at once,"" she said.Though the cost of tomato has dropped in wholesale markets in the past few days, it continues to sell at Rs 100-120 per kg in the city.

Around 400 tonnes of onions are imported from Maharashtra this season alone and another 10 loads every week by Anakapalli traders, sources said.With the farmers in Maharashtra staging protests demanding the government for loan waiver, traders started stocking up huge quantities of onions which led to shortfall in supplies.A trader at Anakapalli S Seetharam said: ""We don't have any proper facility to store onions in huge quantity.

Dilip Khaire, chief administrator of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune told TOI that the rainy season often sees fluctuation in prices because of the problem it poses for reaping vegetables from the fields.""The recent rise in onion prices is the result of stocks rotting in the godowns they are stored in during the recent rain,"" Khaire said.

The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness.First, it was tomatoes and now it is onions, whose prices are soaring, much to the discomfort of consumers and policymakers. The current price spiral is remarkable for its suddenness. Only two months ago  that too, during peak summer  tomatoes were retailing at an all-India average of Rs 15 per kg. That rate has quadrupled since, even scaling Rs 100 briefly in some places. Even more striking is that onion, till as late as July 21, was selling below Rs 7 per kg at Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. But today it is quoting at over twice that level in the countrys biggest market for the bulb. The second point to note about the price flare-up now is that it follows a protracted period of low rates for producers. Leaving out the last 10 days or so, onions have been trading in Lasalgaon at below Rs 10/kg since February 2016. Tomato growers were similarly battling Rs 5-6/kg prices from November right through mid-June; they have hardly benefitted from present wholesale prices of Rs 40-plus.There are two reasons for prices going up. The first is the monsoon. Rainfall this time, although normal on the whole, hasnt been as good and well-distributed as in 2016. While Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and even the Marathwada and Vidarbha regions of Maharashtra are facing drought-like conditions, Gujarat and Rajasthan have borne the fury of floods. This has led to delayed plantings or even necessitated re-sowing of the kharif crop in many areas. The immediate impact is being felt in onions and tomatoes, but the effects on other crops  maize, jowar, groundnut, soyabean, cotton  cannot be ruled out. The second explanation may have to do with un-remunerative realisations, post-demonetisation, in most crops until recently. There is evidence, at least in tomatoes, of farmers cutting back on production as a result. The price of that is now being paid by consumers.Going by past record, the Centres most likely response to rising prices would be to impose restrictions on exports (not allowing shipments below a minimum price) and holding of stocks by traders/processors, alongside allowing duty-free imports or even contracting these through government agencies. We saw this in 2014, 2015 and even 2016 in respect of onions, potatoes, pulses and sugar. While being sensitive to the interests of consumers may be a good thing  and also in consonance with the Reserve Bank of Indias inflation-targeting goals  this clearly cannot be at the expense of producers. Like its predecessors, the Narendra Modi government has shown little commitment to the principles of free trade and liberalisation when it comes to agriculture. Hopefully, the promise of doubling farmers incomes by 2022 will lead it to respond differently this time round.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

While farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than Rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at Rs 100 per kg.Price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. More shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.With most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. One farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.The crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched Rs 551 per quintal in June this year compared to Rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.Neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. And, yet price plummeted like never before. Despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. With farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.Average household debt is Rs 47,000. This is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely Rs 20,000 or just Rs 1,666 per month as per Economic Survey of 2016. That the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. Shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.Having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of Rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation is now forced to sell the same at Rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.Price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. To avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation could fetch only Rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.One reason for the glut in onion had to do with the Federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat to unload their produce in Madhya Pradesh. However, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth Rs 900 crore.What is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. Having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) high and dry.All this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.Under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground? Far from taking the price distortion issue head on, the Niti Aayog instead contends that without additional income from non-farm sources, farmers will not be able to cross income of Rs 18,000 per month even after the doubling efforts.The condition demands a mix of soft and hard options to pull farmers out from the current distress. The soft options include liberalisation of contract farming, direct purchase by processors and bulk buyers, direct sale by farmers to end users etc.The hard options include shifting of the workforce to non-agricultural occupations, an inclusion of supplementary sources of income, modernisation of farming and marketing practices, reforms in land lease and better price realisation.It is clear that none of the options proposed by the Niti Aayog can rid agriculture from prevailing price distortions. If farmers are not assured of remunerative prices for their produce, their interest in farming will wane further.Allow exportsA recent World Bank supported study on Price Distortions in Indian Agriculture by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) suggests a ban on export bans on agriculture commodities to help farmers.The report draws reference to lost opportunity on account of export restrictions on wheat during 2007-2011 subsequent to the lifting of the trade ban wheat exports had touched a high of $5 billion in 2012.The question that begs an answer is whether or not exports directly benefit farmers? Exports do contribute to overall agriculture economics, but do not constitute direct benefit to farmers who are often at the mercy of the unending chain of middlemen.Since farmers income is unlikely to be doubled under the business-as-usual scenario, farmers would need direct cash incentives, in addition to input subsidies, to stay in the business of farming.Improving input efficiency (fertiliser and water) will help farmers make choice of crops to be grown. Crop advisories based on price trends of last few years, transit storage facilities at cluster level, and promotion of cooperative farming can enhance bargaining power of farmers.(Sharma writes on development issues)"

Amid reports of differences in the price at various retail outlets, the city administration came to the rescue of the locals by making onions available for `20 per kg at 37 government-run fair price shops.Assistant Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) R C Tudu said 35 quintals of onions were supplied to fair price shops on Saturday. He further pointed out that the retail price of onion at some places rose to `28 per kg on Sunday, with the wholesalers claiming the price of fresh consignment to be `2,400 per quintal. The wholesalers are selling onions for `2,600 per quintal after adding the transportation cost, Tudu added.The officer claimed that the fair price shops will sell fresh stocks at no profit-no loss basis, adding that each wholesaler has been allowed to maintain a maximum stock of 300 quintals.There are no reports of hoarding at the local level. The citys estimated consumption of onions per day is about 130 quintals, claim sources in Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department. Meanwhile, the hike in prices of vegetables has added to the woes of the consumers. The rise in onion price is an additional burden with tomato selling at `70-80 per kg, and most of the vegetables being sold at `40 and above, a housewife, Manavi Sharma, said."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 8: The state government today expressed its helplessness to contain the price of onion, which is now selling at Rs 30 a kg. ""The state produces only one-fourth of its onion requirement. Whatever onion has been produced this year in the state has been exhausted. Now, we are depending on other states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh,"" food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro told The Telegraph. The government had announced on August 2 that it would make onion available at select outlets at Rs 17 a kg and had even threatened to take action against hoarders. It had said that the sellers should not charge more than Re 1 above the purchase price. ""There has been crop failure in Madhya Pradesh, while the crop has not been harvested in Andhra Pradesh. So it is not just Odisha, the entire country is depending on Maharashra at the moment. This crisis is not specific to Odisha. The entire country is facing the problem. At some places, onion is selling at Rs 35 a kg,"" said Patro. The minisyer said the purchase price at the source point was now between Rs 26,000 and Rs 27,000 a quintal. ""After taking the transport cost into account, the selling price in Odisha comes to around Rs 30 per kg,"" he said, adding that he had asked his department officials to sell onion at the government outlets at a price not above Rs 30 a kg. The rise in onion prices following the soaring price of tomato has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at between Rs 80 and Rs 100 a kg in the retail market. ""We have no role to play in the rise in onion price. The price of onion has increased at the source points,"" said secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current high prices would continue till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and only then will the price stabilise,"" said Panda. Both farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of the lack of adequate cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to over-production."

Onion prices in the wholesale and retail markets have doubled in the last one week. The onion prices in the city are anywhere between `30 and `35 per kg on Saturday as against Rs 12 to Rs 16 in the first week of August. The rythu bazaar is selling onions for `30 per kg. Onions were sold at `12 per kilo on July 27 in rythu bazar.We get onions from Kurnool and Maharashtra. Currently, there is no supply from Kurnool district.The rain havoc in Maharashtra has badly affected onion supply, said a trader of SN Puram Vegetable Market. M Srinivas Sastry, Estate Officer of rythu bazar, said: Usually we get around 100 quintals of onions every day. Now, the supply has come down to 30 quintals a day. He added that by the end of this month, Kurnool stock will come and prices will come down.The consumers are worried that the prices will rise in next few days. Onion shops at rythu bazar experienced huge rush on Saturday. However, the rythu bazar officials are giving only three kilos per head. As the stock is less, it is our responsibility to supply to every consumer who walks in, said the estate officer.The middle class families are affected by the unexpected hike in onion prices. The exorbitant prices are forcing them to cut down the consumption of onions.Jyothi Kshatriya, a homemaker, said: No matter what the price is, we will buy onions as it is a significant ingredient in any recipe. But, the prices will certainly affect the quantity. The consumers believe that the traders are deliberately holding up the stock to create artificial scarcity, despite there was good production in Maharashtra.No stock boards at Nellore rythu bazarsNellore:Onion prices are soaring in Nellore too just as in other parts of the State. What is causing concern among the consumers is the rate at which the price is spiking. It has almost doubled in the last couple of days. If the price hovered around R20-R25 a kg a few days back, it is now hovering around R40 a kg.Onions were being sold for Rs 40 per kg at retail shops for the last two days. We have reduced the usage of onions in our day-to-day cooking. We purchased a little quantity only for specific dishes, says N Ramadevi, a resident of Ramesh Reddy Nagar. Consumers like her are pointing accusing fingers at onion traders, alleging that the latter have been hoarding onions in huge quantities to create artificial scarcity. Normally, the district imports onions from Maharashtra and Kurnool markets as local produce is not sufficient to meet the demand."
,,,,,,,5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

They have the best chingri maach. Also, the kosha mangsho at Bhosale Nagar is to die for!'During Pujo, besides festive pleasantries, we can bet that the next most important topic of discussion among Bengalis is what one can eat and where - such is their love for food! Be that as it may, the real charm, however, lies in the simple 'bhog' (an offering to Ma Durga) served during the festival.Close to lunch hours, it's common to see people partaking in the meal on sal leaf or dona plates as dada-boudis and elderly kaku-kakimas attend to them. An honest celebration of community, we couldn't think someone better than 68-year-old Moni Das to tell us more about this divine meal.We meet Moni, the head cook of Pune Kali Bari (one of the city's oldest pujas), in a makeshift mandap beside the pandal. Sporting a checked gamccha, he oversees his team that readies the day's bhog . They stir enormous steel patilas of food, as myriad aromas arise and engulf us. ""We've been cooking since 5 am,"" he tells us. While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.

Forty of the 294 passengers, travelling to the city from Karmali in Goa on Sunday, were rushed to the Life Care hospital in Chiplun after the train was stopped there. Twenty-four of them had to be admitted to the hospital. But on Monday morning, all of them were discharged and transport arranged to send them to Mumbai, said railway officials.According to senior railway officials, the committee spoke to passengers, the AC mechanic, the train conductor and ticket examiners to find out the reason for the passengers throwing up as the initial suspicion was on the food served on the train. Food on Tejas not reason for passengers taking ill: RailwaysIt emerged that two groups of tourists were travelling in the affected coach, one from Himachal Pradesh and the other from Kolkata. Two children travelling with the group from Himachal Pradesh first vomited in the coach. The smell and sight caused uneasiness among the other passengers and then two more children threw up. Then two more children vomited, triggering a vomiting spree in the compartment, railway officials said.The IRCTC has served a showcause notice to catering contractor J K Ghosh. The area officer of the IRCTC at Madgaon and the onboard manager too were placed under suspension. The inquiry on them is still under way. The caterer has been supplying food in the premium train for three months.A committee comprising the senior divisional commercial manager of the CR, additional chief medical superintendent, Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and additional general manager, IRCTC (Western zone), was formed to inquire into the episode. Feedback about the quality of food was taken from passengers, almost all of whom said the food served was satisfactory. Food samples were found to be within their expiry dates, said a statement from the railways.Of the 294 passengers onboard the Tejas Express, 230 were served breakfast consisting of omelette, cutlet, tea, coffee and juice at 9.30 am followed by tomato soup at 12.30 pm. Passengers reported not feeling well from 12.30 pm onwards.The railways statement quotes the tour manager of the group from Kolkata, Kajal Chakravarti, who said there was no problem with the food quality. As many as six passengers of the 16 from the group from Himachal Pradesh and six others from the group of 23 travelling from Kolkata fell ill on the train. Food poisoning could have been caused by food eaten days in advance or by bacterial infection, which can develop days later. This may have triggered the first two cases of vomiting. The uneasiness and smell caused the other passengers to throw up, said a member of the committee.It is true that food poisoning could be caused by bacterial growth after consumption of stale food over a period of days. The same is referred to as gestation and the poisoning may be triggered after consumption of other meals. However, as many as 40 passengers feeling nauseous due to the air-conditioning in the coach is something which should be checked, said Manish Deliwala, a general physician based out of Chembur.The Food and Drug Administration of Maharashtra said they were not sent any food samples from the meals served on the train for testing. The railways has not asked us for any inspection. As per protocol, they have their own food safety officer to test the food samples, said Maharashtra FDA Commissioner Pallavi Darade.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The States need to adopt similar legislations, he pointed out.New technologiesThe legislation would also help infuse new technologies into farming so as to reduce pre and post-harvest losses.This will help whenever there is surplus production with timely storage, mainly for perishable commodities, for a short time and their transportation to places where good price is guaranteed, he said, and pointed out how onion farmers of Nasik in Maharashtra and tomato growers of Madanapalle in Andhra Pradesh were being forced to resort to distress sale whenever there was a glut situation in the market.He said NITI Aayog, the think tank of the government, had undertaken studies on how to optimise price realisation for the farmers, and praised Madhya Pradesh for its success in the implementation of price stabilisation for the farmers with timely market intervention.Value additionReferring to the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, he said the focus of the programme was to inculcate innovative spirit among the farmers, the backbone of the country, and encourage them for value addition and take up entrepreneurship by forming into a network of small farmers for collective marketing.Immense potentialAsked to comment on the future of startups in giving a boost to the rural economy, he said under the Atal Innovation Mission, a comprehensive ecosystem was being created to convince educated youth from all parts of the country to explore immense potential of warehousing, transportation, cold storage, call centres, weather forecast, and timely supply of quality seed, pesticides, and fertilizers.We are seeking the opinion of stakeholders, after which the draft Act will be enacted.

But these days she is faced with a tough choice, whether to add onions to the food items or not. That's because the price of onions is steadily climbing the charts and has reached Rs 50/kg in the retail market, up by Rs 10 from last week. And if market insiders are to be believed, the cost could go up further.The spike in onion prices, along with the rise in the cost of vegetables are burning a hole in the pocket of the common people. Even the state government's assurance to deal with the price rise by importing onions from neighbouring states have failed to yield results.""Usually I require around 2-3 kg of onions every week to cook food for my family of five. After the price rise I am trying to manage with 1kg. I am finding it very difficult to cook non-veg food,"" said Pati, a housewife.""For the past two months onions are being sold at Rs 40 per kg and above. Last week it suddenly increased to Rs 46 and today it has gone up to Rs 50 per kg. How can a family manage with such stiff hike of essential commodities?"" asked Manisha Behera, another homemaker.On october 28, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro had said that the prices would come down within one week after the new harvest.""The new harvest will arrive in the next one week after which the situation is likely to improve. I have also requested the Maharashtra government to supply onions to us first as our consumers are facing inconvenience,"" Patro had said.On Thursday, when asked about the prevailing situation, Patro said: ""Now procurement of all agriculture products will be made through e-procurement. So once fresh procurement orders are placed the prices are likely to drop.""Traders said the main reason behind the hike in onion prices was the loss of crop due to bad weather and the cost being high in the source states. ""On Thursday wholesale price at Nasik mandi was Rs 4,200 to Rs 4,500 per quintal. After adding transportation cost, the price in Odisha will be more than Rs 5,000 per quintal,"" said Sameer Das , a wholesale trader at Unit-I market.The prices of vegetables too are moving up. Tomato has been selling at Rs 60 per kg, broad beans at Rs 80/kg, okra for Rs 60/kg, drumsticks at Rs 200/kg and green peas for Rs 100/kg. These apart most vegetable prices are hovering around the Rs 50/kg mark."

This is precisely what the worldwide tour Bhairav Se Bhairavi Tak being undertaken by renowned vocalists, Pandit Rajan and Sajan Mishra, which commenced from Varanasi recently, signifies. We were seized of the ongoing violence and terrorism world over, which only harms humanity without serving any purpose. Wondering what to do, we decided to propagate peace and brotherhood through our music, explains Rajan Mishra as we settle down for a quiet lunch at Shangri-Las Eros Hotels Tamra restaurant. Agreeing Sajan Mishra, adds, music has tremendous power to move human hearts.We ask for green tea to be followed by som tam, the Thai papaya salad. The staff suggests tomato and bocconcini sandwich to which they readily agree. As in music where we keep exploring ragas, we also experiment with food too, quips Sajan Mishra.Power of musicOne wonders as to how music can help? The entire planet and nature is enveloped in music. Our voice is sound or swara and the heart and pulse beats are layas. Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythm. We have formed rapport through music with even those who do not know our language. In Paris, the audience approached us for autographs with tears rolling down their eyes. Such is the power of melody, relates Rajan Mishra.Sajan Mishra cites the example of their concert at Maastricht, Holland, where audience did not clap. Wondering what went wrong, we were later informed by them that they did not want to disturb the harmony created by the music. That is one of the best compliments we have been paid ever.Has singing given them tranquillity? Besides name and fame, it has given a spiritual dimension to our life making us at peace. Be it riyaaz or concert, we remember Goddess Saraswati and our forefathers and seek their blessings and start. Closing our eyes we are lost and sing to our satisfaction ensuring the audience follows and they do. Recently at Delhi Universitys Shivaji College, we sang for three hours without any student leaving the hall.Driving home the point, Sajan Mishra recalls that once they rushed from a Ganesh Utsav recital at Pune to Mumbai to catch a flight to Malaga in Spain for another show. We did not sleep a wink. Reaching the venue, we splashed water and changed into fresh clothes. We were bone tired yet on the stage with tanpura and tabla as accompaniments, we felt no fatigue and gave a memorable performance.So will this whirlwind tour involve long concerts encompassing all ragas from Bhairav to Bhairavi. Sajan Mishra expounds: We are talking about the whole spectrum and bouquet of ragas and not necessarily from early morning to evening. In lots of places, there are issues concerning audience, auditorium, timings, or security and so keeping those in mind we have worked out various permutations and combinations to bring fore the flavour of ragas. In Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Delhi and Bengaluru, we are doing two concerts, morning and evening just as in Houston. In London we will start at 1 p.m. Adding Rajan Mishra says, Bhairav is an important raga which is sung at dawn just when sun rays start dissipating darkness, has mircotones of Rishabh and Dhaiwat being used. There are several types of Bhairav like Lalit, Ahir, Bairagi and Nat. Bhairavi, a ragini of Bhairav, uses many surs and shudh surs and brings down curtain on a performance. His short demo of the two have heads turning around in awe and admiration.With sandwich and salad being laid, we take a break. Tasting them, the two approve much to the delight of the staff. Bahut achha hai, remarks Rajan Mishra, who loves food and is eager to taste all things new. I like almost all regional cuisines, be it Gujarati, Rajasthani, Uttar Pradesh, Punjabi or South Indian. My favourites include dal-chawal, khichdi, khandvi, undhiyu, rohu fish, bhaat-jhol, dosa, idli, paniharam and appam. Food like music is a labour of love and brings happiness, satisfaction and peace to one making as well as eating. Sajan Mishra, prefers food from UP, Rajasthan and Punjab. They are rich in taste. These regions offer great variety like dal bati choorma, kachhi methi ki and sangria ki subzis, different parathas and dahi.When asked if he cooks, Rajan Mishra replies promptly: Mujhe toh nimbu bhi katna nahi ata. He quietly lets it slip in that Sajan Mishra is a fabulous cook reputed for his dal and chicken preparations. I never had formal training and dont depend on recipes. Having observed my mother and chachi, I started out when we had to fend on our own in Delhi many years ago. Recalling what I had observed, my first attempt yielded delicious dal and gobhi subzi. The bhindi I did not realise had to be washed before being cut. It didnt get cooked despite several helpings of ghee and oil. Our friend sarod player, Ashok Roy and his wife, dropped in. They enjoyed dal and gobhi and quietly ate the bhindi without any comment, quips Sajan Mishra.Such is his love for food that at Vlodrop, Holland, during a tour organised by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, on finding the food placid, Sajan Mishra, decided to use some tadka in the dal and vegetables. I purchased ginger, garlic, chillies and other condiments and decided to use the electric kettle. About to start, Maharishis nephew Girish dropped in unexpectedly. Getting the fragrance, he remarked, Can we also have some of this, and I said join the party. Once, Ritesh, my nephew, requested for kadhi, which I had never made before. With everything ready, I used the curd in the fridge and later the whole place was filled with a strong aroma of strawberry. Investigating I found myself staring at the red kadhi as I had used strawberry curd. Quietly, I dumped it far away. No wonder, they say, raag rasoi pagdi kabhi kabhi bandh jaye (music, food and pagdi sometimes turns to be excellent), he chuckles loudly.On a serious note, Rajan Mishra, is appalled with the burden of studies on children these days. In our time, we studied, played, indulged in pranks and also bunked to watch movies. They couldnt be serious. We had been caught and punished too. Our gurus, grandfather, Bade Ram Das Ji Mishra, father, Hanuman Prasad Mishra and uncle, Gopal Prasad Mishra insisted that sports is required to keep fit and healthy. They insisted on complete concentration, singing with heart and soul instead of treating it as a drill. That helped us to do well in studies too. While Rajan Mishra has a masters degree in sociology, Sajan Mishra graduated from Banaras Hindu University.With great masters at constant attendance, it must have been advantageous. Yes, we were helped by nature and nurture but they never favoured us. The taalim was without fear or favour. They instructed us to listen to other great masters and imbibe their qualities. So we learnt the grasp on sur from Pandit Bhimsen Joshi, while Ustad Vilayat Khan, sitar maestro taught us that the tempo of laya and taan should always synchronise, replies Rajan Mishra.New generation singersTalking about the new generation of singers, Rajan Mishra says, They are extraordinarily talented. All they need is stay away from diversions like mobile, television, internet and computer. Forgetting about updating Facebook, they need to concentrate on studies and music. Rajan Mishra loves to teach while Sajan Mishra fills in his absence. Main unko workout karata hoon, bhai sahib daud lagwate hain (I give workout while brother makes them run), he jests making Rajan Mishra smile.With the brothers declining desserts, one wonders if is a precautionary measure? No, we love khoye ki mithai, sandesh, Banarasi jalebi and sohan halwa, replies Rajan Mishra, and as for precaution, you will be surprised we eat everything. Finding me surprised, he says, Eating is closely related to psychology. The moment you think gol gappa pani will affect the throat, it will. We eat everything bindaas  chutni, aachar, papad, chaat, bhel puri, dahi bhalla, pav bhaji, sev puri, ice creams and drink chilled water. It has never affected our voice. Sajan Mishra adds, Riyaaz cleans up everything. Did you know Begum Akhtar used to eat paan and drink ice water but her voice remained golden.Nobody is beyond music as it strikes a chord with all living beings instantly. In fact, the whole cosmic energy moves in rhythmRajan Mishra"

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik. Of the 300 trucks of onions entering Bengaluru APMC, over 250 are from Nashik.Ashok Walunj, former director, onion and potato division, APMC, said supply has improved since Wednesday. Around 245 trucks of onion arrived on Thursday and Friday, pushing prices down. Were expecting a fresh stock of onions on Monday. This will bring down the rates further. Within a weeks time, rates will regularise to Rs. 15 to Rs. 20.Tomato, which usually costs between Rs. 18 to Rs. 25 per kg, was being sold at Rs. 45 per kg at the APMC on Friday. Shankar Pingle, former director, vegetables division, APMC, said. Usually, the tomato season starts by mid-October, bring prices down. This time, the tomato crop has been affected by rains in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in September. During the same time last year, tomatoes cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg.Anil Rai, who is among the top tomato dealers in the market, said, On an average, 100 trucks would come to the APMC, each bearing 10 tonnes of tomatoes. This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."

Earlier, the vegetable was being sold at a steep Rs. 35 to Rs. 50 per kg. The arrival of 76 trucks and tempos laden with tomatoes from Nashik, Pune, Satara and Karnataka on Friday helped increase the supply in the APMC and significantly lower the price. A total of 711 vehicles, including 125 trucks and 586 tempos, brought vegetables to the APMC market on Friday.However, in the retail market tomatoes continued to be sold at Rs. 60 per kg. The most expensive vegetable at the market was drumstick, which was being sold at Rs. 100 to Rs. 120 per kg. This is in sharp contrast to the usual rate of Rs. 30 to Rs. 45 in the APMC. Shankar Pingle, former director, APMC (vegetable division), said: The rates of drumsticks have been on the rise since November due to unseasonal flash showers in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. There has been a dip in supply from Gujarat and Nashik too, which meet most of the supply in December and January.Meanwhile, the prices of onions which had fallen to Rs. 25 to Rs. 30 on Monday, shot up again to Rs. 30 to Rs. 35 on Friday despite stable supply. Ashok Walunj, former director APMC (onion and potato division) said: Due to Cyclone Ockhi the rates have gone up a bit. They are expected to fall within one week.On Friday, okra was being sold at Rs. 35 as against Rs. 25 on Tuesday, carrots at Rs. 24 as against Rs. 20 on Tuesday.

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also. Due to this, the supplies are now coming in only from Maharashtra, said Padma Harsha , deputy director of department.Predictably, J Ananthaiah, selection grade secretary, agricultural market committee at Malakpet , said that the daily procurements have dropped from nearly 40,000 bags per day to 10,000-15,000 onions bags per day, thus pushing the rates northwards.The steep jump in costs has adversely impacted traders in other markets whove stopped selling onions. We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock. If the situation continues, we may be forced to keep our shops shut, said Mohammed Abid , a vegetable vendor at the Erragadda Rhythu Bazaar.Not just onions, prices of other vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrot too have registered a more than 200 per cent rise in price rise as compared to the last winter season. While one kg of tomato cost 8 in December 2016, the price has now shot to 26 per kg. The price of carrot has increased from 16 to 50 per kg.Onions and tomato are basic vegetables. With the price rise, we are now forced to purchase these vegetables in lesser quantities, said Vijayalaxmi, a housewife from Kokapet. The steep rise in cost of vegetables has driven inflation to an eight-month high of 3.93 per cent."

Govt seeks proposals in key areas,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-startups-solve-agriculture-sector-issues-govt-seeks-proposals-in-key-areas/story-cBJGTPn5hplbGQUE7ADBMI.html,2017-12-25,"Could startups solve complex issues in Indias agriculture sector, which supports 49% of the workforce? The agriculture ministry thinks so and is hunting for commercially viable proposals in 12 pre-identified areas.The Narendra Modi governments Startup India scheme, which has a Rs10,000 crore war chest managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), is seeking to incubate farm-solution startups through a contest called Agriculture Grand Challenge.I urge young entrepreneurs to participate in our newly launched Agriculture Grand Challenge and join forces to make agrarian sector technologically sound and commercially viable, farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said. The idea is to enable entrepreneurship and innovation, he said.A handful of startups for the rural economy are already a part of the growing ecosystem. India has more than 19,000 startups, led by consumer Internet and financial services apps, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.From 220 in 2014, the number of startups funded in the first 10 months of 2017 stood at 482, according to data from Tracxn.As of December 2015, eight Indian startups belonged to the so-called Unicorn category, a club of ventures valued at $1 billion or more. Yet, fewer than 10% of these cater to the farm or social sector, according to Tracxn.A government document, which Hindustan Times has reviewed, states that private-sector startups could offer viable interventions in an array of areas, notably linking farmers to markets and offering extension services. It seeks to rev up an emerging niche area thats being dubbed as farming as a service, or FAAS.Proposals are being invited for simplified, sensor-based quick testing of soil samples as well as real-time assaying and grading of food commodities in electronically linked eNAM markets. The government has linked 470 mandis electronically but many of them lack crucial infrastructure: food labs to test samples being brought to these markets. The prospective app should preferably enable sample tests under two minutes to promote online trade.The government is interested in apps to connect food processors with agripreneurs and growers, an official said. To help price discovery, the ministry is looking at price forecast apps for pulses, oilseeds, potato, onion and tomato at the time of sowing since these crop are vulnerable to price volatility.According to the document, the success of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Indias main farm insurance scheme, depends on accurate yield estimates at village and farm levels for which it wants to incubate digital technologies.Another priority area is custom hiring of farm machinery and cheaper disposal of crop residue that has become a major reason for pollution in the national capital from neighbouring states during winters.Under the programme, commercially viable ideas will be incubated at the governments expense for three months. The last date for applications is January 15, 2018.Given the high penetration of Internet-enabled mobile phones, this is a good idea that can drive down cultivation costs, said Ashok Duggal, one of the promoters of VentureIndia Labs.A crop of startups aimed at harnessing the rural economy has made inroads already. AgroStar, a Pune-based mobile-commerce firm, directly sells farm inputs to farmers in Maharashtra and has raised more than $4 million. Farmers need to give a missed call to access its services.EM3, another firm, offers farm-labour services at Rs 2,000 an acre of wheat, which it claims is half of what it normally costs during peak season.The government document said it would prefer solutions that are scalable and can reach small farmers.The average size of farm holdings is 1.15 hectares. This means nearly 85% farmers are small and marginal. India has 120 million agricultural land holdings."
