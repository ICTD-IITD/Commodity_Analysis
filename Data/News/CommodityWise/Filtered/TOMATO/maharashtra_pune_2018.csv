The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."

Experts say that at least for the next two months the markets are expected to be filled with vegetables costing fraction of their prices prevailing a few days ago. In Karnataka, vegetable growers are more in Kolar, Bengaluru Rural, Chikballapur, Chitradurga, Ramanagara, Mysuru, Mandya, Chamarajanagar, Hassan and other places. With good rain this monsoon, growers could get good yield too. The price of many vegetables has come around Rs 20 per kilo which was more than Rs 70 a few months back. While the tomato has declined to Rs 11 per kilo, pumpukin is Rs 13 per kg, raddish is Rs 18, snake gourd is Rs 18, while beetroot and potato are Rs 22 per kg, according to the Horticultural Producers Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) price list.Former additional director (Fruits), Dr S V Hittalamani, explained that this was because the state witnessed good monsoon rainfall in 2017. The lakes and rivers had filled, and groundwater had charged up.With this, farmers used borewell for water and it was an advantage for vegetable growers to grow larger quantities of vegetables. If there is more supply than demand, naturally the price declines. This is what has happened now, he said.Citing an example, Hittalamani said tomatoes grown on 6,000 hectares of land yielded around one lakh tones of tomatoes. But this year, with more farmers using their land for growing tomatoes, they have used 18,000 hectares of land and grown three lakh tones of tomatoes as compared to last year. If the quantity is thrice, one can imagine the price slash. In winter season, tomatoes normally grow. This year, growers in Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra have also grown good quantities of tomatoes. This means there is no demand for our tomatoes in these states, he said.People, vendors happyAruna, a resident of Rajarajeshwarinagar bought carrot, onion, potato, peas, beans, chilies and curry leaves, all half kg to one kg. Even after buying so much, my bill was hardly D100. I was happy to buy veggies this cheap, she said. She said just a couple of months back, she used to spend D250 for the same quantity of vegetables. The vendors too are happy. Carrot was D90 per kg just a couple of months ago, now it has dropped to D45. Similarly, potato was D80 per kg and it has fallen to D22. People do come to buy vegetables even if the price is increased, Rudresh, a vegetable vendor at Vijayanagar said. Another vendor, Mahesh at Shivajinagar, said customers are happy. We too are happy that they are buying more in quantity, he said.From less supply to tomato glutAccording to deputy director of horticulture department Chandrashekar, just a few months ago there was demand for tomatoes as there was less supply. The price of tomatoes had reached D90 per kg. It was then that farmers started growing tomoatoes thinking there would be good price in the market. Tomatoes need three months to grow. There was good rain, that added as an advantage to them. There is good supply and price has naturally come down, he said. In summer, with some virus or the other, the yield of tomatoes will come down, and the price of tomatoes will increase during that time."

The kitchen staple has finally settled to the normal average of Rs 15 to Rs 20 in retail markets.Mondays rate in Andheri (west), Borivli (east) and Vikhroli was Rs 16 to Rs 20.Vendors in Pali Market, Bandra, continued to charge Rs 30 to Rs 35 per kg. Matunga, too, was Rs 30. Gopal Gupta, a greengrocer , claimed he was unaware of the rates in Nashik , where wholesale prices are said to have crashed, but said he paid Rs 15 in Vashi for best quality tomatoes. Our customers scarcely ask prices. They only want superior quality items, he said.Wholesale trader J M Soni of Rishabh Traders said: We procure tomato directly from growing areas like Nashik, and indeed rates are Rs 4-6 per kilo. This has been a bumper crop year, because more states have begun to grow the crop. Rajasthan and UP have despatched large volumes, just like Karnataka and Maharashtra. Farmers may not be happy, but this is cyclical. Consumers are very pleased to get reasonably priced tomatoes."

I have not been able to recover the cost of cultivation due to the low prices of tomatoes, said Saini.Wholesalers at the wholesale fruit and vegetable mandi in Kota Prakash Batwani said that last year tomato prices were around Rs 25 per kg till December and around Rs 80 in July last year. However, at present, the prices are Rs 4 to Rs 8 per kg.The retail prices of tomato are around Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg, he said.Giving reasons for the low prices, he said that tomato production increases in Kota and nearby areas in winter due to which prices come down around this time every year.Production of tomatoes in Bundi, Deoli region of Tonk, Kota, Sawai Madhopur and other nearby areas goes up in January-February every year. Due to this, tomato prices drop. But the prices go up during the monsoon season when there is no production of tomatoes locally and it is brought from other states such as Maharashtra and Karnataka, said Girish Dalwani , a tomato wholesaler.According to the horticulture department, tomato is cultivated on approximately 3,500 hectares of land in Kota division."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices. Arrival is huge and thus prices have come down. We fear prices might go down further in view of the good crop expected, he said.Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato. Under Operation Green, the government wishes to re-construct the success in the dairy sector under Operation Flood. However, as prices come down, traders say exports have also taken a hit despite nil minimum export price (MEP). There is no demand from the outside markets, said Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter at Nashiks wholesale market. Till November last year, the country had recorded 17,72, 254.31 quintals of onion export.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

(Image used for representational purpose) Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. (Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Balwant, who owns around 40 acre farmland on very tough terrain, is a worried man as the prices of tomatoes have crashed. A vehicle full of tomato crates sent to Kalamna wholesale market was brought back without selling the produce, since it was fetching a very low price of Rs50 a crate, which comes to just Rs2 a kg. The recent weather has weakened the yield and reduced its shelf life, said Balwant, who, left with no option, decided to feed the tomato yield to his cattle.Balwant said it doesnt make sense to sell tomatoes at Rs2 a kg as it does not recover even the basic expenses involved like seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, transportation and commission to agents.Pandurang Tarare, another villager involved in traditional farming, said he too was very depressed when he heard that the rates of tomatoes have gone below Rs50 per crate. He plans to wait another week, otherwise he would also feed the yield to his bullocks. He said the Centre should do something as farmers are facing hardships, especially in Vidarbha region.Shriram Ghadhave, president of Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), said Maharashtra has seen a 10-15% rise in area under cultivation for tomatoes. Previously, farmers from western Maharashtra used to go for vegetable crops but in recent times farmers from Vidarbha and Marathwada too have started growing vegetables. He also attributed this growth to the good rainfall in the state last year. As against 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato cultivation, this year we have about 3 lakh hectares, he said.Lately, farmers have increased cultivation of vegetables as it ensures cash flow in the short term. This takes care of their immediate needs. However, as the number of farmers growing vegetables apart from their main stay crop has increased, it has led to an oversupply as well. Its not only tomato, rates of other vegetables like brinjal, ladyfinger and cauliflower too have gone down throughout the region, said farmers as well as farm activists.Locally grown vegetables, including tomatoes, are fetching a price within Rs2-4 a kg. In some cases, its just a couple of rupees, say market sources.Kishore Tiwari of Vasantrao Naik Shetkari Swavalamban Mission (VNSSM)  the state government agency to tackle farm crisis  said if its tomatoes in Nagpur, in Yavatmal farmers have ended up in losses in brinjal and ladyfinger.The rates of main crops like soyabean and cotton are already down. Now, there is a slump in vegetables which are grown to supplement income by farmers. There is no system of MSP for vegetables, he said.Farmers having irrigation facilities used to go for crops like wheat or gram. These days, vegetables are being preferred as well. This has led to a glut in Wardha. Farmers are not able to recover expenses in cauliflower cultivation, said Vijay Jawandhia, a former Shetkari Sanghathana activist from Wardha.Vijay Ingle from Akola, a farmer who had bagged state government award for best practices, also confirmed that in his area farmers were setting aside an acre or half for vegetables. The rates are down due to oversupply, he said.Meanwhile, Nandkishore Gaur, president of vegetable traders at Kalamna Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) yard, said rates are expected to increase in the coming months.Tomatoes are reaped for four months, so farmers have a chance to recover their losses. Normally, the crop is grown in the month of October. However, these days large number of farmers in areas like Ramtek and Tumsar Road in Nagpur district have gone for the January crop, which will continue till April. At the same time, there are arrivals from other states like bordering Madhya Pradesh and Telangana as well. The supplies will recede after April, and the rates are expected to increase then, he said."

Whatever could be salvaged after his emotional outburst, he placed in a heap and put up a sign: Take farm produce for free.That was barely a week after another farmer in Jalna, Premising Chavan, was videographed taking a hoe to a healthy cauliflower field. Days after the video of the apoplectic Chavan destroying his crop was shared widely on WhatsApp, Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray met him in Mumbai and handed over aid offered by a private organisation. Cauliflower prices were hovering around Rs 500 a quintal. Its not possible to even cover cost of cultivation and harvest and transport at such prices, Bochate told The Indian Express over the phone. Being able to afford my two boys school fees is increasingly difficult.Instances of farmers dumping their produce on roadsides, witnessed across the country in the aftermath of demonetisation, appear to have returned to Maharashtras countryside as vegetable prices plummet. Days after nearly 40,000 tribals, other farmers and farm labourers marched from Nashik to Mumbai last month, some farmers in northern Nashik dumped tomatoes on the roadside. Prices that week dipped to Rs 200 a quintal in Nashik.Shriram Gadhave, president of the Narayangaon-based Vegetable Growers Association of India, said vegetable prices will remain depressed through the coming summer owing to increased farm area under vegetables. The rains were good, and the water table has improved, so many farmers go in for vegetables expecting good prices in the summer season, he said.Until four or five years back, the pockets around Narayangaon and Nashik used to supply a large percentage of the states tomatoes, he said. But now production is coming in from all corners of the state. Whether its Aurangabad or Beed or elsewhere, local tomatoes are now available in plenty.The promise of better access to processing industries has not borne fruit for vegetable farmers  the capacity of processing industries is barely 2 to 3 per cent of the crop, according to Gadhave. Bochate, who used to drive a Bolero that he purchased with a loan, sold the vehicle two years back to focus on farming.I used to grow soybean before. After I sold the Bolero I repaid the loan and dug a borewell on my land. There was plenty of water, so I was expecting Rs 3 lakh from my tomatoes and brinjal this season, he said. Instead, he was offered Rs 25 per 20-kg crate  that wouldnt cover even the auto ride to the market and the cost of cultivation and harvest.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Thanks to a glut in the market and the steepest price drop witnessed in April in nearly a decade, tomatoes have become cheaper than even fodder. Tomato farmers claim they are getting just Rs 2 for every kg of produce, which does not even cover harvesting costs.Usually, tomato prices peak during April because of short supply due to high temperatures. However, statistics available with the Agricultural Marketing Information Network (AGMARKNET) show that the April-2018 prices are the lowest for the vegetable during this month in the past eight years. The tomato glut is evident in the Pune wholesale market as well, where 10 kg of the vegetable is available for between Rs 30 and Rs 80.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India , said this is the first time in several years that prices have hit such a low, almost 60% less than the same period last year. The water table has surged thanks to the rains last year, causing a supply surplus. The prices of many vegetables have dropped because of a glut in markets. Cattle owners in the city and nearby villages have now started taking large quantities of tomatoes and other vegetables left unsold to feed to cattle, he said.ND Ghule, assistant secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Pune, said the increase in tomato supplies led to a drop in prices. Vegetables such as tomato, eggplant and leaves of beetroot and cauliflower are in demand among them as they have become dirt cheap, he further said.The cattle farmers sometimes take 40 tonnes, or more, at a time for free to feed their cattle, added Sunil Kumbharkar, who owns a vegetable wholesale firm in Market Yard.Ramesh Jadhav, a farmer from Malegaon, says he does not know what to do with his 16-acre tomato plantation. Farmers, who are yet to harvest their tomato crops, are letting cattle loose on their fields so that at least they can be consumed by animals. For the first time in years, the per kilogram price we are getting for tomatoes has plummetted to Rs 2, which does not even meet the harvesting cost, he said. Last year, tomato prices had peaked during April, which is why farmers had sown more tomatoes this year, he said."

This is a stark reminder to policymakers that they will have to tackle persistent drought in parts of the country failing which civilisation could disappear in a couple of centuries. Farm crisis in India is real, particularly in states like Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which is going to witness yet another drought this year despite good monsoon forecast for the third consecutive year in the rest of the country.This is one side of the coin but Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak, a Karnataka cadre IAS officer, argues that all is not bad with Indian agriculture. It has come a long way and this year India is going to have a bumper crop with food grain production touching a record 275 million tonnes, while horticulture, including fruits and vegetables, will produce a record additional 300 million tonnes. Also, the country has had a record bumper harvest of 23.6 million tonnes in pulses, the only source of protein to the vast vegetarian population.But the stark reality is that farming is the livelihood for half of the 1.25 billion people of India. A farmer must get a remunerative price and adequate income. Already next generation of farmers are moving away from farming and this could have a catastrophic effect on who will feed the 125 crore people, which is not a small number. Also, if the Indian economy has to clock a double-digit growth on a sustained basis, the farm sector has to grow by at least 4% annually on a continuous basis, which has not happened so far. This is necessary to ensure poverty is eradicated.For the woes of Karnataka and Tamil Nadu farmers, Pattanayak said they should change their cropping pattern from water-guzzling crops like paddy and sugarcane and switch over to drip irrigation, which will reduce water consumption drastically. It is a crime to cultivate sugarcane in Maharashtra. Sugarcane should be cultivated in flood-prone areas of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and perhaps the Northeast as it could also be flood protected.Punjab should not be cultivating basmati rice. The practice of which has brought down the water table to a dangerous level. Israel, which has a mere 300 mm of average rainfall, did not find water shortage a major problem and its farm yield is one of the highest. India gets bountiful rainfall and perhaps one of the few countries to have monsoon as a season every year.Even in the arid zones of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the average rainfall is around 800 mm, which is more than double that of Israel. All one has to do is harness this through rainwater harvesting so that fresh water does not go unutilised into the sea. The government, therefore, is rightly giving priority to minor irrigation and desilting of all the existing tanks, besides immediately taking up 99 stalled irrigation projects. This has to be done on a war footing.What is needed now is to make agriculture smart, which has not happened so far in India despite the Green Revolution that only ensured there are no more starvation deaths. Farmers income needs to be not only doubled but at least quadrupled from the present level of Rs 20,000 annually. One way could be to provide income support as in the US instead of price support by way of Minimum Support Price (MSP). Because of high MSP for certain crops like food grains, rich farmers grow these crops to take advantage of procurement as only they have a marketable surplus.The top 10% of Indian farmers produce 60-70% of marketable surplus in food grains. The remaining 90% have only 30% of marketable surplus and hence they get very little benefit from the price support system. The resulting depression of prices for poor farmers in the market leads to distress sale of the small quantity they produce.If income support is given instead, market forces will come into play and the farmer can produce any crop that the market demands and not only those that have price support, which leads to excess production and subsequent depression of prices. This will also ensure that crop failures do not hit farmers hard.If farmers income has to rise, the dependence only on agriculture for income has to change and farmers will have to take to animal husbandry, poultry, fisheries, food processing and other agri-related rural industries and so on for augmenting income. This is because farming by its very nature is seasonal and hence there is disguised unemployment even in the best of times.As the Swaminathan Committee has pointed out, market access to poor farmers is a major problem in India. Bumper tomato crop forces a farmer to sell it at Re 1 per kg but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 20. But Re 1 does not cover even the cost of production. A farmer gets Rs 6 per coconut but in the retail market, it is not available for less than Rs 40. Who then gets the benefit? It is neither the farmer nor the consumer but the rich middlemen.So what is the way out? An Amul like cooperative model that brought about the White Revolution has to be replicated for all crops so that farmers get a remunerative price and the food products are marketed better and exported. The wastage of fruit, vegetables and other crops running into thousands of crores can be minimised. This will facilitate setting up of common cold storage for horticulture produce in areas where they are grown.Amul like cooperatives will also ensure crop insurance, better quality seeds, pesticides and other inputs, thereby minimising crop failures and loss of farm income.--(The writer is a senior journalist based in New Delhi)"

This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel. So, this is pinching us hard, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The strike later gained steam as thousands of farmers from across the state joined it.Various farmers groups from the state, which had played a crucial role in the strike last year, have decided to stay away from the nation-wide farmers strike that is scheduled to start on June 1. The strike has been called by the All India Kisan Sabha. Shivkumar Sharma, convenor of the Sabha, has asked farmers to ensure that supply of milk and fresh produce to 40 major cities are disrupted as that, he said, will force the government to accept their demands.The farmers demands include proper implementation of the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendations as well as a complete loan waiver.However, days before the strike, farmers groups from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune have declared that they will not participate in the strike. Deepak Bhise, president of the Junnar District Tomato Growers Association, said such strikes cause even more financial losses to farmers. Last year, farmers had incurred heavy losses due to the strike, which was sabotaged by some so-called leaders we do not wish to repeat our losses, he said.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavMost farmers in Maharashtra were waiting for the monsoon to begin their sowing operations, said Bhise.Hansraj Wadghule, a leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana from Nashik, said they will not participate in the strike.

We do not wish to involve farmers in this years strike, he said.During Shetkari Sampa, the seven-day strike last year, farmers had stopped supplying milk and vegetables to urban markets. However, within a day of the strike, a section of farmer leaders had tried to call it off after late-night talks with the government.

Exports to Pakistan and Bangladesh, major destinations for Indian tomatoes, were especially hit. Last year, just about Rs 34 lakh worth of tomatoes were exported to Pakistan compared to Rs 368.45 crore in 2016-17. Exports to Bangladesh last year were just Rs 4.8 crore compared to Rs 66.69 crore in 2016-17.Political tension between India and Pakistan led to the suspension of exports via land to Pakistan last year. Exports to Bangladesh were hit after it increased the import duty on agricultural products to an whopping 48 per cent. In Maharashtra, Junnar taluka and neighbouring areas in Pune district are the major growers of rabi tomato, which feeds the markets from March till August. After that, tomatoes from Niphad, Satana and other areas in Nashik district feed the market and stay till around February.Prices had skyrocketed after July last year as supply was severely hit in the face of low availability of the produce. Farmers in Junnar had stopped using fertilisers and insecticides after March due to lower realisations.

Yet vegetable prices are at the upper end of the normal spectrum as retailers cite spoilage due to summer heat.APMC's former director and wholesale trader Shankar Pingale said, ""The average number of 550 trucks arrived Saturday. The market is closed on Sunday so we will assess the impact on Monday morning. But our farmers are continuing to dispatch produce because they have cultivated a good crop, so we do not expect any shortage or price increase for Mumbaikars.""Most vegetables are selling for Rs 60-80 per kg in retail markets of Khar, Andheri, Chembur, Bhandup, Malad and Borivli.Santosh Kesarwani, a greengrocer at Ahimsa Road, Khar, said, ""The only visible increase has come in tomato which has risen to Rs 25-35 from Rs 16-20 earlier. Spoilage is rampant during summertime and this causes farmers and vendors to charge more. A 25-kg box is being quoted for Rs 800 instead of Rs 400. Also, vegetables grown within Maharashtra are cheaper than those which come from other states. Most of Mumbai's tomato supply arrives from farmlands in Karnataka and transporters are charging more to cover the distance because of the strike.""On Sunday, tomato sold for Rs 40 per kg in certain shops of Chembur and Matunga but remained an average of Rs 25 in parts of Andheri and Bhandup.Cauliflower, lady finger, cluster beans (gavar) all sold for Rs 80 per kg in Andheri East, Khar, Chembur and Bandra East. The typical variation across localities was apparent in the quality and cost of produce.Meanwhile the cost of fruit, especially watermelon has risen owing to the seasonal spike witnessed during the holy fast of Ramzan. A single fruit averaging 2.5 kg sells for Rs 65-70 at Rs 25 per kg. However, alphonso mangoes are available abundant and cheap at Rs 250-350 per dozen as the king of fruit has flooded the market. Lychees have made a grand entry at Rs 60-70 per dozen which should settle to Rs 40 as the days wear on.Milk prices are stable.

This will impact vegetable production after the next two-three months. The tomato prices may rise to Rs 80/kg in April next year, he said.Vilas Shinde, managing director at Sahyadri Farmers Producer Company Ltd, said, Vegetable plantations have already dipped in vegetable growing regions. Our sources in nurseries, which provide vegetable plants to farmers for planting, are reporting a 50% dip in their October orders.He said the area from Nashik to Marathwada , including Aurangabad and Jalna, may see a dip in vegetable plantation mainly, the effect of which might will become apparent as early as December. A 30% dip in vegetable produce is expected in the near future as vegetable planting has already begun dipping. Some effect on vegetable production in eastern Pune might also be seen, in locations like Indapur, Baramati and Solapur , Shinde added.Gadhave said places that do not have canal irrigation facilities were witnessing a dipping water table in October, a phenomenon which usually occurs in January. Farmers may, therefore, refrain from sowing vegetables, he said.He said most areas in the state recorded less rainfall this monsoon. It is due to this reason that Western Maharashtra, where a bulk of vegetables are grown, may also see a dip in production. No impact on potatoes, however, is expected as most of its production will happen before January 2019, he said.A state horticulture department official said the state government has declared a drought-like situation in 128 talukas, reporting trigger 2 conditions. A bulk of vegetables in the state is produced in regions with canal irrigation. However, the regions where this form of irrigation is not available may see an impact of the water scarcity , a situation which may worsen in January and February, he said.Another state horticulture department said the water situation is not that severe in major vegetable producing regions, such as Pune, Satara, Kolhapur , Sangli, Sangamner, Nashik, west Ahmednagar, which fall on the west side of the state, as the dams are full in the Western Ghat region."

The prices are also significantly lower than the wholesale rates prevalent during the same time last year  tomatoes were being sold for between Rs12 and Rs35 per kg in November 2017.The retail price for this kitchen staple, however, is still steady at Rs20 per kg.In July this year, the price per kg of tomato in the wholesale market was between Rs5 and Rs 14. And the rates have been going south since then. They are now less than half of what they were in October and November 2017, the data available with the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) revealed.The tomato production this year was very good, despite drought-like conditions in parts of the state. APMC officials said the prices have dropped because the tomato supply to the wholesale market has increased.Last year, the prices were high during this period. Anticipating similar prices this year, the farmers cultivated more tomatoes in 2018 as well, said Vilas Bhujbal, the president of the Shri Chhatrapati Shivaji Market Yard Traders and Agents Association. The farmers in one area grew more tomato crops without realising that their counterparts in other places too were planning on growing more tomatoes. This led to a glut in the market and the prices fell, Bhujbal added.The government should have a mechanism in place to avoid similar situations. The government should conduct studies using satellite imageries  to gauge the extent of agricultural land where a particular crop has been sown. Even the farmers can benefit from such knowledge. If too much of one particular crop has been sown in a season by some farmers, others can limit its cultivation by sowing other crops, he said.Sanjay Pawar, a farmer from Nashik, said tomato production has been bountiful in many locations this time. Apart from Nashik in Maharashtra, even places in Rajasthan and Gujarat have reported bountiful tomato crops. If production is high in Rajasthan and Gujarat as well, then there is always a possibility that tomatoes from Maharashtra will not be exported to those states as they too are experiencing a glut. Also, exports of vegetables to Pakistan have either stopped or slowed down, he said.Shriram Gadhave, the president of the Vegetables Growers Association of India, however, said that excess production of tomatoes in the current period is from regions where the water table has still not dipped considerably, despite the drought declared earlier.While tomato wholesale prices have come down, retail prices have stayed put at around Rs20 per kg. Yakub Pathan, owner of the Fresh Vegetable Market in Wakad, said, Wholesale tomato prices have come down to Rs3 to Rs6 per kg, but retailers are maintaining a status quo on the prices. Even if prices in the wholesale market increase to Rs10-Rs12 per kg, we will continue to sell tomatoes at Rs20."

Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav led one such group from Bijwasan. Narmada Bachao Andolan activist Medha Patkar, All India Kisan Sabhas Hannan Mollah and others joined the protest that was held under the united banner of All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee The march Thursday led to traffic snarls on 26km of city roads. We are saying sorry to people who have been troubled due to traffic snarls. We have distributed pamphlets among them to briefly explain the farmers distress, Yadav said.The pamphlets urged the people to join them when they march to the Parliament on Friday. Farmer groups also threatened to protest naked if stopped from reaching there.The pamphlets stated that farmers get only Rs 5 per kilo of tomato while consumers pay Rs 30. Our life is also cheap. In the last 20 years, over three lakh farmers have committed suicide, the pamphlet informed.The farmers said they demand the convening of the Parliament to pass two bills: one pertaining to one-time full loan waiver, the other for a long-term institutional measure to ensure farmers are not pushed into debt again. They also demand implementation of Swaminathan Commission recommendations that say the minimum support price should be fixed at 50% above the comprehensive cost of production.Yadav called the BJP government at the Centre the most anti-farmer government ever. The protest march is for the liberation of farmers from the spectre of suicides, from various forms of exploitation propagated by the state and from organised loot and plunder, he said.Anish Kumar from Delhi School of Social Work said there is a lack of political will to address the agrarian distress. We joined the protest to give strength to the voice of the farmers that has been raised at a crucial time ahead of next General Election. We want the policy-makers to listen to the voice, Kumar said.A group of students from Delhi University joined the protest march near Dhaula Kuan. The farmers claimed that in all marches students, artists, lawyers, doctors, etc, extended support.A musical evening mainly based on agrarian, rural and folk themes was organised at Ramlila Maidan where the farmers retired for the night.In Video: Delhi: Farmers gather in capital today to protest against centre"
