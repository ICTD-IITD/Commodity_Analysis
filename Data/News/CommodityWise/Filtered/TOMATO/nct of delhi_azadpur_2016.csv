He gets up at dawn to supervise the harvesting of his tomato crop, spread over 45 acre of lush green field. Some days are more hectic when tomatoes are loaded onto a truck bound for Azadpur mandi in Delhi or Attari border in Amritsar.The climate in Nimar is favorable for growing tomatoes- both the desi and hybrid varieties. Besides catering to the domestic market, we export tomatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Nepal by road, Mourya told HT.The hybrid variety of tomato is in great demand in Pakistan where they use it for making meat curries while the small desi variety is much sought after in Nepal, he said.Like Mourya, many farmers in Khargone and Ratlam districts export tomatoes to Pakistan. The trade takes place through export agencies in Amritsar via the Attari-Wagah border. While business was good in 2015, this year, exports have plunged as Pakistan has harvested good tomato crop due to an unusually warm winter.During the peak season in October-November, 50-60 trucks, each with a capacity of 15 tonne, pass through the border every day. Tomatoes are mainly sourced from Nashik in Maharashtra and MP, Sanjiv Puri, an Amritsar-based custom house agent, told HT over the phone.Cold climate is not suitable for tomato crop, especially in areas where there is frost and snowfall so the yield is poor in Pakistan, said Krishnapal Singh, Shivpal Mouryas younger brother. Few people know that tomato prices have crashed in the domestic market not only due to arrival of fresh crop but also because of oversupply as exports to Pakistan through the Wagah border are almost negligible this season, he said.State agriculture director ML Meena said, Areas under tomato cultivation in the state has gone up due to the growing demand in the domestic as well as overseas markets.Tomatoes grown in Khargone, Ratlam and other parts of the state are superior in quality, he said.Shortages of tomatoes in Pakistan give handsome returns to growers in MP, farmers said. We get more than double the price in Pakistan compared to the domestic prices but then the transportation costs are higher, said Anoopchand, a farmer who exported tomatoes worth Rs 1.10 crore in 2015.Exports to Bangladesh will pick up in March and we also export to Nepal where the small-sized desi varieties are in demand as they use whole tomatoes in their recipes, he said.The tomato crop, which takes three to four months to mature, is grown twice a year- in July-October period and in November-February.Hybrid versus desiTomatoes grown in Khargone, Ratlam and other parts of the state are superior in qualityFor hybrid tomato, two different varieties of tomato plants are combined to produce a variety with beneficial traits from both the parents. Some of the benefits include improved disease resistance, higher-quality fruit and bigger size. Hybrid tomatoes, which have longer shelf life, are often more expensive.In numbers70.23 lakh hectares: Tomato cultivation area in MP (2015)90 tonnes: Average tomato yield in MP (per hectare production)Rs 16 per kg: Average domestic wholesale prices in Oct-Nov 2015Rs 25 per kg: Pakistans average import price in Oct-Nov 2015"

The price rise is a temporary phenomenon and it will faze out soon. In Delhi, there is no issue as tomatoes from hilly areas have started arriving,"" Agriculture Secretary Shobhana K Pattanayak told PTI.Wholesale tomato prices have started cooling down in the national capital on improved supplies, he said, and expressed confidence that prices in other parts would also ease with the arrival of fresh crop.Tomato Merchants Association President Ashok Kaushik said: ""The supply situation in Delhi mandis has started improving with the arrival of over 350 tonnes of tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh and Haryana. The prices as a result have come down by up to Rs 20/kg in the wholesale market.""The wholesale prices of high quality tomato variety 'Sona' from Himachal Pradesh fell to Rs 40-50/kg today from Rs 40-60/kg in the last two days. Prices of tomatoes of Haryana also declined to Rs 20-30/kg today from Rs 40-50/kg in the last two days, he said.However, the fall in wholesale rates in Delhi are yet to be reflected in the unorganised retail markets, where tomato is continued to be sold by local vegetable vendors at Rs 50-80/kg depending on the quality and locality.Tomatoes were sold at Rs 58/kg at Mother Dairy's Safal outlets. Godrej's Nature Basket was selling at Rs 80/kg and e-portal Bigbasket was offering it at Rs 55/kg.The tight supply-demand situation owing to some rabi crop damage has flared up tomato prices in both wholesale and retail market in last more than 15 days across the country. Retail prices in other cities like Bengaluru are ruling as high as Rs 80-100/kg.A senior Consumer Affairs Ministry official had yesterday said that tomato prices would continue to be under pressure till arrival of fresh crop from September onwards.According to the government's initial calculations, tomato output is estimated to be higher by 4-5 per cent in 2015-16 over the last year. ""It looks like the production figures may have to be revised downward when final estimates are released in September,"" the official had said.As per the latest government estimate, the country's tomato output is pegged at 18.28 million tonnes (mt) in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) as against 16.38 mt in the previous year.Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha are the major tomato growing states."

Other traders, especially farmers, have been severely hit by the non-availability of cash in the market. Sources said sales were down by up to 50% at Azapur Mandi as there was no money to pay to farmers, transporters and labourers.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, accompanied by his West Bengal counterpart Mamata Banerjee , will now hold a public hearing at the mandi on Thursday.""Arrival (of fruits and vegetables) itself is down by half as it's impossible to store everything in cold storage. Sales are even lower as people don't have purchasing power,"" said Metharam Kriplani, president, Chamber of Azadpur Fruit and Vegetable Traders . As a result, he said, the price of fruits and vegetables were down by at least 25%.""The relaxations announced by the central government have made no impact. Transactions worth crores of rupees take place every day; so, raising the daily withdrawal limit to Rs 4,500 hardly makes any difference,"" said Kriplani.A comparison of maximum and minimum prices from the start of the month to now reveals that there is a major drop in the prices of potato, capsicum, bottle gourd, cauliflower and cabbage. Mahender Sanpal, member, APMC, said: ""These are indicative prices, dependent on arrival in the mandi on a particular day and the quality of produce. Retailers are purchasing at usually the average prices and, as farmers are so desperate to sell, those prices have come down.""In east Delhi's Patparganj, Fateh Singh has had to slash prices at his vegetable stall. ""There is a drop of Rs 10-15 in the prices of all vegetables. Cabbage, for instance, is selling for Rs 40 per kg against Rs 60 per kg earlier. Capsicum is down from Rs 100 to Rs 80 while tomato is selling for Rs 30 per kg against Rs 40. People don't have cash and, if I sell on credit, how do I make ends meet? If I were to stand in a bank line one day, who will man my stall?"" he asked.Junaid Khan, a vegetable seller on Minto Road, said he had not yet dropped prices, but a lot of his sale was done on credit. ""I know most of my customers. I am doing business in the hope that they will pay me soon,"" he said."

Suthar says he used to buy at least five kilos of each vegetable daily. Now, I cant buy more than two kilos. I dont have cashcant give change to my customers, he said.Shahzad Ali, a commission agent at the Navin Anaj Mandi in Ghaziabad, used to sell 200-300 quintals of rice daily. His current sales stand at 30-40 quintals.Traders, both retail and wholesale, in Delhi-NCR are feeling the pinch of Centres demonetisation move. Though prices of essential commodities such as wheat, rice, pulses and vegetables have remained stable so far but traders warned that they may increase if the current situation continues to prevail.Wholesalers in Delhi-NCR mandis say that the supply of grains and vegetables has also been hit because transporters have not been able to pay truck drivers. In fact, the entire supply chain which includes from the main wholesaler at the top to the loader at the mandi at the bottom, have been hit due to lack of cash inflow.Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee member Rajender Sharma said,We are taking goods from farmers mostly on credit. The vendors and middlemen are also buying from us on credit. This has ensured that the supply we get is less and the quantity being sold is lesser. We cant get a lot and also sell little, too, on credit. The situation wont improve unless the currency chaos gets stabilised, Sharma said.At Khandsa Mandi, the largest wholesale fruit and vegetables market in Gurgaon, the number of trucks bringing onion have come down from 10 to four since last week. The supply of tomato has also been hit.Inderjeet Thakran, president, Gurgaon sabzi mandi, said farmers have refused sell for lack of cash and it might lead to price rise. We dont have buyers even when the supply has reduced drastically, he said. Vegetables were piling up at Khandsa Mandi on Wednesday as retailers did not turn up. The supply has come down by half as trucks remain stranded in several parts of the country, Thakran said.Read: No old currency please, Ghaziabad man adds note to daughters wedding cardTruck operators in Delhi-NCR said nearly half of their 4.5 lakh vehicles have come to a standstill. The All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) said about two lakh trucks have not reached Delhi-NCR with supplies in last few days.In some cases, traders are managing transactions through credit and receipts since Friday but non-payment of dues is having a cascading effect. The retailers are not paying wholesalers who are further not able to pay to suppliers and farmers. And, if perishable items like fruits and vegetables are not picked up by retailers, it would cause losses to wholesalers.At Navin Anaj Mandi in Govindpuram, Ghaziabad, the inflow of supply trucks has gone down by at least 60%. We are also not accepting old notes for Mandi Shulk (2% market charge on traders sale) since November 8. Arrival has reduced to 30-40%. Some traders might be taking the old notes but the majority is accepting the other denomination, said Rajesh Yadav, secretary, Mandi Samiti.Farmers are also hit hard. A group of farmers said they are finding it difficult to arrange fertilizer even as the time is ripe to sow wheat.The shops and other markets where we go to purchase fertilizer are now demanding new notes. We have none left now. If in the next 10 days the fields are now provided fertilizer, wheat crop will be affected, said Nooran, a farmer from Piplehda village in Masuri.(Gulam Jeelani, Rashpal in Gurgaon, Peeyush Khandelwal in Ghaziabad and Ritam Halder in New Delhi)"
