Since both my parents were teachers and would often be busy with work, I would cook basic dishes like khichdi and burji for myself. My love for food turned into my passion when I moved to Delhi for my higher studies. I had to cook for myself and that is when I started to explore. I was exposed to a lot of fresh ingredients and spices as I stayed very close to Azadpur Mandi, which was one of the largest vegetable markets.I decided to pursue a career in food and in 2003, I joined the Institute of Hotel Management, Bhubaneswar. It was a completely new experience for me. A new city, new cuisine and dishes like ghugni (snack), dalma (rice), and chhena poda (sweet) were all completely different from what I was used to in Delhi.I was 18 when I entered the industry and I worked with The Oberoi, Kolkata.There again I came across a completely new and different burst of flavours and dishes like rasgullas, sandesh (sweet), jalebis, kala jamun and much more. From Kolkata, I went straight to Kerala, in 2010 for a year, where I fell in love spices like the black pepper, cinnamon, mace, etc. We got fresh fish right out of the water. We were also part of an Ayurveda camp, wherein we had to cook food according to the prescriptions given by doctors for guests who were on medication. I also learnt to make sadhya, (means a feast), karimeen polichathu and Kerala sambar.In 2011, I went to the US and worked at the Steakhouse. There I learnt the fine tuning of steaks with expensive meat products. I also got the opportunity to work for the Carnival Cruise Lines. I travelled to different parts of Mexico, South America and Europe, where I got my hands on the best tomatoes, wines and cheese. I have been with Marriot Chennai since May 2017.I am so glad to have got such wonderful opportunities to travel to different places and explore so much of food, because it has really helped me grow as a chef. I have noticed that Chennai has a mixed set of cuisines, like Udipi, Chettinad, Andhra and so on.I am yet to master South Indian cuisine, but I am quite confident about the North Indian cuisine. Butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, chole, rajma chawal and karimeen pollichathu are some of my best dishes.Meen PollichathuIngredientsCleaned fish steaks/filet: 20 pieces, 1 kg (measured after cleaning)Turmeric powder: 10 gmPepper powder: 20 gmSmall onion: 200 gmCrushed ginger: 50 gmCrushed garlic: 50 gmGreen chilli: 20 gmChilli powder: 50 gmCoriander powder:50 gmTomato: 200 gmCoconut milk powder: 20 gmSalt: 20 gmCurry leaves: 5 gmCoconut oil: 30 mlBanana leaf: 1 bigMethodMake gashes on both sides of the cleaned fish.

The current prices of tomatoes have already soared to Rs 70-80 per kg in retail markets and would remain so for at least next two months.According to wholesalers, the prices have increased due to a heavy reduction in supply of tomatoes from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Haryana after the rain.Tomato prices shooting up is a normal occurrence during the monsoon months, from June to September. This is because the stock spoils easily during the rain. Right now, we are getting our supply only from Himachal Pradesh, said Rajendra Sharma, president of Azadpur Mandi.The shelf life of tomatoes is not more than four days. Not all retailers have an access to cold storage. So, they tend to recover the losses by selling at a higher price, Sharma said.According to wholesalers, the situation will remain the same until fresh stocks arrive in the markets by August-end.On Thursday, the wholesale prices of tomatoes at the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) market at Gazipur were between Rs 30 and 40.The soaring prices of vegetables have affected the sales of vendors in local markets.Till May-June, the retail price of tomatoes was Rs 40 per kg. As soon as the pre-monsoon showers hit the city, the prices climbed to Rs 60 per kg and finally soared to Rs 80 per kg by the end of the month. Due to a spike in prices, people do not buy more than half a kilogram of tomato at a time, said Abdullah, a vendor at Malviya Nagar vegetable market.Even coriander leaves and green chilies, which came complimentary with vegetables, are now being sold with a price tag of over Rs 10-15 for 100 grams. The increase in the vegetable prices has forced many to exclude these from their shopping list.Except for onions and potatoes, prices of all vegetables have increased by Rs 5-10 in the market. I used to buy vegetables for Rs 200 twice a week, but now the same quantity of vegetables cost anything between Rs 300 and Rs 350, said Aarti Malik, a resident of Geetanjali."

The price of tomatoes in Delhi 's retail market has skyrocketed to Rs 100 per kg and there is no respite expected for at least another two weeks.A strike called by various associations of the Azadpur mandi on Friday may lead to a further spike in prices. Tomato vendors at the mandi have been sitting on protest against unauthorised occupation of their sheds for the past five days and are demanding the sacking of the agricultural produce marketing committee's secretary.""There is a massive shortage of tomatoes in the country due to heavy rain in several areas. On Monday , the Azadpur market received about 20% of its daily demand with a little less than 200 tonnes arriving from Himachal Pradesh. We don't see the situation improving in the near future,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of Azadpur vegetable traders' body.Another member of the association said about 20% of the reduced supply of the vegetable was rotten. The tomato supply start ed falling about a month back, a trader told TOI.""Tomatoes rot in the rainy weather, so the reduction in supply is nothing new.However, last year Himachal growers did not get the desired price for their produce and hence sowed less crop this time.They grew about 40% of what they grew last year. Production also fell in Bangalore. At present, Delhi is only getting tomatoes from Himachal,"" he said.Across the city , buyers started to panic as the price of tomatoes zoomed by about Rs 20-40 since the beginning of the month. Pankaj, a vegetable vendor in Vasundhara Enclave, said the price had touched Rs 100 a day earlier.""There is a massive shortage in supply and we are able to get very little stock of average quality right now. Sales are down,"" he said.Meanwhile, Azadpur mandi has been witnessing a protest by tomato vendors since the middle of last week. ""Some people have come and occupied a few of the sheds and APMC is doing nothing about it. We are still selling tomato stock that is coming in but on Friday , if we go through with the protest, there will be no sale of tomato,"" said Malhotra.""Other associations have also promised to join in. The APMC has no committee members because between the government and the lieutenant governor, they have not managed to notify the members even eight months after the election. We are demanding that the secretary be sacked,"" he added."

The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."

Traders have warned of a further increase in price if their protests continue.Two sections of growers, each accusing the other of having occupied the sheds illegally, have been sitting on dharnas at the wholesale market for a week. The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) had issued a notice to one section on July 20, saying ""it has come to our notice that the following firms have illegally put up their boards at some tomato sheds even as they have no permission from APMC Azadpur, nor has there been any change made by the Tomato Traders Association"". The notice gives them three days after its receipt to remove their boards.""If APMC has issued them notices for illegal occupation , why is the government bent upon reallocation of sheds. We stand by our decision to go on a strike from Monday because we believe that vested interests have prevailed upon the government to take this decision,"" said Metharam Kriplani , a trader.The notice issued by the government, after meetings with both sets of traders on Tuesday, says that fresh allotments of tomato sheds will be made on the basis of the market fee received from individual commission agents in the past three financial years  2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. ""This will be done on the pattern of allotment made for potato and onion trade,"" said a senior government official."

He said with the Income Tax Department warning against cash transactions of over Rs. 2 lakh, saying that the receiver of the amount would have to cough up an equal amount as penalty, wholesalers had been buying less from farmers.GST impactThis is the way business has been happening for years. Transporters charge us certain fee and then show smaller amounts on bills. Similarly, wholesalers make up this amount in some other area. Thats how we make profits. With GST, the law has gotten stricter and people are buying less, he said.He also said that the number of transporters had reduced as they now had to carry an e-way permit for carrying goods above Rs. 50,000.Rajini Kumar, a resident of south Delhis Vasant Kunj, said getting tomatoes from her local market had become a difficult task.The two times that I went to my local vegetable market around 8 p.m. to buy tomatoes, I got only rotten ones.

Seems like tomatoes have become the new onions, Ms. Kumar said.Quality affectedRetailers complained that the high demand had also affected the quality of tomatoes reaching the local markets.Most of the tomatoes we get from the mandi are rotten, because of which we have been incurring losses, said Kamal Kumar, a vendor in Dwarka.(With inputs from Akriti Arora and Vasundhara Dudeja)"

As far as Monday's strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption.The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. ""If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong. In that case, why is there a reallocation of sheds?"" asked a trader.The strike, if it is as severe as traders claim it would be, may impact availability of fruits and vegetables and their price. The city is already witnessing a sharp rise in prices of tomatoes and onions due to reduced supply during the monsoon."

Complaining of corruption in the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC, Azadpur) and encroachment of some sheds by new traders, a group of old-timers sat in protest under a tent. Tomato trader Puran Chand, 59, said, Ive been in this business for 30 years. On June 20, my area was illegally occupied by another firm Im suffering major losses. Another tomato trader, 50-year-old Tilak Raj, recounted a similar tale: I have barely bought two boxes of tomatoes since June 20 Ive told the labourers to find a job elsewhere because I have no work to give.While some of the traders organised a dharna on July 19  with a few sitting on a two-day hunger strike  many closed their sheds on Monday in protest. Stating that closing the mandi meant incurring a loss of Rs 30-40 crore daily, Anil Malhotra, general secretary of Azadpur Vegetable Traders Body, said, We demand that the sheds be given back to those who won the bid We also demand insurance for wage labourers and a proper security system, as well maintaining cleanliness in the area.He added, Initially, they (the committee) would accept cheques for market fee payments. Now we can only pay online Every trader is not well-versed with this; how can they force us? Sources in the Delhi government, meanwhile, maintained that the vegetable mandi was in fact open, while the fruit mandi was partially shut. A source said, This was a politically motivated non-strike the Delhi government will not bow down to blackmail.Reacting to accusations by the traders, Satnam Singh, secretary, APMC (Azadpur), said, The issue is of allotment This faction did not let the new allotment of sheds happen in 2016. They dont want reform, which is why theyre also against online payment of market fee. The country is moving towards digitisation but they dont want to. He added, As far as cleanliness is concerned, this is a 24X7 mandi and we do our best. The corruption charges are also baseless.While the traders have called off the strike as a meeting is scheduled with the APMC on Tuesday, they added, If our demands arent met, well shut down all four mandis of Delhi, go on a hunger strike and block Adarsh Nagar Metro station.For all the latest Delhi News, download Indian Express App"

The issue of deteriorating law and order situation in the area was also brought up.Personal reasonsThe section of traders opposed to Mr. Malhotra accused him of calling the strike as he wanted to be the one in-charge of allotting Parhs and wanted to control the entire tomato trade for his Tomato Traders Association (TTA).The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) has a criteria that those who run businesses worth over Rs. 5 lakh or more be allotted a Parh. The TTA does not want to meet this criteria and wants the allotment power with them, said Devendra Thakur.Mr. Malhotra refuted the charges and said that he stood for the interest of all businessmen, and threatened to intensify the stir in the coming days.The Deputy Secretary of the market, S.
