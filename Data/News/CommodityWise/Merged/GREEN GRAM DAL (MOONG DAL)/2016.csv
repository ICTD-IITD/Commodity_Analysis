A departmental promotion committee (DPC), headed by Haryana chief secretary D S Dhesi, took the decision on Thursday.The 50-year-old bureaucrat had grabbed headlines after he cancelled a controversial land deal involving Congress president Sonia Gandhi's son-in-law Robert Vadra's firm and real estate giant DLF in 2012. Khemka reacted with a tweet, ""Awaiting posting on promotion to the rank of principal secretary.""Then Bhupinder Singh Hooda-led Congress government had chargesheeted Khemka for ""wrongly"" cancelling the mutation of land deal. With the change of guard, the BJP government on November 4, 2015, had dropped the chargesheet paving the way for his promotion.Khemka had cancelled the mutation of Vadra's land deal on grounds that the assistant consolidation officer, who had sanctioned the change of title in the revenue record in favour of DLF, was not competent to do so.Not only that, Khemka had also directed the deputy commissioners of Palwal, Faridabad, Mewat and Gurgaon to probe whether the stamp duty was paid in the land deals of Vadra executed after 2005. Then Hooda government had accused Khemka of ""administrative misconduct for overstepping jurisdiction"" in passing orders to cancel the mutation of 3.5 acres of land in Gurgaon's Shikohpur village.Friday's order has introduced a condition in Khemka's promotion order. ""The promotion of Ashok Khemka shall be subject to the final assessment of his performance appraisal report for 2012-13 (Oct 15, 2012, to March 31, 2013) as per the provisions of Rule 9 of All India Services (PAR) Rules, after the submission of report by state vigilance bureau in inquiry number 9 of September 5, 2013,"" the chief secretary said in the order.The vigilance bureau in 2013 had initiated a probe in the alleged irregularities in the purchase of 10,000 quintals 'moong' (green gram) during Khemka's tenure in the Haryana Seed Development Corporation (HSDC). Khemka had termed the allegations baseless, adding that they had saved Rs 30 lakh by purchasing the pulse at the rate of Rs 8,100 per quintal in comparison to previous rate of Rs 8,400. Even after more than two years of the probe being launched, the report is still pending.At present, Khemka is looking after the state archaeology and museums department. Khemka has faced 46 transfers in 22 years of his service despite the fact that he received outstanding rankings in most of his ACRs (annual confidential reports), apart from four appreciation letters from the governments of the day."

Patil committee appointed by the High Court of Karnataka to look into malnourishment of children and pregnant women, the State government had introduced the practice of supplying mixture of locally available tur dal, green gram, groundnut, jaggery, rice, wheat, Bengal gram and sugar.This not only helped improve the health of malnourished children admitted in the anganwadis but also of pregnant women.However, she said, the State government changed the nutrient food supplied to anganwadis by introducing a mixture of ragi, soya and wheat payasa, rice kheer, navadanya kheer, multigrain chapatti flour, and others.Although these mixtures were highly nutrient, people of the region, particularly children and pregnant women, were not used to eating ragi and soya-mixed nutrient food.Children in the anganwadis rejected the ragi and soya-mixed nutrient food. Pregnant women too did not use these nutrients supplied to them in their houses.She said that the intake in anganwadis also came down sharply after the new nutrients were supplied to children.Ms. Patil demanded that the government revert to the old nutrients consisting of tur dal, green gram, groundnut, jaggery, rice, wheat, Bengal gram and sugar. She also demanded that the government not use the services of anganwadi workers for any work other than maintenance of children in the anganwadis."

Jayachandrans voice is undeniable. That is why we would never get tired of listening to songs like Rajeevanayane neeyurangoo ( Chandrakantham ), Swarnagopura narthakeeshilpam ( Divyadarshanam ), Suprabhatham ( Pani Theeratha Veedu ) and Onnini Sruthi thazhthiJayachandran could make his voice heard, and loved, at a time when a phenomenon called Yesudas was the first choice for most melodies that required a male voice. That was no small feat.Jayachandran made the best of the opportunities that came his way and made hundreds of songs immortal in his unique style and voice. He was able to make an impression on the listener right from his early days.One of those listeners, S. Manoharan, fell in love with his voice when he heard the song Manjalayil mungithorthi ( Kalithozhan )Jayachandrans first releasewhile he was at the Physics laboratory of the University College (Thiruvananthapuram).I was studying for B.Sc. then; and I was hooked immediately to this new voice, he says. I became a fan of Jayachandran, right away.That was in 1967. Decades later, his admiration paved the way for a biography on Jayachandran, P. Jayachandran: Malayalathinte Madhuchandrika . The book, published by Mathrubhumi Books (Kozhikode), may not be a definitive biography, but it offers some insights into the life of a remarkably gifted man.There are quite a few fascinating anecdotes too, such as the one involving composer G. Devarajan. The book also examines closely some of the finest songs of Jayachandran."

But, the wild animals such as wild bears, boars, simians and peacocks are playing havoc with the lives of the farmers.Following the prevailing drought conditions, the wild animals have started intruding into human habitations in search of food and water. The food-starved wild animals entering into fields were destroying the ID crops such as maize, jowar, ground nut, green gram, Bengal gram and vegetables, etc.The farmers were taking all measures to protect the crops by tying sarees, plastic sheets, used water bottles etc to scare the wild animals and also sprinkling of pesticides around the fields, but in vain. Farmers have also erected manch and guarding their fields round-the-clock and making sounds by using drum and utensils to scare the wild animals.Anjanna from Manakondur mandal, who cultivated maize in two acres of land, said that the monkeys and wild bears were destroying his crop in spite of taking all preventive measure to scare the animals. Already, we are worried lot with non-availability of water and protection of the crops. The wild animal menace had become a nightmarish experience for us, he added.A farmer Venkat Reddy from Mujampalli village of Manakondur mandal literally wailed when asked about his groundnut crop.He had taken two acres of land on lease and cultivated groundnut. But, a horde of monkeys attacked his fields and destroyed the crop in search of food. We are informing the authorities to protect the crops from wild animals, but in vain, he complained.The man-animal conflict, which started with the advent of granite quarry operations, had aggravated during this drought conditions, said a forest range officer.We had constructed the percolation tanks and water storage points in the forests for the benefit of wild animals. But, there were no inflows due to drought and the forests have also withered forcing the animals to stray into human habitations in search of food and water, he stated.He said that they were planning to prepare an action plan to ensure that the water was made available to the wild animals in the jungles during the summer season."

However, taking into account the ailing elephants and those that refuse to board the trucks, officials expect only 33 jumbos to turn up. The pachyderms might start arriving at the five-acre camp site from Wednesday afternoon onwards.The Forest Department has elephant camps at Kozhikamudhi and Chinnar in Top Slip in Anamalai Tiger Reserve (ATR) and Mudumalai Tiger Reserve (MTR) in the Nilgiris, besides two elephants at a satellite camp at Chadivayal on the foothills of Siruvani in Coimbatore.

The camp will go on from January 7 to February 23. The regular schedule for the elephants would include a morning, shower in the Bhavani river, pujas and a healthy and nutritious diet as prescribed by the veterinarians.The diet would include coconut, banyan and palm leaves besides sugarcane, rice, ragi, horse gram and green gram besides chayvanprash, ashtachoornam, vitamin and mineral mixtures. The quantity of diet will be prescribed on the basis of gender, height, weight and age of each pachyderm. The progress card on the health of each elephant will be updated during the camp period, officials said.Officials have almost completed work relating to putting up sheds for housing kitchen for the jumbos and mahouts and cavadis, resting sheds for elephant handlers, sheds for storing veterinary medicines and mahouts and cavadis. From this year, the elephants will get an extra shower.The entire five-acre has been fortified with solar fencing and the fence along the road has been covered with metal sheets.This is to prevent wild elephants from entering the camp site, which is close to the Western Ghats.While private security personnel have been hired to maintain vigil, forest personnel will patrol the camp site boundary."

Meena, Additional Commissioner, Ministry of Agriculture; Sumit Goyal, Assistant Director, Ministry of Power, and V.C. Behra, Director, Ministry of Rural Development, inspected and ascertained the extent of damage caused in parts of Tuticorin district following heavy rains and floods in November.The team inspected agricultural fields in Ettayapuram taluk and flood-hit residential areas in Tuticorin city. Baskar, a farmer of Ettayapuram, said that he could hardly realise a harvest of one quintal of green gram this year, against the normal yield of six quintals. Collector M. Ravikumar asked the farmer whether the crop was insured and said insurance benefits to the tune of Rs. 36 crore had been given to farmers this year. Assistant Director of AgricultureS. Mathiazhagan, said that the crop duration of pulses was 70 to 75 days and it required a rainfall of 300 to 350 mm. But it rained beyond the limit.When the team visited Kurinji Nagar in Tuticorin, where stagnant water is being drained into Buckle canal, the Collector said that a comprehensive plan was being worked out to avoid stagnation of rainwater.Jothilingam, a resident of Rahmath Nagar, said that water stagnation had been causing difficulties for the last 46 days and residents, on their own, had dropped 3,000 sandbags in the pool to mitigate the problem.Selvaraj of Adiparaskathi Nagar complained that flooding of the area was caused by blocking of two drains.K. Krishnasamy, Puthiya Tamilagam president and Ottapidaram MLA, said that water stagnation was still prevalent in some more areas of Tuticorin, and wanted the team to inspect those areas as well.Residents Anthoniyarpuram sought immediate relaying of damaged roads in the area. They also observed a fast in support of this demand.Earlier, a meeting was convened at the Collectorate to apprise the team of the extent of damage caused in 10 panchayats and Tuticorin Corporation. The Collector informed the team that an estimated Rs.110.35 crore was required for temporary restoration and Rs.627.39 crore for permanent restoration.Director of Municipal Administration G.

59280dc67be9e0137c77a5e1,Govt forced to return pulses seized during raids,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/521837/govt-forced-return-pulses-seized.html,2016-01-07,"Govt forced to return pulses seized during raidsP M Raghunandan, January 8, 2016, Bengaluru, DHNS 0:00 ISTRaids conducted before rules changed; HC ordered release of seized stockThe Food and Civil Supplies Department had recently cracked down on hoarders in a big way with an intention to contain skyrocketing prices of pulses. But it has now surfaced that the entire exercise backfired as the department had failed to do a proper homework.The department recently returned major portion of the stock of pulses, especially tur and tur dal, seized from mill owners and traders during September, October and November of last year on charges of stocking without licences. Of the total 2,55,458 quintals of seized pulses, 1,79,492 quintals were released back to the traders and the millers, according to documents accessed by this paper.Reason: The department had conducted raids even before notifying the amendments brought to the Karnataka Essential Commodities Licensing Order, 1986, stipulating quantity of pulses the retail and the wholesale traders can stock. Interestingly, the notification was issued 39 days after the Government Order  the GO was issued on September 28, 2015 and the gazette notification was issued on November 6, 2015. A majority of the 1,351 raids conducted across the State was before the gazette notification.As a result, the Karnataka High Court termed the raids conducted by the department (before the notification) as not valid and ordered that the commodity be returned to the aggrieved traders and millers, who had challenged the departments action. The department was finally able to auction only about 3,760 quintals (pulses seized after the notification was issued).The department raided dal mills, godowns and shops owned by the wholesale and retail traders and super markets across 30 districts following criticism from various quarters that the government was doing nothing to prevent price rise. Prices of pulses were shooting up alarmingly and hoarding was one of the reasons for it. For instance, price of tur dal, which is widely used in the State, had touched Rs 200 per kg.Besides tur and tur dal, the department had seized urad, urad dal, gram, gram dal, moong, moong dal, avare, peas and horse gram. Of the 2,55,458 quintals, about 1,11,530 quintals were seized in Kalaburagi district alone. Kalaburagi is described as the tur bowl of Karnataka. The Food and Civil Supplies Minister Dinesh Gundu Rao had announced that the seized commodity worth over Rs 200 crore will be auctioned in public.Sources in the government said, the department later realised that it has to amend the licensing order in order to book cases against the hoarders. And hence it issued the GO on September 28, stipulating the quantity of pulse traders and millers can stock. But delay in issuing gazette notification by the government proved very costly for the department, the sources said.When contacted, Food and Civil Supplies department Additional Director (incharge) Sujatha D Hosmani said the department has released a portion of stock as per the court order. The rest was auctioned, she added.What is more interesting is that the department has hardly conducted any raid against hoarding after the fiasco last year. The price of tur dal of good quality is still hovering around Rs 180 per kg."

Forest personnel burst crackers to chase the wild elephant out of the camp site.The bursting of crackers continued for more than half-an-hour. With the wild elephants entry on day-one, officials plan to step up vigil along the camp site especially from dusk to dawn.Half-an-hour later, a galaxy of Ministers and officials inaugurated the camp.Ministers R.

It will tone up their physiological conditions and revive their liver, and functioning of other organs, said forest officials.A team of veterinarians  seven every week  will help in cleaning up their feet with medicated water and administering medicines. The camp site has a medical centre for taking care of the health of the animal handlers too.Star attractionElephants that play mouth organ and keep dancing all the time proved to be star attractions for visitors.The juniors  Sundaravalli Thayar from Azhagarkoil, Deivanai from Thirupparankundram, both aged eight, Lakshmi from Erattai Thirupathi in Srivaikundam, and Abhirami from Thirukkadaiyur  attracted a lot of visitors.The camp site is equipped with 16 CCTV cameras, four watchtowers, solar fencing for 5 km, 20 forest personnel and private security guards.Officials have provided showers along the banks of river Bhavani to enable the elephants enjoy their bath.The schedule includes a morning walk for 4 km, a shower, and then puja followed by breakfast and complete rest.It was for mahouts to either take the animals again for an evening walk or to split the 4-km walk between morning and evening.At the elephant camp at Chadivayal on the foothills of the Nilgiris, Pari (36) and Sujay (47) took part in the camp along with eight-year-old Masini, who was brought from Mudumalai and is now on training and acclimatisation of the climate in the plains as she had been assigned to the Samayapuram Mariamman temple in Tiruchirapalli.Camps for tamed elephantsSpecial CorrespondentSix female elephants, two makhna elephants (male without tusker), 16 male elephants took part in the elephant rejuvenation camp at Theppakadu in Mudumalai Tiger Reserve.

Though the latest letter to schools is not the first time CBSE has raised this issue, the urgency and seriousness is prodded by a central government report slamming the ""easy availability"" of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (HFSS) in school canteens. The report, prepared by a working group constituted by ministry of women and child development (MCD), has suggested a complete ban on HFSS not only inside campus but also within a 200 meter periphery (during school hours).Stepping up pressure on schools, CBSE secretary Joseph Emmanuel on Thursday wrote that ""it is expected that all schools affiliated to CBSE will take the necessary measures"". While the board has not mentioned what penal action it will take against erring schools, the letter's tone clearly suggests that it means business. Schools have been asked to constitute a School Canteen Management Committee (SCMC), which will take charge of menu preparation. Emmanuel wrote that the SCMC should have ""about 7-10 members including teachers, parents, students and school canteen operators. The committee will coordinate, implement and monitor the guidelines to make safe food available to students in the school"".The MCD report said child obesity is one of the biggest concerns in India and suggested that ""incorporation of healthy snacks needs to be right at the top of the agenda and intensive intervention should be undertaken by the government along with active involvement of parents, teachers and community as a whole"".Well-known city-based paediatrician Dr Rajiv Mohta agrees, saying, ""Healthy eating is a lifestyle and that has to be practised by parents, which eventually children will follow. Once in school, the availability of food items can be controlled and snacks like poha, upma etc should be made available. Even when serving idli, sambar dal must be compulsorily mixed so that it's a perfect combination of carbs and proteins."" Even the MCD report suggests that the above mentioned items along with cutlet, stuffed paratha, dalia, pulao etc can be introduced as healthy options on the menu.Schools too welcomed CBSE's push in this regard and accepted that they have a key role to play. Sumathi Venugopalan, principal of Centre Point School (Wardhaman Nagar), said, ""It is possible to implement this change in schools because if we don't provide unhealthy snacks students will not buy it. There are a variety of options available in Indian cuisine, so it shouldn't be difficult to substitute unhealthy options with healthier ones.""Akhilesh Chaturvedi, principal of Delhi Public School, said, ""This option is feasible and we are trying to implement this in our school by banning such items from our canteen. We do not promote the consumption of unhealthy snacks but if students bring those items from home, we can't possibly check lunch boxes of all students.""IS Tuli, director of Edify School, said, ""It is practically not possible to ban all unhealthy options, but we can control them. Heeding the advice of CBSE, we have hired a caterer and by doing this we give our students homemade snacks, which are more beneficial for their health.""Shashikala Naidu, principal of Jain Heritage school, said, ""It is an extremely positive step taken by CBSE because children today practically live on junk food. We confiscate any junk the students carry, so that at least for the majority of their day they stay away from unhealthy choices.""Ensuring that snacks prepared in canteen are not only healthy but appealing is key according to Bharti Bijwe, principal of Sandipani School.

But his height is not the only reason people gawk. His muscular body with a fine symmetry , gained from countless hours at the gym, does arouse curiosity .After the 28-year-old won the first position in Super Tall category at the contest held by Amateur Bodybuilders' Association of Maharashtra in Chiplun on January 2, Mukadam has become a mini-celebrity, the local Arnold Schwarzenegger, in the herostarved Mumbra.In November last year, Mukadam topped the list of awardees at Mumbai Suburban District Amateur Body Building Championship. Having bagged the two titles, Mukadam is eyeing the coveted ""Mr India"" crown at the national championship to be held by Indian Fitness and Body Builders' Federation at Mangalore next month.Mukadam also follows an awe-inspiring food regimen in the run up to the contest which will pit him against similarly zealous fellows from across the country . Look at what he eats daily these days: 10 eggs, a glass of protein shake, six idlis and 250 gm chicken for breakfast; at noon he chews 100 gm dry fruits followed by lunch, which comprises a bowl of green salad, half a kg of chicken and 100 gm boiled moong; between 4 to 5 pm he has four oranges and six apples; at around 7pm he drinks a glass of fresh coconut water; dinner is seven eggs, half a kg chicken, followed by six apples and four oranges. ""My food costs me around Rs 1200 daily ,"" laughs Mukadam, currently a trainer at a Mumbra gym.In Mumbra, a Muslim-dominated ghetto where workouts and bodybuilding aren't among popular youth passions, Mukadam has motivated many drug addicts to kick the habit with exercise. ""Many former druggies have now gained weight and look healt hy ,"" says Mukadam who lost his father at 12 and was a college dropout.Today , many rickshaws in Mumbra display his postersized photographs while egg sellers and milkmen advertise their merchandise using this muscular man as their ""mascot.""Mukadam says he got inspired to workout after he saw a Salman Khan film. He plans to marry after the national championship is over.""For a bodybuilder, his body is his identity, and Mukadam has painstakingly built that identity ,"" says Mukadam's coach Kiran Sanas who first saw him four years ago and advised him to ""work"" on his body which could gain him name and fame. ""He was a bit reluctant initially , but now he takes his body seriously ,"" adds Sanas.Vijay Katdare, district secretary of Haushi Sharir Seva Sanstha, which holds the annual body-amateur building championship in Mumbai, acknowledges that Mukadam's poses during the contests are ""excellent"". ""His posing style is what gives him an edge over many other body builders"" says Katdare.Mercifully, this bodybuilder from Mumbra doesn't pose any danger to anyone."

The women took up black gram cultivation on a trial basis on four cents of land and found it successful. The harvest was made after one and half months of sowing. Encouraged by the short harvesting period and good returns, they have raised a second crop and are awaiting harvest.Black gram is generally cultivated in States such as Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. The higher market value of the crop could be reason enough to expand the area under black gram cultivation, according to farm experts."

Shaiek Abdullah, Assistant Director (AD), Seed Certification, told The Hindu after an inspection of a seed farm at Nambiyan Valasai near here on Monday.With the supply of certified seeds and technical support to the farmers, we could increase the production by 15 to 20 per cent in the coming season, he said adding presently the yield was 300 to 400 kg of pulses per hectare and this could go up to 500 to 600 kg with quality seeds.We will ultimately achieve the target of 800 kg per hectare, he said.While encouraging farmers to set up seed farms, the department provided production subsidy of Rs. 15 per kg and certified seed distribution at Rs. 25 per kg under National Agriculture Development Programme and National Food Security Mission (Pulses) respectively, he said.Mr. Abdullah said that the department proposed to procure about 17 tonnes of seeds from the seed farms to be supplied as certified seeds to the farmers.More farmers could take up cultivation of short-duration crops, he said adding they were also drought and disease resistant.As pulses had nitrogen fixing quality in the roots, the cultivation helped to improve soil fertility, B.

The nature of celebrations across the country may differ, but the festival is a way to pay homage to the Sun and pray for a good harvest.Lohri, celebrated by the Punjabis, is the first to come. Friends, family, neighbours and acquaintances meet and greet each other around a bonfire. It also marks the end of winter and the beginning of a new harvest season.The sesame-based gajak, sarson ka saag and makke ki roti are some of the special items made on this day.Hanika Paryani, a model and resident of the city, says, ""Lohri is mainly associated with people getting together, greeting each other, exchanging sweets and gifts. People offer their prayers to the Sun and sing songs as they move around the bonfire.""As a kid, Ritika Handa used to visit houses to collect rewri, jaggery, peanuts, popcorn and other goodies.

After the first survey, it declared that anewari of the district was around 70 paise as crop condition was satisfactory. The second survey brought the anewari down to 50 paise in eight out of the 16 tehsils. After the third survey, administration declared the anewari between 45 to 48 paise. (The anewari survey is conducted to ascertain drought or crop failure in a region. Under this parameter, loss of more than 50% is considered as crisis.) This report was made public on December 31. However, by then the state had already issued the government resolution (GR) extending financial assistance to drought-hit farmers leading to exclusion of several villages from the list of beneficiaries.As the GR has included affected crops like soyabean, sugar cane, banana, moong, udad etc and excluded cotton, only 1.67 lakh out of total 4.17 lakh farmers from the district are likely to be benefited from the relief package.Commenting on the situation, former zilla parishad chairman Devanand Pawar alleged that the ruling party leaders, including ministers, are interested only in allotting works under various government schemes to their cronies. ""One of the most lucrative businesses nowadays is bagging orders under the Jalyukt Shivar programme where contractors close to the ruling party leaders are preferred,"" Pawar claimed. He demanded probe into the alleged irregularities in implementation of the programme.Former social justice minister and Congress leader Shivajirao Moghe criticized the state's anti-farmer policies and claimed that the government has done nothing with regard to the interstate lower Penganga irrigation project. Moghe blamed the guarding minister for the exclusion of 2,038 villages in the district from the list of drought-hit villages. Moghe, however, declined comments over his party's silence towards the plight of farmers."

Turmeric leaves are tied around the pot and it is said the direction in which the cooked Pongal oozes out of the pot symbolises prosperity.

Meeting elders to receive blessings, going out with cousins and friends, eating sugarcane besides the festival environment are things we long for. Drawing Kolam, decorating the house with mango leaves, preparing Pongal, worshipping Sun God along with our friends who are our extended relatives are some of the things we do.My secret Pongal recipe has equal amount of rice, moong dal, jaggery and ghee along with pieces of cardamom, raisins, clove and edible camphor.""Dr N Ganesh, Jawaharlal Nehru Cancer Hospital""My father came to Bhopal first in 1959 from Mandaikadu in Kanya Kumari district of Tamil Nadu. We live our traditions here every day and have ensured that nothing changes here that we follow back home. Right from designing of the house to the food to simple lifestyle, we have it all.Pongal is one occasion we look forward to with my septuagenarian mother preparing at least 4-5 varieties of the dish apart from a whole lot of other southern goodies. We wake up at 3 am and draw Kolam outside the house to mark purity. Celebrations are at peak around 5am when the sun rises.I personally am very fond of my traditions.

Tamils hardly leave their food behind. Knowledge of Tamil food here is limited to idli and dosa. However, there is so much more to southern food. I make appam and stew very often and we are also introducing it on our hotel menu soon. My wife is basically from the north but appreciates our food a lot.

Sugarcane, which marks Pongal, pinched people the most.While the price for a dozen canes cost between `150 and `200 in 2015, this year the cost soared to `300.""Farm production was hit this year by heavy rain,"" said R Soundararajan, market ad visor to the wholesaler's association in Koyambedu.Last year Koyambedu market, which draws more than 1 lakh shoppers during the three days of festivity , received at least 3,000 truck loads by January 13.

Around 90% of the sugarcane in the city is sourced from Thanjavur, Madurai and Panruti town in Cuddalore.Buyers were also let down because of the quality of the sugarcane they bought. ""It was quite an effort to haggle with the vendors to bring down the price. In finally got two for `60. But they weren't too juicy. We just showcased them at home as a symbolic gesture,"" said L Doraisamy, a retired government employ ee residing in Gandhi Nagar.It wasn't just sugarcane that pinched wallets, but other ingredients like jaggery and moong dal too. While the price of pulses spiralled last year following slip in production, jaggery prices, traders say, have been going up gradually due to lower availability of cane for crushing.There was some relief, however, with the price of other ingredients used in Pongal recipes and rituals, including manjal kotthu, flowers and puffed rice, remaining around the same."

Suggestions were also made for creation and rejuvenation of traditional and other water bodies through MNREGA.The suggestions come at a time when the farmers are reeling under the impact of two successive droughts and fall in global prices of farm produce, impact of which is also felt in the country.Only on Sunday, Ramesh Chand, member (agriculture), NITI Aayog had cautioned that if international agri-product prices did not increase in 2016-17 agriculture could face a deeper crisis.Karnataka Agriculture Minister Krishna Byregowda shared the success story of the state in ushering in APMC reforms to create a unified market for agri commodities.Post-APMC reforms, farmers have got better prices for their produce. There was 40 per cent increase in prices of green gram and groundnut, while copra prices doubled resulting in better recovery for farmers, Byregowda said.The Prime Minister also declared Sikkim as the countrys first organic state by saying that rest of the country should take steps reducing excessive use of chemical fertilizer.Since 2003, the hill state has embarked on a mission to convert around 75,000 hectares of agricultural land into organic farming mode by stopping chemical fertilizers and pesticides and eliminating existing subsidies to farmers for procurement of chemical pesticide. In 2003, Sikkim Chief Minister Pawan Kumar Chamling passed a resolution in the state Assembly, aiming at making the Himalayan state completely organic, and subsequently banned synthetic fertilisers and pesticides. Sikkim mostly produces maize, paddy, cardamom and oranges."

Nothing is regulated in social media. These diametrically opposite worlds have come together in the recent years, creating a clash that the armed forces are learning to deal with.The recent arrest of an airman from Bathinda airfieldhoney trapped into leaking information by one Damini McNaught, considered to be a fake cyber identitywas an alarming, but certainly not the first-of-its-kind incident. In 2014, another airman had been arrested from Pathankot airbase. Crucial info regarding the bases and IAF exercises had been leaked.The incidents showed how social networking sites can turn into the ideal hunting ground for foreign intelligence agencies to extract vital information. Likewise, misuse of WhatsApp has also been reported on various occasions with cyber bullies disseminating information among troops with a view to influence opinion among them. According to officials from Army's intelligence wing, sometimes anonymous social media messages are circulated as part of psychological warfare ops to spread disenchantment among the ranks.What turns the problem graver is that majority of troops working for country's 1.5 million strong armed forces comprising Army, Navy and Air Force own smart phones.The defence forces are faced with a humungous new challenge and they are bracing for it. Alarmed by cyber espionage, the military authorities have been regularly issuing advisories to make its troops aware of such vulnerabilities. Though there is no ban on use of social sites on troops, the armed forces authorities have established a separate wing to keep an eye on the suspicious social networking activities of its personnel.While some of them see such regulations/advisories as professional duty to be observed in view national interest, some view it as sacrifice of their civil liberties for the sake of national security. A senior officer from Army's Western Command told TOI, ""We know it is a big threat to national security and are taking all preventive measures by ensuring that anyone's privacy is no invaded.""On the other hand, noted veteran and former army commander of Northern and Central commands, Lt Gen H S Panag believes espionage threats have always existed and those posed by the social network are no different. ""Thirty years ago, when social media was nowhere in the scene, several senior officers and soldiers would be arrested for honey trap charges. World is changing and we cannot restrain soldiers from social media but they can be educated and aware about the ill effects of its misuse,"" Panag added.While the troops as well as their family members, who take pride in sharing photos of men in uniforms online, have been strictly advised not to do so, ex-Major of Army and leading lawyer Major Guneet Chaudhary said that in the recent times a new form of litigation has come up in the armed forces. Officers are facing action for boasting with their uniform on social networking sites or disclosing location of their units. Guneet said he has also found that those not on social media themselves are using their wives' profiles for interaction and sharing information about their Army relationship like ""I fly helicopter' or 'drive tanks in that region'.""""Even several regiments have formed social groups on sites where they share information related to Army. I personally feel this will continue till a complete ban is not imposed upon them,"" Chaudhary added.Box What social media use policy* says: >>Use of internet and social media is permitted for private purpose. However, under no circumstances will army personnel disclose their official identity on the social media.

They also directed those who had not joined such sites to stay away from them in future. The advisory was issued after four naval officers were caught sharing vital information with some women on a social networking site.Box Trapped! July 2012 | A court of inquiry was ordered by Army authorities after a Lt Colonel of an armoured regiment was allegedly found in contact with a Bangladeshi woman---an alleged ISI agent---on a social networking site January 2012 | Four naval officers of the rank of Commanders (equivalent to Lt Col) were held guilty by naval authorities for leaking confidential information, including location of warships, armaments on Facebook.

Generally rice varieties have around 7% protein,"" said Nayak.He said the variety is awaiting approval of the Central Variety Releasing Committee, the apex body of releasing varieties in India. ""Once approved, it will be sent for large seed production,"" Nayak said.The new variety has been developed by crossing Assam rice collection - a high protein and low yielding variety with Naveen - a high yielding variety. NRRI has been doing research on the variety for the last 4 to 5 years. The variety will yield at least five tonnes a hectare, he added.Nayak was here to attend the fourth interface meet of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) institutes, State Agriculture University (SAU) and state departments for 2015-16.In the meeting, major concerns of farmers were discussed, including timely supply of quality seeds of potato, onion and pulses. ""Creating of infrastructure for storage, irrigation, processing and value addition and marketing was also discussed,"" said Nayak.This year, NRRI will emphasise on further research in aromatic rice varieties, production of green gram and black gram, which has reduced drastically over the years. ""To tackle the effect of climate change, NRRI has been giving emphasis on integrated farming system but unfortunately various models developed in the laboratories are not transferred to the field,"" he said.The NRRI also suggested the state government to develop miniature farm machinery at affordable prices to easily transfer scientific breakthroughs to field.

The Sena-BJP combine, which is in a minority in the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), and the civic top brass went into mutual back-patting mode with city BJP MP Anil Shirole lauding municipal commissioner Kunal Kumar for Pune making it to the list.Pune has made the cut only due to its conscious citizens and the untiring efforts of the PMC headed by its commissioner, Kunal Kumar, said Mr Shirole. This is just the beginning of a new dawn, tweeted an enthusiastic Mr Kumar, who was instrumental in pushing Punes bid for the project despite flak from Opposition corporators.The Congress-NCP alliance in power in the PMC was vehemently opposed to the Smart City Plan (SCP), which they claim rides roughshod over the rights of local bodies and threatens to usher in radical privatisation, with humungous funds being funnelled through the Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV), the body to be created in each city to implement the SCP.While we welcome the announcement, we cannot comment until we get all details, said Pune Mayor Dattareya Dhankawde of the NCP.The proposed expenditure for Pune city is Rs 2,932 crore, while the budget for Solapur, the second city in Maharashtra to make it to the list, is pegged at Rs 2,921 crore. The project envisages adoption of smart solutions for efficient use of available assets, resources and infrastructure.How smart is it, ask activistsCity-based activists questioned if the smart agenda will be able to address the citys key concerns, and pointed to the PMCs losing battle with the citys garbage disposition and its chaotic traffic even as it put together its Rs 2.5-crore Smart City proposal.Vijay Kumbhar, an RTI activist, contended that the SCPs basic proposal is structurally flawed. There is no harm in making Pune smart, but the plan proposes to concentrate on the development of the Aundh-Baner-Balewadi cluster which is already an upmarket area. Developing areas like the Parvati-Bibwewadi cluster, bedevilled by a number of problems from sanitation to potable water supply, would have been a real challenge, Kumbhar said.While pitching for Pune, Mr Kumar emphasised that area development was only part of the plan, and would not be done at the cost of pan-city development. The PMC also assured that the issues of traffic, solid waste management and water supply that plague Pune will be addressed as part of the Smart City project.Those reading the fine print, however, noted that the Smart City plan uses terms like walkable cities and compact cities while proposing increased parking areas. Sujit Patwardhan, who heads Parisar, an NGO that works on the citys burgeoning traffic problems, said, If you want to have a pro-walking city, you must incorporate ideas that drastically reduce personal vehicle use. Instead, the plan talks about fancy elevated roads and flyovers.Citizens are apprehensive that the plan makes no provision for the strains on the environment and the citys natural resources vis-a-vis its exploding population, given the high rate of migration from villages nearby to this IT hub. They also noted that Pune has experienced drastic vertical growth, and the demands on energy resources will be immense, especially by 2022, the year targeted by the Modi government to fulfil its Smart City mission.One cannot depend on energy-intensive development for a city to be smart and sustainable. The plan appears to be nonchalant about Punes water woes as well, with the PMC itself admitting a 40-per cent leakage in its water supply, said architect Sarang Yadwadkar.Since August last year, the PMC has collected suggestions from over 125,000 families to gauge citizens aspirations. The two-month drive, titled Smart City Projects Vision Document, was conducted in three phases.It must have ideas that reduce personal vehicle use.

Anganwadi centres provide wheat, peanuts, green gram and chick pea to pregnant women and lactating mothers  It provides 850 calories for each person, Ms. Radha said.The department has discouraged home deliveries or delivery by village mid-wife and it has popularised institutional deliveries, she added.The department, along with the Health Department, has been conducting frequent medical examinations of pregnant women and lactating mothers at anganwadi centres and Primary Health Centres, she said.This is to ensure that the women are not anaemic, Ms. Radha said.Anganwadi centres would take complete care of a child if he/she is found to be underweight. The centres have been directed to ensure that all pregnant women weigh not less than 40 kg and that they perform enough physical activities, Ms. Radha further said.The department has also directed the anganwadi workers to keep a constant vigil on the newborns till they attain the age of two, she said.If the children are found to be suffering from any disease or pain, the workers should take the children and mothers to a nearby Primary Health Centre. The State government has earmarked an amount of Rs.750 per child per year under the Bala Sanjeevini scheme to provide medicines and healthcare to the children, she further said."

She is in the same weight-class as Kom (51kg). ""Watching the movie Mary Kom has further motivated me. I want to fight with Mary Kom in this event. I know she is very good and experienced, but I just want to fight with her, no matter what the result is,"" Bano said. Parveen, who represented Pakistan as a kabaddi player in the Women's World Kabaddi Cup in 2014, said watching Mary Kom motivated her to shift to boxing. Javed said Kom had become a source of inspiration for women boxers in Pakistan. ""The movie motivates me and we used to watch it many times,"" she said. Led by coach Nauman Karim, who won a bronze at the 2003 World Amateur Boxing Championships in Bangkok, the Pakistani team arrived here last evening. The three Pakistani girls are relatively new at international events and said they were feeling proud to represent their country. ""It's my dream that I represent my country as a boxer in international events, and now it has materialised. Initially people were discouraging me. My friends and my family advised me to forget this game (boxing),"" a smiling Bano said. The three boxers also spoke about the social system in their country being a constraint. ""There are people who do not accept and appreciate this but our coach has done a lot to encourage us,"" Bano said. They also said that they got good support from their government, boxing federation, coach and, most importantly, their own family members. ""Our families are very supportive and stand behind us,"" Javed said. Asked about the future of boxing in Pakistan, the three pugilists were optimistic and hoped the sport would progress by leaps and bounds. ""We are optimistic that the young generations will take up boxing,"" Bano said. On their preparations for the South Asian Games, they said they trained at the Ali Boxing Club in Lahore and at a camp in Islamabad. ""We may not be as good as the Indians and Sri Lankans (this time), but we will get good experience from this event,"" Bano said. When The Telegraph informed Kom about the Pakistani women looking up to her, she said: ""I am very happy that Pakistan has done this, especially for women. I am very appreciative that boxing for women has come up in Pakistan. I will extend any requirement from my side, including training at my academy."""

He is on a two-day visit to the state.The minister was here to attend the meeting of Hindi Salahkar Samiti, constituted by the Centre to look after the use of Hindi language in official communications.An official statement, circulated during the news conference, said the Centre has already taken a decision to import 10,000 MT of pulses.The Centre has imposed ban on export of all pulses, except 'kabuli chana', organic pulses and lentils, up to 10,000 MT. Zero import duty on pulses has been extended up to September 2016, the statement said. It said despite two years of less rain, there was more than adequate food grain stock available with the government.Besides to check hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities, the Centre has asked all states to impose stock limits for onion and pulses.In Odisha, prices of pulses have gone through the roof in the last few months. While arhar dal is selling at 160 a kg, prices of moong and urad dal have also skyrocketed much to the discomfort of common man, market sources said.State requires about seven lakh MT pulses per annum against its production of only 80,000 to one lakh MT only. Due to shortage in domestic market, pulses are being imported mainly from Myanmar."

58f8de95a3d24b0b70c3b150,Winter harvest,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/winter-harvest/article8236293.ece,2016-02-14,"Grant Roads Bhaji galli will be endlessly fascinating for anyone even slightly interested in food. It is also a reminder that the traditional Indian diet is seasonal, local, minimal in its environmental impact and above all, striking in its immense variety. When I went there on a cool morning, little hillocks of pearly ponkh were being stacked at my feet. Big jute sacks, plump with onions, were being emptied onto raised platforms. Sweet-fleshed yams were being rolled onto colourful plastic crates. Cardboard boxes were being prised open to reveal ruby-hued strawberries and tangy star fruit.Bhaji galli has a fairly old pedigree, originally named for Jagannath Shankarsheth (Jagannath Lane). Its colloquial appellation comes from the vegetable vendors from Vasai who used to unload fresh vegetables that they got from Vasais weekly market, in the compound of the nearby Balchandra building. The number of vendors then slowly swelled, until the entire lane was overwhelmed by a flood of fruit and vegetable sellers.Today, the lane hums with a steady stream of Mumbaikars, some from as far away as Powai and Borivali. Bhaji galli is dotted with vendors on both sides, many specialising in certain kinds of produce: root veggies, kanda batata, fruits, or foreign vegetables. I am drawn to a stall selling a bewildering array of wintry tubers and greens for undhiyu: green Surti papdi, baby eggplants, purple kand, sweet and regular potato, seedless (ariya) kakdi, Rajagiri bananas and fenugreek. The lady next to me is buying up several packets of these. I come from Borivali once a month to Bhaji galli, she explains as I gawk at the quantity of vegetables she is buying. I have to buy enough undhiyu samaan to last my family that long. But why come all the way here, I persist? She gave me a long, cold look and then she smiled gently. She spoke in a soft voice, as if to an insane person. Bhaji galli has the best quality vegetables, she said, enunciating each word.I slink away to the next vendor, who has heaped posies of mogri or rat-tail radish pods, both green and purple. Oddly, for someone who isnt too fond of radish, I cant get enough of mogri, which I mostly eat raw. But this time, I stir fry them lightly at home with some chopped garlic and salt. They are still delicious, but seem to have lost their sharp flavour and their glorious crunch, having turned a bit fibrous.I move down the lane to Chachas stall, one frequented by my mum for years. We have never been able to find out his real name, You call me chacha only. But we do know that he sometimes keeps amba haldi (mango ginger), another winter favourite. Amba haldi looks almost exactly like regular ginger, tastes a little like green mango with an acerbic aftertaste, but is an obscure relative of the turmeric family. The mango ginger is ripe for pickling with just a little salt water and lime juice and is eaten with every meal to ward off winter infections. But you could also lace your curry with a few slivers, to give it a sour-sharp tang. Its widely used to perk up South Indian, Rajasthani and Gujarati dishes.A little further into the lane, I spot an enormous heap of fresh, leafy vegetables in every possible shade of green. Behind the pile presides a dignified old lady.There is sarson or mustard greens, the main ingredient in the hearty Punjabi winter staple, sarson da saag. There are bunches of spinach and bathua, both of which make first-rate pakodas; I find bathuas bitterness too acrid to consume except when shrouded by a shell of deep-fried dough. But in Jiggs Kalra and Pushpesh Pants Classic Cooking of Punjab , bathua sits comfortably with sarson, spinach and moolipatta (radish leaf) in the aforementioned sarson da saag. This time, I will try and stuff it into a paratha. I also buy the dill, parsley, tender green garlic, pudina and spring onions, ready to be transformed into osh, the warming, nutritious stew that is much loved by Iranians. The lady also has baby methi and gongura; the latter I am going to try and cook with shrimp, Andhra-style.While the lady is rootling around in her tin box for change, I spot a vendor surrounded by a swathe of carrots, both the orange English carrots and the red-hued Indian carrots. The red carrots are more intensely-flavoured and carrotier than their compatriots. I will add them to green peas for a delicious gajar matar sabzi and if some are left over, I will try to cadge the century-old recipe of vegetable achaar from my Punjabi friend. Into her pickle go gobi, shalgam, gajar tempered with salt, chilli, mustard seeds and oil with a little jaggery. It is a delectable winter tradition.A market is an excellent way to get under the skin of a place, and Bhaji galli is a true reflection of Mumbai. The soft drink crates and plastic trays overflowing with international produce reflect the citys growing omnivorousness. Here, a tray heaving with snowy daikon radish. There, a crowd of avocados balanced precariously on a rickety wooden stand. Naturally, the radish and avocados make their way into my shopping bag.What else do I bring home? A perfectly spherical white gourd, which I will stuff with mincemeat as soon as I finish writing this story. Little fronds of fennel which I happily eat raw in salads, but also braised and served on a bed of white fish. Postbox-red chillies. Tart gooseberries or amla. (Amla juice is the elixir I should absorb but amla murabba is what I will actually eat, with stacks of thepla). And finally, green gram, nestled within their pods (a proper pain to shell). Fried or roasted with a light sprinkle of salt and chilli together with a squeeze of lime, they make for the most satisfying winter evening snack.The author is a freelance writer and editor"

In fact, till a few years ago Telangana was the leader in south India in rice production but the situation has now been reversed, if not turned grim.Agriculture started getting affected from the Kharif season in 2014, which saw deficit rainfall and a steadily plummeting ground water table. Added to this was the dismal power supply situation in rural Telangana. With these factors getting worse over time, farmers recorded huge losses in the Kharif and Rabi seasons in 2014-15 and 2015-16.""Even the total cultivated zone has come down drastically. Due to the dwindling ground water table, farmers now require even more electricity to lift water from borewells, but that is not readily available,"" pointed out a senior official.A look at the total food output underlines the gravity of the situation. Whereas the Kharif season of 2013-14 saw the production of 65.28 lakh tonnes of foodgrains, it fell to 44.72 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. This is a steep fall of 31.5 per cent. The decrease was attributed to lesser area under cultivation and an overall decrease in yield of paddy, maize, red gram and green gram crops.The case was similar with the Rabi season. While in 2013-14, the season saw 41.58 lakh tonnes of foodgrains being produced, it fell to 27.46 lakh tonnes the next year, a fall of 33.96 per cent.The worst hit of them all was paddy cultivation, which had earlier thrived due to the introduction of free power to the farm sector. Overall paddy cultivation fell from 65.81 lakh tonnes in 2013-14 to 45.45 lakh tonnes in 2014-15. An expected further fall in production has stoked fears of steep rise of rice prices in 2016-17. Crops such as maize, jowar, wheat, bajra and ragi too have reported a decline.Troubled farmer associations are now pleading the government to save distressed farmers. ""The state government did not announce drought in 2014-15 though the situation was bad, with nine out of the 10 districts of Telangana reporting more than 20 per cent deficit rainfall and drastic drop in the groundwater table. This year, the government has announced drought, but it is too late,"" said Kirankumar of Rythu Swarajya Vedika. The NGO has done extensive studies on the impact of drought on tenant farmers in Telangana and the reasons behind farmer suicides."

Asked who would lead the inquiry, he replied: In due course of time, you will know.The film is based on the real life story of an Indian farmer from Punjab who was convicted of terrorism and spying in Pakistan, sentenced to death, and later wounded fatally by inmates in a Lahore prison in April 2013.Executive body meetsMakkar also led proceedings at a meeting in which the SGPC executive body decided to pass the annual budget for the financial year 2016-17 before March 31. The SGPC will hold many functions through the current year dedicated to the 350th birth anniversary of Guru Gobind Singh coming up on January 5 next year in Patna, Gurus birthplace. Of the various organising committees formed, one comprising senior SGPC officers Roop Singh and Satbir Singh will be in charge of the religious procession from Anandpur Sahib to Patna next month. A mobile exhibition of the Gurus weapons will be part of the event; and this bus will take the route that the young Guru as Gobind Rai had taken to reach Anandpur Sahib from Patna.In June, the SGPC will also observe the 300th martyrdom day of Baba Banda Singh Bahadur, and on the occasion, take out a religious procession from Gurdass Nangal in Gurdaspur district to Delhi. After the Mughals had captured him at Gurdass Nangal, they had taken the Sikh warrior to Delhi and there tortured him to death.SGPC to prepare students for defence, civil servicesMakkar told the media that the SGPC through its professional academy at Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Engineering College, Fatehgarh Sahib, would prepare Sikh students for defence and civil services.Sabat soorat Sikhs (who do not cut their hair or trim their beards) will be trained for clearing the National Defence Academy (NDA) and other officer training academies, said Makkar, adding that 60 students admitted on the basis of written test and interview had commenced training at the academy.He said a similar academy to help Sikhs clear the civil services exams was coming up at Sri Guru Granth Sahib World University, Fatehgrah Sahib.Mobile link to shrineThe SGPC will develop a mobile app to link Sikhs world over to the Golden Temple.

Photo: M.

Cane-growers, black gram cultivators and green gram farmers are the worst-hit as the weeds, due to thick growth, interrupt the growth of their crops, says P. Pandiyarajan, Dean. The problem being faced by farmers due to non-availability of agricultural labourers or additional expenditure involved in clearing the weeds through labourers can be overcome through the application of herbicides.Four major herbicides are being applied in each plot. The herbicides  imazethapyr, quizolafop ethyl, oxylorfen, pendimethalin are applied for the research.The weed growth is so extensive that they form a bed on the crop so that they are known as mat weed which turns otherwise hard to be cleared, he adds.The research aims at helping farmers prevent the emergence of weeds both before and during the process of cultivation of crops, said T. Ramesh, Assistant Professor of Agronomy who has been conducting the research.Parameters such as dry weight of the weeds and cost effectiveness would be ascertained, he added."
5904ea097be9e04154dfda83,"Farmer suicides is no fashion trend, Mr Gopal Shetty",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/farmer-suicides-is-no-fashion-trend-mr-gopal-shetty/,2016-02-18,"The BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra Gopal Shettys statement that it has become a fashion among farmers to commit suicide is ignoble. It not only points to an utter lack of sensitiveness to the plight of the farmers but also points to the ignorance of the difficult conditions in which farmers operate with hardly any infrastructure or help from the government. A cursory glance of the most recent report of the NSSO on Some Aspects of Farming in India brought out earlier this week will most certainly enlighten the honourable BJP MP in this regard.According to the report, which surveyed farmers for the two periods July to December 2012 and January to June 2013, the average cropped area of an Indian farmer was less than one hectare. While the average value of total crop production per agriculture household was Rs 40, 580 in the second part of the year which includes the khariff crop it was at a still lower Rs 36,696 in the first half of the year which included the rabi season. This is a far cry from the hefty payments doled out to the government employees by the various pay commissions and often for very unproductive work.The farmer has very little access to modern inputs and was heavily dependent on the local traders and their own farm for seeds and other farm inputs. Moreover what is worse is that the survey shows that the central and state governments have not been able to spread awareness of the various government programs to help farmers including the widely used minimum support prices which is to protect the farmers from any distress sales during periods of good harvests. And even the minor segment which is aware of the minimum support prices sold their produce to procurement agencies and benefited from the program.But it is not the governments ability to inform the farmers about minimum support prices which galls the experts. More important is the government inability to provide any kind of insurance to cover for the risks the farmers take through large investments in each cropping season. While the share of agriculture households insured was in low double digits in crops like moong, groundnut, soya bean and cotton it was less than 5% in important cereals like paddy and wheat. Numbers on most major crops show that less than half the farmers were aware of crop insurance schemes and even among those aware of such schemes very few had any idea of the facilities it provided.However, the biggest default on the farm front is the governments apparent inability to provide extension service for the farmers. Less than 3% of the agriculture households who were keen on updating technologies have access to the support of krishivigyan kendras, agriculture universities or NGOs. Hardly 6% had access to services of extension agents. Similarly 7-8% of the agriculture households can avail of services of private commercial agents or veterinary departments. The largest source of agriculture households access to technical advice was progressive farmers and media like radio, television, newspaper and internet which accounted for almost a 20% share each.There is also substantial disparities in the access to technical advice for agriculture household across states. Among major states almost two third of the farmer households has access to technical advice during the khariff crop in the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Kerala. In contrast the access to technical advice to farmer household was the least in Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh where it was just around a quarter.These numbers give an idea of the innumerable hurdles that Indian farmers have to face to eke out a marginal existence on the fringes of the economy. The government inability to provide even basic facilities like extension or insurance facilities either directly or through private agencies point to bankrupt polices which has forced many a farmer to take their own life especially when input costs and cost of farming practices have soared up in recent years. Gopal Shetty, the BJP Member of Parliament from Maharashtra should try to educate himself about the sad plight of the farmers before he makes such ignoble statements about them."
58f14bcea3d24b245e5986eb,Improved immunity best shield against swine flu,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Improved-immunity-best-shield-against-swine-flu/articleshow/51049393.cms,2016-02-19,"Ahmedabad: A study by Civil Hospital of samples collected from swine flu patients during the epidemic last year indicates that people in the age groups with lowered immunity are most vulnerable to the infection. This includes children in the age group of 0 to 9 years, working population in the 20 to 29 years and the 50 to 59 age group.For this reason, experts say that the focus of preventive measures this year should be on improving immunity through vaccination, and through improved diet with high protein content.Last year, between January and April, Gujarat had experienced the worst swine flu epidemic in its history and had recorded the second highest number of cases and deaths in the country after Rajasthan.A recent study by BJ Medical College's microbiology department of close to 6,197 blood samples that its lab had received during the epidemic last year, has revealed that nearly 55% of the 3,242 samples had tested positive. Of this 55%, a large number belonged to patients in the age groups of 20 to 29 years (15%) and 50 to 59 (16%) years. A large number of these cases, however, were of children in the 0 to 9 age group.During the swine flu epidemic last year, Gujarat had recorded a total of 6,561 cases while the death toll was 439. In the second phase of the epidemic between July and November 2015, there were 519 swine cases and 63 deaths.The most common symptoms in confirmed H1N1 positive cases were cough (78%) and fever (77%), followed by sore throat (62%) and dyspnea (52%). From patients admitted at Civil Hospital in Asarwa, a total of 1,377 samples were received between January 1 and March 15 last year. Of these, 735 (53%) were H1N1 positive and 180 deaths were recorded. The case-fatality rate was reported to be 24%, the highest during the season.""The report clearly shows how children between 0 to 9 years accounted for the highest number of H1NI cases (21%). Thus, to reduce transmission during an epidemic, this population must be a key target for vaccination,"" said a senior official of the Civil Hospital. Among patients with confirmed swine H1N1 infection, 1,679 (51.79%) cases were female patients.The Civil Hospital study also says that though the 0 to 9 age group was most vulnerable in Gujarat, similar studies in Maharashtra and Delhi had reported the 20-39 age group as the most affected.Pediatricians like Dr Mona Desai say that the human body's biggest defense against swine flu is its immune system apart from vaccination.""These days even mother's breast feed to infants has to be supplemented with trace nutrients and iron for the well-being of the infant and his increased immunity. The immunity comes from the food, habits and lifestyle of breast-feeding mothers,"" said Desai.She further said that in middle and lower middle class families, high protein diet is a still a dream though this is necessary to build an immune system. ""The cost of basic pulses like moong, fruits and vegetables are sky-rocketing. These are essential for children in the growing age but many families today cannot afford them,"" she said."

But, being a chartered accountant, she never had a chance to take it up until she gave up her job and decided to finally give it a try. Ashwini Aurangabadkar has taken to full time organic farming since 2011 and cultivates almost all cereals, a variety of pulses, linseed, vegetables and fruits like orange, custard apple etc.Ashwini is not alone. There are a number of city women who have taken up full-time organic farming. Some of them who couldn't get into farming are even doing organic terrace kitchen gardening. All have something common.They are part of the Nagpur Seed Festival Group which has members who are completely into organic cultivation and opposed to chemical farming and naturally also other modern technologies like the genetically modified (GM) farming. The group from the last four years has been regularly holding a seed festival to create awareness in masses about preservation of indigenous varieties in various crops.TOI spoke to some of the women farmers on the first day of the Beejotsav being held at the Vinoba Vichar Kendra on Friday.""After entering the field, I realized that agriculture by itself was a difficult task and especially organic. I wouldn't find workers who would listen to my instructions. But I never gave up. I read on line. I attended Padma Shri Subhash Palekar's workshops, consulted experts like Vasant Futane. But now I have enough animals also to generate farmyard manure, vermicompost and other components of organic farming like use of gomutra, cow dung and neem-based pesticides etc. Farming has become a passion now,"" said Ashwini.Shyamla Sanyal, another dedicated organic farmer from the city, has been into serious agriculture from the past six years. She has a farm about 50km from Nagpur on Chhindwara Road.""I wanted to cultivate variety of crops only for my own consumption and not buy anything from market. I had met Dinesh Balsawar, who is into organic rice farming in Lonavala, in 1993. But after beginning with a kitchen garden six years back now I am into full time farming. I grow wheat, gram, mung, tur, onions, garlic, mustard, turmeric, fennel, sesame, vegetables and fruits etc. It was trial and error. But now I know which crops are good for my soil conditions,"" said Sanyal.Prachi Mahurkar, who got associated with Beejotsav since last two years, has a farm in Maragsur village near Katol. She grows bajra, mung, maize, ambadi. She left her IT sector job and is a member of Pune based 'Ecological Society'.""My perspective to life and farming changed after joining this society. It has taught me to take holistic approach in agriculture too and hence along with crops I also have forest trees like hirda, bheda and amla in my field,"" said Mahurkar.Kirti Mangrulkar left her teaching job in computer science and is also into organic farming since two years. She believes in preserving indigenous varieties and grows desi cotton, ambadi, bajra, jowar and vegetables.

But, with escalating food prices and a need to cut down on food waste, restaurants and individuals across the world are turning to 'root to stem' cooking, ensuring that no edible part of any vegetable goes waste. Carrot tops and onion peels, cauliflower stalks and watermelon rinds - all of it is used to dish out delicious chutneys, pickles and gravies.While the West may be discovering new ways to cut waste, Indians seem to be coming full circle. The older generation of Indians have always believed in the 'waste not, want not' maxim.""I have grown up being told not to waste food and even today I don't waste vegetables while cooking,"" says cookbook au- thor Sabita Radhakrishna. She uses the tender cauliflower stems to make a clear soup, and all vegetable peels and celery stems to whip up a broth. ""I collect vegetable peels and put them in a Ziploc, chop celery, add a bit of the fleshy outer skin of the onion, chop ginger-garlic and celery and slow-cook it,"" says Radhakrishna. The broth is then extracted and frozen in plastic containers and used instead of soup cubes.""With people earning more these days, I am not sure whether they are conscious of waste, unless it is inculcated in them,"" she adds.However, many families are indeed turning to old recipes. Swarnamalya Rajesh, an HR professional and mother of two, says tighter household budgets made her take a second look at her style of cooking. ""Earlier, I didn't think twice about throwing away the stems of coriander and keerai (greens). But now, I make chutney from the coriander stems and kootu from the keerai stems,"" she says, adding that she got the idea from her mother.Chitra Viswanathan  or ChitVish as she is known after her cooking app  says there is a growing awareness now. ""Traditionally, Indians have been frugal. For instance, the peel of the nendran banana was chopped, boiled with green gram soaked overnight and then tempered with various ingredients.""Every day, when she chops coriander, she drops the roots into the rasam when it is boiling, to add flavour. ""It can be strained before serving,"" says Viswanathan, who has come up with a aromatic 'herbal waste rasam'. Shree Periakaruppan, who runs Foodology, a recreational culinary studio, says she often encounters innovative dishes created from what was considered waste. Sorakka (bottle gourd), thol payasam, and chutney made of ridge gourd peel are some dishes she has come across. ""Even lemon zest, where you remove the outer layer of a citrus fruit, has become popular and is used in dishes like lemon cilantro rice,"" says Periakaruppan.Restaurants too are looking at traditional ways of cooking. ""With the cost of vegetables going up, it is becoming mandatory in restaurants that want to reduce edible waste,"" says Koushik, the Mad Chef of Eatitude, a consulting company for startup food ventures. So, onion and carrot peels are used to make vegetable stock, and watermelon rinds pickled or made into vadais. ""It helps maintain the prices at a restaurant,"" says Koushik."

Often, it is at odds with their personal picks. The majority rightly predicted Leonardo DiCaprio finally winning the the Best Actor prize for The Revenant , or Alejandro G Irritu winning Best Director for the same. But these werent necessarily in agreement with their ideas of the most deserving.However, if theres one name for whom the gap between will win and should win almost didnt exist. it is Emmanuel Lubezki. Even if that meant that the Mexican would create Oscar history as the first cinematographer to win three consecutive times. Or the fact that the Academy, given its track record for giving consolation prizes for the wrong film in the wrong year, could hand it over to Roger Deakins, another modern great who has 13 nominations but not a single win, for Sicario . ButLubezkis work in The Revenant , much like Gravity and Birdman , is a visual miracle hard to ignore. Without his artistry with natural light, live action and CGI, these films wouldnt exist.While his old friend and collaborator Alfonso Cuarns Gravity showed us how intimate the space between two people can be, it also made us feel the infinite loneliness when one is without the other. In the following years Birdman , with another compatriot, Inarritu, he pulled out another trick from his bag. He gave us a seemingly one-shot film that throbs with kinetic energy and fervour. In The Revenant , the 51-year-old takes his use of natural lighting to another extreme, capturing the staggering beauty of wintry wilderness. What has made Lubezki a modern great is his label-defying work that embraces natural light as much as CGI. Even when he didnt have humungous budgets to work on, he gave us some of the most unforgettable sequences in cinema history: whether it was the one-take car ambush scene in Children of Men , where the frivolous and light mood inside a car is turned on its head when rioters launch a surprise attack or the visual poetry in Terrence Mallicks Tree of Life . Then theres also the poolside masturbation scene in Cuarns low-budget Spanish indie Y Tu Mama Tambien , that signs out with an underwater POV shot of semen dissolving in the water.While Lubezki continued his winning streak, veteran Ennio Morricone ended his dry spell at the Oscars by winning his first Best Original Score; he was awarded an Honorary Lifetime Achievement in 2007. This was the sixth nomination of the 87-year-old great, making him the oldest Oscar winner.The granddaddy of soundtracks has been snubbed by the Academy several times when he should have won, most notably The Mission (1986), when Morricone famously called it a theft.But the Italian composer, who still doesnt know to speak in English as we saw in his acceptance speech, even after composing in Hollywood for over 50 years, has fittingly won it for The Hateful Eight . It is a film that gives Morricone a starring role and a throwback to his earlier work: especially his score in horror classics such as John Carpenters The Thing and in Sergio Leones Spaghetti Westerns . Morricones work can be described as distinctly cinematic, hair-raisingly larger-than-life and romantically melodious.Tarantino, a major fan of the maestro, who coaxed the octogenarian to work with him, uses his ominous, atmospheric soundtrack to heighten the sense of tension and foreboding in the film.But no composer has been associated with a genre as Morricone has been associated with Westerns. For instance, the Dollars Trilogy gave us one of the most exhilarating and also most mimicked, whistled, and parodied musical themes in movie history: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly . Or his last hurrah with Leone, his friend from school, in Once Upon a time in America .But Morricones body of work is bigger than just Westerns; those comprise a mere 10 per cent. His work also extends to Italian art films such as the orchestral outbursts of Bernardo Bertoluccis 1900 and/or the emotional strains of Cinema Paradiso ."

Harish, member of the Board of Regents of University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences (UAHS), Shivamogga, has called upon agriculture scientists to take up research on high-yield varieties of pulses to strengthen the food security of the nation. He was speaking after inaugurating an awareness programme on pulses held at the campus of UAHS, here on Tuesday to mark the International Year of Pulses. Pulses like tur, Bengal gram, horse gram, lentils, green gram and cow peas are rich sources of nutrition and form part of the diet in India for many years now. It is necessary to enhance the production of pulses to ensure access to nutritious food for people from all strata of the society, he said.Though the nation is the largest producer of pulses with a total annual production of around 18 million tonnes, there is a huge gap between the domestic demand and supply owing to which 4.60 million tonnes is being imported every year. It is necessary to be prepared to meet this challenge by increasing the production of pulses, he said. Even farmers in irrigated zones are not keen on taking up cultivation of pulses. They hold the wrong notion that the returns from this are not lucrative.Agriculture scientist T.K. Siddarame Gowda said that, owing to change in agriculture practices and due to shortage of labour in rural areas, the farmers are displaying an aversion towards the cultivation of pulses. The cultivation of pulsesis necessary for sustainable agriculture as pulses fix atmospheric nitrogen to the soil through root nodules. By taking up cultivation of pulses, the farmers can minimise the use of chemical fertilisers and thereby conserve the fertility of the soil, he added.Farmers in irrigated zones believe that returns are not lucrative in the cultivation of pulses"

58ff13fe7be9e041361623cb,"Now, Bihar farmers hope for a reprieve from Nilgai",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/532878/now-bihar-farmers-hope-reprieve.html,2016-03-05,"Abhay Kumar in Patna Mar 06, 2016 0:05 ISTFifty six-year-old Ram Sharan Singh in Bihars Bhojpur district remained a worried lot after packs of Nilgai destroyed his crops year after year. So perplexed was he with the Nilgai menace that at one point of time, he was mulling over the proposal to shift to other business from agriculture.But the Centres decision to allow Bihar cull Nilgais has come as a major relief for him and other farmers. A recent notification issued by the Union Environment ministry, headed by Prakash Javdekar, in December 2015 says the Centre has agreed to the Bihar governments demand to declare Nilgai as vermin on account of the damage they cause to the life and property.This is arguably the first instance where the Ministry of Forest and Environment has declared any species as vermin and granted rights to a state to hunt them down. Bihar had been pressing about the matter after several complaints poured in about damage of crops by Nilgai. Such was the havoc created by the antelope that farmers last year complained to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar during one of his yatras.The concern was expressed again in the meeting of the State Board of Wild Life, held in May 2015, where it was decided that Bihar would declare the Nilgai as vermin. The proposal was then forwarded to the Union Environment Ministry, Bihars Principal Secretary, Forest and Environment, Vivek Kumar Singh told Deccan Herald.We were receiving regular complaints about crops damaged by Nilgai. Since Nilgai (also called blue bull) is a Schedule III animal, it has been quite difficult to handle the menace. But after cultivation was hit, there was a growing clamour to hunt down the Nilgai despite the emotional attachment to it due to gai factor, said Singh.Its not only the farm area where the Nilgais had wreaked havoc. Sometime back, a peculiar situation arose in Patna when an antelope strayed into the campus of Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport .Mercifully, before it could enter the high-security zone, zoo officials from the nearby Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park were requisitioned who helped in apprehending the wayward animal.Close on the heels of a blue bull entering the Patna airport, yet another antelope entered the campus of Gaya International Airport, some 125 km from Patna. Every takeoff and landing of international and domestic flights in Gaya was fraught with danger as the blue bull, which had once strayed onto the runway, was said to be hiding in the adjoining 50-hectare dense forest cover at the airport. The antelope was eventually apprehended by the forest department officials who came looking for the herbivorous animal with tranquilliser guns in hand.Prior to this incident, when a tiger strayed in from Valmikinagar reserve area (in Champaran), it killed several antelopes along the Gandak basin, while returning to its territory.The villagers, comprising mostly farmers, were profusely thanking the God because these Nilgais had destroyed acres of crops worth lakhs.Rattled over Nilgais havoc, we had organised Mahachandi yajna (a form of prayer) some time back to invoke the Goddess Durga. The goddess sent in the tiger to chase the blue bull. We are thankful to Maa Durga, said Rampujan Singh, a native of Saran.Bihar has a history of Nilgais damaging lentil crops like arhar and moong (pulses), thereby adversely affecting their production. Farmers in several districts where the Ganga and Gandak basin exists face huge losses as crops of wheat, maize, vegetables and pulses are damaged by herds of Nilgais. These animals not only graze in farmlands but also damage standing crops.During Vishwas Yatra undertaken by Nitish Kumar, the farmers narrated him their plight over the mess created by Nilgais. There are thousands of Nilgais. And their population is increasing by the day because a female antelope breeds twice a year, an aggrieved farmer told the Chief Minister emphasising on the need to capture and sterilise the Blue Bull.Later, farmers in many parts of Bihar put up bars and barricades to protect the crops from Nilgais and also continuously monitored their fields.The Bihar Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institute (BAMETI) organised one of the workshops on the issue in which representatives of the state government and other experts dwelt at length how to overcome this problem. The meeting, which was attended by Chief Conservator of Forests, wild life experts and activists of NGOs, deliberated on the issue and suggested ways and means to protect the crops from these wild herbivores.One of the suggestions was to empower mukhiyas to issue gun licences to kill these animals and make them honorary wildlife warden. But the suggestion was immediately shot down. As per the Indian culture, Hindus consider Nilgais as sacred because of the nomenclature. It has gai (cow) in it, and therefore it cant be gunned down, an expert argued.The other reason for the increase in antelopes population is said to be the shrinking forest. The carnivores that kept a check on their population are fast dwindling. As a consequence, the wild carnivores nowadays roam freely and, of late, have entered the human habitat.Taking note of the serious problem, the Centre, on December 1, 2015 issued a gazette notification which has allowed Bihar to cull Nilgais. Now this should make farmers heave a sigh of relief."

The 45ft artificial wall and 15ft indoor climbing gym studded with fibre boulders on the TSAF campus are witnessing a poor response from the local children defeating the very purpose of setting them up.

""The irony is that professionals likes business managers, engineers and others take part in the adventure sport when they are settled in their job whereas the motive of adventure sport is to train growing children,"" Bachendri said.She added that she has stopped visiting schools and advising faculties to send children for adventure sport training. ""If adventure sport is made part of the school curriculum, parents will send children to learn this sport,"" Bachendri said.Responding to a query, Pal said teachers and parents should realize that adventure sport helps build confidence and overcome physical stiffness. ""Adventure sport helps a person tide over crisis. It also helps build the character of the person. It also helps relieve stress build will power,"" Bachendri said."

However, it still falls short of the demand by nearly three to four million tonnes, forcing the country to fall back on imports.The new versions of pulses being developed at the Kanpur-based institute include reduction of crop duration of moongbean from 75 to 55 days, lentil from 140 to 120 days and chickpea from 135 to 100 days.Varieties developedIt has also developed wilt-resistant varieties in chickpea, development of early maturing varieties in pigeonpea suitable for multiple cropping and green seeded variety of field pea for diversified food uses.The Centre is also promoting production of pulses in rice fallows and also popularising pulses cultivation in non-traditional area."

Khemka on Saturday tweeted, Cleared in false vigilance case after 31 months. Inquiry report not provided.Reason? To shield conspirators involved in the frame-up?THE PROBEThe state vigilance bureau (VB) was probing the alleged flouting of norms and tendering procedures in the purchase of green gram seeds through a single bidder, Metro Hybrid Seeds (on outright purchase basis), and denying National Cooperative Consumer Federation (NCCF) and National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED) the supply order.According to the official records, the NCCF and NAFED were denied the supply order even as they had agreed to supply the requisite quantity of green gram seed at Rs 8,400 per quintal on consignment basis. Instead, a short-term tender was floated by HSDC inviting private seed producers without even assigning the reasons. Only one seed producer, Metro Hybrid Seeds, made an offer to supply the green gram seed at Rs 8,412 per quintal as against the negotiated rate of Rs 8,400 per quintal agreed by the NCCF and NAFED, VB officials had told HT.The NCCF had made a formal complaint to the HSDC saying if they had been given a counter-offer to supply green gram seed they would have supplied the moong seed at Rs 8,000 per quintal on consignment basis as the rates of moong seed had considerably decreased in the market during March-April 2013. The Federation also said that denying them the supply order without any intimation about the status of their tender was illegal and undue favour was shown in placing the order with Metro Hybrid Seeds.While Khemka as managing director, HSDC, had put a condition for the NCCF and NAFED that the seed supplies should be from their own-co-producers and not through traders or middlemen, no such condition was imposed on Metro Hybrid Seeds. The private seeds producer supplied about 6,600 quintals of seed after buying it from other 24 seed producers and traders.PROBES AGAINST KHEMKAChargesheeted during the Congress rule in September 2013 for major penalty. Held liable for administrative misconduct for overstepping jurisdiction in passing orders to cancel the mutation of 3.5 acres in Shikohpur village, the land sold by UPA chairperson Sonia Gandhis businessman son-in-law Robert Vadra to realty major DLF and indulging in public criticism of the actions and policies of the state government.Status: Chargesheet dropped by the BJP government.Vigilance inquiry initiated regarding alleged irregularities in the purchase of green gram seed in 2013 during his tenure as MD, Haryana Seeds Development Corporation.Status: Vigilance gives him a clean chit.Issue of alleged irregularities in award of contract for construction of godowns with galvalume roofing sheets by state Warehousing Corporation under his watch is still pending.

But we do not have a good school in Karbi Anglong,"" said Juli Tokbipi of Nawgong Girl's College who has now spent almost 15 years in a Nagaon household. ""We do household work in the morning. Girls are engaged in cleaning while boys are assigned to take the cattle to the fields. Thereafter, we go to school and once the classes get over, we assist the families in household work and go to table in the evening,"" Longsing said. A pitiable education environment, frequent bandhs and trouble, lack of quality infrastructure and qualified teachers and mismanagement are the reasons why parents in Karbi Anglong prefer to send their children to Nagaon schools. Some guardians in Hamren, however, blame their poverty coupled with the local autonomous council's failure to come up with an education policy as the root cause of the migration. Most of them blame Khor Sing Engti, an MLA from Howraghat in Karbi Anglong who is a minister in the Tarun Gogoi cabinet, for the pathetic scenario. Engti's wife Premola Beypi is the executive member for social welfare in the Karbi Anglong Autonomous Council and his sister Alis Engtipi is the executive member for education in the council. ""Being the hills area development minister, Khorsing could have taken some initiatives. Both Premola and Alis are influential elected members of the council and they represent the two departments involved in children's future,"" said Lorense Engti, a Baithalangso villager. Baithalangso is one of the most underdeveloped constituencies of Karbi Anglong, suffering from illiteracy, backwardness and poor communication. It has 179,851 voters, of whom 93,196 are male and 86,655 female. Congress legislator Mansingh Rangpi and Hill State Demand Council (HSDC) heavyweight Holiram Terang are the two strong candidates from Baithalangso this year. Asked about the migration, the council's Hamren representative, Mangalsingh Timung of the Congress, said: ""We have no time to discuss such things now as we are busy in election campaign."" Baithalangso legislator Man Sing Rongpi of the Congress, when asked about the issue, said: ""This is a complicated subject, for which several factors are responsible. The entire socio-political system might join hands and work together to curb the migration."""

Narasingha said after facing humiliation instead of words of assurance from the sub-collector, the farmer, who had taken loan from bank and private money lenders ended his life the day after.Echoing similar sentiments, BJP legislator K V Singhdeo demanded that the state government should investigate the role of the officer. Opposition chief whip and Jeypore MLA Tara Prasad Bahinipati said the sub-collector knowingly instigated the farmer to commit suicide. Bahinipati said it was yet another instance of bureaucratic high-handedness in the Naveen Patnaik regime.Bahinipati sought a historic ruling from the speaker on the issue and immediate arrest of the sub-collector. The Balangir sub-collector, when contacted, said the allegation against him is false. Mohanty said during the grievance redressal on March 21 a group of four to five farmers had come with the complaint that they had suffered crop loss due to untimely hail and rain. ""I and other officers present were compassionate while listening to the farmers' plights. The tehsildar was immediately asked to conduct an inquiry who submitted his report the same day. Unfortunately, one of the farmers ended his life,"" Mohanty told TOI.BJD spokesperson and MLA Pratap Jena said the death is being probed by the district administration. Action will be taken against anyone found gulity, he said."
5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
58f4dcf560de470aa339d391,Missing projects ,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160331/jsp/northeast/story_77427.jsp,2016-03-31,"Water, water, every where/ Nor any drop to drink... Water, water, every where/ Nor any drop to drink... A peek into the files of Karbi Anglong Rural Development Agency will give you the impression that Diphu Assembly constituency in the hill district of Karbi Anglong has overcome its decades-old water crisis, thanks to the commissioning of almost 500 water-harvesting projects in the past 10 years. More than Rs 4 crore from the local MLAs development fund, Rs 16 crore released under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Generation Scheme and Rs 4 crore from the Backward Regions Grant Fund have been spent during the period for the projects concerned. However, the residents might tell a stranger that he is seeing the matter through the wrong end of a telescope  the projects exist only on the office files. Scarcity of potable water has been one of the biggest problems in Diphu. More than Rs 55 crore (Rs 24 crore from district rural development agency, Rs 5 crore from the fishery department, Rs 4 crore from the soil conservation department and the remaining amount from PHE department) have already been spent under various government programmes to eradicate the problem, but most of the funds are allegedly siphoned off by corrupt officials. Even 59 years after installation of the Greater Diphu Water Supply Project, only 45 per cent population of Diphu town has been covered so far. In the past 15 years, crores of rupees have allegedly been spent on non-existent projects, which has further aggravated the water crisis in the hill district headquarters. When we saw the long lists of schemes we thought it was a political joke as we know these areas where there is no such water-harvesting schemes. We moved the offices concerned and found that what was written on the files are true, said Diphu constituency CPI (M-L) leader Daniel Teron. A boy fetches water from a pond in Diphu. Picture by Sarat Sarma On paper, local legislator Bidya Sing Engleng has commissioned more than 30 water-harvesting projects utilising his area development fund in the past three years. We visited the sites, but no such project was to be found. Each of these projects cost at least Rs 5 lakh. Work is shown as completed by the DRDA and physical and financial progress are 100 per cent, alleged Bidya Rangfar of Dharamnala. Round the year, people in the town depend on only the PHE department scheme as geologically, areas under the Diphu constituency do not have enough groundwater. Diphu town receives 24 lakh litres of water per day against its requirement of 50 lakh litres. For the people in the adjoining rural areas, rain water is the only source, which worsens during winter. We make holes in the PHE department pipes from Siloni to Diphu town and steal water, said Stephen, a Kuki youth of Manja. Poor roads, erratic power supply, lack of civic amenities and potable water crisis have been the main issues in Diphu all these years. We expected a long-term measure to put an end to the water crisis. Had the legislator taken the initiative to actually implement the water projects, which figure on the office files, which could have been a relief for the residents, said Robinson Hanse, a Diphu resident. Diphu constituency, 70 per cent of which is in rural areas, has 245 polling stations. It comprises 1.66 lakh voters of which 84,890 are male and 81,272 female. The 25,000 Bodo voters and 20,000-plus Dimasa voters play a role of kingmaker in the constituency. Since 2001, Congress candidate Bidya Sing Engleng has been representing the constituency. Engleng was the parliamentary secretary in the 2011 Tarun Gogoi cabinet. This time, Hills State Demand Committee leader and former Diphu Lok Sabha member Jayanta Rongpi, sitting MLA Engleng and former district Congress committee president, who later joined BJP, Som Ronghang are in the fray. We want a politician who sincerely considers the major problems of Diphu town. Population is rising but supply of water is going down every day. Developed roads, systematic planning of urban areas are some symptoms of development. But these are not seen at all in Diphu during the 15-year Congress rule, said Pratima Terangpi, a Karbi school teacher. Karbi Anglong DRDA, however, claims that all water harvesting and fishery schemes executed by the agency under various government programmes are real. See, we have photographs and land-related documents. Photos were taken in different phases of execution. Our block-level officers and team from headquarters visit these schemes time to time, said Karbi Anglong DRDA project director (in-charge) David Timung."
58f4e33e60de470aa339da9a,Election ennui,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160402/jsp/northeast/story_77834.jsp,2016-04-02,"Karbi king Harsing Ronghang. Picture by Pankaj Sarma Elections don't excite traditional Karbi king Harsing Ronghang anymore. The Karbi king, who's called Lindokpo or Richo, is impervious to the two-phase Assembly polls, reflecting the general mood of his subjects. ""Elections come and go but our lives remain just the same. We lack proper roads. Every day we have to trudge through hilly tracks for over 3km to fetch water and don't even have regular power supply,"" Ronghang said. Judging by the lack of interest and by the ennui in the Assembly elections, it's clear that common people, barring members of political parties, are fed up with the false promises of the politicians. ""All politicians, irrespective of their party affiliations, work only for their own betterment and that of their family members. They need us only when elections are around. Once the elections are over, they don't even care about us,"" the king said. He feels a lot remains to be done for uplift of the area, which is considered to be one of the most backward places in the state. Traditional social administrative system and the traditional king still exist in Karbi Anglong. The king, who is traditionally selected from the Ronghang clan, has a strong control over all socio-cultural and religious activities within his territorial jurisdiction. He, however, doesn't have any political power, which is vested with the Karbi Anglong District Autonomous Council and the state government. His capital, surrounded by forests, mostly bamboo groves, is situated at Ronghang Rongbong, about 16km south of Hamren, headquarters of the new West Karbi Anglong district in central Assam. ""The government and the council have done precious little to preserve the Karbi royal tradition. Ronghang Rongbong can be developed as a heritage centre of Karbi culture and a tourist spot but so far nothing has been done in this direction,"" Ronghang rued. Despite being a king, he struggles to make ends meet on a monthly honorarium he gets from the council. ""I may be the king but I am a poor man. I don't even own a car,"" he said candidly. He has a solar power panel at his home but has to go without electricity during rains and cloudy weather. He also doesn't have water supply. ""The only honour I get from the government is the invitation to witness Independence Day and Republic Day celebrations as a guest,"" he said. The king's disgust and disillusionment with the electoral process is also shared by the people his ancestors once ruled. Most voters reacted to the elections and political leaders' assurances by saying, ""We have heard everything before"" and ""They are all the same. It makes no difference who wins"". ""Most of the poor people will vote for the candidate who will pay them a few hundred rupees. Development and other civic problems are hardly an election issue here. That's the ground reality,"" said Willingson Timung, a resident of Umchera. ""We have a 50-bed hospital in Hamren but you will rarely find a doctor. Moreover, there is no equipment, medicine, oxygen cylinder and laboratory. It itself speaks volumes of the government's neglect,"" he said. Hamren goes to polls on April 4."

The Eden Gardens witnessed an amazing finish to this World T20. England came back strongly after the initial hiccups, but they had not reckoned with the massive hitting abilities of Carlos Brathwaite, the new superstar of international cricket. Joe Root and Jos Buttler gave England the chance to fight and fight they did. West Indies, barring Marlon Samuels, failed to plan the chase initially and the pressure saw the middle order cave in. But Samuels and Brathwaite finished the job in style. To sign off the contest with four consecutive sixes was just the icing on the cake for this wonderful tournament. Two titles in a day at the same venue was a reward the West Indies richly deserved. West Indies were the champions for the second time and none should grudge them the exalted position in T20 cricket. They earned the reputation richly on Sunday night and what a sight it was to see them celebrate their triumph! I felt sorry for Ben Stokes but that's the way it is. There has to be a loser and it happened to be England. West Indies snatched the victory from an improbable position. It was nice to see the West Indies and England making it to the final. The revival of cricket in the Caribbean has the potential to change how the rest play the game. West Indians play and also entertain. There is always a sense of unpredictability in the West Indian approach. They can win from anywhere. And also slip at the summit. But West Indies cricket is looking up now. A steady supply of talent raises the optimism around West Indies. They are ready to rule world cricket again. For four decades England have stubbornly refused to innovate or shed their traditional approach to the game. They did win the World T20 title in 2010, and interestingly that was in the Caribbean. It is good to see that the English have understood the need of the hour. They are willing to take risks and that brings freshness to their cricket. The classically correct Root shining in the T20 format is evidence of England's change in approach. The World T20 over, one feature that strikes me is the rapid progress the game has made in the last decade or so. Cricket has become robust and very skilful. You need skills at every step and the T20 format tests your ability to innovate and come to terms with the rising challenges. The obstacles can come in various shapes and there is nothing that stands out as starkly as the humungous task the bowlers face when battling against some of the finest batsmen you can imagine. The adventurous streak that a batsman carries with him to the crease is understandable. The focus is on garnering runs quickly. The poor bowler is faced with a situation that just does not look to favour him. I am meaning the playing surface and the nature that continue to conspire against the bowlers. I feel disturbed when the dew factor leaves the side bowling second in such a state of frustration. There has to be a way out to counter this problem and I think the International Cricket Council (ICC) must look into this malady on a priority basis. How can we allow the key contests of a tournament to be decided on the basis of toss? That is what happens when you lose the toss. You bowl second and suffer due to the dew factor. I think the ICC can experiment with a slightly early start. The idea should be for the game to finish by 9pm. I know prime time TV is the attraction for the cricket administrators, but when you want the world to watch an early start I am sure prime time can become flexible. Afghanistan is an example of cricket promising to reach out to new teams. They have locally-bred cricketers and a couple of more teams in the Afghanistan mould could boost the game. It is time Afghanistan are invited by Test nations to play regularly. They have earned the reputation of being an exciting team. I was most disappointed by South Africa and I have decided I shall never back them. Time and again South Africa have let their supporters down and confirmed their lack of nerves on big occasions. India have a steady stream of gifted players and Virat Kohli has the capacity to absorb all pressures and guide the side. He doesn't play any fancy shot, the scoop or the switch-hit, but stands out as a dashing batsman in T20s with the purity of a Test player. I expect Virat, Rohit Sharma and Ajinkya Rahane to be the pillars of India's batting in all formats. England are the surprise of this tournament. They played the right brand of cricket. Better than all the subcontinent teams where Pakistan and Sri Lanka need a major overhaul. It happens when you lose your stalwarts in very short period and Sri Lanka have felt it hard. As for Bangladesh, they have the fire to improve and shake the top teams. Hope they have recovered from the self-inflicted defeat against India. I must also add that Bangladesh suffered because they lost two bowlers to suspect action. Here it would help if the ICC takes such action ahead of a tournament and not in the middle of it. I like the way Tamim Iqbal, Shakib-al Hasan and Mustafizur Rahman approach the game - positive and confident. The West Indies women claiming the title for the first time was all the more relevant because they dethroned three-time champions Australia. The men emulated their triumph and the West Indies are the toast of international cricket again."

The husband-wife duo, whose three children work in Bangalore, were later admitted to RIMS, where they regained consciousness around 10.30am on Wednesday, almost 30 hours after two men in their thirties offered them prasad on the train. Doctors at RIMS said strong sedatives were used, but the couple was stable. Police are probing reservation details of their two co-passengers in Coach HA-I and banking on surveillance camera footage at Bhubaneswar station, from where the men boarded the train, to crack the case. Speaking to The Telegraph from his RIMS bed, Verma - a BIT-Mesra alumnus and retired architect - said he still couldn't believe that they were robbed despite always being so alert during train travel. ""We boarded the first class coach around 8.30pm on April 4 from Puri, where we went to attend an alumni meet. Our co-passengers - one a fat man and another lean - boarded from Bhubaneswar after 10pm. They had reserved two upper berths. The fat man offered me peda, saying it was prasad. I politely refused, saying I wasn't a believer. He did not insist,"" Verma recalled. The next morning, the same person who introduced himself as Manish from Sahebganj offered peda to Nayan Tara. Embarrassed at Verma's refusal the other night, the warm-hearted lady accepted the prasad. ""I took a bite and made my husband have the rest. He felt drowsy soon thereafter and my co-passengers insisted that I let him sleep. I had tea with them and then fell asleep too. Both of us woke up in our hospital bed,"" said Nayan Tara, a former music teacher of DAV Public School. While Verma lost his pokhraj (yellow sapphire), panna (emerald) and moonga (red coral) rings, his better half was robbed of her gold chain, bangles and earrings, and a diamond ring, among other things. ""The youths were friendly. They even advised me to go to Chandigarh for treatment of my chronic headache. Now, that we have lost valuables worth nearly Rs 8 lakh, I realise we were fooled,"" Nayan Tara said. GRP sub-inspector Somra Lohra and RPF sub-inspector Harishanker Kumar recorded the couple's statements. ""Since the men had reserved tickets, we can locate their addresses easily. Besides, the CCTV cameras from Bhubaneswar will aid investigations,"" Kumar told The Telegraph . Retired colonel R.A. Prasad, a close friend of the Vermas, said railway police should grill the HA-I coach attendant too. ""The attendant left without checking if all passengers had safely got off the train. My friend's driver, Sambhu, followed instructions from his daughter over phone from Bangalore to find them senseless. This is a case of negligence,"" he added."

You can sense the liveliness and excitement in his voice as he tells you on phone that he has finished writing it and is waiting for Anurag (Kashyap) sir  who is busy giving final touches to his own new film Raman Raghav 2.0  to sit with him, go through the final script and give him a decisive go ahead.Zeishan is no less busy himself than his filmi guru. I cant sit still for even five minutes, he tells you. The live wire that he is, the entire interview gets done in ten minutes flat with Zeishan giving out all the information and facts at breakneck speed, our questions acting as small speed-breakers on the rapid ride. He is one of the producers of Omung Kumars Aishwarya Rai-Randeep Hooda starrer Sarbjit which is ready for release on May 20. He is also set to announce a big production soon. Having produced and directed a small film like Meeruthiya Gangsters that suffered at the box office owing to poor promotion, he is intent on producing only biggies now. They help you gain a hold in the business and in the industry, he says.But writing is what makes his world go round. I cant ever stop writing, he says. He is doing a slice of life film for Luv Ranjan ( Pyaar Ka Punchnama 1 and 2) on sports in a small town UP school and a crime thriller for Abhishek Pathak.It was Kashyap who suggested that Zeishan, a Wasseypur boy himself, should direct the third in the Wasseypur series. This was last year in September. He feels that I understand the dark humour and have a way with creating quirky characters, says Zeishan. The first film covered a huge span of time  from the 1940s to 1990s  and second ended in 2009, says Quadri. He has written two versions of the new film and hopes to set it between 1985 and 2000. It will actually be Gangs of Wasseypur 1.5 , he says. There will be no geographical changes. The same homes, families, shot-taking, language and body lingo will be there, he says, The world will be the same, the story will be different and there will be new characters introduced.Rebel with a causeBut isnt it a challenge to take on a film franchisee that is so strongly associated with Kashyap? Isnt he scared of what Kashyap fans will say? According to him you cant satisfy everyone. There were people who disliked the GOWs too. More than scared he is happy about embarking on the project. I like to hold on to positive feelings, he says. Also, the call came from Kashyap himself, someone he couldnt have contested.  Ab agar guru ne kaha hai to naa to nahin kah sakta (If my guru has said so I cant turn it down), he says. Isnt he scared of the expectations knowing the cult success of the film? I am not trying to copy the two films; there is no competition with them so there is no sense of fear either. I will just go ahead and make it. Rest is the fate of the film itself, he says. And what about the inevitable comparisons? I have grown up in Wasseypur where comparisons are an intrinsic part of life  he got Rs 90 lakh in dowry and you only got Rs 85? he guffaws. While his friends excelled in studies he remained a second division pass. I had to be accepted as a rebel eventually, he says. And he wants to be a rebel with a cause in Bollywood too."

The Sri Guru Gobind Singhji Playground in Ameerpet hosted the Vishaal Deewan, a huge gathering attended by more than 5,000 people, from 11 am to 5 pm. Renowned preachers, specially summoned from different parts of the country, recited keerthans and kathas at the event.""Bhai Gurpreet Singhji Khalsa from Shimla, who was specially invited for the event, rendered the keerthans and preached about adopting a few higher values of life. Langar was distributed among those present,"" said Bhagender Singh, former president of Prabhandak Committee Gurudwara Saheb Ameerpet.Members of the Bengali community, meanwhile, busied themselves with preparations for Poila Boishakh, celebrated on April 14. While many have decided to organize family lunches and gatherings at speciality restaurants, members of 'Bengalis in Hyderabad' have organized a one-day trip to a resort on the outskirts of the city. ""More than 100 members have signed up for this trip. We have even roped in a Bengali band to perform in the evening,"" said Rahul Basu, an IT professional.Poila Boishakh is also being eagerly awaited by many businessmen who assert that the day symbolizes the beginning of a 'brand new financial year'. ""The Bengali new year is an important day in terms of business. It marks the beginning of a new financial year and implies that we have to start afresh. Hence, we buy new entry books and also distribute Bengali calenders to all our clients,"" said Devashish Jana, who owns a jewellery store in the Old city and is a member of Hyderabad Bangalee Samity.On the same day, the family of Sanghamitra Bora, a teacher and resident of Mahendra Hills, will kickstart the seven-day Rongali Bihu, celebrated by Assamese community, complete with traditional dishes like Ghila Titha (made with rice and jiggery) and prasadam made with various fruits and black and green gram.

""There was a time when my family could stand and enjoy an uninterrupted view of the city .Thanks to the building that has come up in front of me I can still see my sun set through its skeleton, but there will be a time soon when it will only be a memory ,"" he adds ruefully .Developers of luxury skyscrapers are enticing clients by promising them unobstructed, panoramic views--for which they charge a hefty premium. But in the midst of a construction frenzy with humungous towers springing up on narrow plots, people who pay big bucks for ""sky villas"" and penthouses are beginning to realize that there's nothing like an unhindered view.Ask residents of Lodha Bellissimo, an ultra-luxury tower at Mahalaxmi, who paid a few crores each for the clear view the apartments offered of the 227-acre racecourse and the sea beyond. Soon after they moved in, a builder on the adjoining plot started construction on an 82-storey skyscraper. The new tower, Lokhandwala Minerva, is barely 30m away and has completely blocked not only Bellisimo's racecourse view but also its ventilation.One Bellissimo resident said his family is now forced to switch on the lights even during the day . Another resident said prices in this luxury tower no longer fetch the premium prices they once did. ""The prices are half of that of similar towers in the area,"" he claimed.Urban experts warn that real estate is an ever-shifting advertising game. If an apartment buyer thinks they are entitled to their views for perpetuity, then the sales gimmick has succeeded.Said Gautam Saraf, MD (Mum bai) of global property consultant, Cushman & Wakefield India, ""Many projects, especially in south Mumbai, command a premium on account of scenic views of the sea, race course, clubs, etc. Home buyers of premium and luxury projects also pay floor rise charges to avail such views. It is true that gi ven the scarcity of land in the city , constructions is bound to grow vertically and hence, there is no guarantee of unobstructed view. This would definitely impact the price of the project in the first level sale, and the valuation of the property too during resale.""In Bandra's Pali village, Neil Pereira, who lives in a 150-year-old cottage, has been waging a lone battle against high-rise towers that have been allowed to come a few feet away from his property . ""One of the two buildings have eaten up 15 feet of a public passage. Another one has two illegal floors,"" he alleged. Pereira points out at several other ancient cottages, which have been overshadowed by towers just metres away . ""Our view and ventilation have been obstructed,"" he said. ""But no one cares.""Veteran architect Kamu Iyer said the promises of panoramic views go back to the 1970s, when skyscrapers first started proliferating in Mumbai. ""The panoramic view is that of the next building.Since long, builders have been selling a dream when the reality is so different,"" he said.Iyer blamed the wrong policies of the government, which allow excessive heights of buildings without any relation to the street capacity and overcrowding on the roads.New York-based architect Arzan Sam Wadia said buildings in the heart of downtown New York once had views of the sea and the Jersey shoreline in the distance.""However, in the early 1980s, land was reclaimed and Battery Park City was formed, and all of a sudden residents of Battery Park City had the view,"" he said. The promise of spectacular vis is a ""marketing gimmick"", Wa ews is a ""marketing gimmick"", Wadia added. ""From my experience it originates from the demands of the developer or real-estate sales agents. It is what is referred to by architects as the `money shot'.Whether one actually gets that view is left to conjecture.""""In an urban context, it would be unwise to think that views will be forever,"" he added.Urban critic and New York resident Roberta Brandes Gratz said any new apartment tower has to ""offer more appeal than a good view, which, of course, could be blocked by the next tower"".""New residences need street-level appeal even more: interesting stores, street life and public amenities. But these are the kinds of things being demolished to make way for new towers,"" she said.The same phenomenon is happening in New York, too, Brandes Gratz added. ""Real neighbourhoods, rich street life, local businesses and public amenities are being replaced by repetitive, boring towers."""
58f9f7e9a3d24b0b70c4367e,Inadequate rainfall hits pulses cultivation,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/inadequate-rainfall-hits-pulses-cultivation/article8484888.ece,2016-04-17,"After steady increases in the acreage for the past many years, the pulses cultivation in the district hit a rough trough during the just ended 2015-16 financial year with area coverage down to 18,249 hectares, a reduction of more than 2,000 ha.Collective acreage under different varieties of pulses like black gram, green gram, red gram, horse gram and Bengal gram, in the district stood at 16,419 ha in 2012-13 fiscal, 19,176 ha in 2013-14 fiscal and 20,530 ha in 2014-15 fiscal.National Food Security Missions district consultant K. Mariappan, who is also a retired Deputy Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu the decline in the acreage could be attributed primarily to the non-reception of adequate rain at appropriate time of the season.Sowing in the case of pulses is normally done in June-July period anticipating the commencement of monsoon, as the crop used primarily raised under rain-fed conditions in the district. What happened in 2015-16 was that the district received good rainfall of 153.66 mm in April and 187.3 mm in May.But when needed, i.e., during June and July, the district received only 34.24 mm and 2.07 mm, respectively and this situation forced many farmers to opt out of the crop during the kharif season, he said.Interestingly, the acreage under pulses could have been even worse if the rain did not come in November.Till October 2015, the acreage was just 5,797 hectares.Many of traditional pulses farmers tried their luck once district started receiving good rain towards end of October. As a gift of nature, the district luckily received 215.6 mm rainfall in November which pushed up the acreage to reasonable levels at the end, said agriculture department officials.K. C. M. Balasubramanian, a pulses farmer and also a retired agriculture economist, pointed out that in the case of pulses, any assistances would be useless if it did not rain."
58f9f9f2a3d24b0b70c43764,"The circle of economy, the cycle of drought",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-circle-of-economy-the-cycle-of-drought/article8487445.ece,2016-04-18,"The water train chugged into Latur last week capturing national attention. But it took the spotlight away from the daily struggles of lakhs facing the most immediate consequences of an extended drought and acute water scarcity in Latur district. The vagaries of nature have already taken their toll, the farmer in the hinterland has no way out, and the common man clings to a collapsing water infrastructure in the cramped city space.Nitin Kalantary, CEO, Kalantry Food Products Limited, a leading exporter and supplier of pulses from Latur, says, Scarce water availability has resulted in poor farm yield, low income and diminishing spending power of the farmers. The weddings lack the pomp, while festivities are curtailed both in urban and rural areas. It has never been like this before.Falling outputThe local Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) turnover fell to Rs 905 crore in 2015-16 from Rs 1,460 cr the previous year and Rs 1,875 cr in 2013-14. The drop in the arrival of pigeon pea from 15,000 quintal last year to only 5,000 this year is an indicator of the crashing economy, say experts.Drought and water scarcity is a complex phenomenon.The district administration blames natures vagaries while the oilseed and pulses lobby point fingers at the water-guzzling sugarcane crop. The politicians, of course, blame each other. Geographically, too, the impact of the current crisis varies across regions.Northeastern Maharshtra Jalkot, Ahmedpur, Deoni, Nitur and Udgir  are facing more of a hydrological drought and scarcity as compared to the slightly better off and greener northwestern belt of Renapur, Latur City and Ausa, which are hit by both an agricultural and meteorological drought. But they are also home to three powerful sugar factories and major sources of water, including the Manjara dam, and the Bhandarwadi barrage among others.Sugarcane to blame?The western belt grew around the big three: Manjara, Raina and Vikas sugar factories; the banks too belong to the same politicians. The cyclical economy was complete once they got better access to water from the barrages. It is this economy that is facing the prospect of a collapse, says Sudhir Mane of NAAM foundation started by actor Nana Patekar which offers funds as drought relief for farmers.The ground water level at Jalkot has gone down to an alarming 4.7 metres; at Ahmedpur it is touching 4.38m and at Deoni it is 4.08m. According to guidelines of the Ground Water Act, levels below 1 metre are termed manageable scarcity, those below 2 metres as critical and below 3 metres are declared alarming. The district hit the danger mark in October with an average fall of 3.53 metre across the ten talukas.In contrast, the East has fewer barrages and dams; existing ones have gone bone dry because of three years of deficient monsoon. At the 33 small water projects at Ahmedpur, having a capacity of 14.4 mcm (million cubic metre), the current water availability is zero. In the 10 water projects, with a capacity of 25.26 mcm at Jalkot, every single drop has disappeared. Ironically, the belt falls in the assured rainfall zone with an expected 700 mm to 800 mm of monsoon as compared to prosperous western sugar belt which is a declared drought prone areas programme (DPAP) Rainfall Zone with less than 500 mm of average rainfall.The east was never meant for development as water here doesnt flow with gravity; [the area] being on an elevation, the soil is somehow less fertile than the west. Water used for sugarcane as opposed to the perception of being wasted, always percolated back into the soil in the western belt, says Vaijnathrao Shinde, former Congress legislator from Latur Rural and director of Vikas Cooperative Sugar Factory near Niwali in the western belt.The shifting rainfall pattern is the biggest cause of crop failure, which has hit both kharif and rabi sowing this year. For example, the average July rainfall in 2013 and a year before was 331.54 mm but in 2015 it was just 31.7 mm in Latur. The number of rain days in a year is now reduced to 36 in Latur and 37 in Beed, leading to reduction in rain precipitation and hence, poor ground water availability. The rainfall deficit in the district has been 50.12 per cent in 2014, and 47.94 per cent in 2015.For four years (2009-2013) I grew sugarcane but with falling market prices and changing rain pattern I chose soyabean after taking a loan of Rs 40,000. But that crop failed, I had to sell three of my seven cattle to repay the loan. The vicious cycle never ends, says Dayanand Ashokrao, 26, who has a four acre farm near the Raina sugar factory.There was no rain in June in the region, some in July and in most parts concentrated around August, and back again in October with devastating hailstorms in February. This mean it becomes challenging for a farmer to opt for pulses (pigeon-pea, urad and moong) and easier to go for oilseeds (soyabean). With only 1.72 per cent water remaining in 141 small and big sources of water, the district officials estimate failure of in excess of 70 per cent of the kharif crop.As many as 125 farmers suicides were reported from Latur district till July 2015."
58f4c07460de4776e369496f,Costly pulses hit domestic budget,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160419/jsp/odisha/story_80836.jsp,2016-04-19,"POCKET PINCH Cuttack, April 18: Dal is missing from the menu of several households as the prices of pulses have gone up in the past week across the state. Primarily, the high cost of pulses in Maharastra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka - from where the state procures dal - is responsible for the price hike. Besides, the state government's norms - fixing the limit of stocking pulse - have also added to the consumers' woes. The retail prices of pulses have registered a hike varying from Rs 5 to Rs 15 per kilogram. At present, arhar dal is being sold at Rs 148 to Rs 150 per kg at the retail markets. The rate of chana dal has also gone up to Rs 80 to Rs 82 per kg against the retail price of Rs 73 to Rs 78 last week. There has been no change in the retail price of moong dal, which is being sold at Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. But, the prices of biri dal have gone to Rs 145 per kg from Rs 120 and the rate of masoor dal stands at Rs 85 per kg while it was being sold at Rs 75 at the retail markets last week. Harapriya Samal, a working woman from Jhanjirmangala, said: ""Rice is our staple diet, and our meal is incomplete without dal. So, we are now forced to buy dal at such high rates,"" said Samal. Malgodown traders, however, put the blame on bulk procurement by several multi-national companies, who are now procuring pulses from the farmers. The state requires seven lakh metric tonnes of pulses per annum, while only 80,000 tonnes to one lakh metric tonnes are produced here. A Cuttack Chamber of Commerce official said the pulses' prices were expected to rise due to the existing curb on stocking pulses. At present, a trader is only allowed to stock 750 quintals of pulses according to the government norms. ""If the stock limit is raised, then only the prices of pulses can be kept under control at least for a month despite the high procurement rate as there will be adequate stock to meet the requirement,"" said the official. ""Various big companies are now directly procuring essential commodities from farmers, and as the prices of pulses are high at the point of purchase, there has been a gap in the supply which has pushed the prices,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafula Chatoi, who said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an increase in the stock limit for traders to 5,000 quintals. On the other hand, Cuttack collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra convened an emergency meeting to review the situation here today, and the Malgodown traders were asked to report the wholesale and retail prices on a daily basis. ""There is an adequate stock at Malgodown. We also urge the consumers not to resort to panic buying as the wholesale prices at Malgodown have been stable for the past two to three days,"" said the collector."

In Lalitpur, maximum temperature has already shot past 44 degree Celsius. The month of 'Jyeshta', falling in June when summer peaks, is two months away, but hand pumps and bore wells are running dry and muddy beds of parched lakes have caked and have large craters.In terms of agriculture too, the past two years have been disastrous for Bundelkhand in general and Lalitpur in particular. Lalitpur farmers chiefly grow wheat, beside moong and urad daals. In Pali, another rocky interior of the Lalitpur district, farmer Shambhu said, ""Of the three quintals wheat I had sown, I could recover only one-and-half quintal worth of seeds. There was no water to irrigate our land."" Shambhu is not alone. Sundar, another farmer in Pali has left the dried stubs of wheat on his few acres. At a time farmers should be tilling the ground and prepapring for the next crop, his land, like several acres surrounding it, lie unattended. ""There is no point in tilling the land. There is no water. I don't have resources to get a tubewell bored so I have decided not to sow anything,"" said Sundar.For the uninitiated, Lalitpur often presents a confusing picture. Flanked on the east, west and south by Madhya Pradesh, this backward district of Bundelkhand has 12 dams, including the towering Govind Sagar, Mata Tila and Rajghat dams and the smaller Sajnam, Jamini and Lower Rohini. If you drive into Lalitpur from Jhansi, it's not uncommon to spot large pools of water, sparkling in the April sun. The pools of water may exist, but for the largely rural population, it's a mirage.Uttar Pradesh's irrigation department, the key agency that controls construction and maintenance of these dams, faces an uphill challenge. ""Lalitpur's chief problem is that the terrain is rocky so bore wells are expensive to dig, while the stony earth does not throw up enough water over a sustained period. Also, rivers in the region are rain-fed and it is difficult to store water and ensure its optimum usage. Finally-and this concerns all of Bundelkhand and UP-while we assess the rate at which we withdraw ground water, its depletion is a subject that does not get the attention it deserves,"" said Akhtar Ali Farooqi, executive committee member of the UP Engineers Association. Despair hangs like a thick layer on Lalitpur. In Balabehat, locals turn to 'Sankat Mochan' Hanuman, their reigning deity for deliverance from danger. Local resident Jagdish Rai claims a new statue of Hanuman springs from the earth every time UP gets a new district. Despite 75 statues of Sankat Mochan in their midst, Balabehat's prayers are falling on deaf ears.In Pali, after months of pleading with the local administration to supply water, the paan growers have now pooled in resources to build a temple dedicated to the serpent god. A woman from the resident community Krishna Chaurasia said, ""Our appeal to the government and administration has got us nothing. 'Naag devta' is our last hope so we are building a temple dedicated to the deity.""Abject poverty, low and poor crop yield, depleting ground water levels, and joblessness have also caused the crime rate to shoot up in the region. Unemployed youth are resorting to petty thefts and looting passersby to make ends meet. Now, even hope is drying on the parched lands of Bundelkhand."

Wholesale and retail prices have shot up simultaneously. Prices of pulses, which have been rising since a year, still continue to move in the upward direction, hitting the common man's budget hard.While the prices of arhar and masoor dal have gone up to Rs 160 per kg from Rs 110 a month ago, chana dal which was Rs 70 per kg a month ago now costs Rs 130 per kg. Similar spurt in prices has been witnessed in the cost of moong and urad dal.However, according to city-based retailers, the hike is a temporary phase and the prices will go down within a week or two. Though there has been an abrupt hike in prices, it is temporary. ""The price of pulses are usually stable in nature and the recent hike in price is mainly due to shortage of dal production and also because of bulk buyers who create a shortage in the wholesale stock. It is demand like these that attribute to rise in lentil prices,"" a retailer Rajkumar Verma said.He further said that sugar prices are also on the rise and have shot up by Rs. 3-5 per kg. ""It is not just the spiraling price of pulses but even the sugar price has shot up by Rs. 3-5 per kg"", said Verma.Another retailer-cum-wholesaler at Khojwa area, Prince Kumar, attributed the price situation to drought destroying large portion of pulse crops thus, flaring up the prices. Arhar dal has seen the most dramatic increase among staples with the wholesale price recording a rise of 25% in a month.Meanwhile, denizens have started to cut down on the consumption of pulses and are opting for cheaper lentils. ""We were not expecting hike in prices of pulses anymore after suffering in October last year. Although the prices have not shot up as compared to previous year, yet if the trend continues it will soon have to be replaced with other alternatives so that my family gets required amount of protein, said Riddhi Sinha, a housewife."

Odisha is home to some 62 different tribes speaking hundreds of tribal languages.

In contrast, last year green gram was cultivated in 800 hectares of land that too by April-end and May-first week. This time, farmers have postponed their plans in the absence of summer showers.The district usually sees cultivation of pulses, especially green gram, across 150 to 200 hectares of land when it receives 130mm to 140mm summer showers spread over March, April and May. On an annual basis, pulses are cultivated across 11,000 acres in the district. However, when the district received almost 260mm of rain last year, the green gram cultivation acreage rose by four times to 800 hectares.""Usually, farmers in Annur, Karamadai and Sarkar Samakulam start cultivating green gram soon after the first summer showers. This time around, the acreage under summer cultivation is abysmally low, as the district didn't get summer rain,"" said a senior agriculture officer.""Even farms with good drip irrigation facilities are not taking up any new cultivation and they are only using it to maintain paddy, sugarcane, banana and cotton plantations,"" the official said, adding, ""We will consolidate the acreage of land under cultivation only by mid-May.""Farmers said they would wait till southwest monsoon to start any cultivation. ""This summer is the worst we have seen in almost four to five years,"" said the president of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, A Kandasamy.""So, many farmers are afraid of using irrigation facilities to sow seeds, because they are scared they will dry up.

But positive forecast of a very good monsoon of around 106% this year has worked like a balm, soothing the nerves of the government as well as cultivators alike.The Devendra Fadnavis government is focusing on increasing farm output by better planning, concerted efforts to harness low-cost technology, soil health cards, new crop insurance scheme, and spreading coverage of institutional funding. To make this possible, the kharif planning, normally done by May-end, has been advanced by a month.Fadnavis has convened the kharif meeting in Mumbai on April 28, where the statewide plans will be finalized. Before that, each district is expected to complete its plan at meetings chaired by respective guardian ministers. Nagpur guardian minister Chandrashekar Bawankule will preside over the district kharif meet on Monday in the city, which will be attended by MLAs and agriculture as well as credit agency officials.""With indications of good monsoon this year, advance plans will help deal with farmers problems so that they gear up for higher yields, especially of pulses and oil seeds,"" said Amravati division joint director of agriculture S Sardar. His Nagpur division counterpart Vijay Ghavate also agreed that advancing the planning will give a distinct advantage to all stakeholders.Kharif is the main crop season with sowing in over 144 lakh hectares. Of this, more than one-third or roughly 50 lakh ha is in Vidarbha region, which depends heavily on the monsoon. Cotton is grown in around 40 lakh ha, soyabean in 41 lakh ha, paddy in 15 lakh ha, tur in 11 lakh ha, urad and moong in 4.5 lakh ha each. Farmers will be encouraged to increase coverage of tur and other pulses in districts like Akola of western Vidarbha.New measures like Jal Yukt Shivar water conservation projects across the state, soil health cards, stress on passing benefits of low-cost technology, increasing quantum of agriculture loans, and restructuring old dues of drought-hit farmers are some issues on which Fadnavis has already devoted a lot of time in official meetings. The last cabinet meeting also decided to make full use of PM crop insurance scheme, so that farmers get adequately compensated for losses at very low premiums of around 2%.Officials said that crop loan distribution would be better this time, with some ailing district cooperative banks given a bailout package. The fertilizer supply may be adequate but seeds availability could be a problem since sowing area will increase on expectations of timely and good rains."

Till now total imports and domestic procurement of pulses have increased by around 1.6 million tonnes.Pulses price on rising trend again, arhar cost up by 45% The price of dal', especially arhar' has started showing an upward trend yet again.In a span of just a fortnight, there has been a spike of over 45% in the price of pulses like arhar, masoor and chana. Wholesale and retail prices have shot up simultaneously.Like the Terminator, high prices of pulses are back. And production data shows that there is not much hope for any respite. Overall, production is estimated to increase by just 1%, as the second consecutive drought year takes its toll. Tur or arhar (pigeon pea), one of the most popular dals, has taken a hit with its production dipping by 9% from last year, and by 20% over 2014-15. Other pulses too are expected to see decline in production, bringing the total pulse production down by 12% compared to the non-drought year of 2013-14. This is ironic because 2016 has been declared the International Year of Pulses by the United Nations.The government seems to be more alert this time compared to last year, having imported about 5.1 million tonnes of pulses till January this year compared to 4.1 million tonnes last year. But international markets are equally on the ball. Canada and Australia had both planted increased acreage of pulses, expecting good prices. Last year, India had imported 1.5 million tonnes of pulses from Canada, nearly 30% of its total production. This year, Canadian farmers planted 5.1 million acres of lentils, up by 30% from last year, and 4.3 million acres of peas, a rise of 16 % according to data from Statistics Canada. This is because corn and wheat prices are running low and Canadian farmers are looking for better bucks from India.Australian farmers have sown a record 5,64,000 hectares of pulses in 2015, mainly chickpea (chana), but production is only slightly better than 2014 due to adverse weather in some parts. By November, some 3 million tonnes of lentil will be ready in Australia, according to Pulse Australia. Trade experts say that good crops are also in the offing from neighbour Myanmar and from African nations like Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Malawi.But there's a rub. Canadian stocks are already sold out, as are Australian chickpea crops. International trade experts say that African output will become available in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the deficient monsoon that affected crops in India has also severely brought down pulses production in Pakistan, another big consumer.In other words, the international demand is going to be very high even as stocks are limited and fast running out. This means high prices for import into India under constrained conditions.Currently, international prices of lentil (Rs 51 per kg), tur (Rs 80 per kg) and chana (Rs 45 per kg) are lower than domestic prices in India. But given the tight global supply position this spread may vanish in the coming months, spurred by increasing import orders from India and Pakistan. Global prices of moong (Rs 75 per kg) and urad (Rs 105 per kg) are already higher than the Indian domestic prices.The government will have to not only ensure quick buying in international markets but also streamline offtake from ports where last year huge stocks were held up causing prices to rise in the markets.But all this is firefighting. Unless production of pulses is boosted through better seeds, better support prices, and procurement the aam aadmi will have to continue suffering protein pangs."

The Cabinet approved a Rs 5,000-crore loan restructuring plan for farmers whose kharif crops were ravaged by drought in 2015-16.In what is being seen as an attempt to blunt the Oppositions plan of projecting unrest among certain sections as signs of the governments dipping popularity, the ruling BJP in Maharashtra unveiled several populist measures on Wednesday.Reaching out to the middle class, the Cabinet adopted a draft legislation aimed at regulating and capping prices of pulses, which have witnessed a spike in recent days. Further, with the Opposition targeting it over its failure to rein in farm distress triggered by drought, the government doled out fresh sops for the farm sector.The Cabinet approved a Rs 5,000-crore loan restructuring plan for farmers whose kharif crops were ravaged by drought in 2015-16.Cooperatives Minister Chandrakant Patil said that 48.41 lakh farmers had availed loans totalling Rs 29,680 crore from lending institutions for kharif cultivation in 15-16.It has now been found that farmers in 27,609 drought-hit villages have run into loan arrears worth Rs 5,000 crore. These farmers would not have been eligible for availing a new loan in 16-17 unless the arrears were paid off. So the Cabinet decided to restructure the repayment schedule for these loans, which will now be spread over five years. The state will bear the whole interest amount due in the first year for such loans, whereas for the remaining four years, 50 per cent of the interest will be paid by the state, Patil said.Simultaneously, the government also advanced loan repayment schedule for the Rs 3,503-crore loans availed by 5.33 lakh farmers in 2014-15, which were similarly reconstructed last year. Despite the states tight financial position, the government has also decided to approach the Reserve Bank of India to restructure loans worth Rs 2,439 crore, availed by farmers in 2012-13 and 2014-15.Meanwhile, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Girish Bapat claimed that Maharashtra was the countrys first state to adopt a price control mechanism for pulses. Following the Cabinet nod, Bapat said the draft legislation would be sent to the Centre for Presidential assent.Once the assent comes, a notification for its implementation would be brought out. Rules of business will be readied before that, he said.The Devendra Fadnavis government had come under criticism when tur dal prices shot up to Rs 200 per kg last October. With drought adversely impacting production of pulses this year too, there has been a hike in retail tur dal prices recently.Bapat said the draft legislation would apply to the sale of tur dal, black gram, green gram, lentils, beans, etc,across the state. But the capping rate would vary for different areas, since transportation costs and local factors would have to be taken into account, he said.Bapat also said the cap will be different for producers of pulses and for those involved in its trade.The government would fix the prices taking into account the availability of pulses, demand and supply, among other factors, he said. Rates once fixed will be applicable for a maximum of six months. To control an artificial spike in prices, the draft legislation makes it mandatory for producers and dealers to record sale by providing authentic receipts to the buyers.Bapat also said that the government was mulling a plan of asking producers and traders to display the maximum retail price on the sale product itself, but said this was challenging as dal was often sold loose. Provisions of penalising and imprisonment of up to one year for those violating norms have been made, Bapat said.Senior government sources, however, conceded that till the Act is implemented, the government will have to rely on inspection drives to check hoarding and improve supplies as its main tool to control prices. Instructions have been issued to district collectorates and the District Supply Officers (DSOs) to be vigilant and check hoarding of pulses, a senior official said. Stocking limits imposed for tur dal by the Centre are in force till September 30, 2016. Bapat also informed that discussion was on in the state and the Centre over the feasibility of announcing fixed remunerative prices for tur dal.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government has written to the Centre for allotment of 2.12 lakh quintal of tur dal purchased by the Food Corporation of India and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Fedration of India Limited from farmers in Maharashtra for buffer stock.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

The incentive will also be over and above the one-time bonus of Rs. 75/quintal already granted for chana (gram) and masur (lentil) last Rabi season, officials said.The proposal to grant additional incentives from the States side has been prepared by the Agriculture Department, which is now seeking to answer questions raised over growth of water-intensive crops in drought-hit regions like Marathwada, where some experts have pointed out excess consumption of water, attributing to crops like sugarcane, banana, grapes and oranges, which are mostly groundwater dependent.Senior officials said the decision taken will give a strong price signal to farmers to increase acreage and invest in improving production of pulses. It was about time we took a strong stand from our side to send a message to farmer to increase acreage in other crops and not only sugarcane. Merely telling him not to grow any particular crop does not make much sense anyway, said a senior official.The Centres current minimum support price (MSP) for tur (pigeon peas), urad (black gram whole), moong (green gram), masur (lentil), currently stands at Rs. 4,625/ quintal, Rs. 4,625/ quintal, Rs. 4,850/ quintal and Rs. 3,425/ quintal.However, experts said the State intervention is too little too late. With market prices for pulses hovering two times the MSP  tur trading over Rs. 10,000 and Urad around Rs. 15,000  increasing the MSP or even adding an incentive over and above that will not serve as a motivating factor for the farmers, experts said.The governments intentions are good, but even if assuming that the Centre increases the MSP next season by say 10% and we add another 10% incentive of the State, it will still be way below the market price to influence the planting decisions of the farmer in October when he actually takes a call on what to sow, said Nitin Kalantari, of Kalantari Foods Ltd, a prominent trader in the State.Some others pointed out that procurement must continue even as the government was looking at bonuses and incentivising the use of pulses.At most times, the State machinery does not procure even when prices hit below or around MSP, We have to petition the local collector to start procurement but the implementation of the MSP is poor in the districts, said Lalit Shah, of the APMC, Latur."

I was completely in awe of her. She is a huge star, but at the same time very jolly, nice and humble. She used to talk about her baby and made sure everybody was comfortable on the sets,"" the actor told .Ankur, who resides in New York, began his career in 2010 in Payal Sethi's ""Grant St Shaving Co"", which was produced by filmmaker Mira Nair.He then went on to work in a negative role in Apurva Lakhia's ""Zanjeer"", which also starred Sanjay Dutt and Priyanka Chopra.For his role in ""Sarbjit"", the actor had to undergo several rounds of audition and grow his beard to look like a sardar.""I had actually auditioned for a film called 'Mehrunnisa' which was being directed by Sudhir Mishra. That film never got made. Later, I was asked to record some scenes of 'Sarbjit' and send it to the casting directors before I finally went to Omung Kumar's office and gave the audition.""Ankur says the role was ""demanding"" as he had to portray the conflict of a character, whose age group he did not identify with.""Baldev is a man who loves his wife very much, but also feels he doesn't get that much of attention as his wife is constantly into the mission of rescuing her brother. It was very necessary for the conflict to come out...,"" he said.""At times it was challenging because the character starts out as young and transitions into old. I did not belong to the age group, but had to keep myself in the zone of an uptight man which I am not in real life,"" the actor said.""Sarbjit"" will release on May 20. JUR GK PSH"

Express Photo by Kamleshwar Singh Director Omung Kumar with Richa Chadha and other cast of the film Sarabjit during interaction with media in a hotel in Industiral Area Phase 1 Chandigarh on Tuesday, May 03 2016. Express Photo by Kamleshwar SinghFor four years, Sarabjit Singhs story passed from one filmmaker to another till it landed on Omung Kumars desk. At first, he said no. His film Mary Kom had just happened, and he was in no mood to attempt another biopic. But one woman fighting for justice and her brothers life for 23 years  Dalbir Kaur  changed it all.I decided to dig a little more into the story, and when I came across Dalbir Kaurs videos on YouTube, I was stunned. Watching this fearless woman wage a battle against the world to bring back her brother from Pakistan jails moved me to tears, and I knew I had to tell this story, says Omung.In town with producer Jackky Bhagnani, actors Richa Chadha and Darshan Kumaar, Omung shares the reason for following the 23-year-old journey of a sister, a wife, a family in the hope of seeing Sarbjit free and alive.If we can rescue one innocent person or help one family through this film, our work will be done, says Omung. Bhagnani, who is debuting as a producer with this film, adds that they are in the process of setting up a foundation to help such families.A filmmaker who worships the details, plays on the visual narrative and develops his actors as characters, Omungs first challenge after finalising the script was casting. While Randeep Hooda was his first choice to essay the role of Sarbjit, to do justice to Dalbir Kaur, he asked Aishwarya Rai Bachchan. Dalbir Kaur is a force to be reckoned with. She refused to back down. She could walk up to any leader, into any office and demand her right. She grabbed attention and we needed someone like that  Aishwarya is one such personality, says Omung.As for Randeep Hooda, even Dalbir had him on her mind to bring her brother alive on screen. Randeep is a phenomenal actor. He happened to be the obvious choice of Dalbir as well. Randeep was game to change the look and get under the skin of the character, and I feel no one else couldve pulled it off, says Omung.Why he chose stars like Aishwarya is a question Omung gets quite often. They asked me when I chose Priyanka Chopra for Mary Kom. I focus on the character, not the actor. I am more interested in the journey and their transformation and mould them accordingly, says Omung.It was a challenging film for no one had met Sarbjit. It was through the family, letters, books, archival material, media that the story took shape. For instance, Darshan Kumar, who is essaying the role of Pakistani lawyer Awaiz Sheikh, referred to Sheikhs book Sarbjit  A Case of Mistaken Identity. There was also just one iconic picture of Sarbjit as a visual referral.Staying true to the facts was paramount too.One does take cinematic liberties for instance, he loved singing Rajesh Khanna songs to his wife. We created scenes from the jail, showing cyncial, ligther, shades of him. Songs act as connecting points too threading that narrative across 23 years, but never once did we deviate from the truth. There is, however, hope and realisation in the end, says Omung.While there are rumours and controversies on Sarbjits real identity, his sisters fallout with the family etc, Richa Chadha, who plays Sarbjits wife Sukhpreet, reasons otherwise. There can be multiple theories about Sarbjit, but this is a film that highlights human casualty. No one deserves to die like this and violence only destroys families, says Chadha, who has also produced a short Punjabi film Khoon Wali Chhitti. She will be seen in another biopic, Cabaret, and deliver a TED (technology, entertainment, design) talk  an annual international conference where prominent people share their opinions/journeys  this May 18. Close on the heels is Sarbjits release on May 20; they are hoping to release the movie in Pakistan too.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

There was no rain though in many parts of the district it was overcast, particularly during the evenings. Farmers of Mysuru, Chamarajanagar and surrounding places normally experience pre-monsoon showers from the second week of April to the second week of May.But this year, the rain failed and the hopes of farmers to grow jowar, maize, sunflower, green gram, cowpea have been dashed.Normal rain during April in Mysuru is 61.9 mm while this year it was just 15 mm.

But, this year, the total scenario has changed, due to the delay in pre-monsoon showers.This has left the farmers worried. However, their hopes are kept alive as the officials of the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) have predicted good rains in a few days.Speaking to Deccan Herald, a farmer said that the pre-monsoon showers were necessary to sustain standing crops. As there is a delay in pre-monsoon rains this year, we may lose the yield. Every year, the district receives good rains in the months of April and May, facilitating agricultural activities. But, this year, there have been only sparse rains so far, he lamented.According to statistics, the district should have received 46.4 mm of rains in April with an average of 49.7 mm of rains. In 2015, there was 54.7 mm of rains, while it is only 11.4 mm this year. The situation is similar in all the taluks of the district.In the month of May, the average expected rains is 118.7 mm. It was 119.4 mm in 2014 and 156.8 mm in 2015. But, it is only 1.5 mm in 2016 till May 5, which has upset farmers.Crop lossPre-monsoon rains are essential to save sugar cane, coconut and mulberry crops. Sugar cane has already started withering in some villages. In all, sugar cane has been cultivated on 35,000 hectares, coconut on 45,000 hectares, mulberry on 5,000 hectares. The yields are expected to come down, if the rains fail.If there was timely rains in April, the farmers would have sown black-eyed peas (alsande kalu), green gram, sesame and black gram. Now, the sowing activities has been delayed and farmers are anticipating rains to begin sowing.KRS damWater is released into canals only if there was sufficient water in the Krishnaraja Sagar (KRS) dam. But, with the water level depleting to 80 ft, it is not possible to release water into canals. With the temperature rising at alarming levels, borewells too are drying up, leaving the farmers in a tricky position."

However, there is sufficient stock of other foodgrains, he added.To check the price rise, Gowda said that Karnataka had sought the Centres intervention. The state has sought a share in the pulses imported by the Centre, he said.Seed shortageWith sowing season fast approaching, Karnataka is finding it difficult to procure seeds to be distributed to farmers.Karnatakas seed requirement this year was 6.45 lakh quintals, while last year it was only 4.29 lakh quintal. However seed companies, including state-owned seed corporations, were trying to cash in on the departments predicament.This year, the seed requirement is high. Sensing this, seed companies, including the Karnataka Seeds Corporation, National Seeds Corporation and Oilseeds Growers Federation, are all quoting higher rates. The department is into hard bargaining, he said.He said disbursement of input subsidy to farmers who have incurred crop loss was delayed as the department was in the process of introducing Real Time Gross Settlement Systems (RTGS), which facilitates immediate transfer of money from one bank to another.Production targetFoodgrain production target for 2016-17: 135 lakh tonnesProduction in 2014-15: 126 lakh tonnesProduction in 2015-16: 110 lakh tonnesProjection for current year: Improved production as good rains are expected"

Its nawabi heritage is evident even today in its exquisite Awadhi cuisinea unique refinement of Mughlai culinary traditions that is characterised by complex techniques and an amazing depth of tastes. Indeed, the food culture of Lucknow is the product of both science and art, passion and centuries-old kitchen secrets. It plays with your palate, tricks your gastronomic senses, and leaves you hungry for more.From the melt-in-your-mouth tunday kebabs to the lip-smacking Awadhibiryani locally called pulaothe food in Lucknow truly leaves you spellbound. On a recent trip to the city, the first thing we noticed is how much time the locals devote to food. From morning to late at night, Lucknowallahs are either eating or discussing what to eat next. And given the range of options available who can blame them.Everyone in Lucknow has an opinion about the best korma, the best chaat, or the best kulfi. They seriously know their food and could easily be described as some of the most knowledgeable food connoisseurs in the world. And these food connoisseurs strongly recommended that we try the food at Idriss in the Chowk area of the city.So off we went hunting for Idriss and its legendary biryani. And after reaching our destination we were assaulted by a range of emotions. For we found ourselves at a grimy hole-in-the-wall that barely had space for two wooden tables. Yet, the aroma of food being cooked in pots over coal fire prevented us from making a hasty retreat.As soon as our hosts got to know that we had come all the way from Delhi to sample their food, they took it as a matter of honour to overwhelm us with their culinary delights. Out came the most flavourful, succulent mutton korma that I had ever tastedonly comparison could be made to my mothers korma and thats saying something. Then came a delectable mutton stew. But what really bowled us over was the Idriss special daal. I never knew that ordinary moong daal could taste so extraordinary.But we had missed out on the biryani because it was still being prepared. We were told to come back in the eveningan invitation we simply couldnt resist. So as we returned to Idriss in the evening, we saw the place full of people from all walks of life. Some were sitting and eating, some were waiting their turn, some were ordering takeaway. And as we dug into our mutton biryani/pulao our palates began dancing with joy.But the real revelation came to me when I looked around at all the happy people enjoying their food. And I realised that in Lucknow food is a great leveller. You could be a rickshaw puller or a wealthy businessman, but all come to Idriss to satisfy their gastronomic senses. And that is the true greatness of Lucknows food culture that transcends class, caste and religious barriers. Heres to Lucknow and the love of food."

They'll go to any lengths for their kids.Munna Gupta's amma was no different. About 30 years ago, when Gupta opened a shop selling moong pakodas, Chandravatidevi Gupta would toil over a heavy stone grinder every day, making a paste of several kilos of soaked lentils that would be fried to make the snack.Amma's recipe was, as mothers' recipes are wont to be, very good. It made Gupta's shop in Sitabuldi so famous, he named it 'Pakodewala.' The shop also sells the usual sinful suspects such as samosa, kachori, bread pakoda and aloo bonda (the last one, also Chandravatidevi's recipe), none of them using any onion or garlic. But it is the moong pakoda that is easily its biggest draw.""When the grinding became too much for amma,"" Gupta says, ""I decided to give her a break. I chanced upon an electric grinder that was used to make dosa batter. I tried using it for the moong dal and, fortunately, it worked,"" he says, adding that it was only after this that he could scale up operations.Gupta goes through 20kg of split moong dal (the green one, with the husk still on) for the savoury fritters every day. Crisp on the outside, they have a spongy texture inside to soak up the mini pool of two chutneys, one with tamarind and green chilli for tang and spice, and another with yoghurt to balance the heat.""Many people ask us what we put in the pakoda to make them so crisp. They wonder if we add bread crumbs. But we don't add anything to the moong dal paste, apart from salt,"" Gupta says. The taste, he insists, is due to the 'grace of god' and blessings from his mother, who passed away in 2002.The dal, he says, is soaked for four hours. This is followed by the lengthy grinding process to get plenty of air into the batter so that it becomes very light. The paste-like batter is then scooped by hand and dropped into uniform chunks into the hot oil. The trained hands make the process look much easier, and safer, than it actually is.And here's another secret: The pakodas are fried once until they are cooked halfway through, rested for some time and then fried on high heat for a second time. Side note: This trick is used to make a lot of deep fried dishes, such as french fries, crispier.""I used to make the pakodas with great speed but had to stop recently due to health reasons,"" says the 55-year-old Gupta, who belongs to the third generation of his family selling eatables. His grandfather, who migrated here from Benaras, and father ran a sweets shop on Sitabuldi Main Road. It was Munna's eldest brother Vijay, along with three other brothers and some cousins, who introduced savoury snacks to the menu.Gupta says rainy season is when demand for the pakodas becomes almost unmanageable. ""Most Buldi shop owners buy snacks from our shop. Nitin Gadkariji loves our moong pakodas and aloo bondas. He eats here and takes a parcel for home, too,"" Gupta beams.Somewhere, amma must be smiling, too."

While the rates of chana dal, masoor dal, black masoor and brown vatana have increased by 10; prices of moong, kabuli chana, black chana, tur dal, big toor dal have shot up by 20, while urad dal has shown the most drastic gain of 40 per kg.Sifting through udat dal contemplating, whether to make the purchase or not, Rajani Desai, said, ""When chicken and vegetables become expensive, people opt for pulses but with pulses also being expensive what is the aam aadmi to eat?""The steep rise in prices of pulses in the state has been attributed to the weather conditions in Maharashtra. ""Drought-hit Maharastra has led to an overall poor produce leading to exorbitant rates of pulses. For the past one week, even the prices in Goa have been high,"" said vendor Gunaji Dhulapkar.The Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2015-16 has reportedly indicated that the production of cereals is projected to fall 41%, and pulses 11%, as agricultural growth in Maharashtra declined by 2.7% for the year 2015-16.""Since most of these legumes have to be brought from Maharashtra, Goa's dependency on the drought-hit state will affect our business badly this year,"" said another vendor Aarti Amonkar.While businesspersons in the local market are putting on a brave face for now, they feel sceptical of the scenario as the month of Shravan, a time when these pulses are most in demand, is fast-approaching.""We will definitely feel the hit once Shravan commences, especially for toor dal which is sourced from the Latur district in Maharashtra,"" said vendor Nitin Mandrekar.He further added that besides various pulse crops being affected, even sugarcane crops were a disappointment as a result of which there will likely be a crunch for sugar as well."

She immediately held up her right hand and showed me the victory sign, the two leaves symbol of J Jayalalithaas All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) Party. I burst out laughing. Though I hadnt meant it as a tribute to Amma Jayalalithaa, I went along and we began chitchatting about Ammas prospects in the forthcoming elections here.Yengal votu Amma-vuke! Again, the woman held up her hand with the victory sign. Ok, ok, sure, lets vote for Amma, I said. So has she ever come here to meet you all, I ask of the Amma devotee. Well, MGR would come and he had no security, nothing. He addressed us in the large maidan and you should have seen how much love we showered on him, she informs me. So why doesnt Amma come here, I persist. Is it because she does not keep good health?Oh no, the corner-store-woman says. Amma is perfectly fine, Its just that she drives through Kodaikanal, she does not stop because of fear of any kind of  Did she mean there is a security issue? Well, no, she says. It is just that Amma has so many rivals.She went on to heap praise on Ammas welfare schemes as she handed me the milk packet Id come to get. I wave her goodbye and walk towards the lake that looks beautiful  serene and calm  as always. Sundays are a nightmare, though, in Kodaikanal, because of the rush of weekend holidaymakers who crowd the arterial lake road for horse rides, food stalls, coffee outlets and roasted corn. When I come to the part where there is a bridge I look toward the lake to find that two boats have been tied together to hold a huge hoarding that advises residents of Kodaikanal to be responsible citizens  to vote on the designated day. The boats are quarter-filled with water and I get that sinking feeling that perhaps the hoardings will disappear before May 16 when polling is due.Flooded now by memories of a childhood when summer holidays were spent in Kodaikanal, I remember that the profile of visitors here was so different then from what it is now. The profile of politicians and parties, too, have changed, definitely. For better or worse? That I cannot be the judge of  its just that times are changing, people change, priorities change, so everythings different. Half the trees are gone, like have scruples. New buildings, whether homes or commercial establishments, sorely lack aesthetics, sticking out like sore thumbs in what was once described as the princess of hill stations.If you are running away from urban concrete jungles to enjoy the rock clad structures, you will be sorely disappointed for cemented surfaces here are as ubiquitous as in cities. Yet, the princess (Kodai) hasnt lost her charm yet  the Bombay Shola Forests are now protected, and wild bison roam freely there as do Asian squirrels, birds and other chota-mota animals.Perhaps something can be done to save the road going around the lake from vendors and merchants, who attract tourists who litter the place with plastic and other trash. Yes, there are trash cans at frequent intervals but much too small and some too out of shape to hold the humungous amount of garbage being generated. The shops could be moved a bit away from the lake area . And instead, the municipality could create nice relaxation zones with seating arrangements so that one can sit and stretch ones legs between trekking around the lake  I must ask the corner-store-woman to send a prayer to Amma with this request."

The decision is to minimise the losses incurred by farmers in investments made in agriculture sector, specially in the 14 drought-hit districts of the state.The state government has sought the services of agriculture universities to provide expertise on crop patterns with a definite timeline adaptable to climate change to help the farmers in the drought-hit districts of Vidarbha and Marathwada. The decision is to minimise the losses incurred by farmers in investments made in agriculture sector, specially in the 14 drought-hit districts of the state. Notwithstanding the drought declared in 28,000 villages, the state government has geared up to take advantage of the good monsoon forecast from June 10.The IMD reports provided to the state agriculture department suggests an average rainfall of 106 per cent across Maharashtra. It has indicated higher than normal rain at 138 percent for eight districts of Marathwada.Three leading agriculture research universities have recommended that farmers should start the process of sowing all kharif crops between June 15 to 30. However, all three reports of the Mahatma Phule Agriculture University, Marathwada Agriculture University and Punjabrao Agriculture University, caution farmers against making huge investments in udit (cereal) and bhuimoong (cereal).Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis has directed district officials to complete the process of providing the soil health card to farmers in the next two years instead of three as was scheduled earlier. To capitalise on the good monsoons, several steps have been initiated such as provisions for disbursement of higher loan amounts from bank and enhancing the crop insurance loans to provide security to farmers.The projection for 2016-17 is marginally higher with sowing across 152 lakh hectares of land compared to 148 lakh hectares in 2015-16.There are efforts under way to bridge the gap between the food grain shortfall of 25 to 30 per cent which was registered in year 2015 in the coming year 2016-17.A flow chart along with crops to be taken up between June 15 to 30, July 8 to 15, August 1 to 7 and August 7 to 15 has been compiled region-wise which would be shared through the agriculture department using the mobile network through district collectors and gram panchayat levels. Under the banner of shektakri mitra (friends of farmers), a network to connect farmers forums with local administration which would periodically deliver the inputs is being strengthened.Agriculture minister Eknath Khadse said, We have already made provisions of adequate seeds and fertilizers. For coming kharif seasons, the requirement is for 14 lakh quintal seeds and provision has been made for 17 lakh quintal seeds, he said. Similarly, for BT cotton, the requirement of 160 lakh packets is being supplemented with 200 lakh packets.Amongst the traditional crops which are being recommended to farmers in drought-hit districts are soyabean, jowari, bajra, sunflower, tur dal and ragi (mid-July to mid August) among others. However, there is also emphasis on promoting intercrops and short crop cycle to bring better remunerations to farmers.A special drive to help small and marginal farmers to reduce their investments in agriculture is also being rolled out by the government.The agriculture department is working to provide them technological know-how to ensure higher production of yield. There is a lot of emphasis laid on micro irrigation mechanism for water management and also on better quality of crops and horticulture produce.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

According to the head of agronomy, PAU, Dr Thakar Singh, moong is conducive for the development of whitefly in cotton.Keeping in view last years' damage to cotton crop due to whitefly attack, university experts have advised the farmers to avoid cultivating moong in or around cotton crop. This has also been recommended by PAU in package of practices for kharif crops 2016.Dr Vijay Kumar, PAU entomologist, informed about the attack of whitefly on brinjal, tomato, potato, chillies and moong besides cotton. He advised the farmers to monitor their crops regularly and control whitefly by following PAU recommendations. Dr R S Sidhu, director of extension education has alerted the farmers against the whitefly attack on cotton. He urged them to monitor their cotton fields in order to avoid the worst consequences of the attack. He also stressed on eradicating the weeds on waste lands, roadsides, and irrigation channels/canals to avoid spread of whitefly to cotton fields."

Sarangi gave the direction on a petition which alleged that sand was being illegally quarried from Baitarani river at Turumunga under Patna tehsil in Keonjhar district on the basis of a transit permit.The petition alleged that the tehsildar, for the past one year, had been granting temporary transit permits to extract the minor mineral on a monthly basis without any mining plan and environmental clearance in the lease agreement, which is mandatory under the amended rules.Md Nasir Husen, 42, a resident of Chadhaibhole within Ghosoda police limits, filed the petition seeking direction for auction of the sand quarry in Turumunga following the amended provisions of the Orissa Minor Mineral Concession (Amendment) Rule 2014.In its order yesterday, the high court issued a notice to the principal secretary of the revenue department and collector to file a response when the court reopened after summer vacation on June 20.The collector is expected to file an affidavit stating under what authority the tehsildar had been issuing temporary transit permits on the basis of the old Orissa Minor Mineral Concession Rules, 2004.""The next hearing will be in the first week of July.

One-third of districts have faced more than four droughts over the past decade and 50 million people are affected by drought every year. Since independence, the country has spent a humungous Rs 3.5 lakh crore on drought-related issues. A media presentation on drought was organised on Friday by New Delhi-based public research and advocacy think tank, Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).CSE's Richard Mahapatra told reporters here that the current drought is turning out to be worst in the country's recorded history. More people are affected by drought now than before, irrespective of the level of monsoon deficit. India has more than 150 years of experience in managing droughts. Despite this, every time the country faces a deficit monsoon, we plunge into a crisis.""In Chhattisgarh, 93 per cent of the districts have been declared drought-affected. It has rainfall ranging between 1300-1600 mm. In 2015, it had 12 per cent 'deficit' monsoon which according to India meteorological department definition doesn't qualify to be termed as 'deficit' monsoon. Mahapatra argued, ""It is not deficit monsoon rather lack of policies and mechanisms to drought-proof susceptible areas that turn the situation into a crisis.""In his presentation, Mahapatra connected drought to food security. He said, ""Drought and food security are critically linked. Drought-prone districts account for 42 per cent of the country's cultivable land. For maintaining food security, even at the current nutritional levels, an additional 100 million tonnes (MT) of foodgrains need to be produced by 2020. According to estimates, 40 per cent of this additional supply has to come from these districts.""So it is not about whether our drought relief operations are effective, he said. Rather, India can't afford to have droughts any more. A long-term strategy to make India drought-free is the biggest message of the 2016 crisis."" CSE advocates a three-pronged action plan to combat this enduring crisis: augment water resources, revise and update the drought code, and secure water for all times."
58f613ac7be9e031f13ae0e2,Where water is hallmarked gold,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/ahmedabad/Where-water-is-hallmarked-gold/articleshow/52276574.cms,2016-05-15,"What worries 22-year old Jamnaben Dashratbhai, a resident of Kundalia, is not whether Gujarat Lions will win the IPL or whether BJP will win the Kerala assembly polls. It is unwashed clothes piling up over a week that has got her goat. Kundalia, located 30 km from Pakistan, is one of the 52 drought-hit villages of Banaskantha. Residents here are univocally furious with the state government for depriving them of Narmada water like those in the rest of the 1114 drought-hit villages. But what particularly annoys this expectant mother is that a water tanker, ""which turns up once in three days and at no fixed time"", dictates how and when she should go about her domestic chores.It's been three hours since her family members called for the tanker and it has not arrived yet. She says that sometimes the tanker does not turn up for days and her family goes without a bath for an entire week. ""If the driver feels like it, he will oblige. As such, the tanker supplies water for about 45 mins which is not enough for the village,"" she says. Of the 2,500 families in Kundalia, only 600 live in pucca houses. The rest live in tents on their farms. As farming is out of question, the menfolk work as labourers and take up carpentry and plumbery in Deesa, the nearest town.""We get paid Rs 100 to Rs 200 a day. We would not be at the mercy of others if the government just gave us water to irrigate our fields. We can then grow bajra, jeeru, matth and moong,"" says Samthabhai Suthar, 40. Soon, a tanker arrives, honking continuously, and parks itself near a dirty cattle trough. Balancing metal pots on their heads, the womenfolk rush to the spot. They queue up to fill water from the tanker tube while the thirsty cattle lap up water from the trough. A war of words breaks out inevitably because everybody is in a hurry.Sometimes, a ""miracle"" happens, as one of them puts it  The village school receives a trickle of water from the Deesa pipeline and the women queue up there. Prakash Goswami, 22, a resident, says, ""Women walk down four km daily to fetch water. At times, they are forced to return without a drop because 10,000 litres of water provided by the tanker is not enough for the village. A family of six needs at least 200 litres daily. The village has a huge water tank, but the stored water turns saline since this is a desert area."" Water seems to be the single most deciding factor that determines their future  in Kundalia, education is a privilege for boys alone as the families do not allow girls to attend school because ""who will go and fetch water then?""The village has seen about two to three divorce cases in the recent past because of the water issue. ""Our neighbours have left the village and moved to Ahmedabad. Some time ago, their daughter-inlaw left them because she was tired of making daily trips for water,"" he says, adding, ""That is what happens when you go looking for girls from another village. They cannot adjust to our circumstances."" During the wedding season or festivities, the village orders for food and water from Tharad taluka. Interestingly, one or two shops in the village sell local soft drink brands, but water is too much to ask for. ""A water tanker is hardly seen here, but the soft-drink vans always do the rounds and ensure the shops have enough supply,"" says Lalji Rajput, 22, who works in a diamond polishing unit nearby.Villagers can diss the state government as much as they want but sarpanch Karsan Rajput gives the administration a clean chit. ""A lot of people here live on the farms here and they break the pipelines supplying water from the Deesa outlet. Since we are a village at the farthest end of Banaskantha, we do not receive water. It is not the government's fault,"" he says. ""How is it not the government's fault? If people are resorting to such illegal ways, surely some action can be taken. Why can't they ensure us a steady supply of water like it does for the rest of the world?"" asks Prakash.Around 5 km ahead of Kundalia is Radha Nesda, the first village of Gujarat that is entirely powered by solar energy. Almost every mud house ('bhunga') here is fitted with solar panels. Recently, the state government also allocated 1,407 hectares of land here to Gujarat Power Corporation to set up a 750 MW ultra-mega solar plant. So while the villagers are thankful for the power supply, they complain about being sidelined by the government when it comes to paani. Around 350 families and livestock live in this arid region. Valiben Mavabhai, 55, a resident, says she has lost count of the cattle that died due to perennial water scarcity in the region.Villagers survive on the water found in the small wells ('virda') they dig on their farms. If they are lucky, the water is sweet, but it doesn't remain so beyond 10 days. So they abandon that well and dig another. ""We survive on the virda as long as it lasts. Once the water turns saline, we dig another. This has been going on for decades now. We have more or less accepted the fact that we will never get water. The tankers only provide water to the Border Security Forces,"" she says. Every morning, she leaves home with her husband for Deesa to look for work and the couple returns by night. Bajri no rotlo, batata nu shaak and chhas is the staple food of this region. ""Usually we get paid Rs 100- 200 a day. If we get lucky, we buy onions on the way and make dungli nu shaak,"" she says.The hardships faced by the villagers of Suigam, around 35 km from Kundalia, are no different. The only silver lining is the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act project that has them busy these days. On Friday, ahead of CM Anandiben Patel's visit to Suigam, around 300 villagers were out in Jodiya digging earthen bunds for rain water harvesting. The bunds, a 100-day project, can store water for two months during monsoon. They were provided Banas Dairy buttermilk packets by MNREGA officials. A water tanker was also parked here for these workers.""This is all a show. Just because the CM is visiting today, you see a water tanker parked here. Otherwise, you will never see one in our village,"" says Talabhai Parmar, 30. While MNREGA's Deputy DPC P M Gorecha hailed the bund project as a blessing for the villagers battling acute water scarcity, the latter feel doubly cheated. ""It usually rains here in July. By then the bunds will be ready to store water and the 1,435 families that live here will be benefited. Besides, we are providing employment to the villagers and also creating assets for them,"" he said. But sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput is not excited about the project. ""Firstly, we would not have to be part of such a project if we they simply give us water from the Narmada canal. Secondly, the MNREGA labour charges are a pittance. We get paid only Rs 178 per head for the work whereas the same work for a private contractor will earn us Rs 300,"" complains sarpanch Ramsinh Rajput, who has a debt of Rs 4 lakh. He claims he has been submitting memorandum seeking Narmada water to the state government for the past seven years, but to no avail.""It would be nice if agricultural loans were given to us at 1% interest rate instead of 7%. We find it difficult to sustain ourselves,"" says Rajput, adding, ""We spend Rs 200 every day on fodder for cattle and they produce just 3 litre of milk daily. If there is regular water supply, we can feed them green fodder and they can produce 6-7 litres of milk."" He along with others from the village go to Deesa to work on potato plantations or construction of roads and buildings.Only 100 families in Suigam get water from the Deesa pipeline, which is released to a common livestock trough here for 20 minutes to an hour every third day. Villagers come walking from as far as six km and queue up here in the afternoon. The tankers supply water to the villagers only once in three days. Asked how they were coping with the water crisis Maniben Bhurabhai, 30, says, ""How does anyone care about us? If you go without taking bath for a week and walk down six kms with three pots on your head, you'll now how we are coping up."""

They are disappointed with the district receiving only 50% of the rainfall this year.So, sowing of jowar, sunflower, cotton, green gram, black-eyed peas, urad dal and other pulses has been delayed. Normally, Chamarajanagar and Gundlupet taluks receive good pre-monsoon rains.The farmers of both the taluks are involved in sowing activities during April and May. With monsoon rains following in June and July, they would reap a good yield. But, all their calculations have gone wrong due to deficit rains this year.The average expected rainfall in the district during April and May is 159.5 mm. But, this year, the region received only 79.6 mm rains. Last year, the district had received 294 mm of rains.Only a few parts of the four taluks of the district have received good rains, while it was only scanty rains in other parts. Farmers of Kollegal, Gundlupet and Chamarajanagar taluks are facing drought.Last year, sowing was taken up on 38,838 hectares and 25% of sowing activities was completed by May. But, this year, sowing has been taken up only on 24,879 hectares and 15.8% of sowing activities has been completed.SeedsAccording to the Agriculture department, target had been set for sowing in 1,57,000 hectares for the pre-monsoon period.Hence, there is a need for 21,255 quintals of jowar, sunflower, cotton, groundnut, ragi, green gram, urad and black-eyed peas this year.The Agriculture department has 1,785 quintals of seeds. Similarly, there is a demand for 33,400 tonnes of fertilisers this year. There is a stock of 8,000 tonnes of fertilisers in private establishments and cooperative societies. The seeds and fertilisers will be distributed to farmers as per demand, the officials said."

Telegraph picture Imphal, May 16: Avian population in Manipur's Loktak lake, a favourite haunt of migratory birds, has registered a slump, according to a latest census report. ""The survey carried out in January this year recorded more than 47,000 birds as against a little more than 50,000 recorded last year,"" R.K. Birjit Singh, coordinator of the bird census, told The Telegraph. The census was carried out on January 21 by the wildlife wing of the state forest department, Indian Bird Conservation Network and local groups, namely the Centre for Conservation of Nature and Cultivation of Science, Sangai Protection Forum, Unique Wildlife Protection Committee and Global Science Club. ""Though the number of birds in the lake has decreased this year, the number of bird species has increased. The ratio of migratory and local birds is 50:50,"" Singh said. The 246 square km lake is home to many migratory birds during winter. Migratory birds start reaching the lake in late September and reside here till April every year. The census identified 68 water bird species. Last year, it was 61. This year's count recorded 18,612 lesser whistling ducks, the highest among the species in the lake. Common coot comes next with a count of 14,545. The bird count was done from 50 vantage points and supervised by divisional forest officer (park and sanctuary) Arun R.S, range forest officers L. Biramangol and Kh. Hitler. Singh gave two main reasons for the fewer number of birds this year. ""The first reason is poaching. Poachers use pesticides and insecticides to catch birds. A large number of birds are being caught by the poachers. The second reason is high water level in the lake. The water level this year is higher than that of last year because of blocking of the lake water at Ithai barrage,"" Singh said. ""Large flocks of birds were seen in November and December. Perhaps, many of these visiting birds went to other places because of shortage of food or high water level of the lake,"" Arun said. Environmentalist Kh. Samungou said the fewer number of birds could be attributed to climatic changes taking place in the state resulting in declining growth of water weeds in the lake, which are food for many of the birds. Lesser whistling teal and gadwall, which were seen in large numbers in the preceding year were not seen much this year, the experts said. The first systematic study on the avifauna of this lake was carried out by the wildlife wing of the forest department in 2012. The census identified 51 water bird species, 22 of them migratory, and counted 23,561 water birds on the lake. Bird lovers and ornithologists have carried out unofficial census of the bird population since the early 1990s."

""But in Bihar, pulses are sold above Rs 150,"" he said.Sources said unpolished pulses were priced at Rs 170 in the open market, while polished pulses cost Rs 150 per kg.Paswan was speaking at a seminar on national food security act and consumer empowerment organised by the ministry on instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi who has asked his ministers to highlight their achievements on the two-year anniversary of the NDA government.The food and public distribution ministry has kept a surplus stock to ensure the prices of pulses does not rise.To check the prices of pulses, the food ministry has already asked the states to place their demand to the ministry. Paswan, the Hajipur MP, said: ""It is pitiful that when other states have placed their demand for pulses to the ministry, my home state Bihar has not done so."" But the state minister, Madan Sahni, said: ""The Bihar government has already placed its demand for 15,000 tonnes of arhar dal (split red gram) and 22,000 tonnes of moong dal (split green gram)."""

The team, led by Prof K N Uttam, tested the metallic nano-particles and presented their work at an international conference at Bhabha Atomic Research Center (BARC) recently.""We developed various metallic nano-particles, including titanium-di-oxide (also used in cosmetics), zinc oxide, copper oxide, aluminium oxide and silicon oxide, and tested these on number of cash and fodder crops, including onion, garlic, coriander, mint, moong dal (pulses) and wheat, said Prof KN Uttam. When titanium-di-oxide was injected in onion and garlic crops, it enhancement the overall productivity of the crops, he added. Likewise, when we tested copper oxide on wheat, we found that the requirement of water for the crop came down considerably, he said.Although, there was no change in its productivity. However, as we had seen that nano-particle of titanium-di-oxide enhanced the production of onion and garlic, we are assured of an equal effect on the wheat crop too, for which, we have started our tests and initial results shows the same, said Prof Uttam.The team is also studying the effect of another promising nano-particle of silicon oxide, result of which is still awaited."

There was melody, emotions and hope in the air as the cast and crew mesmerised the audience at the live concert, which was held at a suburban auditorium in Mumbai.The event started with a 30-second silence to pay homage to Sarabjit Singh. His sister Dalbir Kaur and wife Sukhpreet were overwhelmed by the mood of the evening. Though Dalbir's screen counterpart Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and Richa Chadha, who plays Sukhpreet, were conspicuous by their absence, actors Randeep Hooda, Darshan Kumar and director Omung Kumar attended the event.The evening began with a heart-rending performance by composer duo Shail-Pritesh, who sang the biopic's theme song amidst resounding applause. The duo also performed on Barsan Laagi, Mera Junoon and Meherbaan. Later, Altamash, Shashaa Tirupati and Rabbani Mustafa Khan sang the qawwali track Allah Hu Allah.People were delighted to see Sonu Nigam perform after a long time. The singer, who recently underwent a leg surgery, made an appearance after two-and-a-half months. He recounted how in 2013, he was amongst many others who had filed a petition to bring back Sarabjit. Despite being in pain, the singer sang Dard, which left everyone teary-eyed.Tulsi Kumar and Amaal Mallik regaled the crowd with Salamat, which has been composed by Amaal himself.

File PhotoWhile pre-monsoon showers and forecast of a good monsoon has perked up the hopes of farmers of the Bombay Karnataka and central Karnataka region, leading to start of preliminary farm activities, not all farmers are ready to jump into farming activity given their past experience of drought.In Ballari district, farmers can be seen ploughing and levelling ground, making it ready for sowing for the kharif season in the rain-fed areas. But, in other places, people are yet to venture out, since they are waiting for a couple of bouts of heavy pre-monsoon showers to start work. In the first fortnight of May, Ballari received an average rainfall of around 24.6 mm as against the average normal rainfall of 22.5 mm. The sowing target for the kharif season in the district is around 3.65 lakh hectares of which 2.09 lakh ha is rain-fed and 1.55 lakh is irrigated.In Haveri and Dharwad district, the situation is not very different. While Agriculture Department officials say the climate is conducive to begin farm activities, not many have completed pre-sowing preparations. Unpredictable climate has delayed the beginning of farm activities, said Basavaraj from Guttal in Haveri.In Raichur district, farm activities have begun thanks to early and good rainfall, and ploughing began last week. Agriculture Department officials said around 40 per cent of the lands in rain-fed areas, particularly in Lingasugur, Deodurg and Raichur taluks, are already prepared for sowing cotton, red gram, bajra and other crops.In the irrigation belt across Sindhanur and Manvi taluks, farmers have prepared their fields for sowing green gram, hoping to harvest it before the transplant of paddy begins.In Chitradurga, however, the majority of the onion farmers have prepared their fields for sowing in anticipation of good rainfall. Last years good profit in onion cultivation is likely to lead to a 30 per cent increase in the area of cultivation too.( With inputs from M.

The oft-repeated talk of the legacy of hatred across the border is a big yawn. Then, just like in Mary Kom , director Omung Kumar tries to wring the patriotic emotions too. But his brand of jingoism is more cringe-worthy than emotional. Kumar, also tries to take up the cause of all the illegal detentions on either side of the border. Theres far too much packed into a little over two hours.Its left to Randeep Hooda, who plays the titular role, then to make the film watchable. And he tries to give Sarbjit his all. The hard work and seriousness of his approach is visible in the getup, in the Punjabi he speaks (the only character who uses the lingo decently in the film), in the mannerisms, in the odd sense of humour, even in the awkward dance moves. The actor in him is clearly trying to come on his own.

""The animal census is held after every ten years and so we cannot comment on the accurate number of animals. But looking at the growing instances of man-animal conflict, we firmly believe that the population of some species has surged significatnly,"" he said.Girhepuje said the population of blackbucks, nilgai and wild boar appears to have increased in Aurangabad and Jalna.""In 2013-14 the forest officials had recorded 420 cases of man-animal conflict in the division, which surged to 1033 in 2014-15. In 2015-16, it has risen to 4287. In most of the cases, black bucks, nilgai and wild boar have caused massive damage to crops for which the forests department had to give compensation. This indicates that the animals' population has gone up,"" he said.Wild herbivores tend to consume several crops like tur, moong, cotton or groundnut, which causes huge losses to farmers. The aforementioned species are covered under Schedule I of the Wild Life Protection Act 1972, according to which permission of the Central Government is mandatory for anything from trapping to killing them even for the purposes of scientific management, education or research."

PHOTO: M.A. SRIRAMEven as the price of pulses, especially red gram (tur dal), green gram and black gram, has continued to be on the higher side since last year, despite assurances of price stabilisation, pulses continue to be the focus area of the Department of Agriculture.As 2016 has been declared as the International Year of Pulses, the department has been promoting cultivation of pulses to boost production and bring down prices.In Mysuru district, which gets pre-monsoon showers, farmers start off sowing pulses earlier than in the rest of the State. But this time, with the pre-monsoon showers ineffective as only 60 per cent rain was recorded across the district, the sowing has not been very encouraging.Statistics available with the Agriculture Department show that the pulse cultivation scene this year pales in comparison to the previous year. This year, red gram has been sown in 523 hectares, while cowpea is being cultivated in 11,808 hectares. Black gram has been sown in 5,765 hectares, green gram in 4,842 hectares and flat beans (avarekai) in 203 hectares.The numbersDuring the 2015 kharif season, black gram was cultivated in 21,169 hectares, green gram in 14,028 hectares, cowpea in 48,338 hectares, flat beans in 10,492 hectares, tur dal in 2,511 hectares and horse gram in 16,349 hectares. During the rabi season last year, chana dal was cultivated in 1,109 hectares, horse gram in 23,432 hectares, black gram in 4,546 hectares, cowpea in 6,017 hectares and flat beans in 8,446 hectares.The cultivation of flat beans was on the higher side last year because of its wide acceptance and popularity. Different varieties of delicacies of avarekalu had been prepared in this part of the region during the season.Mahanteshappa, Joint Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu that the production of pulses would have gone up if the pre-monsoon showers had been copious, especially with subsidy being given for cultivating them.Traditionally, Mysuru is one of the districts where different varieties of pulses are cultivated. Though red gram is not grown predominantly, pulses like black gram and cowpea are grown in surplus. Red gram is cultivated as an inter-crop as it is said to be suitable in black soil."

The forecast has a 4 per cent margin of error.India Meteorological Department, the country's official monsoon forecaster, has predicted 106 per cent rains. The department is expected to issue an updated forecast in the first week of June. ""The last prediction was based on data from March. In our updated forecast, we have looked at data till the beginning of May and it's showing more favourable conditions, particularly the increased possibility of La Nina forming later this year,"" said G P Sharma, VP meteorology, Skymet.Average rainfall of 887mm across the country from June to September is considered normal. If this is taken as 100 per cent, the normal monsoon range is 96%-104 per cent. Rains in the 104-110 per cent range is termed 'above normal', while those above 110 per cent is excess.According to the forecast, the monsoon may have a relatively poor start. Rainfall in June is expected to be 13 per cent below normal. The situation is likely to improve sharply in July, when 8 per cent above normal rains are predicted.""We expect the second half of the monsoon season to be better, with our models showing 13 per cent above normal rains in August and 23 per cent higher than normal in September,"" Sharma said.Based on the rain prediction, Skymet also made projections for the kharif season. It said the total area under kharif foodgrains was expected to increase by 15-20 per cent over last year. The total foodgrain output in the kharif season could touch 129-130 million tonnes, it said.The forecaster also said the sown area under oilseeds  including soybean, groundnut, pulses (tur, moong and urad)  and rice was likely to increase."
58fef85b7be9e0420db2a665,The rot in Indian agricultural policies,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160526/jsp/opinion/story_87563.jsp,2016-05-26,"Every aspect of Indian economic policies is influenced by all-pervading government control. Many times, they are also subject to massive leakages due to inefficiencies and corruption (for example, bogus ration cards, rotting grains and corrupt procurement in the public distribution system). The poor state of industrial development, inability to increase domestic defence production in spite of massive imports, diversion of government revenues from taxes on minerals, mismatch between demand for agricultural products and their production, and so on, are some examples. India has massive unemployment and underemployment. More are seeking fresh employment each year, consumption levels are low, and there are many poor people. Yet, growth in production of physical goods from agriculture and industry has, in five years since 2011, been modest. At constant prices, agriculture grew annually from 2011 in per cent at 1.5, 4.2, -9.2 and 1.1. Over these years, industry grew in per cent at 3.6, 5.0, 5.9, and 7.3; manufacturing at 6.0, 5.6, 5.5 and 9.5. There is heavy pressure of population on land. The average size of land holding was 1.41 hectares in 1995-96 and 1.15 in 2010-11. India has more arable land than China. Indeed it has the second-most arable land in the world. But it has very low productivity of crops per acre. When one takes paddy, as one example, and on comparing with China, India remains far behind. This is so for other crops as well and as compared to most Southeast Asian countries. A good reason for the low productivity is the growing fragmentation of holdings and their decline in size. The high population pressure on small land holdings is on account of high rural poverty. Alleviation requires consolidation of land holdings by leasing, urbanization and the acquisition of rural lands for the purpose with adequate compensation. This will also reduce this pressure. Consumption habits are changing at all levels. Rice consumption per person per month in rural India was estimated at 5.98 kilogramme in 2011-12 compared to 6.38 kg in 2004-05 - a fall of 0.4 kg in seven years. In urban India, the fall in rice consumption between these two periods was 0.2 kg per person per month - from 4.71 kg to 4.49 kg per capita. A high proportion was taken at subsidized prices from the public distribution system. Per capita consumption of wheat in 2011-12 showed a slight rise since 2004-05 of about 0.1 kg per person per month in rural areas and a fall of 0.35 kg in urban areas. As with rice, the share of PDS purchase in wheat consumption has increased considerably, from 824 grammes to 901 gm in the urban sector. At the same time, and in contrast, 69 gm in the rural sector and 57 gm in the urban sector were contributed by split gram, whole gram, pea and besan bought at rising market prices. The four pulses - arhar, moong, masur and urd - also rose. So did consumption of vegetables, eggs and fruits. All these have seen rising prices and no price support to consumers. Minimum support prices for cereals are increased almost every year and have been the same as procurement prices. But retail prices were not raised similarly. There is also government interference in the agricultural markets which cause the farmer to lose the margins made by middlemen. India has stimulated the production of cereals when the demand was dropping, while growing for other non-subsidized items. Rural households bought the cheap PDS grains and sold their own produce for government stocks, which are at unsustainably high levels without adequate storage. They might as well have been given free to the malnourished rural poor. Productivity remained low because of falling land holdings. Improved seeds were not easily available. Genetic modification of food grains was prevented by environmentalists with no evidence of ill-effects. (Research has shown no ill-effects on humans; in some cases, there might be resistance to plant resistance.) Fertilizers are subsidized, benefiting manufacturers and big farmers. Subsidies are relatively more for urea, leading to a mismatch in fertilizer use and inadequate productivity. Water availability has been shrinking as lakes and rivers become polluted and groundwater levels are used excessively. Per-capita availability of fresh water has declined sharply, from 3,000 cubic metres to 1,123 cubic metres over the past 50 years versus the global average of 6,000 cubic metres. India needs to make judicious use of surface water and groundwater. Dams on rivers have robbed some of them of their usual water flow, while diverting the course of others. Urban effluents have also destroyed the potability of river water. Fifty five per cent of India's total water supply is now groundwater. This has reduced levels across much of India. Growing water-intensive crops and using techniques like flooding for paddy have further depleted groundwater. Over 60 per cent of irrigation comes from groundwater. Nearly 30 per cent of urban water supply and 70 per cent of rural water supply come from groundwater. We need a rational water policy and less populism. Massive subsidies on equipment and electricity required to mine groundwater have accentuated its use to the financial detriment of the power sector. Free or heavily subsidized flat rate electricity tariffs helped bring the Green Revolution. They have now become the norm. The result is indiscriminate use of groundwater. Each of the issues mentioned is the result of government policies or their absence. Land legislation encourages fragmentation of holdings. There is little encouragement for leasing. Land acquisition for urban areas and for factories has been a corrupt business, and there is little incentive for many farmers to give up their land and move away. Government procurement policies and the public distribution system have stimulated rising production of rice and wheat. Little has been done to help production, storage and marketing of other items like vegetables, pulses, fruits and eggs (such as cold storages, improved varieties, and so on). There is little sign of a rational water policy: indeed, it is the opposite. Electricity tariffs encourage a rise in the use of groundwater. There is no policy on groundwater. Neither is there a limit on what water-intensive crops can be grown with it. There is no concerted recharging of groundwater. State governments follow irrational water-pricing policies. Cleaning up river and lake water so that it is available to supplement water supply in case of drought is uncommon. Little is being done to spread better agricultural practices and scientific developments that benefit farmers. Agricultural productivity can be increased even on small holdings, but there is little attempt, except by non-governmental organizations, to disseminate these practices. In Israel, these have reduced the use of water. There are vineyards producing good wine in the Negev desert. Groundwater use is not metered in India as it should be. Fertilizer subsidies do not benefit the small farmer. Rational policies, which ensure that subsidies reach the farmer and do not encourage unbalanced use of fertilizers, are urgently needed. Environmental agitations against genetically modified seeds should be countered by scientific evidence so that more productive seeds can be used. Agricultural policies have developed into a messy package. They need a thorough overhaul. Our political masters are unable to even think of it.

58f5511a7be9e01a17c97040,N for… Neyyappam!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/N-for-Neyyappam/articleshow/52479472.cms,2016-05-29,"Will the desi neyyappam win the ongoing naming poll for an Android version and go global? Malayalis have left no stone unturned in rooting for it.Malayalis have brushed up their 'collective social media skills' yet again, no, not to insult anyone this time, but for a rather 'sweet' cause. Google, which normally gives its updated Android versions names of confectionery like Lollypop and KitKat, has invited users from all over the world to suggest names for its latest version. Its CEO Sundar Pichai, a Tamilian, had stated last year that an Indian sweet can be considered for the next Android version, and that he would be asking his mother for suggestions. But there was no need for that, for an innovative Malayali somewhere came up with a suggestion, neyyappam, the popular Kerala sweet, and it was soon taken up by Malayalis all over the world. A group of Bengaluru-based Malayali techies have even created a website to campaign for votes for neyyappam, and the Kerala Tourism Department is all gung-ho over the choice and have been tweeting in favour of it.While other North Indian dishes like Naan and Nankhatai were trending initially, none had the perseverance of Malayalis apparently, and it was the modest little neyyappam which finally found a place among 'nuts' and 'nachos' in the homepage of the site.And why not neyyappam, ask Malayalis. It is a sweet and it begins with an N, as stipulated by the company, thus winning over its somewhat poorer cousin, the unniyappam. ""If Nutella can contest, why not neyyappam? All others sound similar while neyyappam will stand out,"" says Manoj Thomas, a techie, while Poornima Menon, a homemaker, says, ""From a Malayali perspective  there is an instant connect because most of us have some good ol' childhood memories associated with it. Currently not many non-Malayalis know about it. Globally, everyone would be curious about what neyyappam is. Along with it, Kerala would get popular too.""Also, the neyyappam is much-loved by a huge community of tech-savvy people spread across the world! What more could the search engine giant want?Lohit Chandran, founder of Humans of Kochi has reasons to root for neyyappam and he says, ""India comes out on top globally in terms of mobile subscriber growth. Every second, a mobile connection gets activated in India. What could be a better way to acknowledge this than by naming the next Android with an Indian sweet!""Farzana Jayash, a college student, agrees, ""Android versions have always been named after generic western sweets  Cupcake, Donut, Jelly Bean etc  so neyyappam would be a fresh, fun desi alternative.""Apparently, Hiroshi Lockheimer, Senior Vice-President of Android has commented that they have had ""very intriguing results so far.'' Neyyappam has been branded too difficult to pronounce by many non-Indian users but if you can pronounce marshmallow why not neyyappam, ask Malayalis. The final call goes to the company regardless of the polls, which is on till June 9, 12.29 pm. Meanwhile, many Malayalis have already started dreaming about Android neyyappam taking over the world, in true blue Dasan-Vijayan style, as Manoj says, ""Neyyappam is going to make us proud of being Malayalis.""The neyyappam has been an all-time favourite not just in temples but in children's literature as well. One of the most popular songs go thus:AyyappantammaNeyyappam chuttuKakka kothi kadalilittuMunga piller mungiyeduthuThatta piller thattiyeduthuVangiya piller vayilumittuEnikku mathram kittiyillallo!In case all that talk about neyyappam hasleft you craving for a bite, here is the recipe:Rice flour - 1 cupJaggery, powdered - 1 cupCardamom - 4 podsGhee - 3 tspDry grated coconut -1 tsp (optional)Oil or ghee for fryingWater - 1 cupGrind the rice flour into a thick paste. Add powdered cardamom. Add the powdered jaggery and grind again without adding water. Add ghee to the batter and mix well. If you're using ghee to fry the appams, do not add ghee in the batter.Roast the grated coconut and mix with the batter. Heat oil/ghee in a thick-bottomed frying pan. Pour small quantities of the batter using a ladle into the oil (the size of a cookie) and deep fry till it becomes dark brown in colour."
58f5ba7aa3d24b0b70c2444b,She is a study in self-sufficiency,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/she-is-a-study-in-selfsufficiency/article8665185.ece,2016-05-30,"K. Nagajothi of P. Subbulapuram in Peraiyur taluk of Madurai district is a phenomenon in self-sufficiency. The 55-year-old woman, who has studied up to SSLC, is good at multitasking  she is a farmer, entrepreneur, trainer, leader and, above all, a homemaker.The mother of three practises 100 per cent organic farming in her 8.5-acre farm at Chinna Reddiyapatti, provides value addition to her produce and also makes food products. Whenever she finds time, Ms. Nagajothi joins other villagers in deepening the local tank under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Like any rural household, Ms. Nagajothi and her husband V. Kanagasundaram, her classmate, were struggling to make a living with a meagre farm income. After attending motivational and training programmes, I decided to adopt organic farming in my land in 2001. My husband was for use of chemical inputs and, at one point of time, even threatened to walk out of home if I continued with organic farming. On seeing the results, he is now my partner in progress, says a proud Ms. Nagajothi.Their farm resembles a kind of oasis in a village where use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is the norm. We do not use even one per cent of chemical input. When there was a recent pest attack on maize, I suggested an organic insecticide to fellow farmers. They made fun of me, saying that I was suggesting rasam for a crop. But they could not believe their eyes when their crop withered and ours was ready for harvest.Integrated farmingMs. Nagajothi practises integrated farming while raising tur dal, millets like thinai and kuthiraivaali, green gram and maize. She hires herds of goats and uses her own cows to provide manure to the rain-fed farm. She prepares organic ingredients at home to ward of pests. We do not hire farm hands for deweeding. I and my husband do it ourselves. Like in many places, P. Subbulapuram also faces shortage of farm hands.The cost of harvest has gone up now. However, it is essential to have workers during harvest. We hire vehicles to transport them to the farm, she says. She does not depend on machinery for processing the produce. She has hand grinders at home on which she works and hires people for work on contract.Last month, she, along with a few other women, processed one quintal of tur dal using hand grinders. The organic nature and hand processing add value and taste to pulses and millets, she says. On an average, Ms. Nagajothi processes 25 kg of dal or small millets a day. Mr. Kanagasundaram says that they have planned to buy a machine to dehull small millets.In between, Ms. Nagajothi makes eatables from rice and millets, which have become famous in the region. Mr. Kanagasundaram, who sells the products on his bicycle, says, We do not do it for profit. I give away eatables for free whenever I come across crying children.The couple have married off their two daughters and their only son is waiting to join a postgraduate course. The money they earn is enough to run the family. Immediately after marriage, I pledged all my jewels in a cooperative bank. I could redeem them only when the government announced a loan waiver. Today, there is no need for me to approach lending institutions.Pamayyan, an expert in organic farming, feels that there is immense scope for developing small millet cultivation in the region. During the British period, the area around T. Kallupatti was double taxed for the fertile soil. He points to the couple as a classic example of how farming can be made profitable with value addition and marketing. They have planned their lives without any significant help from outside, he says.Madurai-based Dhan Foundation, in association with the Government of Canada, has launched a project in the country to encourage cultivation of small millets.It is focussing on T.

Soyabean in Adilabad, rice in Khammam, Karimnagar, Nalgonda, Warangal and Nizamabad and maize in Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy will be the predominant crops to be covered with villages as units of insurance.Other crops like jowar, red gram, green gram, black gram, chillies, turmeric and groundnut will be covered with mandal as unit.However, soyabean, rice and maize will also be covered in mandal as unit where they are not listed as predominant crops. For instance, rice is not a predominant crop in Adilabad, Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy. Similarly, soyabean is not a predominant crop in all districts except Adilabad and maize not in districts other than Medak, Mahbubnagar and Ranga Reddy.Besides, the government notified cotton, red chillies, oil palm and sweet lime in various districts for weather based crop insurance scheme (WBCIS) as part of PMFBY. The PMFBY aimed to support sustainable production in agriculture with financial assistance, stabilising income of farmers, encouraging them to adopt innovative and modern agricultural practices and ensuring credit flow. The WBCIS was meant to address the financial loss suffered by farmers on account of adverse weather conditions."

The proposed hike in MSP for paddy in contrast will be only Rs 60 per quintal indicating the government's intention of making production of pulses more remunerative.The steep hike in MSP of pulses will be for the second consecutive year as retail prices refuse to come down due to acute shortage in domestic production. Last June, MSP for arhar and urad was increased by Rs 275 per quintal and for moong by Rs 250 per quintal.Sources said that the agriculture ministry has proposed an increase in pulses MSP over and above the recommendations made by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). They added while CACP has suggested hike of Rs 200 per quintal in the MSP of arhar, the ministry has proposed more than Rs 200 hike per quintal .CACP has proposed a hike of Rs 150 per quintal each for moong and urad dal.Meanwhile, Niti Aayog member Ramesh Chand on Tuesday said that though he agreed to some extent that giving higher MSP will bring some shift in area to pulses, it will not help in raising production. News agencies reported Chand saying that government needs to ""rethink"" the decision.In case of oilseeds, the CACP has proposed an increase in MSP of soyabean yellow by Rs 75 per quintal and Rs 50 per quintal jump in the MSP of sunflower seed. The other proposals include Rs 90 per quintal increase in the support price of groundnut shell and Rs 100 per quintal hike in sesame seed.

Paddy saw a modest hike of Rs 60 to Rs 1,470 per quintal. ""We have increased MSP of all kharif (summer season) crops for 2016-17. Over and above MSP, we have decided to give a bonus of Rs 425 per quintal for pulses and Rs 100-200 per quintal for oilseeds,"" agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh told reporters after the cabinet meeting. After including the bonus component, MSP of tur has been increased to Rs 5,050 per quintal for this year from Rs 4,625 per quintal last year. Last year, too, the government had given a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal to the growers. MSP is the rate at which the government buys grain from the farmers. Paddy is the main crop grown during the kharif season. Sowing of kharif crops will begin with the onset of the southwest monsoon this month. ""The bonus of Rs 425 per quintal for all variety of pulses reflects the Centre's conscious effort towards incentivising production in the face of a dwindling output and a possible cascading effect that a sharp price rise of pulses can have on food inflation,"" Yes Bank said in a research note. However, an increase in the support prices of pulses doesn't count much as the government's procurement is limited - less than 1 per cent of the total production. Wholesale market prices are substantially higher than the support prices. For instance, the wholesale prices of tur or arhar are over Rs 12,000 per quintal, more than double of what was approved by the cabinet. Over a quarter of the demand of pulses is met through imports. Farmers are unwilling to grow pulses because of risks related to price and production. The support price of moong has been raised to Rs 5,225 per quintal from Rs 4,850 per quintal a year ago. The MSP of urad has been increased to Rs 5,000 per quintal from Rs 4,625 per quintal."

The bonus was an additional incentive as it was over and above the price recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).The bonus may not be enough to incentivize farmers to cultivate pulses, in particular. For long, there have been complaints from all quarters, including CACP, about the ineffectiveness of governments procurement mechanism in pulses. NAFED, the agency designated to procure pulses and oilseeds, has a disappointing record.Kharif pulses such as moong have seen a decline in area under cultivation between 2007-08 and 2014-15. Wheat, on the other hand, saw an increase in area under cultivation. A part of the reason for a decline in area under cultivation for pulses could be on account of the ineffective procurement mechanism.To solve this problem, CACP once recommended that farmers be given a statutory right to procurement. Presumably, this was expected to work on the lines of a statutory right such as the rural employment programme. But as the experience with rural employment programme has shown, legislating a right does not necessarily make a difference on the ground. Merely legislating a right of procurement is not going to help farmers. Governments procurement mechanism has to get more effective.In the forthcoming season, Food Corporation of India has been designated as the primary procurement agency for pulses and oil seeds, in addition to its traditional responsibility of cereals. If FCIs presence can make a difference, perhaps the bonus offered by government will begin to make a difference."

This rise in MSP, they say, is too little to maintain a permanent increase in areas under pulse cultivation in the country.On Wednesday, the central government announced the MSP for 15 agricultural commodities. As per the newly declared prices, the MSP for Tur was increased to Rs 5,050 per quintal from the present Rs 4,625 per quintal, an increase of 9.2 per cent. Similarly, the prices of other pulses like moong and urad were increased by 7.7 per cent and 8.1 per cent to Rs 5,225 and Rs 5,000 per quintal respectively.Incidentally, the increase in the price of pulses was the highest among all the commodities. Pulses, especially tur, has been in news over the last year or so due to the sharp price hike, both wholesale and retail. Decrease in area of cultivation due to drought and low profitability have been cited as the main reasons for the price hike.In order to arrest any further price hike, both the state and central government have taken various measures to increase the area of cultivation of pulses. The increased MSP is one such measure, which the government hopes will make farmers prefer pulses over other crops. Modal prices of tur in the wholesale market of Latur are at present hovering in the range of Rs 8,500- 9,000 per quintal. Laturs wholesale market is the price setter for pulses across the country.India imports around 15-20 per cent of its requirement of pulses annually. Lalit Shah, chairman of the Latur market committee, said the MSP hike would not have any immediate effect as the market prices are already too high. If the rains are good, farmers will prefer tur and other pulses, given the good prices. However, in case of a good crop, prices are bound to fall next year, which will again see a decrease in area for the next year, he said. Shah said if the MSP was fixed at Rs 7,000 per quintal, it would be profitable for the farmers and there would be a permanent solution to the problem.Nitin Kalantari, CEO of Kalantary Food, one of Indias largest importer and exporter of pulses, is of the similar view. If the MSP was made between Rs 6,000-7,000, a real strong signal would have gone to the farming community, he said. In order to ensure permanent increase in pulses area, Kalantari also said the government should continue to procure at market price to create a buffer stock. This year, in the face of the high prices, the central government had procured five lakh bags of pulses, with procurement happening at current market prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

To be headed by PAU vice-chancellor B S Dhillon, the panel will also include representatives from Haryana and Rajasthan.On a recommendation by Sirsa-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) regional station head Dalip Monga and PAU experts, Kaushal has directed agriculture officials to ask farmers to sow bajra (millet) around their cotton crop as a barrier against whitefly. As per experts, bajra stops the pest from advancing towards other crops. The experts also suggested to sow moong and jowar around cotton, if possible, as with it the chances of pest attack are minimized.Following the whitefly outbreak last year, farmers in state suffered an estimated loss of Rs 4,200 crore, and further deepened the agriculture loan crisis in the state. Due to the losses and mounting debts, many farmers had committed suicide. The committee will be laying special emphasis on keeping a check in Abohar and Fazilka where whitefly has been detected due to large number of orchards.

""We began with Tarawi or offering namazon Monday evening,"" said Altaf Ahmad, president of Jama Masjid, Kutchi Memon Jamaat in Sadar.Mosques in the city are equipped with coolers and air-conditioners for the comfort of the devout as this year Ramzan is falling in the summer season. Muslims visit mosques in large numbers during the holy month for offering prayers, reading of the holy Koran and for Iftar or the ritual of breaking fast after sunset.Muslims on fast eat before sunrise and after sunset and go without food and water throughout the day. ""Our religious leader has advised us to eat curd laced with powdered cardamom during the early morning sihori ritual, which will make us feel less thirsty,"" said Tasneem Hussain, a high schoolteacher and a Bohra Muslim for whom Ramzan began on June 5.""We follow the Islamic calendar and do not go by the sighting of moon,"" she said. The Bohras break the fast at the mosque and follow it up with a community dinner.For the Shia sect, the rules remain same except that there is a difference of 15 minutes for commencing and breaking the fast. ""We break the fast about 15 to 20 minutes after the others. Similarly we stop eating 15 minutes before the other sects,"" says Bilal Hussain, a Shia Muslim. There is only one Shia mosque in Mominpura where the 500 odd Shia families residing in the city worship during Ramzan.

""I have shopped and stocked food items at home for the entire month as this keeps me organized and helps me to devote more time for prayers,"" she says.Meanwhile the hot and dry weather has made various eateries hopeful. ""Last year rains had kept people indoors,"" says Mohd Sadiq, an eatery owner in Jafar Nagar. Many Muslims set up food stalls here for iftari and dinner. ""Fresh food is prepared every day during Ramzan and we are able to earn only if it all sells out.

Top agriculture officials of Amravati and Nagpur revenue divisions are expecting pulses cultivation to be up by around 2 lakh hectares this season.What has also helped farmers in making up their minds to go in for the pulses is the increased demand and rates in market coupled with increase in minimum support price and special bonus for tur cultivators who want to sell the produce to government agencies. The Union government has announced a bonus of Rs425 a quintal over and above the MSP for tur for the coming season to ensure good returns for farmers growing it.Joint director of agriculture of Amravati division, S Sardar, was very optimistic about the Kharif prospects. ""We had undertaken a special drive for promoting intercropping of cotton with tur. Traditionally in western Vidarbha, you do not find farmers doing this. So, we launched a campaign and told farmers to sow one row of tur after every two rows of cotton. He said even in Akola and Buldhana districts, where pulses are grown in good volumes, it is mostly a stand-alone crop of one of the pulses. Intercropping with cotton may further increase yield of pulses in the area,"" Sardar told TOI on Tuesday.""A forecast of 106% monsoon, good availability of fertilizers and seeds are all in favour of farmers. In Amravati division, we expect pulses cultivation will be taken up in additional 1.25 lakh hectares as compared to the previous year. Of around 31 lakh hectares, soyabean is traditionally taken up in around 15 lakh hectares. But this time, soya sowing as well as cotton could see a dip with marked preference for tur, urad and moong,"" said Sardar. Cotton could be sown in around 9.5 lakh hectares. Tur area could go up to 4 lakh hectares, he said.Of around 19 lakh hectares land under cultivation, paddy is a major crop grown in around 8.20 lakh hectares and cotton in over 6 lakh hectares followed by soyabean in nearly 3 lakh hectares in Nagpur revenue division. ""This time, we are expecting tur to be grown in at least 2.05 lakh hectares, up around 50,000 hectares than last Kharif season,"" said Nagpur division joint director of agriculture Vijay Ghawate.

The good news is that it is expected to dip further in the coming months.Toor dal is now available in the market for Rs. 130, while the finest quality costs Rs. 160 a kg. The downward slide in prices started from the second week of March, said B. Raju, a retail trader in Sahakar Nagar.The Centre may be making efforts to provide toor dal for consumers at Rs. 120 a kg, but even before the government acts, the price in the open market may soon crash to Rs. 120 levels, if the past two months are any indication.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bengaluru Food Grains and Pulses Wholesale Merchants Association, said the prices are expected to slip further to below Rs. 120 levels before AugustSeptember, when it is expected to rally again.The stock limit of 2,000 quintals of all pulses for traders has effectively put the whole stock in the market today, leading to lowering of prices.The government has imported toor from South African countries and this will also flood the markets soon and bring down the prices further, he said, adding that the quality of the imported toor was unlikely to be accepted by the urban middle class market.With there being full stock in the open markets already, traders say that crashing prices may lead to increase in consumption again, leading to emptying of stocks before December, when the next crop is expected.If that happens, then we are likely to see a rally between September and December, but not at the 2015 levels, said Somashekhar, a pulses trader in New Taragupet.The plummeting price of toor dal is likely to have its impact on sowing during the coming kharif season, says Basavaraj Ingin, president of the Karnataka Red Gram Growers Association.He said the crashing prices may create panic among growers and lead to less sowing this year.However, senior officials in the Agriculture Department said even the price of Rs. 9,000 per quintal was beneficial to the farmer, and they would prefer toor crop to any other crop.He predicts an increase in the area of toor in the coming season.The government has fixed a target of covering 3.6 lakh hectares under toor cultivation this year.Meanwhile, unprocessed toor, which was being purchased at an all-time high record price of Rs. 12,500 per quintal has now crashed to Rs. 9,000 per quintal, and the arrivals of the unprocessed variety has trickled down to minimum due to the price fall. The farmers who had left over stocks of the pulse have withdrawn from the market expecting a good price.Kalaburagi farmers are particularly cautious this season, following mills closing down after a disastrous crop last year, said farmer leader Kodihalli Chandrashekhar. Our farmers are likely to begin sowing toor only in June third week after the region receives its first monsoon showers. Meanwhile, the sowing for moong in Old Mysuru region is likely to begin this week, keeping it ready for the monsoons, he said.The government has imported toor from South African countries and this will also flood the markets soon and bring down the prices furtherRamesh Chandra LahotiPresident, Bengaluru Food Grains and Pulses Wholesale Merchants Association"

At this juncture, Zilla Parishad chairperson Tula Uma intervened and stated that she received complaints about the irregularities in the same from various parts of the district.Stating that authorities have diluted the cause of providing government benefits to real beneficiaries, the ZP chairperson informed Joint Director (Agriculture) Sucharita to order for an inquiry and ensure that the tractors are provided to genuine beneficiaries.Earlier, the ZPTC members complained that the Agricultural Department officials failed to provide adequate seeds of various ID (irrigated dry) crops such as redgram, green gram, maize, etc. in the district.Boinpally ZPTC member K.

District collector Panna Lal Solanki clarified, ""The decision not to declare it drought-affected was based on the fact that the block had received 50% rainfall last year."" Rana Singh, an educated tribal, said that more than 5000 people migrated from the parched block leaving behind the elderly and cattle.To this, Solanki said, ""Things are under control now and people who migrated have returned.

The farmers of the district, who faced several hardships due to drought for two consecutive years, are expecting a good rainfall and have intensified their farm activities. Besides, the desiltation of the minor irrigation tanks under the Mission Kakatiya programme and taking up of other rain harvesting structures had also boosted the morale of farmers and are expecting a complete recharge of ground water table. During the last kharif season, farmers cultivated crops in only 3.43 lakh hectares against the normal area of cultivation on 5.2 lakh hectares. This year, the Agricultural Department is expecting cultivation on 5.15 lakh hectares. The authorities are also encouraging farmers to go in for ID (irrigation dry) crops instead of cotton crop. Against the normal area of cultivation of cotton in 2.26 lakh hectares during the kharif season, the authorities expect cotton to be cultivated only on 1.62 lakh hectares due to their awareness programmes. Maize cultivation would be increased from the normal area of 53,799 hectares to 83,669 hectares, soya cultivation would be increased to 31,761 hectares from the normal area of 9,744 hectares. Similarly, the green gram cultivation would be increased from 4,579 hectares to 10,742 hectares. The red gram cultivation would also increase from 5,422 hectares to 13,241 hectares.

But this years estimated targeted area is 1.3 lakh ha. It may even go up to 1.5 lakh ha, officials say.The hardy crop that can survive in scarce or excess rainfall seems to have endeared itself to farmers due to its qualities of ease of harvest, higher yields, stable prices and relatively high disease resistance, say experts.Traditional cropsBidar has been a traditional green gram and black gram growing area. But soya is slowly replacing them for reasons ranging from climatic conditions to perceived ease of cultivation, says C.R. Konda, head of the Bidar Agriculture Research station of the University of Agricultural Sciences, Raichur. In the last few years, we are witnessing heavy rainfall at the time of harvest of green gram and black gram, which is 60-70 days after sowing. Such showers can damage the crop, apart from making harvesting difficult. However, soya takes 110 days to mature and is not damaged by rain. In fact, it can be stored in hay stacks and thrashed a month later, to take out the pods. This is the prime reason for its popularity, says Dr. Konda.Farmers are inter-cropping soya with red gram, to ensure ease of cultivation.Secondly, soya is a rain fed crop and does not need protective irrigation. An acre of soya yields 8-10 quintals while the yield of green gram and black gram are around 4-7 quintals per acre. Soya is also relatively disease and pest free, he said.Crop like maize and soya replacing pulses seems to be the trend in many States, he points out. Pulses are slowly shifting to rabi due to the growing influence of soya and maize.In Karnataka, Bidar has a larger crop area compared to Belagavi and Dharwad, the other two soya growing districts, he said.Soya has been getting a stable price at the whole sale markets for some years now. That is an important point, says K. Ziaullah, Joint Director of Agriculture. Soya is selling at Rs. 4,000 per quintal and farmers are happy to get a return of Rs. 30,000-Rs. 35,000 per acre, he said.Constant supplyAccording to him, this is partly because of the soya-based industries in neighbouring Maharashtra that need a constant supply of the crop.The Agriculture Department has sought 86,000 quintal soya seeds from the State government.We are getting supplies of around 3,000 quintals every day by road. We hope to meet the need, said Mr. Ziaullah.Farmers in the district are inter-cropping soya with red gram to ensure ease of cultivation"

The bureau had given a clean chit to Khemka stating that all the allegations levelled in the complaint were false.After the bureau cleared him in the case, Khema recently lodged a formal complaint with the SVB seeking an FIR against those officials, including a retired IAS officer, who had tried to frame him in the case.Khemka had sought information about evidence and notices sent to the complainants - Jagbir Singh, a resident of Panipat and his ""brother"" Narbir Singh, a resident of Thanesar (Kurukshetra). However, the bureau informed him that both of them didn't join the inquiry. Giving details of its efforts, the SVB replied that it tried to contact them at least 12 times, apart from sending notices under the provisions of the CrPC. ""As per our inquiries, the persons mentioned in the complaint don't exist,"" says a senior officer of the bureau requesting anonymity.According to Khemka's letter to the DGP of SVB, the allegations in the complaint against him were of personal nature and in the normal course, the complainant was required to be summoned at the outset to testify the allegations made in the complaint. ""However, the first notice to the ghost complainant was sent by the SVB on April 23, 2014, i.e., a full eight months after the registration of the regular inquiry. It shows the SVB knew that the complaint was false and the inquiry was a witch-hunt,"" the bureaucrat claimed in the complaint.""Evidences on record prove beyond doubt that there was a criminal conspiracy to wrongly frame me,"" said Khemka, adding that a senior IAS officer (now retired) had misused his official position to concoct the false complaint. Vigilance bureau DGP Parminder Rai told the TOI that they were examining the legal aspects of Khemka's complaint.A complaint was made against Khemka, purportedly by Panipat resident Jagbir Singh in April 2013, after the official was transferred from Haryana Seeds Development Corporation. It said that the complainant was not given any tender form and the corporation gave order for summer moong seeds at a lower rate of Rs 8,100 per quintal to a private firm because ""low quality seeds were to be purchased"". However, the vigilance bureau probe found that the corporation saved Rs 30 lakh with the efforts of Khemka as he purchased the seed at the rate of Rs 8,100 in comparison to the previous Rs 8,400 per quintal."

Soon the sun wont seem as pleasant, but for now the two 10-ft tall elephants are taking a leisurely stroll, ears flapping, trunks swaying, through a verdant patch. Mahaut Kuliemimboro accompanies the two largest mammals at the zoo in their morning exercise. The walk, usually an hour long, has been cut to 45 minutes because of the heat.By the time they return to the elephant enclosure, a light breakfast, of 8 kg bananas, is ready. As Kuliemimboro explains, The bananas help maintain the water balance in body and protect Heera and Rajalakshmi from heat stroke.

The food meant for the elephants.Around 9 am, the elephants are led for a bath, where they are hosed down with special pressure pipes. As he ensures water washes every part of their body, Kuliemimboro says, The shower is not just to keep them cool. It is to know whether they are keeping well in the heat. Are they energetic and sprightly? Or do they appear tired? The morning shower answers these questions. It also creates trust. When they are scrubbed, they love it.While Heera appears to be enjoying his bath, Rajalakshmi stands quietly under an umbrella-shaped shelter. Kuliemimboro doesnt think there is any cause for worry. The elephants, brought to the zoo 30 years back from Kanpur, have not reported any illness this year. Originally from Assam, Kuliemimboro himself has been here only a year and earns Rs 15,000 a month.To be a keeper for elephants or the big cats, one needs to be at least Class X pass and have minimum three years of skilled experience. Kuliemimboro, who also looked after elephants back home, is a permanent employee, which means his salary is indexed to the Pay Commission and he gets Central government dearness allowance. Many of the employees, like Kuliemimboro, live in staff quarters on the premises.Satisfied all is well, Kuliemimboro next leads the elephants to a big, open sand pit where Heera and Rajalakshmi roll around in the mud, to cool their thick skin that has started heating up.Heera again seems to be having the most fun. Visitors have started trickling in by now, and as they watch him, he scrubs himself and deposits sand onto his back with his trunk.In summer, the number of sand pits is increased. The dust also guards the elephants from harmful sun rays and prevents itching, says Kuliemimboro.A diet chart for the summer has been put up in a 1010 ft room located around 500 metres away. Kuliemimboro goes by it to prepare the meal for the elephants with the help of two others.Again, in concession to the weather, it is mostly khichdi these days. About 30 kg of rice is made separately and mixed with 10 kg of moong dal and mustard oil. The cooking starts at 11 am, for the khichdi to be ready before 2 pm. It is then transferred to a special wheelbarrow-like trolley, where it is kept for cooling for three hours. Only at five, after the zoo is closed for visitors, will the meal be served, says Kuliemimboro.As evening sets in, Heera and Rajalakshmi retire to a semi-conical enclosure, open on one side. There is a partition in the middle to ensure they dont fight at night. By now the weather is cool enough for them not to need any special arrangements  making them an exception for the zoo.2 adult tigers, 4 cubs; 22,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for white tigers: 20-35 COn September 24 last year, Vijay had grabbed headlines for mauling to death a 20-year-old man who had fallen into his enclosure.

However, its too hot for that law of nature to work.So, like the tigers, six-year-old Salman, who was born at the zoo, is also given glucose. Plus, its food has been rationed to 5 kg of buffalo meat daily, from 7-8 kg at other times.Apart from a cooler, a special green shade blocks the sun and provides Salman respite from the heat, while also giving the animal that is known to be very shy a feel of wilderness. Such special arrangements have also been made for jackals and hyenas  two other creatures of the night.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.The shade keeps out 75 per cent of the sun rays. You will never find a leopard in the desert, which has no green cover. This green shade helps it feel at home even during the dry summers in Delhi, says Balle Ram, who has been guarding this enclosure for over two decades.The 50-year-old is a father of two, both of whom work as daily wagers, and says he wont be happy to retire. Pointing out that he has seen at least a dozen leopards come and go, he remarks, Sirf mausam badla hai, aur kuchch nahin (Only the weather has changed, nothing else).1 sloth bear and 6 Himalayan Black Bears: 20,000 sq m areaIdeal temperature for sloth bears: 20-30 C; for Himalayan bears: -2 to 18 CHere is a wild one getting special attention these days since a fellow sloth bear, all of 6, escaped the Hyderabad Zoo a month ago. It was reportedly disturbed due to the extreme heat.Riaz Khan says they cant take things lightly with their own sloth bear now.Known to be a reclusive animal, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear lives in an enclosure where two coolers work round-the-clock. But with its thick black fur still making the Capital heat almost unbearable, their diet has to be more closely monitored than that of others.A special addition is bael, the Indian fruit known as wood apple, offered at regular intervals. The wood apple controls excessive thirst. It also has medicinal value. Outdoor cooling can contribute only a little to maintaining the heat balance of the animal. It is only through diet that one can solve the problem of heat stroke, says Khan.Apart from bael, the bear is fed cucumbers, water melons, melons, cheeku and beetroot (around 2.5 kg of food in all daily). In winter, this is changed to a lot of sweet potato and singhara.While bears are omnivores, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear is by now a vegetarian. However, notes Khan, it is given kheer, prepared in the pantry, and eggs.Not in summer though. The bread and milk content is being reduced. We have also stopped giving eggs, especially when the temperature is very high, Khan says.Apart from the tigers, Fateh Singh also takes care of the bear enclosure.The enclosure for the Himalayan Black Bears, which have a similar diet, is nearby. It has four females, but the authorities havent been able to shift the two males in. Brought from Himachal Pradesh in March for breeding, they are still in a temperature-controlled room at the zoos veterinary hospital, slowly adapting to the climate.During their first two weeks here, sources say, the Black Bears were kept at zero-degree temperature. The bears were then shifted to a cool temperature, maintained by desert coolers. Currently, they are in a room with fans. We are slowly making them adapt to Delhis climate. They are responding well and should be out by the end of August. The females (who have been in the zoo for five years) will not get to see their male counterparts this summer, a source laughed.100 antelopes; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for deer: 25-30 CIn a first for the Delhi Zoo, the deer enclosure now has a 360-degree sprinkler. It is meant for the zoos most vulnerable species, the black buck, also known as the Indian antelope.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.Black bucks usually inhabit grassy plains and slightly forested areas. So this summer a hundred new plants were planned well in advance to make the enclosure greener.Due to their vulnerability, the special sprinklers are run once every two hours till the sun sets. So the enclosure is always moist and cool. After the installation, we have not received a single complaint from this enclosure during the summers, Khan says.The deer are fed green vegetables, bengal gram, wheat, maize and oats during the summer.Despite the special arrangement, it is here that the officials have had their biggest scare this time. In the last three months, 16 spotted deer have died due to suspected rabies. The enclosure is now out of bounds, with over 30 employees who work with them also undergoing a rabies vaccination programme.30 bird species; 8 cagesIdeal temperature for the birds: 20-30 CBefore the summer arrived, the bird enclave was given a complete makeover. This year the zoo has special glasshouses with agro net green shade. Besides, pipelines have been laid throughout to ensure that the water being delivered to the cages has glucose in it.Home to exotic birds with glorious plumes, Delhi Zoo knows this is one of the favourite areas for its visitors, especially children. From the macaw, known to be extremely intelligent and curious as well as friendly, to the critically endangered Blue Edward Pheasant, Khan says, they cant be too carefully with the diet of the birds.For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose. For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose.The Illigers Macaw, endangered in the wild due to deforestation, feeds usually on seeds, fruits and nuts. During the summer, special apples and water melons are provided to keep them cool.For the Golden Pheasant, who usually live in small groups and are a hit as they prefer to run rather than fly, the diet is green vegetable salad, bread, chana sattu and gauva.The macaw has been provided a special wooden area near the water to give it a feel of its natural habitat. This is to ensure that they keep coming to drink water, Khan says.The curator says there is another reason he and his staff at the bird enclosure are excited this summer. The zoo is expecting eggs of at least 24 exotic birds to hatch soon. The arrival of these chicks is being monitored closely at the hospital. The Silver and Golden Pheasant have laid over a dozen eggs each, with an incubation period of 20 days.We must monitor the temperature as well as humidity levels, smiles Khan.200 employeesOver 50 of them work in the animal section, which is the lifeline of the zoo. They take care of the feed and wellbeing of the animals.Close behind is the security section, including over 20 employees, who keep in touch over wireless as they guard the different enclosures. A supervisor heads the team and monitors the CCTV cameras.The garden section has over 20 employees, responsible for greenery at the zoo. They also maintain the small vermin compost unit to meet the zoos manure requirements.It is the garden section which has the oldest employee at the zoo. Mahender Mali, who is over 60 years of age, has been keeping this part of the Capital green for years. For me, zoo is home, says Mahender. I will be retiring soon, but I wish to continue contributing.Around 4 pm, as the visitors hasten to catch their last glimpse of the animals before the zoo shuts its gates, Riaz Khan steps out of the office for his last round of checking. Over the next 30 minutes, he enquires about animals in 12 enclosures.By 6 pm, before heading home, the staff has kept food in enclosures for the nocturnal animals, including foxes and hyenas.On the eastern side, some soaked grams, fruits and vegetables have been left out in a bowl.Before long, a porcupine emerges. As the zoo quietens, it is the hour of its largest rodent to feed.Colombo to HamburgIndira Gandhi was part of an ad-hoc committee of some prominent nature lovers of Delhi, headed by the chief commissioner, which got down to giving Delhi a zoo in 1952.Major Weinmann, Director of the Ceylon Zoological Garden, Colombo, was invited to help draw up a coordinated plan for development of the park. He submitted a report along with a preliminary plan. As he was not available for continued consultations, the committee approached Carl Hagenbeck, owner of the famous Animal Park at Hamburg, West Germany, who gave the idea of the open moat enclosures. He presented a preliminary report in March 1956 and provided a general layout plan of waterways, roads and paths, animal enclosures and sewage system.The Government of India approved the final plan on December 31, 1956.Even while the final touches were being given to the zoo, state government and individuals started gifting animals. The animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, foxes, deer and birds, were initially kept in temporary enclosures around Azimganj Sarai, a courtyard built for travellers during the Mughal days.The park was formally inaugurated on November 1, 1959."

While Moong Kopargaon variety packet would now cost 75 more, the price of Utkarsh variety were hiked by 300 for a packet of 5kg.Similarly, Urad TU-1 variety's 5kg packet would now cost 600 more. Tur ICP-8863 variety of seeds will see a hike of 80 per kg. Just at a time when farmers were finding some cheer in forecast of good rainfall this season, the seed price hike by the government company has come as a shock. He has urged the chief minister to rollback the prices to give some respite to farmers from rising input costs that is making their occupation unremunerative."

Chilli crops would be cultivated in over 25,000 hectares, maize in 14,000 hectares, red gram in 4,000 hectares and green gram in 6,000 hectares in present kharif season.The Agriculture Department has laid a renewed focus on encouraging farmers to go in for crop diversification and raise irrigated dry crops such as red gram and other pulses as an alternative to the water intensive cotton crop. We have conducted a series of workshops in the cotton intensive mandals to motivate farmers to take up cultivation of pulses crops like red gram and green gram as an alternative to cotton, says Manimala, Joint Director of Agriculture, Khammam. Adequate quantity of fertilizer and seed have been stocked at the distribution points for sale through the primary agricultural cooperative societies and other designated institutions at subsidised prices to farmers all over the district."

This is likely to encourage farmers to increase the agricultural activities in the district.There had been a lull in cultivation related works in recent months owing to the failure of pre-monsoon showers. The district had received 163.5 mm of rainfall from January so far this year as against the expected 245.8 mm of rainfall.Change in patternFor the past few years, the district has been witnessing plentiful pre-monsoon showers. It had received over 29.7 mm rainfall during the months of January, February and March in 2015. This year however, for the same period, the district received just 10.8 mm rainfall. This had discouraged farmers from conducting agricultural activities. In the previous years, farmers had already sown Bt cotton, pulses such as black gram, green gram and cowpea, and oilseeds such as sunflower and sesame, by this time.Mr. M. Mahanteshappa, Joint Director of Agriculture, told The Hindu on Tuesday that sowing is yet to pick up in the district. He hoped that the rains in the last 12 days would encourage the farmers to take up sowing. So far, sowing has been completed in over 1,68,107 hectares of land, including rain-fed and irrigated land, as against the target of 3,88,220 hectares, he said.Cultivation of pulsesMr. Mahanteshappa added that by this time last year, pulses such as green gram, black gram, cowpea, red gram were grown in over 92,800 hectares, while this year the same are being cultivated in 34,450 hectares only.Sowing of hybrid jowar, cotton, tobacco, ground nut, apart from pulses, had also come down this year owing to the failure of pre-monsoon rains; he said and noted that sowing was carried out only in 61 per cent of the total targeted area.Cotton is being grown in just 34,300 hectares as against the target of 47,800 hectares. Similarly tobacco is being grown in 65,700 hectares as against the target of 70200 hectares.Mr. Mahanteshappa added that sowing of green gram and black gram could not be taken on hereafter for the season, as there still was time for cowpea, horse gram and avare.He was confident that sowing would be carried in all the targeted areas in the coming days. He claimed that the agriculture officers have been instructed to make field visits and help and educate farmers about scientific cultivation."

But it is yet to be popular in Jharkhand.This is because the state farmers are apprehensive about cultivating pulse in place of the traditional paddy.To clear this bottleneck, the department of agriculture and experts are jointly focusing on improving the production of pulses ahead of the kharif season this year.Director of state agriculture department Jata Shankar Choudhary said that there has been a marked improvement in pulse production since the launch of National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in which pulse is a major component. ""As against three lakh hectare land under pulse cultivation in state, the area has doubled to six lakh hectare in the last two years,"" he said.He added that this qualified the state for winning the Krishi Karman award twice. Choudhary said that it was because of the farmers' reluctance to opt for any new crop, that the department and agriculture extension centres are still trying hard to popularize pulse cultivation.About 77% area of pulses in Jharkhand is available in 15 districts namely Gumla, Palamu, Simdega, Garhwa, Latehar, Ranchi, West Singhbhum, Seraikela, Dumka, Giridih, Lohardaga, Hazribagh, Pakur, Chatra and Sahebganj. All these 15 districts of Jharkhand have been included under NFSM-Pulses in which special support including subsidy on high yielding varieties of seeds are given to the farmers.Agriculture secretary, Nitin Madan Kulkarni said that in the 1st phase of NFSM, the government thrust on pulses has been in Palamu, Garhwa, Chatra, Simdega and Lohardaga districts.He has asked district development managers (DDMs) of National Agriculture Bank for Rural Development and State Agriculture Management and Extension Training Institute (SAMETI) to organize town hall meetings in all the districts.In this meetings, progressive farmers will be invited to indicate the quantity of pulse seeds (and arhar seeds in particular) available withthem for distribution during the ensuing season. ""The government will provide details of government schemes and support to the farmer club members,"" he said.At the national level, Jharkhand ranks seventh in pigeon pea (arhar),eighth in urad and 12th in moong daal production whereas it is yet to catch up with the top ten states in the production of chickpea(chana) and lentils (masoor)."

Not because its a remake of the Malayalam hit Vellimoonga. (Most of our remakes miss out on whatever made the original film worth watching.)Not because of comedy scenes like the one in which a man gifts his girl an iPad, only to see her use it as a plate to shape dough for vadais. Not even because of the other comedy scene where the heroine embraces the hero and pulls back because something is poking her, and he whips out a police siren (of course!) he had hidden in his clothes.My fear was that someone would ask me what film Id be reviewing this week, and Id have to find a way to not look terribly embarrassed while mumbling: Muthina Kathirikka. Really! Was this film made in Kodambakkam or Kothawal Chavadi?Sundar C plays the titular vegetable  the name is a reference to this forty-something man who never married, and is still looking for a girl 25 years or younger. Because if a woman isnt married by then, somethings wrong with her.The heroine (named Maya) is Poonam Bajwa, but its more interesting to note the actress who plays her mother: Kiran Rathod.This isnt just about the resemblance  they both look vaguely vacuous in that blubbery, what-is-a-gym? way so beloved by Tamil and Telugu audiences.This is about the fact that Kiran Rathod, at 35, is in Kollywood what a muthina kathirikka would be in Kothawal Chavadi. (Sundar C is 48!) Its pointless to crunch these numbers, I know, but its also fun  especially when you consider that the Sundar C characters mother is played by Sumithra, who is just about 60.All of which is a way to get around talking about the film, directed by Venkat Raghavan. Frankly, there isnt much to talk about.A few scattered laughs, maybe. The story is about Muthupandi (Sundar C), who wants to become a politician. He also wants to marry Maya, despite the fact that he went to school with Mayas mother and had a crush on her. Watching this film after Enakku Innoru Per Irukku was an exercise in dj vu. More cuckolded-husband comedy. More VTV Ganesh. More Yogi Babu. More appropriation from Ilayaraja. This time, a clash between brothers is underscored by music from Agni Natchatiram. And when a man says the married woman he is assumed to be having an affair with is like his sister, we hear Andha vaanatha pola which doesnt even make sense.

Corporation invited expression of interest from the mill owners. But the poor quality of dal and high amount of waste during milling has the mill owners complaining.Sources said the wastage was found to be very high at 32%.

Ultimately, they have got trapped in huge debts arising out of high input costs as compared to output costs, said Shri Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavalamban Mission chairman and farm activist Kishore Tiwari""A close look at the market strategy followed by the cultivation cost will prove that Bt cotton is a total failure in rain-fed regions like Vidarbha,"" Tiwari said, adding that it is high time to promote indigenous seeds of all crops, including cotton.""It is our experience that only indigenous seeds can suit rain-fed farms and only they can ensure sustainable farming in the region,"" Tiwari said.The Nagpur-based Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) has been trying to achieve high density cotton cultivation in the region, he added.""To meet this goal, we have started a novel programme of distributing indigenous seeds of cotton, tur and moong to 133 farmers in Aawalgaon village of Yavatmal district recently. The aim is to encourage farmers to produce their own seeds out of the distributed 4 quintals of seeds free of cost,"" Tiwari said, adding that the Aawalgaon pattern would be introduced in the entire state in a phased manner.""There shall be a seed bank in each village so that the needy farmers would be given the seeds from it,"" he added. Aawalgaon is situated over 80km from Yavatmal and it is a tribal dominated village in Maregaon tehsil. Close to 80% of the villagers belong to Kolam community. ""To save Kolam tribals, we have set up a seed bank and free seeds are being distributed to them for the ongoing kharif sowing,"" Tiwari added.""Our special attention is that farmers should be encouraged to produce their own seeds and they should cultivate the seeds with less production cost so that the earning would be more,"" Tiwari further said, adding that the state-owned seed company Mahabeej would buy seeds from the farmers and market them in the state at a reasonable price."

Sowing of most of the crops require good soil moisture for germination and the required dampness in the upper layers of soil comes only with the help of at least 70 mm rainfall, officials of Agriculture Department said adding that many mandals have not recorded that amount of rain so far.Sowing of seed of crops such as maize, cotton, red gram, jowar and others, besides paddy, could be done till the third week of July, the officials said. Cultivation of cotton is likely to remain high in such circumstances, in spite of the government efforts to bring it down to 10.64 lakh hectares this year against last years 17 lakh hectares.The crop has already been cultivated in nearly half of the total extent covered in kharif season as the plans to encourage soybean and maize in place of cotton have fallen flat due to delayed rains and institutional credit.The State Government has prepared orders to release Rs. 2,019 crore out of Rs.4,040 crore required for writing off the third quarter of the crop loan waiver.Official sources said that renewal of crop loan accounts linked to the waiver scheme is likely to be delayed for over a week due to the time consumed in percolation of the information along with necessary orders by the controlling officers of banks till the branch level.The actual rainfall in 125 out of 443 mandals where crops are cultivated is either deficit or scanty till date, although it is normal or excess in the remaining mandals.

The department of women and child development has expressed its reservations at kindergarten sections being opened in government schools across Dakshina Kannada district. Parents, the department fears, are opting for schools instead of anganwadis.The issue was discussed at a KDP meeting and the district administration ordered that no LKG, UKG sections should operate in schools when there is an anganwadi nearby. ""We are worried that opening KG section in government schools would deprive children from getting nutritional food, which is specially designed to keep malnutrition at bay and helps in healthy growth of children,"" said Sundar Poojary, deputy director, department of women and child welfare.According to a recent survey, DK has identified 128 malnourished children.In DK, there are around 2,102 anganwadis, including 20 which are mini anganwadis that are looked after by one person. The centres operate from 9.30am to 4pm, during which kids from six months to six years are given day care facilities.

58f6b702a3d24b0b70c2e45b,Why pulses rates skyrocketed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/Why-pulses-rates-skyrocketed/article14405613.ece,2016-06-28,"Pulses, the common mans food, have gone beyond the reach of millions with the government failing to rein in the crisis extending across the country since March, 2015. Lethargy and mismanagement by the State government, problems of a mismatch in demand-supply, and rigidity in the supply chain, owing to a narrow stock limit, were further compounded by the extended two-year drought in the State.Maharashtra, somehow, failed to put a finger on the pulses crisis. Not only did the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-headed government in the State miss a few tricks, it moved slowly and clumsily in intervening to stem the prices during the peak crisis period between March and October, 2015.The governments mismanagement even spurred action by the Prime Ministers Office which had to intervene to correct the misinterpretation of central orders. On October 28, 2015, Joint Secretary to Prime Minister, Anurag Jain, wrote to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis: Stock limit shall apply to any stock held by dealers after the first sale by importer.The limit was for wholesale traders to maintain less than 5,000 quintals of pulse stock in Mumbai; 3,500 quintals in other areas, and 1/9th of last three years crushing dal stocks with millers.Meanwhile, between April 10 last year and April 11 this year, the prices jumped by 60.35% for tur, 83.55% for urad, and 43.57% for gram.The State has so far shown little urgency in lifting the un-milled pulses from the Centres buffer stock (at Rs. 66 per kg, to be sold in the retail market at Rs. 120 per kg). With a prospective shortfall of 13,00,000 metric tonnes this year, the State failed to lift two instalments from the buffer stock totalling 17,000 tonnes. This stock is now gathering dust at Food Corporation of India (FCI) godowns at Latur, Akola, Jalgaon, Udgir and Yavatmal. The mismanagement of the crisis did not end with this. In October 2015, the government misinterpreted central directives and lifted the stock limit on pulses at 4 p.m. on October 19. This was followed by midnight raids on consignments at ports and seizure of nearly 74,846 tonnes of pulses from alleged hoarders.Traders, importers and millers claim the States reaction delivered a disastrous signal to the market, which reacted with a further price hike. All the government did was, paint the entire trading community as hoarders and black marketers. The government must facilitate trade instead of trying to micro regulate it during a crisis such as this, said Prem Kogta, president of the Jalgaon Dal Mill Owners Association.Not a single action was taken against the big corporate retail chains found selling pulses at higher rates, while importers and traders working on wholesale prices  that remained lower than retail prices all through 2015  faced the brunt. Chains like Big Bazaar, Reliance Fresh did not face any music at all while the importers and miller were hounded, said Navin Bhai, former secretary of Grain Rice and Wholesale Merchants Association (Mumbai).The seized stock was later returned to the same traders who had faced government action under the Essential Commodities Act, and the stock limit was scalede back until September 30, 2016. Unable to control the crisis, the State appointed a Price Monitoring Committee on December 28 last year to regulate the rates of 27 essential commodities, including onion and potato. The committee suggested introduction of a Price Control Act to ensure traders prepare a rate chart, and sell pulses at fixed prices. The punishment for violation was proposed as jail term of three months or one year.The Bill is currently pending approval by President Pranab Mukherjee. The trigger for the draft Bill was hoarding and profiteering by traders. It cannot be denied that traders are creating artificial shortages to jack up prices, there is an urgent need for a Bill to control prices, the Act will allow traders to appeal to Divisional Commissioners, a Cabinet note of April, 2016 reads.Historical mismatchIn 1956, India was producing 120 lakh tonnes of pulses for a population of 42 crore.In 2015-2016, production of pulses is estimated at 17.06 million tonnes, while the demand for it stands at 23.5 million tonnes.Our population kept increasing but the pulse production remained static. The per capita consumption dropped to 40 gm per person from 68 gm in the 1950s, the yield too dipped to about eight quintal an acre from 12 quintal. Slowly, the farmers abandoned pulses because its yield was three times less than wheat, and when the governments minimum support price too supported wheat, that was the end of pulse production in India. The successive governments did not make any long term plans. It (crisis) has now exploded, explained Sunil Baltewa, executive member of the New Delhi Grind Merchants Association.Buffer stockThe fears of buffer stock going waste were raised at a meeting of the State price monitoring committee on pulses on April 21 this year. Members of the committee revealed that the government is yet to chalk out a plan to transport 7,367.5 tonnes of tur, urad and chana to the milling units due to disagreement of prices. The government has no clue where the milling and polishing of the naked grain is going to be carried out or what will be the recovery percentage millers are going to charge. All this, while a huge stock is lying at the FCI godowns. This government is just lethargic, said Nitin Kalantari, manufacturer of Pistol Dal, a popular brand in Marathwada.A senior FCI official said they had started procuring pulses since January  tur at Rs 8,900 per quintal, urad at Rs. 4,800 per quintal and chana at Rs. 10,800 per quintal. But we do not yet have information on what the State wants to do with this stock, whether they want to distribute it through PDS or auction it directly into the market. We do not have any experience of distribution or transportation, said G.S. Rajasekhar, general manager, FCI (Maharashtra).Consumer, the fall guyThe ultimate impact of the pulse crisis is being felt by the average consumer, who is forced to cut down on his daily consumption. On an average, a single family in Maharashtra consumes 200 gm of tur daily, which goes up during the festive season.Low-income homes are either cutting down on consumption or trying to substitute tur with moong which has more amount of nutrient value. Earlier, when tur was around Rs. 100/Rs. 120, I used to buy two to three kg per month for my family, but now prices have increased to about Rs. 200/ Rs. 220. We have cut our consumption to 1-1.5 kg. The prices of vegetables are also high, it is becoming hard to manage kitchen, said Balkrishna D. Kadam, 53, a security guard who lives with his family of five in a chawl at Grant Road. Mr. Kadams monthly income is Rs. 8,000.The retail prices of tur and moong are touching Rs. 160 and Rs. 175 per kg. The all-India retail prices have hovered around Rs. 200 through June, only to settle at Rs. 198 per kg on June 21. I only cook dal once a week now. I now cook more dishes using potatoes, since even other vegetables are getting costly. I cant disturb the family budget, as it will now cost me Rs. 800 to Rs. 820 for the same consumption. I dont want to compromise with my childrens education or medical requirement of the family, said Ms. Kanchan Jalandariya, 42, a Grant Road resident.(With inputs from Sourabh Jain, Aditya Jain)"

The only hope for the recovery  that could dramatically turn around the fortunes of the Railways  now hinges on the Supreme Court, a key official in the Railway Board told The Hindu .The developments come even as the Railways have withdrawn the higher freight charges iron ore exporters had to pay under the 2008 policy, which they avoided illegally.According to sources, the Railways on May 9 issued a freight rate circular, abolishing the dual freight policy in iron ore transportation, eight years after it was implemented. According to the new circular, the exporters would now only pay the same fare for exporting iron ore out of India as those for domestic manufacturers who use ore to make steel within the country.A CAG audit report tabled in May 2015 estimated that the Railways could recover Rs. 29,236.77 crore from the exporters who transported iron ore meant for export on freight charges meant for domestic consumption movements. The loss estimates were for a period from May 2008 upto September 2013."

And if that sounds judgmental and presumptuous, youre right. I was judgmental and presumptuous about the womenfolk in my family who laboured away in the kitchen to dish out tasty treats for foodies like me. Till one such day when reality hit me. And how?I was to get married and live alone with my husband, with no one to cook for us. Fortunately for me, I had no romantic notions about marriage that love-struck couples can survive on love and thin air alone. I knew we needed our three meals a day  fresh, tasty and healthy. But, cooking and me? A chit of a girl whod always treated cooking with disdain?Well, coming back to the problem, hiring a cook was not an option. What would my in-laws think? A crash course in cooking was out of the question, too. With the wedding just a month away, I was working, and shopping, and getting ready for the D-Day, all at once.So, the next best thing was to jot down all my moms recipes, to experiment later. I quickly grabbed a blue diary, dragged my mom out of the kitchen, and started noting down recipes for everything from simple chutneys to complicated biryanis.Along the way, I realised I was ignorant when it came to the names of dals. Painstakingly, I explained each dal with my own understanding of it. Toor dal was sambhar dal, green gram was kosambari dal, and so on. Once done, I felt like I had conquered the kitchen. The blue diary occupied the pride of place in my wedding trousseau, holding within its hallowed pages culinary secrets that promised to make me a great cook.Post-honeymoon, the first thing I did on entering the kitchen was to open my blue diary and look for the simplest of recipes. It was tomato bele saaru (rasam). Thus began my culinary journey, with the blue diary religiously by my side. I quickly graduated from saaru to gravy to pulao and biriyani. Of course, not without the blue diary by my side. Recipes from glossy books were not for me. Even if I saw an interesting recipe, I had to first note it down in my blue diary before trying it out. My strong belief was that only recipes that came out of my blue diary worked their magic.Over the years, the blue diary attracted more recipes, and oil splatter, too. Dog-ears and the fading colours of its pages notwithstanding, it continued to be my cooking bible. It was highly personalised, too, as only I could understand the recipes therein, what with my own notes in a nice combination of my mother tongue and English.Recently, post my week-long vacation, I opened the kitchen cabinet to pull my blue diary out, and what did I see? Horror of horrors, my sacred book had been feasted upon by termites. It was in tatters. Tears rolled down my cheeks. Out of frustration, out of anger. Of all the books at home, which are quite a few, termites had to target my blue diary. The same diary that had changed my attitude toward cooking, the same one that had given me the confidence to master culinary skills. And, most of all, the one that had marked my journey from ignorance to struggle to triumph.My dear blue diary, I miss you."

The flowering pattern and consequent harvesting time was not simultaneous for both crops. Farmers have to incur huge expenditure in terms of labour for harvesting the crops at different periods. But the simultaneous flowering period will enable them take up integrated harvest of both crops, says A. Mahalingam, scientist of the Centre.The Centre had introduced VBN (Gg) 2, a green gram variety, a decade ago. It has introduced Vamban 8, a black gram variety. Both VBN (Gg) 2 and Vamban 8 can be raised and harvested simultaneously, says R.P. Gnanamalar, Head of the Centre. The black gram crop duration is 60 to 65 days and green gram is 70 to 75 days.Both crops are resistant to diseases like yellow mosaic virus. The average yield would be 900 kg per hectare.Farmers who visited the Centre said that they had not seen such tall green gram plants."

The minister said it was high time the scientists brought out more high yielding varieties of pulses.""2016 has been marked as the International Year of Pulses. So, we want scientists to come up with newer high yielding varieties of black gram, green gram, red gram and other pulses. More focus should be given to black gram, because the country faced its shortage last year leading to prices skyrocketing and forcing the country to import the same,"" Doraikannu said.The state agriculture minister also urged scientists to come up with state-specific varieties of oilseeds. ""Presently, our farmers are dependent on oilseeds brought out in other states. We need to come out with a variety of oilseed that suits our state's conditions. It is also TNAU's responsibility to ensure that breeder seeds of varieties brought out in other states are available for our farmers,"" he said.Pointing out that the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University has come out with around 100 new innovative farming technologies and 30 new farm equipment in the past five years, Doraikannu urged both the scientists and farmers to use them effectively.""The state government will complement the efforts taken by the university to strengthen all aspects of research, including innovating researches on using water efficiently,"" the state agriculture minister said. Stressing on the importance of agriculture, Doraikannu said ""farming and education were the two eyes of the government"".""The university attracted 1,430 in funds in the past five years for research and development.

The country had imported 5.78 million tonnes in the entire 2015-16 fiscal to meet domestic demand.""Imports are happening. About 1.2-1.3 million tonnes of pulses have already been imported. Moreover, private traders have contracted for 3 million tonnes of pulses to be shipped between September and December,"" India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) Chairman Pravin Dongre told .Asked about the landed cost of imported pulses, he said it is Rs 32-33 per kg for yellow peas, Rs 92-93 for tur dal, Rs 105-106 for urad, Rs 65 for masoor and Rs 58-60 for moong.Importers are selling it to millers and wholesellers at a very less margins, he said.On overall imports for this fiscal, Dongre said it would depend on monsoon.""If monsoon is good as projected, domestic production will increase. Then imports will be less in the last quarter of this fiscal,"" IPGA Vice Chairman Bimal Kothari said.IPGA said the pulses prices have gone up in domestic market due to fall in production on account of poor and unseasonal rains in two consecutive crop years.Pulses production fell to 17.06 million tonnes in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) from 17.15 million tonnes in the previous year. In 2013-14, output was over 19 million tonnes.As a result, retail prices of pulses have shot up with Tur and urad dals selling at as high as Rs 180 per kg and Rs 198 per kg, respectively, in the retail markets.Chana dal is being sold at Rs 105 per kg, while moong and masoor at Rs 130 and Rs 110 per kg respectively.The government recently decided to enhance the buffer stock limit of pulses to 8 lakh tonnes for making market intervention when prices firm up in retail markets. It is also importing pulses to boost domestic supply.So far, 1.19 lakh tonnes of pulses has been procured from farmers for creating buffer stock and 46,000 tonnes have been contracted for imports.

In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"

This zone comprises 36% of the total value of unsold flats in MMR. But this area has only 4% of the 1.71 lakh flats in the MMR. Till June-end, there were 6,214 unsold apartments in south central Mumbai.Mumbai topped the list with highest sales volume growth of 22.93% in the residential segment, followed by Bengaluru with a growth of 18%. Hyderabad saw an increase of 8.10%, while the Pune market remained stagnant. Samantak Das, chief economist and national director of Knight Frank India, said, ""South central Mumbai (Parel, Worli, Nepean Sea Road, Colaba) is the most expensive real estate market in India. It is bigger than the entire Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Ahmedabad markets.'' ""The current unsold inventory in south central Mumbai will take five to six years to sell,'' added Gulam Zia, executive director, Knight Frank. Independent property market sources expect an estimated 2,500 apartments in this area to hit the market in the next one year, which could lead to a major glut. Every year, builders in south central Mumbai sell Rs 8,000-10,000 crore worth of apartments.""While the National Capital Region (NCR) of Delhi has the highest unsold inventory of 2,00,398 units, MMR has the highest value of unsold inventory at Rs 1.80 lakh crore,'' said the report NCR and MMR alone account for 62% of the country's inventory of Rs 3.90 lakh crore.

This is down by 54% from the 2,32,490 units that was observed in H12013. NCR witnessed the sharpest drop in new launches, at 41% year-on-year (YOY), followed by Chennai and Pune, at 36% and 32%, respectively. ""Mumbai turned out to be a surprise, as the city noted growth in new launches by more than 29% YOY in H1 2016,'' said the report. In terms of sales, the top six cities observed a positive growth of 7% in H12016, as the number of units sold jumped from 1,26,615 in H1 2015 to 1,35,015 in the latest period. But this is considerably lower than 1,85,800 units sold across these cities in H12015.Meanwhile, according to the half-yearly report released by the real estate consultancy, Cushman & Wakefield, Pune saw the highest drop in absorption of office spaces over the first half of the year (41%), after Chennai (51%). These cities, among the major eight cities, were followed by Mumbai (-36%) and Bangalore (-34%), where also the negative growth was seen to be significant.The reason cited by Cushman & Wakefield was ""unavailability of quality Grade A space in many cities, and prevalence of small-sized deals"""

So far only 30% of the area has been brought under cultivation against the target of 159.57 lakh hectares.Till Friday, the total area sown was 48.85 lakh hectares. Soybean which is prime crop in Hadauti region, has crossed the 50% mark because of normal rainfall in the region. Sowing of other major crops has slowed down after initial kick start. Pulses which are produced in abundance in the state have been able to achieve just 27% of the target.""The data clearly indicates that there has been lower sowing. This could be because of delayed arrival of south-west monsoon in Rajasthan,"" said an official. However, they are confident that as monsoon will gather pace and spread across the state, sowing too will go up. ""Kharif is a monsoon crop. If it rains properly then may be we would cross all our targets before end of July,"" added the official.Among cereals, total area of paddy sown is 3,500 hectare (19%) while jowar has achieved 2.15 lakh hectares (34.2%). Bajra and maize have been cultivated over 13.4 lakh hectare and 5.81 lakh hectares, respectively. However, for the officials the major concern is slow cultivation of pulses. They claim that by mid-July all sowing is likely to be finished.""Barring urad which has been sown on 1.74 lakh hectares reaching 58% of its target rest all pulses are still to gain speed.

Each data-backed allegation is matched by another figure, complete with decimal points, and the gaps are often the size of Indian Ocean, leaving voters to wonder what were the two sides smoking, or injecting. Metaphors must move with the times.In Punjab, they have. Rahul Gandhi, clearly briefed to the hilt with data, informed us that 70 percent of Punjab's youth were drug addicts. Punjab's Minister of Health and Family Welfare Surjit Kumar Jayani marked the International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking by giving us the good news, citing and interpreting an AIIMS report, that only one percent of the states population was addicted to drugs, a marked improvement over the 16 percent figure given under oath to a High Court by Punjab's Department of Social Security and Women and Child Development in May 2009.More good news came earlier this year when Punjab's Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badal worked the data a little more to inform us that out of the 2.77 crore population of the state, only 0.06% was found abusing drugs.""Union Minister of State for Social Justice and Empowerment Vijay Sampla took a simpler route. When an AIIMS study, commissioned by his ministry, estimated that Punjabis were spending Rs 7,575 crore annually on opioid drugs, Sampla rejected the findings and asked AIIMS to conduct a proper survey all across India. Reason? He said his gut feeling was that the AIIMS study was ""not authentic.""From complete denial to grudging acceptance and then doomsday scenarios, the row over Udta Punjab did two things - it took those in denial by the scruff of their neck and forced them to have a real, hard look at the problem, and it created enough hullabaloo for vast sections in India and abroad to think the worse of Punjabis.Lying somewhere in between, the truth is neither very appealing nor so repulsive.Is the drug problem in Punjab exaggerated? Most certainly. Is the state government trying a cover up? Most blatantly. Should we worry no end? Yes, unless you want to wait till you find a packet in your child's schoolbag. Is the government serious about dealing with the problem? Well, this is no time for jokes.Does the government have a strategy to tackle it on both law and order front as well as on health front? Well, if it has, it must be one of the most closely guarded secrets.We have blamed everyone, with the exception of ISIS: from Pakistan to AIIMS researchers to political opponents to Bollywood filmmakers.The only people seriously fighting against drug abuse are the drug addicts. The National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre (NDDTC) at the AIIMS found that 80% of opioid dependent addicts in Punjab had tried to wriggle out of the quagmire they found themselves in, and they did so by opting for the Opiate Substitution Therapy. Endorsed by the WHO as well as by the Indian Psychiatric Society, it requires users to go through a course of opioate medicines, available only at de-addiction centres run by the state.This was the most cost-effective means. Opioate medicines are inexpensive, less than $1 a day, and compared to what addicts were spending on the dope, the treatment is affordable. However, the state's capacity to mess up is unfathomably huge.Just as it misinterprets data from surveys and studies, the Punjab Government seems to have a poor understanding of rules governing Opioid Substitution Therapy. It allows such a course of treatment for only the licensed in-patient centres. On top of that, a misperception prevails among the kin of victims who think a few days at a de-addiction centre and taking opioate medicines diligently would cure them.Both need to change. Expertsare unequivocal in saying that the Opioid Substitution Therapy must be available to out-patients and should thus be part of clinic-based health services. Also, that it takes years of sustained treatment to shun drugs, not a few days.PiyushMahajan, a third-year junior resident at the Department of Psychiatry, Government Medical College, Amritsar, in a recent article described in chilling detail how doctors often have to deal with ""aggressive, impulsive, abusive"" addict patients, unlike the picture of a patient lying prostate on the couch and bantering with the doctor in TV serials dealing with the turf, such as In Treatment. Even in the din of allegations and Udta Punjab row, we did not hear a word about training doctors to deal with this category of patients, a flaw very symptomatic of the lack of seriousness that has permeated all layers of stakeholders.Only a people in a stupor think in terms of binaries. The ruling alliances spin is to ask people to decide if it is a humungous problem or an exercise to defame Punjab. The opposition's focus is on whether making drugs a centrepiece of its election campaign can pave the road to power. As for the media, it timed its coverage to depict how easily one can find drugs in Punjab. Every channel worth its name ran a sting operation in the bylanes of some major town. Seriously? You need a sting operation to prove what is easily available?When complex socio-political issues, nuanced statistical interpretations and inferences and accountability of multiple stakeholders are all negotiated with the larger masses through a Bollywood movie, it is a sign of a bankruptcy of ideas, or a refusal to grapple with a problem that has tentacles far too many and which run too deep.Countering drug abuse needs job creation, industry revival, massive push into agriculture research and extension, proactive engagement with the institution of gram sabha, better investment in government-run school system that is currently in a shambles, and an inspired initiative to put doctors, equipment and medicines in civil dispensaries and hospitals.Better vigil at the border is a no-brainer, as are police reforms. A sick education and health system, coupled with stagnant farms pushes people into the welcoming fold of drug dealers. At the same time, a political culture that privileges conspicuous consumption acts as a pull factor. Together, the push and pull powers are sucking Punjabis deeper into the vortex.In an irony that would be too comical, if not tragic, scores of gyms in Punjab play songs that glorify drugs, guns, foreign brands of cars and talk about revenge-seeking mindset in adulatory tones.The only simple remedy is to recognise that any solutions will have to deal with the complexity of the problem. So far, all three claimants to power in Punjab have fallen short. The ruling Akali Dal denies the severity of the problem, the Congress' near-anointed chief ministerial candidate Amarinder Singh says he will solve the problem in four weeks, and AamAadmi Party says they themselves are the solution.When in doubt, blame the foreign hand. Amarinder Singh has now said elements in BSF are hand in glove with Pak Rangers and are letting drugs into the country. Sukhbir Singh Badal has been demanding better border control. We have so far been spared a demand a la Donald Trump to erect a wall along Punjab's border with Rajasthan.In the best traditions of escapism, we went to the cinema halls, but PehlajNehalani made sure that Udta Punjab, instead of taking us by the scruff of our neck and forcing us to look at the drugs problem, primarily serves to bring some much needed correctives to the Censor Board.Whatever it is that our politicians are smoking, it surely is powerful stuff, worth its weight in gold. Or chitta? How else would you describe the refusal of all sides to link liquor with drug addiction, something every addict and his uncle knows?(The writer is a senior journalist based in Chandigarh.)"

But he was not satisfied. Hailing from a family of farmers, he wanted to do something different. Once, he visited an agri expo in Delhi and that proved a turning point in his life. He quit his job and started cultivating aloe vera and other crops on his 120-acre farmland.We are talking about Harish Dhandev, whose turnover from his farmland is from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore per annum now. He has also opened his own company 'Naturelo Agro' at Dhaisar, 45 kilometres from Jaisalmer. Aloe vera grown in Thar Desert is being supplied in huge quantity to Patanjali Food Products Limited for making aloe vera juice.The quality of aloe vera grown in desert area is so good that there is a heavy demand for it in national and international markets. Experts at Patanjali found the quality of aloe vera so good that they immediately placed orders for its leaves. Dhandev's risk has paid off. He says that he had got a job of junior engineer with Jaisalmer Municipal Council, but his heart always craved for something else. So he resigned from his government job. He had land and water, but no idea. He wanted to grow something new. Last year, he visited an agriculture expo at Delhi, where he got an idea to grow aloe vera, amla and gunda. Generally , in desert, bajra, wheat, moong, mustard etc are grown, but he thought of growing something new. He grew 'babie densis' variety of aloe vera on his 120-acre field.This variety is so good that it is in high demand in Brazil, Hong Kong and America too.Initially, he had planted around 80,000 saplings of aloe vera, which now he has increased to seven lakh. He said that in last four months, he has sent 125-150 tonnes of processed aloe vera pulp to Patanjali factories in Haridwar.Dhandev also said that aloe vera leaves are processed in a modern way for which a facility has been set up."

Many farmers in the cotton belt of Punjab have switched to paddy despite lesser availability of groundwater as the region is fed by canals, hoping to avoid losses they suffered on account of the pest attack in 2015.Punjab agriculture department has set the target of bringing 27.50 lakh hectares under paddy and basmati this year. In 2015, area under paddy-basmati and cotton was 28.50 lakh hectares and 4.50 lakh hectares. This year cotton has been sown over 2.56 lakh hectares (a drop of 43.11% as compared to the previous year) -the lowest in the past 61 years.Sources said area under paddy could surge in the state with Malwa farmers shifting from cotton as they feared repeat attack of whitefly on the fibre crop. Farmers in the cotton-growing areas of Punjab have grown paddy ignoring the advice from the agriculture department on hopes of assured marketing as entire crop is procured by the government agencies at minimum support price (MSP). This year, MSP of grade A and common varieties of paddy is Rs 1,510 per quintal and Rs 1,470 per quintal respectively, an increase of Rs 60 from the previous season.Bathinda chief agriculture officer (CAO) Nachhattar Singh said the department had urged the farmers not to grow paddy considering lower availability of fresh groundwater. ""Our area is fed primarily by canals since most of the groundwater is unfit for irrigation as it is brackish. Farmers have ignored our advisory and have planted paddy , though it may not give the desired yield or returns as compared to Doaba and Majha regions of Punjab,"" he said.Shamsher Singh, a farmer from Kotbhara village of Bathinda district, said he had grown paddy since he suffered bi paddy since he suffered big losses due to whitefly attack last year. ""I had grown cotton over 4.5 acres last season, and whole of it was destroyed by the pest. I didn't even receive adequate compensation for my loss. I decided to grow paddy this year, though I have to spend more on irrigating the crop as compared to cotton. I have planted paddy on 2.5 acres this time,"" he said.Fazilka CAO Sukhdev Singh said area under cotton in his district had dropped considerably as wary farmers opted for paddy and other kharif crops.""Many farmers who have access to groundwater using tubewells have shifted to paddy . They are willing to spend more to maintain the crop as paddy is purchased by the state agencies at MSP ,"" he said.Pulses, oilseeds sownWith farmers shifting from cotton due to fear of repeat of whitefly attack in Malwa, some of them have opted for other kharif crops like arhar (pigeon pea), moong (green gram), groundnut, maize and guar (cluster bean). According to Fazilka CAO Sukhdev Singh, area under arhar and maize in the district stood at 4,200 hectares and 5,000 hecatres. In Bathinda, farmers are switching over to arhar (1,000 hectares), guar (400 hectares) and groundnuts (280 hectares). Moong and arhar have been sown over 2,000 hectares each in Mansa district"

As a backup for the erratic rains, there is a proper sitting area under the shade wherein youngsters enjoy without worries. One of the regulars Atul Sawarkar, a first year B.Com student of Hislop College opines,""Ever since I moved to the city from Chandrapur, being a hostelite, momos have become my comfort food that satisfy my evening binge for snacks.

Rainfall has been scanty this month so far and the district recorded 40 per cent less rain than the normal.Against the normal rainfall of 30.1 mm in July till now, the district received only 18.1 mm.

Except Chincholi, where the shortfall of rainfall this month was 12 per cent, all the other taluks received scanty rainfall, posing a serious threat to the germinated crops.The district requires at least two to three good spells of rain to prevent the withering of germinated crops. Standing crops have sustained the extended dry spell because of the overcast weather conditions which helped prevent evaporation of moisture and retention of moisture in the soil, a senior official in the Agriculture Department said.Afzalpur received only 12.3 mm rainfall against the normal of 22.5 mm; Aland received 24.8 mm against the normal of 32.2 mm; Chincholi recorded 33.5 mm against the normal of 38.5 mm; Chittapur recorded 15.8 mm against the normal of 31.3 mm; Kalaburagi recorded 18.7 mm against the normal 28.5 mm; and Sedam recorded 14 mm against the normal of 34.7 mm.Although the germinated crops are not facing moisture stress in most areas, cash crops like green gram sown on 37,598 hectares (ha); black gram sown on 22,217 ha; bi-seasonal crop red gram sown on 3,25,370 ha; and oilseed crops like sesame sown on 7,903 ha desperately need rain for growth.The farmers had completed sowing on 80 per cent of the targeted area in the district following good rains in the first three weeks of June.SowingFarmers in Afzalpur completed sowing on 98 per cent of the targeted area; those in Chittapur completed sowing on 92 per cent; those in Chincholi completed sowing on 91 per cent; those in Aland completed sowing on 87 per cent; those in Kalaburagi completed sowing on 80 per cent; and those in Sedam completed sowing on 77 per cent of the targeted area.Owing to scanty rainfall, sowing was completed only on 49 per cent of the targeted area in Jewargi taluk."

File picture Jorhat, July 18: The Kaziranga National Park (KNP) authorities today suspended two forest guards - Anil Kalita and Manash Bora - in the wake of last night's incident in which a stray bullet, reportedly fired by Bora, hit Akash Orang, 7, in the leg. The boy is from a village on the fringe area of the park. Bora fired in the air from a machan (a platform on a tree) to chase away a rhino and a calf that were reportedly coming towards the camp inside the second addition area under Kohora range of the park. Sources said the bullet hit Akash, the seven-year-old boy, who was standing in front of this house in an adjoining village. He was today shifted to the Gauhati Medical College and Hospital from the JMCH as the JMCH did not have ""master surgeon"" to remove the bullet. The state government has ordered an inquiry into the incident and directed conservator of forests M. Timung to conduct a probe. The divisional forest officer, eastern Assam wildlife division, KNP, Suvasish Das, told The Telegraph this evening that based on the report of the preliminary investigation carried out by the park staff, the two guards have been suspended from service pending an inquiry into the incident. Das said it has been found that Bora, a supporting unarmed staff who has recently been transferred to Kaziranga, is not authorised to use a gun as he does not have proper knowledge of use of firearms. Das said Bora was cooking in the Mihirtang camp on a machan near the Mihirmukh area along the fringe area of the park when around 7.30pm, camp in-charge Kalita spotted a rhino and a calf coming very close. Taking only a torchlight, Kalita climbed down the tree to chase away the rhinos leaving his single-barrel gun in the camp, Das said. After a while, Bora reportedly heard a loud sound. Assuming that animals had attacked Kalita, he picked up Kalita's gun and fired in the air. The bullet hit Akash. The officer said in the first place, Kalita should not have left the gun in the camp while trying to chase animals and secondly, Bora should not have used the gun allotted to Kalita as he did not know how to handle firearms. Das said according to rules, to scare away a rhino, a bullet should be fired towards the ground or straight towards the sky which was not done in this case. Bora was not permitted to use the gun either, he added."

""We are keeping a close watch on the market situation and will recommend action against unscrupulous traders,"" said deputy director, market intelligence, Pravakar Rout. Panda said VAT had been reduced by four per cent and it has had its impact on the dal prices. ""The arhar dal price has fallen from Rs 140 to Rs 130 a kg. The price of moong has also fallen correspondingly."" He, however, conceded that the gram dal price had climbed by Rs 30 a kg. ""We have no control over the price of gram dal because it has been listed under the National Commodity Exchange. The price fluctuates based on speculation,"" he said, adding that they had urged the Centre to de-list gram dal from the National Commodity Exchange. ""But the Centre has not accepted our demand."" Panda, however, hoped that the prices would fall in the coming days, as dal cultivation in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh had been higher this year because of favourable weather conditions."

Why? Well, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is in the process of drafting a cycling Plan that could make the city a mirror image of the Danish capital, where the most popular and preferred means of transport is the humble bicycle. Dedicated cycling tracks, parking spaces, rental services and more; imagine how Pune would look if all this is put in place. On paper, the plan is somewhat similar to the Copenhagen model and spells happiness for cycling enthusiasts of the city.Cycling is the most important means of transportation of Copenhagen. There is an extensive and well planned cycle track around the city, which makes it convenient for cyclists to pedal around. The City of Copenhagen's Bicycle Strategy 2011-2025 aims at making the capital of Denmark the world's best city to cycle in.According to PMC figures, on an average, 500 vehicles are registered in the city on a daily basis. Multiply that by 30 or 365 and the sheer number of vehicles on the roads is humungous. With so many vehicles plying the road, traffic congestion and increase in pollution levels is but obvious. On the other hand, the bicycle reduces two problems  no air or noise pollution and much lesser chances of congestion and accidents.Creating a cycle networkParking space for cyclesPutting a Public Bicycle System in place which includes rental plansAmidst the peak hour chaos, it is hard to miss the cycling-gear clad enthusiasts who cycle to work daily, but the number of these is quite low as of now. For people with desk jobs, body ailments have become quite common and the draining work hours ultimately make them lead a sedentary lifestyle. Put cycles in the picture and your problem is solved. You might not get time to work out throughout the day, but a daily trip from home to office and back is sure to put your fitness graph on the rise.HadapsarSinhagad RoadKothrudSNDT College roadMMCC to Prabhat RoadModel ColonyRace Course road (Barring the SNDT, and MMCC to Prabhat Road tracks, the rest are in bad condition. Plus, motorcycles ply these tracks, posing a threat to cyclists.)City cyclists are happy, but are unsure of the implementation of The concept. it should be implemented one region at a time. The plan is like a social healthcare initiative because it will help reduce pollution and accidents, and increase fitness levels of Puneites. It will also increase green cover. Take the National Defence Academy (NDA) for example; it is mandatory for the cadets to use bicycles and that's why the campus is so well-maintained. The same can happen to the entire city if the Cycling Plan is implemented properlyThe reason behind proposing such plans is to find a way for money laundering. What can be done to really help cyclists, is educate vehicle-owners about following traffic rules, which have become a joke. As long as people don't follow them, no plan can succeed. The cycling plan can only work out if traffic is disciplined. It's not a magic wand that you wave and suddenly everything is sorted out.The existent cycling tracks and footpaths have more hawkers and parked vehicles than cyclists or pedestrians. So it is important to create awareness among people about cycling. The plan might help reduce traffic woes but traffic needs to be disciplined for it to be implemented in the first place"

The Meteorological department has predicted rain in the district for a week.However, 10 villages in neighboring Yadagir district are facing flood. Though the rainfall decreased, downpour in Maharashtra raised the danger of an overflow from Bhima river.

The sluggishness in sowing paddy, according to agriculture experts, follows fear of borewell failures with the rains so far not resulting in extensive recharge of groundwater table after two years of successive drought.""The rainfall has been fairly good this time, but not good enough to recharge the water table that had fallen to low depths in the last two years. As a result, rain-fed crops stand a better chance whereas sowing of the crops like paddy has not picked up,"" said agriculture scientist G V Ramanjaneyulu. ""The sowing of paddy should have been over by now. With just 16 per cent of normal crop area so far, we cannot really hope that farmers will plant the crop in a larger area in the next fortnight or a month,"" he added.Of the normal crop area of over 15 lakh hectares in the state, where farmers grow rice, sowing of paddy has been done only in 2.14 lakh hectares. ""The paddy sowing has been slow as compared to other crops since farmers depending on borewells are not getting enough water. The groundwater level has not improved as expected,"" said N Narasimha, joint director of the agriculture department. Narasimha was optimistic that the situation would improve and sowing of paddy might reach 50% of its normal crop area by August 15.The groundwater was severely affected due to two years of drought in 140 out of the total 445 mandals in the state. Water levels have plummeted to more than 20 metres below ground level (mgbl). The situation was termed 'critical' by the state groundwater board in 90 more mandals where water was available only after depths of 15 metres. The average depth of groundwater in Telangana is 10 mgbl. Though this year on an average the state has received 16% more rainfall, the rains have done little.""The rains have not been enough for irrigation projects. The situation is not conducive for water guzzlers like paddy and a majority of farmers have shifted to rain-fed crops such as maize, soybean, red gram and green gram,"" said M Kodanda Reddy, chairman of Kisan and Kheth Mazdoor Congress."

When the controversial plan was introduced for the first time last year (and later withdrawn following protests), it received a humungous 64,867 responses from the public.However, while last year the BMC counted each and every suggestion/objection letter separately, this time multiple objections received in a day for the same case or from the same organisation have been clubbed together. The deadline for submitting objections/suggestions ends on July 29.Activists are aghast and have accused the civic body of manipulating the suggestion/objection figures. For instance, a people's campaign known as 'Hamara Shehar Mumbai Abhiyaan' alone sent 3,500 suggestion/objection letters to the draft DP 2034 last week. But the BMC claims it received around 5,000 odd suggestion/objections in total to the plan so far. Hussain Indorewala, assistant professor at Kamla Raheja Vidyanidhi Institute for Architecture and Environmental Studies, and a member of the campaign, said, ""Our suggestion/objection letters were all based on different issues. Such letters, although they come from one organisation, can't be counted as one. Another issue with the fewer letters sent is also the fact that most suggestion/objections filed last time were disregarded in the revised plan 2034.""Activists alleged that by clubbing the suggestion/objections received, the BMC was violating the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (MRTP), 1966, which states that the planning authority or said officer shall forward 'all' objections and suggestions received by it to a planning committee. Nayana Kathpalia, trustee, NAGAR said, ""As per the MRTP Act 1966, the authorities are supposed to look at every suggestion/objection received and can't club them. By doing such a thing they are trying to portray that they have done a good job. They can't subvert the law no matter what.""Activist Gerson da Cunha said multiple suggestion/objections being clubbed as one do not echo the true volume of the outcry against the revised draft DP 2034. ""This is a subtle way of discouraging citizens from filing multiple suggestion/objections to the plan,"" he said.Filmmaker Ashoke Pandit said they are in the process of drafting their suggestion/objection to the plan as an entire nallah in Oshiwara-Lokandwala has been shifted in the plan. ""It's shocking that the BMC is doing such a thing as one needs to read each complaint letter, even if on the same issue, to conclude whether they are the same or not,"" said Pandit.The BMC meanwhile in its defence has said that even if the multiple objections received in a day for the same case are clubbed together but each of it would be looked at separately once the hearings begin. ""If the same plot is the matter of concern and the suggestion/objection letter has the same wordings too, the same is being considered for one hearing. In many cases where suggestion/objections have been given by numerous persons of the same group, there is no address provided. Whom are we supposed to call in such a case for a hearing?"" said Vivek More, deputy chief engineer (DP)."

Ramanathapuram District Jamaathul Ulama Council had opposed installation of the statue stating that it was against Muslim personal law (Shariat) but the officials decided to go ahead with the installation.It appeared that construction of the building might not be in the immediate offing when officials from the Directorate of Architecture, MoD, said they required seven to eight acres of land for building a world class memorial. Later, the State government had arranged 3.5 acres of land. It was negotiating with private parties for making available another 2.75 acres.Meanwhile, family members of Kalam visited the burial site and offered prayers at the Kabur (burial site) on the eve of his first death anniversary on Tuesday. They were led by A.P.J.M. Maraikayar, elder brother of Kalam. After offering prayers, they distributed laddu made of green gram and ghee, the favourite delicacy of Kalam, to those gathered at the site.School students took out silent rallies and offered floral tributes. After walking down from Thangachimadam, they lit candles and offered prayers at the burial site."

Most may have just heard this but Dr Ravindra Kolhe can vouch for it. Born in the temple town of Shegaon, he listened to sermons of saints who visited the place. ""They had a deep impact on my heart and mind,"" says the doctor who had his early education at a local school in Marathi medium.Suffering with a congenital heart ailment termed as primary pulmonary hypertension, Kolhe says frequent hospitalization and frail health made him a voracious reader. ""I got very good marks in Std X and wanted to become an engineer. But my teachers said I should go for medicine.""Kolhe moved to Wardha and enrolled at JB Science College. ""It was here that I came under the influence of Gandhi and Vinobha Bhave. Their ideologies had a deep impact on my mind.""Good marks in Std XII ensured a seat in Government Medical College, Nagpur. ""Here, too, I looked around for a library and found one at Ramkrishna Mission,"" he says. By this time Kolhe had realized that he had to work in rural area. ""I read John Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' and was impressed by it. I was also in the company of seers at the Ramkrishna Math and would discuss the purpose of life with them.""By the time he was in the final year, he had formed a group called Sangharsh with his batch mates and they worked in the Babulkheda slum behind the medical college. ""It was at this time that I read the book 'Where There is No Doctor' written by a Spanish revolutionary. The book cover had an image of four persons carrying a patient on a stretcher and there was a milestone on which it was written -- hospital 30 miles. That image remained imprinted in my mind and when I passed out I decided to hunt for a village from where a hospital was 30km away,"" says the doctor.Though he wanted to rush to rural areas, ""my seniors advised me that I should first learn to do deliveries single-handedly, diagnose pneumonia with stethoscope and should be able to treat diarrhoea"", he says. Two house jobs in Mumbai equipped him with these skills.""My professors Dr Dinoo Dalal and Dr Minoo Advani took me through an intensive course in mother and child care,"" he says. On October 30, 1984, when Dr. Kolhe was just 23 years old, he went searching for the ideal village and travelled through Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra.""I finally identified Bairagad in Amravati district on Feb 9, 1985. My batchmate and I began working from a veranda of a house,"" he says. But realization that they can't handle surgical emergencies made them decide that they should complete post-graduation too.Kolhe enrolled in GMC for MD in preventive and social medicine in 1986. ""My professor Dr Motghare said that I should look for some more sustainable solutions and asked me to prepare a paper on tribal health. The data that I collected about the mother and child health of tribals at Dharni was dismal.""What he discovered during this compilation was malnutrition of children in Melghat. These findings reached out to the world as he was interviewed by BBC radio. ""Suddenly this issue of child mortality and malnutrition in Melghat got political attention as I identified 200 reasons for it.""But after completing his MD, Dr Kolhe's partner refused to return to the village. ""This made it imperative that I get married as alone I could not serve the community."" But the conditions that he laid out for his would-be wife were tough. ""I wanted to marry a woman who would run the house in 400 per month, walk up to 40km, would agree for a registered marriage and be prepared to beg for others.""Ironically, the woman he married was a far cry. ""I was running a homeopathy clinic and earning lots of money. I was fashion conscious and would travel across the city just to match my footwear with a sari,"" says Dr Smita, who was also an ABVP worker and a school mate of Nitin Gadkari. ""But these four conditions were acceptable to me as I would always think what is it in life that I want beyond what I have,"" she says.In 1988, she left behind her penchant for good clothes and a good life and moved with her husband to Bairagad. ""It was a trial marriage and would continue till she kept to these four conditions,"" says Kolhe.In the village, the couple got a new mud house built by the villagers. ""Drawing water from the well, getting the mud, cow dung and hay mixture right for the walls, cooking on firewood were things that I had never done in life,"" recalls Smita.Wearing a sari costing 10 purchased from ration shops, she began enjoying the scenic beauty of Melghat and got involved in the life of the villagers. ""I loved the beauty of the place and the simplicity of the tribals,"" she says.The couple has two sons and both studied at the local school. ""The elder one Rohit is an agriculturist and the younger, Ram is studying at the medical college in Akola. The elder one's wife is a farmer's daughter. She took time to adjust with our lifestyle but is now comfortable with it,"" Smita says and adds that luckily the sons agreed to follow their parent's lifestyle.Going beyond community service through medicine, the couple have also focused their attention to making the village economically strong. ""We took help of agriculture universities and began sowing potatoes, soya bean, cotton, sugar cane, jute, water melon, turmeric and summer moong. Amravati is known as the suicide district but there are no such events in Melghat,"" says the proud couple.""Child mortality came down to 40 per 1000 when we began working it was 200, mortality of preschool children is 100, previously it was 400. We have been able to make an operation theatre with the help of private aid and now there are 70 doctors in the region,"" said Kolhe.The couple also organizes a camp 'Tarunai' for youth which is about social orientation and community living. ""We did not set up any NGO. This village is our karambhoomi and we are happy with any progress that is made here."" There only grouse is the lack of electricity in the area. ""It stops us from doing much more,"" they say."

The rise in prices of pulses, along with government incentives and motivational efforts for the cultivation of the pulses has seen an at least 150% rise from last years cultivation.With almost all districts registering more than 76% of the average rainfall, the sowing of Kharif crops has reached 90%. Though the cereals have seen a dip in sowing in the last five-year average, pulses like red gram (tur dal), black gram (udid dal) and green grams have seen a sizable rise in sowing.If the plans succeed, the prices of pulses in the Indian market are likely to fall substantially next year. The pulses grown by farmers earned twice the amount sugarcane and pomegranate growers earned per acre over the past two years. This has resulted in the rise in area this year and it will definitely lead to the rise in production. , said Balasaheb Bende, former director, APMC, Vashi.We have been implementing a Rs250 crore programme to promote the cultivation of pulses throughout the year. Besides the distribution of seeds, the programme also includes the distribution of micro nutrients, bio-fertilizer, crop-improvement initiatives for pulses. The farmers, who grow pulses, have been getting a good price for their produce owing to the shortage and high rates in the market for the past two years. As a result, the area for cultivation has increased by 2.50 lakh hectares, said Vikas Deshmukh, agriculture commissioner."

FKCCI had opened centres in Mysuru, Tumakuru, Mandya, Hubballi, Kalaburagi and Bidar.Association president Ramesh Chandra Lahoti said the initiative yielded results as retailers reduced prices.The main aim of the initiative was to force retail traders to reduce prices. Retailers had kept the price high despite the wholesale prices coming down. But the government used to blame wholesale traders for high prices, he added.Prices may come downLahoti said prices of pulses are likely to come down in the coming days following good monsoon. Sowing has been going on in full swing.Traders expect a good crop this year. Last year, there was severe shortage of pulses due to failure of monsoon rains, leading to price rice.Besides, prices of mung dal have come down in the last few days. The pulse, which cost Rs 120 a kg two months ago, now costs Rs 90 a kg. Fresh stocks are expected after August 20, bringing down prices further, he said.

He added that the country needs to double its annual pulses production from the current 19 metric tonnes to 38 metric tonnes by 2050, else it will not be able to feed its future population.Manohara was speaking at the Goa science centre during a lecture series on pulses organized in keeping with the 68th UN General Assembly decision declaring 2016 as the International Year of Pulses.He further elaborated that India's current population is 1.21 billion which is expected to go up to 1.69 billion by 2050.

The exception is for paddy, with deadline of August 20, says Agriculture Joint Director J.

Ranga Rao.Most of the two lakh tenant farmers in the district still do not have access to institutional credit, he said, adding a recent government circular, which made lease agreement mandatory for getting crop loan, put paid to the hopes of these sections of farmers to get the Loan Eligibility Cards (LECs). Cultivation certificate to enable tenant farmers to access bank credit has so far been provided only to 700 of them. Pointing out that kharif and rabi seasons overlapped in the district,Sangam district secretary P.

""We handed over eight packets of milk powder to CWRC head Rathin Barman in the presence of NRL official P.K. Baruah and block resource person Pradip Sharma. From one packet about six litres of milk can be produced and one rhino calf needs 20 litres per day,"" he said. Dutta said the children had sought permission from him to give up the meal and he asked them to give it in writing. On Friday, they submitted the application. ""I sought permission over phone from block elementary education officer Barman Teron, who told me that this was a very generous gesture from the students and me to permit them to do so,"" Dutta said. However, as one child gets only Rs 3.78 per meal from the government the amount came to about Rs 300 and a packet costs Rs 287. ""When others heard about the donation, they also contributed and we could give eight packets,"" the headmaster said. Barman said he was deeply touched by the gesture of children who were so young. ""Never have I come across an instance where I was told by the teacher that children below 12 had on their own given up a meal for the sake of wildlife,"" he said. The eight packets will provide at least two milk meals to the eight calves, each meal comprising about 2.5 litres,"" he said. The school also has 33 children studying in KG but they do not come under the government's midday meal scheme. ""Whatever food is made with the dole is shared with these children as we cannot exclude the youngest of the lot while the others are eating,"" Dutta said. The name of the school already has a connection with milk. ""While most of the children hail from different communities, the majority being from the tea tribes, earlier the area had a Nepali khuti set up by Ahom King Suhungmung Dihinga to provide milk to the king's camp nearby. Hence, the name of the school,"" Dutta said."

5937322c7be9e015d564a60d,Charda village: Dalits stood up here and got village to rally behind them,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/dalits-stood-up-here-and-got-village-to-rally-behind-them-2969616/,2016-08-12,"No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed Raja No untouchability in village now: Sattuben (left). Express Photo by Javed RajaAbout 100 km from the India-Pakistan border, in Tharad taluka of Banaskantha district, Charda village witnessed a revolution of sorts over six years ago. A Brahmins buffalo had died and he called the Dalits to clear it. They refused. Since then, Dalits here havent skinned or cleared a single carcass.There was a fight and we decided not to do it anymore. The buffalo lay there for two days, till the owner buried it himself, says Mulabhai Mansinh Bochiya, a Dalit who was in his second term as sarpanch at the time in 2009-10.I was made the sarpanch for the first time on a savarna (general) seat in 2000, when the incumbent sarpanch, from the darbar (OBC) caste, was booked in a murder case within six months of his appointment. Rajputs and darbars are the dominant community, but the village voted for me again, says Bochiya.At a time when attacks on Dalits have led to a widespread outrage, particularly after the public flogging of seven Dalit youths in Gujarats Una for skinning dead cattle, Charda is on the cusp of change, although there is still some way to go.Bochiyas wife, Sattuben, assures that there has been no untouchability in the village since the buffalo incident. But 15-year-old Bhavna Desai, a member of the cattle-rearing Rabari (OBC) community, who spends most of her time at the Bochiya home, says it does exist subtly in the privacy of homes.For instance, they (Dalits) cannot come into our temple, and they do not come anyway. At community get-togethers, they sit with their community members, not with us, she says.A student of Class VIII, Bhavna says that in school, however, everyone sits together and dines together, and this has been happening for as long as I can remember.Sattuben and Mulabhai have six sons and two daughters all of whom are married. Unable to accommodate everyone in one home, the family moved to a plot where they used to store fodder, on the outskirts of the village and have one bigha of land in which they only grow cattle feed for their buffaloes, says Sattuben.All the sons are labourers and do canal-work, she says. The Narmada canal which connected this taluka has come as a blessing to the village. We laid a pipeline spending Rs four lakh to connect to the fields, says Sattuben.But if they (government) evicts us we will have to leave, because this land is not ours, says Sattuben.Her daughter-in-law Jasaben says their staple food is bajra and mung and potato. Rice is made only on occasions, unlike the Desais and the Rajputs in the village, who also eat wheat and vegetables like brinjal, and tomatoes, she says.Bhavnas father Nagjibhai Desai lived in Shilaj on the outskirts of Ahmedabad, taking care of a cow pound till about ten years ago. Then came the Ring Road (Sardar Patel Ring Road), and Ahmedabad became a mega city, and here we are back home to farming, says Desai.He raises cattle and sells milk to the Banaskantha dairy co-operative. Untouchability, he says, does not exist at all in Charda, adding that everyone clears carcasses.Pointing to the children gathered around his home, he says, Look, all of them are Dalits. Can you tell the difference between them and us? If you cut any of us our blood will be red. They all eat together play together. Those who believe in discrimination, may practise it (untouchability). We dont.Shankarbhai Prajapati, an OBC who has been Chardas sarpanch for the last five years, insists that the village has changed. Only last week, my buffalo died, it was worth Rs one lakh. I called a tractor, tied and dragged it, loaded it and buried it with some salt for faster decomposition, he says.Govindbhai Rajput, a farmer, blames politics, for the discriminatory practices. People working on the directions of the Congress and the BJP practise untouchability, because they have political interests. We have no enemies. There is no issue at all. In our weddings, they (the Dalits) play the drums and get Rs 25,000-30,000 for it. Brotherhood is what we believe in, he says.Nanjibhai Adhial, who works in Tharad for Dalit rights as part of the Ahmedabad-based NGO Human Development and Research Centre, says that much has changed since awareness came in.But the awakening has come with its own set of issues, he says. Today, if a Dalit is asked to shut up in a panchayat meet, he will object, and then the oppression begins. Earlier, he would sit quiet, he says.Banaskantha District Collector Jenu Devan says the district administration tries to get communities together at gram sabhas to overcome discriminatory practices. In schools, we have successfully managed to finish it. We have ensured that children sit together and dine together. Our teachers mostly come from towns where untouchability is less and they are partners in this effort, he says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

However, the governments plan to restrict cotton cultivation to below 10.64 lakh hectares has been successful only to the extent of keeping it much below 17 lakh hectares cultivated last year, as it has already reached 11.94 lakh hectares.Dry spell in parts of central and southern Telangana during June-July has forced the farmers to opt for cotton again as it was impossible for them to take up soybean cultivation since cotton can withstand dry spell for over 180-day crop period with the capacity to regenerate whenever it gets moisture, a senior official of the Agriculture Department said. The crop has already been sown in over 1.3 lakh hectares above the extent planned by the government and it could go up further as farmers in some parts take up sowing till the end of August second week.Officials explained that the government had plans to cover an extent of 45.49 lakh hectares this kharif against the normal extent of 43.43 lakh hectares by increasing sowing of red gram to 4.85 lakh hectares, soybean to 5.02 lakh hectares and that of maize to 6.14 lakh hectares against their normal area of 2.60 lakh ha, 2.02 lakh ha and 4.91 lakh ha, respectively.Farmers have cultivated pulses in an extent of 5.93 lakh ha this kharif against the season normal of 4.04 lakh ha with red gram cultivation in 3.99 lakh ha against the normal of 2.6 lakh ha, green gram in 1.48 lakh ha against the normal of 1.1 lakh ha and black gram in 0.45 lakh ha against the normal of 0.32 lakh ha. Similarly, soybean has been cultivated in 2.97 lakh ha against the normal extent of 2.02 lakh ha and that of maize in 5.51 lakh ha against the normal of 4.91 lakh ha.Good rains have improved the prospects of paddy cultivation this year and it has been cultivated in 4.04 lakh ha already. It was covered only in 2.44 lakh ha during the same period last year. It is expected to be taken up in about 11 lakh hectares this season, if good rains continue through the rest of monsoon, the officials said.The area of cultivation increased by over 3 lakh hectares compared to same period last year"

Pictures by Manoj Kumar Ojha and UB PhotosDoomdooma/Dibrugarh, Aug. 13: Protests and blockades rocked several parts of Tinsukia district in Upper Assam following the death of a man and his son in firing by suspected Ulfa (Independent) militants last night. Apart from the victims Kishori Shah, 65, and his son Rajesh, 32, five persons were injured in the attack at Number 11 Phillobari Bamungaon, carried out by five gunmen who fired indiscriminately on Shahs house, where a puja was being conducted, and some adjoining houses before fleeing. The injured, admitted to Assam Medical College and Hospital in Dibrugarh, are Arvind Shah, Ranjit Shah, Awdesh Shah, Jitendra Chouhan and Pratima Devi. The village is 12km from Doomdooma and 526km from Guwahati. Local residents and protesters blocked the roads in several places this morning and again at Doomdooma when family members were taking the victims bodies back around 5pm. Traffic remained disrupted for most part of the day.A 24-hour Doomdooma bandh called by the Bhojpuri Yuba Chatra Parishad also affected life. Residents said they would not allow the bodies to be taken home till chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal or his ministerial colleagues came and listened to their grievances. Protesters also questioned the state governments preparedness in tackling untoward incidents even after intelligence inputs. Ravindra Yadav, who led the blockade of National Highway 37 in Doomdooma from 9.30am to 3pm, said they have submitted a memorandum to the district administration to set up a 24x7 distress helpline for people under Doomdooma circle and permanent security involving army and paramilitary forces, among others. This is the second attack by militants after the carnage in Balajan weekly market in Kokrajhar on August 5, which left 14 people dead. Shahs neighbour, Ranjit Prajapati, said, It is routine now  rebels targeting Hindi-speaking people before any important day or festival or VVIP visit. We have not slept since yesterday. The village is in mourning. The Shah family is associated with the tea business. There are over 700 Hindi-speaking households in the area who are into tea and paddy cultivation and own small shops. They mostly hail from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh and came there prior to Independence. Kishori was born in Phillobari, his grandson Sanjay said. He said the cremation will take place tomorrow. In Guwahati, parliamentary affairs minister Chandra Mohan Patowary told the Assembly this morning that a team of four or five suspected Ulfa (I) militants carried out the attack on innocent Hindi-speaking people. He said a massive combing operation has been launched to hunt down the culprits. He also announced ex gratia of Rs 5 lakh each to those killed and Rs 1 lakh to the injured. Doomdooma Congress MLA Durga Bhumij, while raising the issue during zero hour, asked how long Ulfa would continue to kill Hindi-speaking people. AIUDF legislator Aminul Islam expressed apprehension that more such attacks may be carried out before Independence Day. He demanded that police and security personnel be put on maximum alert. Sonowal rushed two of his ministerial colleagues  Atul Bora and Pallab Lochan Das  to the site. Home commissioner L.S. Changsan and additional director-general of police R.M. Singh were also in the team that visited Phillobari this evening totake stock of the situation. They handed over ex gratia to the victims families this evening. Changsan said they listened to what the local residents had to say and will prepare an appropriate response. Locals said they have been routinely targeted since 2004. On July 14 last year, rebels shot down a man and his daughter in Bijuliban area, 5km from Phillobari. We tried to clarify that attacks are not only aimed at Hindi-speaking people. We have had such incidents in Kokrajhar and Karbi Anglong. Several IEDs have been recovered. Its happening all across Assam. These people have ganged up. These attacks are against everyone and the response has to be collective. We have urged the locals to cooperate and have their ear to the ground, she said. On deployment of additional forces, Changsan said 6,000 constables and 2,000 Assam Battalion personnel have been deployed across the state in the last few days. The new personnel can help their experienced colleagues devote more time in the field, she said. Changsan said Singh would be camping in the area for a couple of days to finalise security arrangements. We will set up fixed pickets as sought by the locals, she said. Tinsukia superintendent of police Mugdhajyoti Mahanta told The Telegraph over phone that Ulfa leader Rupam Asom led the five-member group. He said they have identified one more person, Uday Asom. He said the attackers were carrying AK-series rifles and 5.56-inch bullets were recovered from the site. We have got information that a group of Ulfa (I) rebels have sneaked into Assam from Arunachal Pradesh and started operations to track them, he said. AJYCP general secretary Palash Changmai said common people were bearing the brunt of the armed conflict. He blamed the government for the reign of terror in Tinsukia, saying that it had failed to put security forces on alert even after the Balajan incident. Several organisations belonging to the Moran community and the Akhil Assam Bhojpuri Parishad condemned the incident.Sonowal reviewed the law and order situation today and condemned Ulfa (I) for the killings. Our government is very capable of dealing with the rebels in a strong way, he said. Calling upon all communities, linguistic and religious minorities to rise in unison against such inhuman acts, he said, If everyone joins hands with the government, then it will be easier to take the battle to the enemy camp.

At 20 bucks a pop for 'pyaz' kachori or 10 for 'moong dal' kachori, it is the cheapest and quickest way to be transported to Rajasthan ""I grew up in Bhilwara , eating kachoris almost every day. It's that kind of dish: once you see it, you can't resist it,"" Lakshkar states the obvious. It may sound trite, but Lakshkar is right when he says his kachoris are different from the ones one normally eats in the city. ""They're full of besan and so heavy. These ones,"" he says, gesturing at the golden brown savouries bobbing happily in hot oil, ""won't give you acidity or gas.""That is the reason, Lashkar adds, 90% of his patrons are repeat customers. A triad of chutneys  spiced dahi, amchur and mint  douses the heat from the kachoris and bumps up the flavour, although a single fried green chilli is a nice way of keeping it simple.An ice-cream seller by evening, Lakshkar claims he developed the recipe for the kachoris himself, evidently wanting to keep his cards close to his chest. Try to pry out his 'special ingredient' and he clams up. ""It's just home-made masala that I make fresh every day,"" he says, and refuses to elaborate.But a close inspection of the dal kachori hints at the presence of coriander seeds, fennel seeds, red chilli and a pleasant punch of asafoetida (hing). ""I procure it from Rajasthan. The hing here doesn't have that mazaa,"" he reveals. But no more. And Lakshkar says no one else knows the full recipe.""The day I am sick or not here, there is no kachori. Only I can make it, although I'm introducing my elder son Vinayak to it slowly. I'll pass it on when I think he's ready,"" the 45-year-old says.Until that day comes, he is prepared to toil. Lakshkar's day begins at 4am as he makes preparations for the kachoris, chopping onions, grinding up masala and so on. He's at his spot by 7am and stays there until 11am. He then goes home, and gets out to make purchases for the next day.By this time, it's evening and he heads out again, this time with his ice cream cart from which he sells flavours like gulkand, cashew-and-raisin, and other chilled delights such as almond shake, falooda and rabdi. By the times he hits the bed, it's midnight. In just about four hours, he will get up to go at it all over again.Pure hard work. That's his special ingredient.(This occasional column looks at some of the old eateries in the city, when they started and how they have evolved. Do you know of any?

Picture by UB Photos Aug. 14: An IED suspected to be planted by Ulfa (Independent) rebels, went off at Sonari in Charaideo district in Upper Assam today as the Northeast prepared to celebrate the 70th Independence Day. Security has been beefed up in the region in view of the boycott and general strikes called by several militant groups tomorrow. Charaideo superintendent of police Mohneesh Mishra said suspected Ulfa (I) militants triggered the blast using a remote-controlled device along Dhodar Ali at Joloha under Sonari police station at 4.15pm. No one was hurt in the incident. The police suspect army vehicles that pass through the road could be the target but they missed. Joloha is about 8km from Sonari town. Another IED was recovered by the police near the forest office at Makum in Tinsukia district. The IED, which was found inside a bag, was defused by the army's bomb disposal squad. ""Rebels are trying everything to sabotage the Independence Day celebrations,'' Tinsukia superintendent of police Mugdhajyoti Mahanta told The Telegraph. Tension continues to prevail in Tinsukia district where suspected Ulfa militants gunned down two Hindi-speaking persons and left seven injured at Number 11 Phillobari Bamungaon on Friday night. Mahanta said the special director-general of police (law and order), R.M. Singh, today reviewed security in the village and announced that a fixed police picket will be set up. Singh also met the victims' families and assured them of security. The last rites of the victims, Kishori Shah and his son Rajesh, were performed today. A six-member delegation of the All-Assam Bhojpuri Parishad today met Union home minister Rajnath Singh in New Delhi and submitted a memorandum seeking security for Bhojpuri people in the state as the community has been targeted by Ulfa many times in the past two decades. Parishad president Parshuram Dubey said their community has become a ""soft target"" for militants. He said the home minister had assured them that strong action will be taken against those who kill innocent people. Guwahati police today claimed to have foiled an Ulfa (I) plan to carry out strikes in the city ahead of Independence Day. He said police and CRPF personnel were carrying out checking at Azara-Rani road near Pepsi Gate on Friday night when two youths on a motorcycle on the way to Guwahati turned back on seeing the security forces. ""The motorcycle skidded and the two fell but they got up and drove on towards Rani. The police chased them but they escaped. The duo dropped a bag containing three hand grenades and an IED,"" he said. The bomb disposal team defused the IED and grenades. ""It is suspected that extremists were bringing these explosives to Guwahati for carrying out strikes but the heightened vigil foiled their plan,"" he said. In Meghalaya, security was intensified across Garo hills. ""We are on alert. Operations are still on,"" said South Garo Hills superintendent of police Anand Mishra. A truck driver from Mankachar in Assam, Sohidul Islam, was abducted yesterday from Deku Bazar in Chokpot of South Garo Hills. In Tura, the weeklong Freedom Fest will culminate tomorrow with the final match of the Freedom Challenge Cup to be held at Chandmari playground. A friendly football match between surrendered cadres of GNLA and the disbanded UALA will also be held at Dikki Bandi Stadium in Dakopgre."

An agriculture scientist addresses a meeting in Umerkote.Two Bhubaneswar-based institutes of ICAR (Indian Council of Agricultural Research) plan to adopt at least two villages in Nabarangpur, an effort to promote the growth of micronutrient-rich crops and help tribals arm themselves against malnutrition.Last week, scientists of Bhubaneswars Central Tuber Crop Research Institute and Central Institute for Women in Agriculture visited Sukhigaon and Biriguda villages in Umerkote and Pondripokhana village in Raighar to assess local requirements.CTCRI director Dr Archana Mukherjee, who heads the six-member team, said the intervention by ICAR institutes was prompted by The Indian Expresss District Zero series on poverty and change in the district. The District Zero series was haunting us. When our director general Trilochan Mohapatra asked us to do something for the hunger hotspots, we thought what could be a better place than Nabarangpur to focus on. Our project was conceived last month. Our aim is to bring freedom from hunger and malnutrition, said Mukherjee.CTCRI focuses on research on sweet potato and aroids catering to the needs of the eastern and northeastern regions. CIWA focuses on agricultural technologies and policies with a womens perspective and undertakes studies to understand drudgery and safety-related issues of women farmers.Dr Rajasekhara Rao Korada, principal scientist at CTCRI and coordinator of the project, said they would focus on making nutrition available between January and June before the arrival of monsoon. Between January and June there is little food in a tribal household. At CTCRI we have varieties of sweet potato that could address the beta carotene deficiency and vitamin deficiency in tribal women and children. The sweet potatoes developed by us need very little water and would be suitable for Nabarangpur, he said.The two institutes will also help grow nutrient-rich colacasia and tapioca. These will reduce dependence on potato available in he market. Every day, they can harvest one or two such tubers till June, said Korada.CTCRI, which has also conducted research on pulses, plans to introducing green gram and horse gram that would mature in 90 days. Our objective is to intervene in their dietary practice and improve upon it to enhance its nutritional value. The tribals of Nabarangpur mostly eat dalma, a recipe of boiled pulses and vegetables. We will give them good saplings of papaya, banana and drumstick, which they can use in preparing dalma, said Dr Mukherjee.As per the BPL census of Odisha, over 73.6 per cent people in Nabarangpur live below the poverty line. According to the women and child development department, 3,400 children in the district suffer from malnutrition, 296 of them severely.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Ulfa (Independent), which has unleashed a series of subversive activities in Upper Assam ahead of Independence Day, kept up the offensive, triggering five explosions this morning. Four of them were in Tinsukia district and one in Charaideo district. In Manipur, two explosions occurred within a span of five minutes in Imphal on a day various militant groups had called a strike. Shops remained closed and vehicles stayed off the roads. There were no reports of any casualty or injury across the valley. Tinsukia deputy commissioner Ranjan Chakravarty told The Telegraph that four explosions in the district took place around 7am to 8.30am. However, there has been no report of any casualty. Police suspect Ulfa (I) to be behind the blasts. The first blast took place at Laipuli on the outskirts of Tinsukia town near Indira Gandhi High School. The site is about 200 metres away from an army transit camp. Sources said the second explosion occurred at Gabharubheti Tiniali near a garbage dump under Philobari police station. The area is less than 1km away from Bamungaon where on Friday night suspected Ulfa (I) militants shot two persons and injured six others. The third blast took place on the approach road to Badlabeta tea estate near the Doomdooma Bypass. The spot is near the Thursday blast site. Sources said the fourth explosion occurred under Doomdooma police station at Masuapatthy, which is a small market while the fifth was reported around 8.30pm at Pathaligarh Chariali in Charaideo district. Tinsukia, which shares a border with Arunachal Pradesh, has been targeted by Ulfa (I) in the past few months. Militants sneak in from their Myanmar-based camps. Tinsukia additional superintendent of police (headquarters) Lamhao Doungel said the IEDs were of low intensity. We have launched an operation against them, he added.Ulfa (I) boycotted the Independence Day celebrations like in previous years and on August 9 the outfit warned of a violent clash if the celebrations continued for three consecutive days. As a departure, though, people in the urban areas defied the strike. In Imphal, an IED exploded on the foothills of Chingarel at Singjamei on the outskirts of the city at 8.35am. An Assam Rifles post is located on top of Chingarel hillock. Five minutes later, another IED exploded at Tera Bazar in Imphal West. The bomb exploded near a house and an old couple fainted on hearing the sound. They were hospitalised.

To that end, it is offering several incentives including discounts on seeds of the new varieties purchased from the government and subsidies on every tonne of crop produced.The government has announced a subsidy of Rs 8,000 per tonne of paddy produced with seed varieties that are less than 10-years-old. While this is a subsidy for grain production, farmers have also been offered better discounts and incentives for buying newer variety seeds from the agriculture department. While seeds of certified high-yielding paddy varieties will be sold at a discount of Rs 10 per kg, pulse seeds of varieties less than 15-years-old will be offered a discount of Rs 25 per kg.""Farmers need to have bought seeds of the variety ADT 49 (released in Ambasamudram) from the agriculture department and produced the grains of that variety,"" said the deputy director of agriculture, Mohammed Iqbal. ""The discounts on the seeds are also attractive because paddy seeds usually sold at Rs 24 per kg will cost only Rs 14 per kg and pulse seeds which cost Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg will come down by a sizeable Rs 25 per kg, giving farmers an Rs 500 subsidy for a hectare,"" he said.Besides ADT 49, the agriculture department is promoting six new varieties of pulses - which include CO7 and CO8 (released in Coimbatore) for green gram, CO(RG)7 for red gram, CO6 and VDN 5 for black gram and CO(CP)7 for cow pea.Five of the six varieties, released in Coimbatore in the last decade, are believed to be suitable for the district's soil and climatic conditions and have additional benefits too. ""For example, CO7 gives a yield of Rs 900 kg per hectare and is a bunch variety which all matures uniformly, making it labour-friendly,"" said an agriculture officer. ""VDN 5 is also resistant to yellow mosaic virus,"" she said.Experts say such initiatives are critical to promote newer varieties. ""Farmers hesitate to try out the new seeds because they are too attached to age-old varieties. Often traders also reduce the farm gate price for grains of new rice varieties,"" he said. ""So in situations like this, a subsidy is advantageous.""""The newer variety have guaranteed germination, easily achieve optimum population per square metre, have a good yield and are resistant to yellow mosaic virus, all of which the varieties which are over two decades old don't enjoy,"" said head of TNAU's pulses department, Kannan Babu.The farmers, however, are divided on this issue. While Oothukuttai-based farmer, D Deivasigamani, says newer varieties tried regularly by him are more pest resistant and give him as much as 300 kg more per acre, other farmers doubt the new varieties. For example, Maharashtra-based farmer Subhash Palekar, the father of zero budget farming, says promotion of new varieties is a conspiracy to make farmers dependent on seed and fertilizer selling corporations. ""The new varieties which call themselves hybrid and high yielding do not produce seeds for the next season of cultivation and require only store-bought fertilizers, making the farmer dependent on store-bought items. When our soil and weather do not change every year, why should the seeds we plant change?"" he said during an earlier interaction with TOI."

Over the last 25 days, prices of pulses in the wholesale markets in Maharashtra have been dropping by 20 per cent.LAST year, when prices of dal touched the sky, the state and central governments had announced efforts to permanently increase cultivation of pulses. While area under cultivation of pulses has seen an increase of 119 per cent, wholesale prices has seen a dip, which many say might hamper permanent increase in cultivation area.Over the last 25 days, prices of pulses in the wholesale markets in Maharashtra have been dropping by 20 per cent. Good monsoon and reports of a good harvest in the overseas markets are the main causes attributed to the price dip.Pravin Dongre, chairman, India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) said a further price drop is expected across the wholesale markets.Sowing or reporting issues by the government of Maharashtras agriculture department shows that sowing of Tur daal has increased by 123 per cent, while that of Moong and Urad daal has increased by 115 and 124 per cent respectively. This changed the market sentiments and resulted in liquidation of stocks from farmers/millers/ traders. At the same time, Dongre said the demand from end consumer is down. Already, moong prices are trading near Minimum Support Price (MSP) value. Once the imported pulses start hitting the market from September, more price correction is expected.Volatility of prices has been one of the major reasons for farmers getting weaned away from pulses towards sugarcane. Even in water-stressed Marathwada, pulses recorded a steady decrease as farmers complained of lesser returns. In an ambitious move, the state government decided to increase pulses area with 2016 being designated as the year of pulses but if prices continue to dip, doubts are being expressed if it can be achieved. Dongre said the government should assure farmers that their stocks should be brought at MSP across all mandis in the country.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

According to government officials, over 10,000 people had been affected by the rains and more than 3,000 houses have sustained damage.Banda Additional District Magistrate Gangaram Gupta said the Ken river has been flowing nearly 4 metres above the danger mark. He said that while only 6 villages had been severely affected by the flood, the district administration has sought motor-driven boats from the army as a precaution to ensure efficient supply of relief material in case of emergency. Mahoba District Magistrate Vireshwar Singh said that most of the dried-up ponds in the district were now overflowing.Jhansi DM Ajay Kumar Shukla said that water had been released from Rajghat and Matatila dams, and the Betwa river now has over 2.5 lakh cusecs of water passing through it. The situation is still under control. More water has passed through the river earlier. No villages have been affected in Jhansi but the administration and police officials have been put on alert, he said. Officials did not have an estimate for the loss of crops, but said that sesame and split green gram (moong dal) crops have reportedly suffered damage due to excess rains.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

A good rainfall is required in the next 10 days to improve the situation, he said, adding that in the last 20 days, none of the three blocks received above 60 mm rain.The district paddy transplantation activities are pending on over 6,700 ha, while inter-cultural activities are yet to be completed on 25,000 ha. The district has taken up 2.13 lakh ha under paddy cultivation, while one lakh ha is earmarked for non-paddy crops. To counter weak monsoon, Sundargarh district administration had advised farmers not to cultivate paddy on upland. Accordingly, 63,000 ha of bonded upland, 95,000 ha of medium-land and 55,000 ha of low-land have been taken up for paddy cultivation.Incidentally, the district had witnessed 65 per cent deficit rainfall in June and 15 per cent less rainfall in July, while in 20 days in August, the average rainfall was 238 mm against the months average of 393.9 mm.Agriculture experts said sighting of dew in the morning is an indication of monsoon nearing an end and hope for a good rainfall now rests on formation of low pressure.The DDA said despite a weak monsoon, there is no fear of damage to paddy crops as there has been sporadic rainfall and now occasional showers would be adequate to retain soil moisture for survival of paddy.Meanwhile, cultivation of non-paddy crops, which requires less water, remains unaffected. So far, 50,000 ha have been covered under various non-paddy crops including maize, groundnut, other oilseeds, pulses like moong and arhar and vegetables. Cultivation of non-paddy crops on the remaining 50,000 ha would continue till October end."
58f602b87be9e031f13acf53,Drought threat looms over Andhra,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/vijayawada/Drought-threat-looms-over-Andhra/articleshow/53803156.cms,2016-08-22,"VIJAYAWADA: With the south-west monsoon remaining inactive for a considerable period of time, the farming community in the state has begun to feel the heat. Barring one or two districts in Rayalaseema region, almost all districts in the state are reeling under drought due to the scanty rainfall. Crops are withering away even in the areas which reported normal rainfall as not a single day in August witnessed showers anywhere in the state. Continuous dry spell has become a major concern for farmers as they are struggling to save the nurseries. The state government, which deployed all its employees for Krishna Pushkarams management, does not seem to have realised the crisis in the agriculture sector as it is yet to rush with contingency plans.According to latest reports, paddy was sown in just around 55 per cent of the actual acreage in the state due to severe shortage of rain. The monsoon, which lured millions of farmers to the fields with pre-monsoon showers, had suddenly disappeared from the skies as season progressed. In fact, farmers too went into early sowing operations following the predictions of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), which termed that it could be a 'good monsoon' and erase previous drought conditions. Surprisingly, all the predictions of IMD went wrong particularly with regard to AP as the state is just heading for another serious drought. The state is already gripped with extreme hot conditions due to adverse weather conditions which is expected to prove fatal for the crops.Paddy farmers will be the biggest losers if the state did not witness another shower in the next fortnight. The tall claims of the state government on river linkage through Pattiseema have come a cropper with the crops even in Krishna delta facing acute shortage of water.""The fate of the other crops too is not encouraging. Rainfed crops like jowar and ragi are grain-forming stage, red gram, green gram, black gram, chillies and cotton crops are at sowing in the state. We are unable to suggest ways to protect these crops as not even a drop of water is available in majority of the tanks in the state,"" admitted a senior official of the agriculture department. He said maize crop is also at the cob-formation stage while the early sown green gram, black gram and groundnut crops are in pod-formation or harvesting stage. Sesamum crop is in the flowering to pod development or harvesting stage. Watering is a must in the given weather conditions and the situation is grim, the official said.The state government asked the agriculture officers to encourage farmers to make use of the rain guns to keep the standing crops afloat. ""We are doing our best to protect the crops wherever possible. We are supplying rain guns to as many farmers as possible to combat adverse monsoon conditions,"" explained agriculture minister Prathipati Pulla Rao, who is visiting Anantapur to oversee the crop rescue operations. While Nellore district, which was virtually washed away in floods last year, is witnessing the highest rainfall deficit with minus 45 per cent rainfall during the season. While Prakasam is undergoing nearly 32 per cent deficit, Guntur has received 20 per cent less rainfall. In fact, the deficit will be much higher if it is compared with normal rainfall in August alone. Paddy is sown just in 8.8 lakh hectares as against the normal acreage of 16 lakh hectares in the state, which is just 55 per cent. Chances of saving the crop till harvest too is doubtful if the situation continues."

The district has received 1,558 mm of rain till August 22 this year, as against the average of 1,741 mm. What is more, the average rain in the district in the peak monsoon months of June, July and August is 1,594 mm. This year, Shivamogga received only 1,076 mm in this period, leaving the total rain deficiency at 33 per cent.Sowing of paddy in areas where cultivation is taken up using rain-fed method, preparation of nurseries of paddy seedlings and transplantation of the saplings in command areas of reservoirs are done during these three months. K. Madhusudan, Joint Director of the Department of Agriculture, told The Hindu that the target was to cultivate paddy in 1.06 lakh hectares this year in the district. So far, cultivation has taken place in 75,000 hectares only.No water in lakesIn Udugani and Talagunda hoblis of Shikaripur taluk, paddy is grown by using the water stored in lakes. Owing to deficient rain, the lakes have not filled up. The farmers have raised paddy seedlings here but are unable to transplant them because of the water shortage. Transplantation has not taken place in many areas in Sagar, Hosanagar and Tirthahalli taluks, where paddy is cultivated in rain-fed method, locally known as makkigadde .But as paddy transplantation is under way in some parts of the command areas of Bhadra, Tunga, Anjanapura and Ambligolla reservoirs, the total area under paddy cultivation is likely to reach 90,000 hectares, Mr. Madhusudan said.On the contingency plan, he said farmers in rain-fed areas and those dependent on lakes have been asked to cultivate ragi and pulses, including green gram and horse gram. Sunflower too can be cultivated in these areas after August. The department has a stock of 20 tonnes of sowing seeds of ragi and it has arranged for their distribution to farmers through Raitha Samparka Kendras. Based on the need, arrangements have been made to distribute seeds of pulses as well, he added.Mr. Madhusudan said the department would organise programmes in villages to provide information on cultivation of ragi, pulses and sunflower."

The MSP fixed by the government is Rs. 5,225 a quintal. Although government agencies were expected to enter the market once the prices of the commodities fall below the MSP to protect growers from the exploitation by market forces, there is no signal to this effect so far.Another disturbing feature was that the prices of pulses have stared crashing even before the arrival of the fresh stock of red gram and sesamum. Although the fresh arrival of red gram is expected some time in January 2017, the prices have started sliding downwards dangerously. The price of red gram, which was being purchased at more than Rs. 9,000 a quintal a few weeks ago, has now crashed to Rs. 5,790 a quintal. The price of sesamum, which was being sold at Rs. 16,000 a quintal a few weeks ago, has now crashed to Rs. 6,475 a quintal even before the arrival of new stock.The sudden crash in prices is attributed to the decision of the Union government to import 8 million tonnes of pulses. Five million tonnes of pulses had already been imported. When there is no crisis or shortage of pulses, the Union government has started importing it. It has led to a crash in its prices in the wholesale market affecting growers, Basavaraj Ingin, president of the Karnataka Red Gram Growers Association, said. Sources in the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee Yard and the wholesale market told The Hindu that the prices of green gram and black gram were likely to fall further when new stocks would arrive after the completion of the harvest. Although the prices had crashed in the wholesale market, it continued to be high in the retail market."

Farmers are worried that the three-year cycle of drought that pushed them to misery may not have been broken at all.August is the wettest month for Bidar that lies in the north east transition zone. As much as 200 mm of the 900 mm of annual rainfall is received in this month, as per the annual aggregated average of 70 years. But this year, the rain gods sprinkled only around 60 mm of water in the five taluks in August.This seems to have affected crops of pulses, the main stay of farmers in the kharif season.Growth of crops has been affected in several villages and leaves have turned brownish in some villages.As much as 3.5 lakh hectares of the 7 lakh hectares of cultivable land in the district has been greened by major crops such as green gram, black gram, red gram and soya bean. Pulses form 62 per cent of the total sown area.Of these, soya covers the largest area of 1.4 lakh hectares (ha). Red gram has been sown on 52,000 ha, green gram on 16,000 ha and black gram on 15,000 ha. Farmers have also cultivated jowar on 22,000 ha, sugarcane on 21,000 ha and maize, niger, millets, vegetables and other crops on the rest of the area.Monsoon began on an inspiring note in June and rainfall was early and copious. Rain gauzes across the district collected 176 mm of rain in June that usually receives 128 mm. July that is supposed to bring 187 mm, got 212 instead.DisappointmentHowever, August was a disappointment with 70 per cent deficiency in rain.Among the taluks, Aurad is the worst hit, with only 42 mm of rainfall against the average of 206 mm. Humnabad and Basavakalyan are in a slightly better condition.We were very happy with the rainfall in June and most farmers began cultivation. The condition of crops across the district is good. But now, farmers are worried that any delay in rainfall will damage the crops and make them lose their input investment, says Vishwanath Patil Koutha, Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader.Scientists tell us there is hope for rainfall in 2-3 days, says K.

The latest figures of Labour Bureau of the Union Ministry of Labour show that 1.35 lakh jobs were created in 2015, the lowest figure since 2008, lower than the 4.9 lakh new jobs in 2014 and 12.5 lakh in 2009.Job creation is the ultimate goalJob creation is a humungous task for any government given that every month, a million Indians become age-eligible to join the workforce. While we work on overhauling the education system and imparting large scale skilling programmes, the key is to not veer away from the solemn goal of job creation.But how many of these eligible candidates are employable in fast growing sectors like Information Technology, banking and financial services, manufacturing, infrastructure or even recession proof industries like pharmaceuticals, education and healthcare? The stark reality is that not too many of the larger population may fit into the specialised roles that these sectors demand. However, it is an undeniable fact that services sector today is the largest sector in India.As per data from the economic survey, its contribution to the GDP is almost 58%. So it is a no brainer that services sector is what we should, as a rising economy, focus on to sustain our growth rate and more importantly create jobs.It is pertinent to note that the retail and hospitality sector in our country have not achieved their full potential  both in terms of contribution to the GDP and providing employment. This despite the fact that we have the largest young population in the world, rising per capita income and purchasing power parity. The model law when implemented will most certainly boost consumerism.The biggest driver will be retail shopping malls, as it will give a level playing field between online and offline retailers as now customers will have better options available all the time. Hospitality will also see a larger impact.The recent announcement of centres decision to implement the recommendations of the seventh pay commission will also impact consumer spending in real estate, hospitality and retail sectors. More importantly, we have just started witnessing a slowdown as far as jobs are concerned in the ecommerce sector, as it fights funding crunch and cash burn to focus on unit economics. This slowdown in jobs can now be offset with new jobs in brick and mortar retail outlets.Job growth of 8-10%So again as pointed out earlier, the model law allowing malls, cinema halls, restaurants and shops to remain open 24X7 is a right step in the long path of creating more jobs. If implemented by various states in its current form (as it is only suggestive and onus is on state governments to adopt it in full), will boost employment across many sectors. It will create tremendous job opportunities with a spike of 8 -10% in growth in jobs across India. These opportunities will also drive workforce movement across cities as skilled labour from tier II and tier III cities will find greater options of livelihood with the opening up of more jobs.The Bill is also expected to lead to greater gender diversity as women will get better opportunities to work and make better decisions based on their work life situations. Considering that the retail and hospitality sectors have more women oriented job profiles, this can only spell hope for the larger women population.The most far reaching suggestion in the Bill is the onus on establishments to ensure the safety of their women workforce working late. They will have to provide safety not only at work but also while travelling to work.India has only about 30 million jobs in the organised sector and nearly 440 million in the unorganised sector. Policy initiatives alone can help the unorganised sectors organise and informal employees to move into formal jobs where they can also avail the comfort of social security.The recent referendum in Britain has shown that globalisation will hit a speed bump and that export-led growth will not be sustainable in the long term. It serves us a very valuable lesson that we need to focus on domestic consumption of products and services. Policy initiatives like the model law are vital to expanding our domestic market and creation of new jobs.(The author is Managing Director of Kelly Services and Kelly OCG India, a recruitment and staffing company)"

Photo: Arun KulkarniThe members of the Karnataka Prantha Raitha Sangha (KPRS) staged a protest in front of the office of the Deputy Commissioner here on Thursday opposing the Union governments move to import red gram and other pulses from the other countries and urged the government to fix a minimum support price to protect farmers against fall in agricultural prices.State president of the Sangha, Maruti Manpade, in a memorandum addressed to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah, urged the State government to take a delegation and exert pressure on the Union government to fix the minimum support price of black gram and green gram at Rs. 6,000 per quintal and red gram at Rs. 7,000 per quintal.Mr. Manpade said that the excessive import of 69 lakh tonne of pulses into the India market in the last two years has adversely affected farmers.The estimated pulses production in India is 20 lakh tonne against the requirement of 24 lakh tonne. The Union government could have focused on increasing the production of pulses to meet the demand instead of importing excess pulses, he said.Mr. Manpade demanded that the State government hold a Cabinet sub-committee meeting to discuss the issue of minimum support price.He also urged the government to establish procurement centre at every gram panchayat for purchasing agricultural produce."

With the rates fast going southward, the businessmen are saying that bringing more supply by way of imports will only worsen the situation. It will hit the farmer who may not fetch a good price for the produce.Citing reports that government plans to import another 90,000 tonne of pulses, The Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association has termed the move as unwarranted. ""Already growers of moong dal have started getting a rate below the minimum support price (MSP). As against an MSP of Rs5,225 a quintal, moong dal in the open market is getting a rate in the range of Rs3,500-4,500 a quintal, said a press release issued by the association. Pratap Motwani , the association's secretary, said already there is enough supply of pulses in the market. ""If the government imports more stocks then the rates are likely to fall by more than 50% from the existing level. This will lead to a huge loss for the government. Even the traders will be hit,"" he said.According to the association's estimates, the area under pulses cultivation has gone up by 34% this year. As against a yield of 165 lakh tonne last year, it is expected that the output may be at 200 lakh tonne this season due to favourable monsoon. There has been a sharp decline in the rates of pulses but the government has continued with the import initiative buying at higher rates, he said. In a month's time, the rates have gone down from Rs3,000-1,000 a quintal depending on the variety.

My income has doubled and we have more money to spend, thanks to him, she beamed.Fifty years ago, Swaminathan and other scientists had introduced India to the Green Revolution, bringing in high-yielding seeds, technological implements and machinery and scientific methods for pest control and soil management. With governments support in land reforms, easy credit and procurement, the country became a surplus producer of rice and wheat.But the neglect of pulses has proved costly, forcing the government to import, and making the once-economic source of protein out of reach for the common man.A kilogramme of moong dal costs Rs 160-180, while urad dal is around Rs 200 and tur dal Rs 180-200, all of which have doubled since 2014.Each time we go to the market, the shopkeeper raises the prices by Rs 10 per kg, laments Premalata Srinivasan, a resident of Mylapore in Chennai.It is hard to understand, whether it is an actual or artificial shortage that the shopkeepers are taking advantage of, she said, an apprehension shared by many across the country.Historically, India has been the largest producer, consumer and importer of pulses, accounting for 33% of the worlds cultivated area, 22% of the production and 27% of consumption of pulses.In 2012, 18.34 million tonnes of pulses were produced from a total area of 23.47 million hectares with the average productivity per hectare at 781 kg, falling short of the estimated demands by about 3-4 million tonnes.The pod-bearing plants are cultivated in rain-fed areas and are severely affected by the vagaries of monsoon. Higher input cost, in terms of seeds, fertilisers and labour, affects the return on investment. Lack of incentives from the government also has forced farmers across the country to stick to rice and wheat.For Swaminathan, the crisis was an opportunity to overcome the problem which led to the crisis.When he and his team came to Pudukottai three years ago, it was the driest district in Tamil Nadu.The setting up of Illuppur Agriculture Producer Company Limited (IAPCL) ensured that agriculture became profitable again and ensured that the farmers got the benefits.IAPCL, registered in 2015, markets and sells all the produce from the villages directly to retailers in various cities of Tamil Nadu under the brand: Edaimpatti and Patikaadu.Though the CEO is senior scientist K Thachinamurthy of MSSRF, he only executes the plans. Decisions are taken at the meeting of board of directorsall of who are farmersheld on the 7th of every month.Major decisions taken at the meeting and financial statement of the previous month are circulated to all the producer groups, promoting transparency and accountability and boosting confidence of farmers.With 70 % shareholders being women, the company and the programme also have accorded greater importance and representation to women.The company has now expanded beyond pulses and has a product mix of organic vegetables, integrated dairy and poultry.For R Subbaiah, another prosperous pulses farmer in Illuppur, the 482-kg black gram yield per acre in his farm almost doubled his average returns to Rs 27,306 per acre.I am glad I listened to Swaminathan sir. Today many people from other villages want to imitate us, he said."

Its one of the sights to look forward to at a new aviary and rehab centre for the citys winged population at Thiruvanmiyur. Spread across 700 square feet of a residential terrace, the one-month old facility is run by mother and son duo, Manjula and Shravan Krishan.So far, theyve had visitors that range across woodpeckers, bats and mynas  rescued and brought here from as far as Kilpauk and Thirumullaivoyal. And while most of these feathered friends are either too young or injured to take flight, what we spotted on this particular trip was the height of cuteness.Its half past noon, and a koel hatchling is caw-cawing away, clearly ringing the bell for lunch. This turns out to be a Cerelac-rice-moong dal-raagi-millet formula, which (you have to see this to be believe it) is spoon-fed to the bird! The crazy part? This greedy little one looks up in anticipation after every mouthful, beak wide open, as if to say: Couldnt you bring a bigger spoon?Someone rescued her and brought her to us after she fell from a nest nearby. Its one of the most common incidents we get, says 25-year-old Shravan, who most will recognise as the activist that found Bhadra, the dog that was thrown off a terrace by medicos in the city. Other cases have included everything from a pigeon with an injured wing after flying smack into a glass window to a dehydrated short-nosed fruit bat. Built to be avian friendly, the enclosures have been designed to be rat resistant and each one has multiple perch points from bamboo logs suspended from the ceiling to large rimmed cement pots. We also keep straw on the floor to keep the space cool, not to mention it gives the birds better grip, adds Manjula, as she concludes her feeding session. Bulbs in each enclosure are turned on at night to keep the birds warm.Shravan who also works with the Wildlife Department on snake rescues explains that the challenge is the long wait from the point of a rescue to medical care thats often the biggest stressor for the bird. Birds can die from stress. So minimum handling actually increases their chances of survival, he explains. And thats where intermediate rehabilitation centres like ours can make a huge difference. This way, a bird injured nearby, like the ECR, can rest for a few days here, before making its journey all the way to the Madras Veterinary University in Vepery or the Vandalur Zoo.The birds that have found medical assistance do not include birds of prey like shikras and vultures. But I have requested the Wildlife Warden to grant me permission for Schedule Birds (those that come under the protection of the Wildlife Act) so that they have a higher chance of survival, Shravan says.If you find an injured bird or want to volunteer at the aviary, call 9585212749"

Barring about 2,000 hectares (ha), there is no major threat to paddy crops in the rain-fed district while sporadic rainfall has proved to be a boon for non-paddy crops.The district, with vast upland, is most suitable for non-paddy crops, but farmers traditionally give priority to paddy crops.The farmers were spending tense moments as deficit rainfall in June, July and August delayed first and second phase of paddy cultivation operations. Though sporadic rainfall improved the situation in the affected blocks, broadcasting and transplantation were considerably delayed.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) R N Satpathy said paddy crop on about 2,000 ha in Tangarpali, Sundargarh, Hemgir and Lefripara blocks are likely to be affected due to inadequate rainfall but there is no threat to paddy crops on remaining 2.11 lakh ha with good rainfall in August improving the situation. Amid favourable condition, cultivation of non-paddy crops, which requires less rainfall, is going on in full swing.Agriculture authorities have planned non-paddy crops on one lakh ha of upland and paddy crops on 2.13 lakh ha. Accordingly, 17,400 ha have been planned for pulses, including 7,500 ha for arhar and 5,500 ha for moong. While 6,000 ha and 17,400 ha are planned for cow-pea and black gram respectively, a total of 23,780 ha are earmarked for oilseeds, including 19,880 ha for sesame and 3,800 ha for groundnut. About 12,600 ha are earmarked for cereals and millets, including 8,000 ha for maize and 22,460 ha for vegetable crops and rest for fibre crops like mesta and sun-hemp.The DDA said so far 60 per cent area has been covered under non-paddy crops.District Agriculture Officer (DAO), Panposh, R K Mangal said about 75 acres have been covered under non-paddy crops in Nuagaon, Bisra, Kuanrmunda and Lathikata blocks of Panposh sub-division."

And if you want to learn of the sheer variety of desserts of a runny consistency the lady of such a household can prepare, this is the moment you need to seize.Catholic households in Goa are known to make rice dessert with sheaves of the season's first harvest thrown in to celebrate the konsachem fest. The equivalent of this practice can be seen on day two of Ganesh Chaturthi in Hindu homes.The preparation is strikingly similar.Rice of an aromatic variety is boiled and cooked with few soaked sabudana globules in milk. Sugar, cashewnut pieces, and a haldi leaf are added to the preparation, and the sheaves of the newly harvested rice are thrown in last. Needless to say, the aroma of the rice, the haldi leaf, and the freshly-harvested rice combine into a heavenly experience for the senses when eating this kheer.Sabudana always makes an appearance on days when Hindus are required to observe a fast or just any auspicious occasion in Hindu households.Kheers with sabudana as an ingredient are aplenty, as the globules help bring volume and give a fuller texture to the runny dishes.One homemaker in Margao prepares banana kheer during Ganesh Chaturthi with soaked sabudana, coconut milk, banana, jaggery, and the haldi leaf as its ingredients.Manganem is another favourite in many households during Ganesh Chaturthi.""Soak the chana dal for 20 minutes, Cook it, and keep it aside,"" explains Sonali Vernekar from Mapusa. ""Keep the first thick coconut milk extract that you get separately from the thin extract that you get from the grated coconut later. Cook this thin extract with jaggery, the boiled chana dal and salt. Add little sugar as this enhances the taste. Add pieces of cashewnut and roasted sesame seeds and the thick coconut milk last, and bring to a boil. Add soaked sabudana to the dish, take the dish off the gas stove, and keep it covered for 20 minutes for the sabudana to cook inside.""Manganem is also high in nutritional value and so is the moongachem konn and soji made during the festival. This is the reason these desserts are not restricted to the Ganesh Chaturthi festival alone. This is also reason to not to hold yourself back from asking for a second helping of these sweet dishes when you visit your friend's home on Ganesh Chaturthi."

Vice-president Shivanand Karigar instructed the officials to seek the government's permission to start centres to purchase green gram under the minimum support price scheme before the Ganesh festival concludes. The members expressed concern over the banks pressurizing the farmers who have taken loans to repay the installments and interest at a time when farmers have suffered losses. They urged the Lead Bank to ensure that the farmers are not harassed.Chaitra expressed her concern over the pathetic conditions of the government schools and asked the DDPI to ensure that the children are provided proper facilities. Referring to complaints that children are made to squat on the ground in classrooms, she said they should be provided mats if not desks. She also asked the DDPI to ensure that the teachers do not go late to the schools and leave early.Some members complained that there are no doctors at primary health centres at night and sought arrangement for appointment of night-duty doctors.ZP CEO Sushma Godbole said the district has sought Rs 4 crore from the government to repair school buildings and a proposal has also been given to the chief minister.

This includes Ganesha murtis made out of alum, chocolate or with seeds and fish friendly food in the stomach. Many have even opted to create their own eco-friendly murtis of Bappa at home. The numerous workshops conducted this year also show that Mumbai is serious about going green.Murtikar Rohit Vaste experimented with papier mache Ganpatis on a smaller scale last year, to counteract the bulk sales of PoP (Plaster of Paris) idols at every gully. It has paid off dividends for his decade-old family venture this year. ""The response to papier mache Ganpatis has been humungous this year. In fact, there's been 80% sales vis-a-vis PoP,"" he says. The process of making papier mache idols, which involves the use of paper, clay and natural glues is more time-consuming than clay. However, it's lightweight, durable and can be couriered without the risk of it being damaged.Dattadri Kothur, a commercial artist, who initiated the tree Ganesha concept last year, is also surprised at how the concept has been lapped up Mumbaikars. 'I started making a few idols last year with red soil and seeds in Ganesha's stomach. These idols, when immersed in a pot, grow back as lady finger saplings or tulsi. I wanted to do something that was eco-friendly and didn't just end with visarjan; the plant that grows back is a reminder of the ongoing cycle,"" he says.Anand Pendharkar, an ecologist, has come up with fish-friendly Ganpati idols. These are murtis made of clay and painted in natural colours like haldi, kumkum, multani mitti, gheru and are stuffed with fish-friendly food like corn, spinach, dough and wheat noodles that the fish can nibble on when it disintegrates in the water during visarjan.Another element that is catching on is alum. First attempted in 2009, sculptor Vivek Kamble says, ""Alum is antiseptic. So, when the idol dissolves immediately in water, it cleans it too."" A design and technology company also attempted it last year in Mumbai as part of their eco-Ganesha triology.Vaste is happy that he could retain the artistry with papier mache murtis, which is not possible with other eco-friendly versions. Affirming the fact is Kamble, who says that he cannot mass-produce with alum Ganpati idols and is working on getting the finish that PoP Ganpatis have.For Pendharkar, creating eco-awareness with fish-friendly Ganpatis is more important. ""It's re-aligning the way people celebrate the festival. There are three issues that need to be addressed: the use of PoP idols, toxic colours and size as there's no need for 20-ft idols,"" he says.Aesthetics is also the last thing on the mind of those making their own idols at home. One such father proudly flaunts his daughter's awkward handiwork online. Something that Pendharkar is working at to get parents to use their children's creations at home. ""It adds meaning and value to the celebration at home, and instils confidence in the child,"" he says.Last year, Rintu Rathod made a 3.5ft chocolate Ganpati, which was immersed in milk on the last day of the festival. The milkshake was then distributed to 100 underprivileged children. This time, she has increased the height to nearly 5ft so that she can reach out to more children with it. ""I get orders to make chocolate Ganpatis, but I don't want to earn from it. I tell people to attend my workshops instead and create their own chocolate Ganpatis at home,"" she says, adding that she was quite busy conducting numerous chocolate and tree Ganesha workshops this year.Nanasaheb Shendkar let go of making thermocol decorations for cardboard in 2001, but the risk has paid off only now. The former JJ School of Arts teacher, who makes and sells festive decorations at Lalbaug, endorses cardboard makhars (Ganpati altars), saying that it is inexpensive and longer lasting than thermocol. The decorations can be folded and re-used for a long time. ""We now get orders for the huge sarvajanik Ganpatis. I took a big risk when I started with thick white chromo cardboard material. And now it's great to see the awareness for eco-friendly goods go up to such a great extent this year. But this awareness could only happen through God and the rituals associated with him,"" says Shendkar.Turmeric: Known for its antiseptic properties, people are making Ganpatis out of turmeric powder. This is not to be mistaken for the auspicious Haridra Ganpati (which is made out of turmeric roots) and kept in the cash box.Cow dung: An ancient form, Ganpati idols made of cow dung is especially popular in South. When dissolved in water, it serves as a manure.Wheat: Easy to make, fishes can also feed on these when the idols dissolve in water during visarjan."

The pattern of deficient rainfall has been common to all districts with South Interior Karnataka recording a 70 per cent deficit in the average rainfall during the month.North Interior Karnataka districts consisting of Bombay Karnataka and Hyderabad Karnataka regions also experienced 54 per cent deficient rainfall during August and the Malnad and the Coastal regions recorded 37 per cent and 28 per cent deficient rainfall during the month.As against a normal average rainfall of 197 mm during August, the State received only 114 mm rainfall. Similarly, South Interior Karnataka districts recorded 23 mm average rainfall as against a normal average rainfall of 76 mm. North Interior Karnataka districts recorded 50 mm average rainfall as against a normal rainfall of 110 mm during the month. Malnad and Coastal Karnataka districts recorded 231 mm and 529 mm average rainfall as against a normal rainfall of 370 mm and 732 mm rainfall, respectively.Sources in the India Meteorological Department and the Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre said that the during Makha Nakshatra (Star Regulus in Leo) period from August 17 to 30, the State would record heavy rainfall; but as against an average 75 mm rainfall during the period, it recorded only 36 mm average rainfall causing 52 per cent deficit.However, a silver lining amid the despair was that the scanty rainfall during August helped farmers who had taken up green gram cultivation to harvest their crops successfully this year. (The rain during the harvest period in August usually hampered harvest procedures and caused loss to farmers.)This year, farmers cultivated green gram in a record 52,562 hectares of land against the target fixed by the government at 35,100 hectares in Kalaburagi district. The productivity per hectare was also a record 5 quintals per hectare and as per the official estimate, a record 2.63 lakh quintals of green gram has been produced this year."

Some say disruption, others describe it game-changing. Call it by any name, the Jio announcement has caused quite a stir in the marketplace with analysts predicting an intense price war that will force the incumbent operators like Airtel, Vodafone and Idea to fight for each penny of their subscribers who have this royal choice of shifting, importantly, without changing their telephone number thanks to the portability permitted in the regime.The 4G speed internet at one-fifth of the price charged by the existing service providers coupled with free calls is too tempting to resist on the face of it. While the existing players, consumers and the stock market have all been expecting Reliance Jio to shake up the comfort zone of high tariff muzzled by call drops, the Data-giri unleashed by senior Ambani is too much of a combat for players such as Airtel and Vodafone. The way Ambani spoke at the launch listing some of the hurdles like point of interconnect being experienced for Jio gives an impression as if it is Reliance versus the rest. But then, it was time for regulator Trai to keep its watchful eyes on the unfolding developments.In the midst of it all, where do the subscribers figure? Happily for them, they are a huge mass of over one billion of which less than a third have moved over to the Internet. It is the vacant space of over 700 million potential users who would be central to the Jio business model which has been created by a humungous investment of Rs 1.34 lakh crore and still counting. Jio would be offering a suite of information and entertainment products delivered through different devices. While Ambani has set a target of 100 million subscribers in the short term, market leader Airtel with a subscriber base of 250 million is not going to let it slip through competition and along with other players, is expected to slash rates of data packs. It may be party time for consumers, the major worry for the industry could be the viability of it all since most of the operators are sitting on a large debt pile. Even Jio is reported to have added to the large burden. It would remain to be seen how soon the challenger is able to reach a break even amidst high pitch competition.

The association's secretary Pratap Motwani said he had tweeted to the Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union Food and Public Distribution Minister Ram Vilas Paswan and Chief Minster Devendra Fadnavis over the issue.They were apprised of the problem that large-scale imports of pulses in order to rein the prices has led to the rates crash. This has led to an adverse impact on the farmers. Soon after the tweet, announcement to activate purchases at MSP was made. This has marginally improved the rates of pulses in the range of Rs1,000 to 1,500 a quintal.The move to buy at MSP will help a large number of farmers. The area under pulses cultivation has gone up by 35%. The overall production is expected to reach 200 lakh tonnes as against 165 lakh tonnes in the previous year. If the farmers do not get a decent rate for their produce, there are chances that the production of pulses may go down the next year, again leading to a crisis.Motwani has suggested that the government should focus on ensuring a better rate for the farmers instead of large-scale imports. Moong dal growers have already been hit. As against a MSP of Rs5,225 a quintal, moong is being sold at Rs3,500 to 4,500 in the open market, he said."

This April, however, the farmer from Majuli and his family of seven polished off almost a quintal of beetles.Pankaj is one of hundreds of farmers on Majuli, recently declared the largest river island by Guinness World Records, who have discovered a taste for the light brown, crunchy beetles locally known as 'hati puk'. In fact, Majuli's new-found craze for beetles serves an ecological purpose - pest control.""It tastes great! It's a bit like eating prawns. All through April and May, when the beetles were in abundance, we binged on them,"" Pankaj smiled.The farmers of Majuli, an island on the Brahmaputra spread over 880 sq km with a population of 160,000, would suffer heavy crop damage due to attack by the insect Lepidiota mansueta. The white grub, which has a biennial life cycle, would destroy vast swathes of crops every year between April and May. The grub would mainly attack potato, colocasia, green gram and sugarcane cultivations in Majuli which has about 30,584 hectare of cultivable land.The farmers hit upon the simple but effective idea of eating their enemies with some help from scientists of Assam Agricultural University (AAU), Jorhat.The scientists, under the All India Network Project, began studying the white grub and pest control on Majuli since 2004. Senior scientist of AAU's entomology department and principal investigator of the project Badal Bhattacharyya and his team carried out extensive campaigns among farmers on the nutritional value of the beetle and on using light traps to catch the insects.""The project (to explore ways of pest control) is part of social engineering. We are controlling pests without using any pesticides. This is being done in keeping in mind that Majuli aspires to be a Unesco World Heritage site,"" Bhattacharyya explains.Analyses of the nutritional value of beetle have confirmed that it is rich in protein (76.83%), followed by carbohydrate (10.93%), fat (4.10%) and fibre (5.16%).Farmers aside, the project has also received a thumbs up from the government. In 2014, it bagged the Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed Award for ""Outstanding Research in Tribal Farming Systems"" awarded by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.Majuli, home to diverse ethnic communities and the hub of neo-Vaishnavite culture in the state, is no stranger to entomophagy. However, consumption of beetles would earlier be confined to the Mishing community.With AAU's intervention, other communities, too, have realized the many advantages of eating the grub.Cultivator Ganesh Saikia has the last word on the popularity of the project. ""Earlier, we would have some inhibition about eating beetles. Now, it has become our alternative to fish,"" Saikia said."

The government has not yet issued an official forecast.""Last year, higher pulses prices were hitting consumers. Now farmers could suffer due to steep fall in prices,"" Dongre said.The price of pulses - such as green, black and red gram - hit record highs earlier this year after back-to-back droughts curbed output in 2015. But in the past few weeks, prices have softened with ample rains prompting farmers to cultivate more.""I have reduced area under cotton to cultivate pulses on more area,"" said Sukhdev Nathu Mali, a farmer from Jalgaon district of western state of Maharashtra.PRICES TO REFLECT NEW SUPPLIES, IMPORTSAs of Sept. 2, India's area under summer-sown pulses reached a record 14.2 million hectares, up 33 percent from a year ago, with the market already reflecting the expected bumper supplies.""New season supplies of moong (green gram) have started and prices have fallen below the minimum support price (MSP),"" said Nitin Kalantri, a miller in the western state of Maharashtra.Prices of other pulses could fall below the MSP once supplies roll in from the new season crop, he said.India fixes the MSP based on production cost and makes purchases if prices drop below the government-fixed rate.Rising imports are also expected to drag on prices.""Canada and Australia are set to harvest record crops. They are consistently reducing prices,"" said a Mumbai-based importer.Australian and Canadian farmers raised pulses area to cater to Indian demand.India, which consumes nearly 22 million tonnes of pulses annually, sources yellow peas and lentils mainly from Canada and the United States, chickpeas from Australia and Russia, and green gram and pigeon peas from Myanmar.""It is necessary to protect Indian farmers from cheaper imports. Otherwise next year they will shift to other crops and again prices will rally,"" Kalantri said."

So, we have been advising the farmers to switch to this organic farm practice gradually,"" said Sharma. Director (CAZRI) O P Yadav said that this farm has been developed after a micro level research on the concepts of organic farming protocol and only after getting it certified as organic farm, we have been disseminating the technique to the farmers with a view to make them switch to organic farming focussing on high value crops. The farm has succeeded in yielding an enhanced crop harvest of 830 kg guar, 886 kg til, 516 kg cumin and 808 kg of psyllium (isabgol) in a hectare area each, a premium of about 15% on the conventionally harvested crop.

They will encourage farmers to store their produce at village-level godowns, and sell them when they feel the price is right.As a first step, the zilla panchayat will collect the details of types and quantities of crops grown in each hobli, or a group of gram panchayats. Officials will also study the market trends of the crop and its varieties, as market records have been maintained in the district.Construction of godownsThe second step would involve the construction of godowns or storage units in each of the 186 gram panchayats. Work on building 145 godowns, each of a 60 tonne capacity, under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MNREGA), is under progress. These will be built according to international parameters with pest and snake-resistant platforms and minimal ventilation to contain moisture variation and fungus attacks.They will also be provided with a computer and an internet connection.Modern silos to store grains scientifically will be built in each of the 30 hobli headquarters, using funds available under the Backward Regions Grant Fund. These will have a larger capacity to store grains, compared to the village-level godowns.Two workshops on how to sell food grains on NCDEX will be held for panchayat Development Officers, and officers of the agriculture produce marketing committee and agriculture department and farmers in the select gram panchayats.Some of the grains will also be procured locally, said deputy commissioner (DC) Anurag Tewari.Red gramRed gram has been sown on around 50,000 hectares in the district and the yield is expected to cross 77,000 tonnes this year. The district administration plans to buy all the red gram needed in Anganwadis and primary schools, locally. This will be processed in the Dal mills in the district and supplied through the mid-day meal scheme, according to the DC.Around three lakh tonnes of green gram have been harvested in the district, but the farmers do not have a fair price. Around 25,000 tonnes of black gram and around 3 lakh tonnes of soya is expected to be grown this kharif season.

After two more starters we tasted the main course. Thunka Puri with its jumbo size made for a great combo with Chenna Tarkari and Ghanta Tarkari, a mix of crushed vegetables and sprouted grams. We liked it with Oau Khatta a chutney of elephant apple. We tried Dahi Machha and Mansha Kassa with Ghia Arna, a rice preparation. We recommend Badi Chura with rice.

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, Sept. 14: A seven-member squad of the civil supplies department today conducted raids on Big Bazaar, Reliance stores and other shopping malls to put a check on the rising prices of pulses. The raid was conducted following complaints that several such malls had been selling different varieties of dal at exorbitant rates. Civil supplies officer Ashok Mohapatra told The Telegraph that it was found that the pulse rates were higher at the malls than in the retail market. Official sources said arhar dal was being sold at a price ranging from Rs 110 to Rs 114 a kg at Big Bazaar while moong dal was being sold for Rs 100 to Rs 105 at the shopping malls. ""There was difference of Rs 4 to Rs 5 of pulses per kg being sold at malls due to the cost of packaging and other charges. We have asked the authorities to ensure that there is no higher variation in the prices as compared to the retail market,"" said Mohapatra. Mohapatra added no violation was detected in the physical maintenance of stocks because the malls are allowed to keep a stock of 2,000 quintals as they come under the wholesale category. A retailer, on the other hand, is only allowed to stock 50 quintal of pulses at his shop or godown, he said. A district administration official said a close watch was also being kept on the retail markets. The stocks at Malgodown, the largest wholesale market, would shortly be verified to ensure that there was no hoarding of the pulses. Sources said there had been a hike in the prices of pulses, especially arhar dal, by at least Rs 10 to Rs 15 in the wholesale price per kg compared to the price last week. Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafulla Chatoi also admitted the prices of the pulses had come down in the last month, while the markets were now witnessing a reverse trend. ""The wholesale price of arhar was earlier between Rs 9,000 and Rs 9,200 per quintal, which has again gone up to Rs 100 to Rs 102 per kg,"" said Chatoi. Chatoi said the Malgodown traders were now procuring less quantity of pulses due to severe fluctuations in the prices as they had earlier suffered losses."

Though pulses are grown mostly in the rabi season, the production of pulses in the ongoing kharif season has increased sharply by 29% to 143.95 lakh hectare.The government is pushing farmers to grow pulses as the prices of main food ingredients have gone up due to a shortage in production for the past two years. The ruling NDA has been criticised by Opposition parties over surging prices of pulses as the cost of tur dal went up to Rs 250 in retail markets a few months ago.The agriculture ministry has set a target to achieve record foodgrain production of 270.10 million tonnes (mt) in 2016-17. It has pegged paddy output at 108.50 mt, wheat at 96.50 mt and pulses at 24.50 mt. Sowing of kharif crops started with the onset of the Southwest Monsoon from June and harvesting will begin from next month.Though the country had last achieved a record output of 265.04 mt in the 2013-14 crop year (July-June), the production in 2014-15 and 2015-16 plummeted to 252.02 mt and 253.23 mt, respectively, due to severe drought.Government agencies have started the procurement of kharif moong in Karnataka and Maharashtra at a minimum support price.Other pulses like tur and urad will also be procured once their arrival begins on a large scale, said Agriculture Secretary Shobhana K Pattanayak at the conference. An increase in the output of pulses in the next rabi season would depend on efficient procurement, he added.The government expects 13.50 mt output of pulses in the rabi season and 7.25 mt from the kharif season, to take the total output to 20.75 mt for the 2016-17 crop year. Better water level in reservoirs and favourable soil moisture conditions will benefit the sowing of rabi crops like wheat, he said."

Since the option of import is limited, the bottomline is we need to boost domestic production and productivity,"" CEA Arvind Subramanian told reporters after submitting the report to the finance minister.Among steps required to be taken immediately, he said the procurement of kharif pulses should be geared up in a war footing mode to support farmers as prices of moong have dropped below the minimum support price (MSP) and even tur prices are heading lower.To encourage farmers to grow pulses in coming seasons, he suggested a hike in MSP of gram by Rs 500 per quintal to Rs 4,000 for the 2016 rabi season to start from the next month.He also recommended a sharp hike in MSP of tur and urad to Rs 6,000 for the kharif 2017. At present, the MSP of tur and urad is Rs 5,050 and Rs 5,000 per quintal, respectively.""MSP for other pulses should be increased by the same per cent as calculated in this report for tur, urad and gram,"" he said further and suggested that the farm price advisory body CACP should review its methodology to fix MSP for various crops.He also said MSP of tur should be raised to Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018 when short duration kharif variety is ready for commercialisation.Asked if hike in pulse MSP will impact inflation, he said, ""I don't think increase in MSP will have any impact on inflation. The MSP increase will boost supply in the immediate term and bring down prices.""To encourage pulses in irrigated areas and rice fallows, the CEA suggested that the government should give production subsidies of about Rs 10-15 per kg to farmers via DBT.Stating that MSP alone will not be enough to induce farmers to switch to pulses, Subramanian said, ""This kharif season, the government should launch a war-effort to procure moong, tur and urad at their respective MSPs. It is meaningless if MSP is not backed up by procurement.""He also asked the government not to take ""blunt steps"" to check prices and called for immediate lifting of ban on exports and stock limits on traders.Since pulse yields in India are below the world average, the CEA favoured development of GM technology to boost production and productivity, to boot. ""We need to clearly signal that we are open to GM technology in pulses,"" he said."

Apart from moong, humid conditions have adversely affected guar crop also in the state.A senior farmers' leader Dayanand Poonia told TOI on Friday that the effect of the disease can be witnessed in Bhiwani and Hisar, apart from some other parts of the state. Poonia claims that in some parts of Bhiwani, the disease has destroyed 40% share of the moong crop. Because of the virus, the leaves of the crop have turned yellow. Agriculture department officials said pulses including moong have been sown in over 15,000 hectares in Bhiwani district. In moong, farmers had found a replacement for cotton, which was damaged by whitefly in 2015.Poonia also said that apart from the 40% crop, the late sown variety of moong has been affected by the adverse weather condition, mainly fast waves in the past two weeks.The farmers' leader said similar conditions had affected the gaur crop in 50% area of Bhiwani district, because of high temperature and lack of canal water. Deputy director of state agriculture department Atma Ram Godara said the virus might have affected the moong crop of old varieties.Moong and guar are not insured under the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana. Apart from Bhiwani and Hisar, farmers in the neighbouring Fatehabad, Sirsa, and Bhiwani districts have also sown the crop."

But where once they were the inexpensive option, ahaatas seem to have lost the cost advantage to the city's swankier bars and pubs. Not that you would know it from the many folks who continue to patronise these outdoor boozers.An ahaata, by definition, is a space that abuts a liquor vend. So, you buy your booze from the 'theka' and take it next door. Here, there are plastic tables and chairs, and no-frills service.Finger food is all you get by way of nosh. Everything you need, in other words, for a leisurely evening with your drinking buddies.The ahaata, of course, isn't a strictly Gurgaon phenomenon. Many a small provincial town across the 'cow belt' has these alfresco dive-bars. But Gurgaon's ahaatas (there are as many as 30 in the city, if not more) have a vibe, an almost proletarian cool, all their own. ""The scale you see here, it isn't there anywhere else,"" says local gourmand Pawan Soni (he's the founder of Gurgaon Food Freak , the ever-growing collective of online foodies).The ahaata turned out to be a boon for those who wouldn't be seen dead drinking at home, or couldn't afford the pricey microbreweries in town (and glugging away outside a 'wine shop' wasn't considered de rigueur). Here, you could quaff on a beer or sip on a rum, while munching on some chips or peanuts or moongphali, as you shoot the breeze with friends and colleagues.While still a favourite haunt of the corporate set, ahaatas face competition from Gurgaon's hip hangouts. Once, these would charge exorbitantly for, say, a pint of lager. Now their rates are much more reasonable (and you're likely to get more fizz for your buck).Still, the microbrewery sharing space with the ahaata makes for a typically Indian urban paradox (like the BMW and the bullock). A cheap beer in the open? Or a full-bodied brew in a chilled glass, in an air-conditioned microbrewery? Gurgaon has space for both."

Uday Deshmukh, Chief Statistician of the Agriculture Department, said the App will allow farmers to access the data seamlessly.MahaRain  the App developed in-house by the state agriculture department, is all set to provide over one crore farmers the rainfall data.The App, which is to be published soon on the Google Play Store, gives the farmer access to information on rainfall at the touch of a finger allowing them chalk out their cropping cycle. This is one of the many steps which the department has taken to ensure better planning and better data is generated from the fields, officials said.While the agriculture department maintains circle level data of rainfall on its website, its dissemination to the grassroot level has not happened.Uday Deshmukh, Chief Statistician of the Agriculture Department, said the App will allow farmers to access the data seamlessly. The department has more than 2,000 rain gauges which allows for rain measurement across the state. While various players do provide this data over subscribed SMSes, the App will make the process easier and more accessible.Meanwhile, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY), the flagship program of the central government, has promoted further use of technology in agriculture. Now, agriculture officers will use GPS technology to conduct surveys and prepare reports about the health and position of crops.One of the most critical exercises of an agriculture officer is to determine the crop yield. These reports are used both by insurance companies as well as government agencies for planning and settling of insurance claims.As PMFBY is an insurance policy against crop losses, information regarding crop health and expected yield rise of great importance. Instead of the traditional method of relying on visual inspection to determine the yield, the agriculture department has decided to use GPS technology and an App to feed data into the central server in Pune.Deshmukh said the App can be operated both offline and online. It will allow the agriculture officer to Geo tag a field. Also, as the App would be on the smartphone of the officer, a picture can be taken of the filed conditions which will be tagged through GPS. This data would then be uploaded to the centre server, he said.Once collated, this data would be analysed to give the expected yield of the crop for the season. Other than insurance claims, this data can be used for deriving various policy related interventions later on.Deshmukh said that master trainers training for all the 34 districts have been trained and a similar training will be held on September 19 also. At present, this App is being used to collect information about the ongoing harvest of black gram and green gram.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

With the region receiving a few good spell of rain early on, the farmers took up sowing on a large-scale anticipating good rains through the season.But, the monsoon played traunt dashing the hopes of the hapless farmers. The farmers in the region are in distress as the crops have started withering due to lack of water. According to statistics, the district has missed the sowing target by 19%. The sowing target set this year was 2,54,105 hectares but the sowing was done in 2,50,648 hectares. Paddy, ragi, jowar and maize were sown in 1,74,752 hectares while urad, green gram, tur, horse gram and others were sown in 15,300 hectares. Commercial crops like sugarcane, cotton and tobacco are being cultivated in 12,830 hectares. Now,sugarcane in 1,500 hectares has withered due to lack of water.According to a survey conducted by the Agriculture department, crops cultivated in 1,13,710 hectares, including 50,000 hectares in Arsikere taluk and 18,000 hectares in Belur taluk, have completely dried up in the district.The farmers usually sow ragi, maize, jowar and sunflower hoping good rains in the month of September and October first week. Now, with no rains and crops withering, the yield is expected to come down by 50%, said Mohan, an official of Agriculture department.The district has received 672.2 mm of rains compared to the average expected rainfall of 723 mm till the end of September (13% deficit). However, it is 45% deficit in Belur and 21% in Arkalgud taluks. The Hemavathi dam, as on September 19, has 7.6 tmcft as against the maximum capacity of 37 tmcft.Speaking to DH, Joint Director for Agriculture T Ramachandraiah said, After the farmers protest, water was released from the dam, but has been stopped a few days back as the water is being diverted to KRS dam. The Revenue and Agriculture departments are conducting surveys to assess the loss. The preliminary report is ready and the final report will be submitted to the government in the next few days.Raitha Sangha district president Kotturu Srinivas demanded that the district be declared drought-hit and a crop loss compensation of Rs 50,000 per acre of cultivated land be announced for the farmers. There is a possibility of shortage of fodder in the month of April. Hence, it is important to collect fodder for future use. The officials are not presenting the real report, he added.District-in-charge Minister A Manju said, The 80% of crops cultivated in the district have withered, this year. I will take a delegation of MLAs of the Hemavathi command area to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah and submit a memorandum, seeking compensation."

He appealed to the banks to disburse fresh crop loans to farmers before the Kharif season ends on September 30 without further hassles.""Though banks are issuing fresh loans to farmers, there are several instances of loans being denied. I appeal to the banks to cooperate with the government and help farmers,"" Rajender said at the State Level Bankers' Committee (SLBC) meeting on Monday.The government has only made a partial payment of the third instalment of crop loan dues so far this year. ""Steps were being taken to release the remaining amount and the dues would be settled 'at the earliest'"", he said. According to the farm loan waiver scheme announced in 2014, the government has to pay Rs 17,460 crore to banks in four equal instalments in four years. While the government paid two instalments in full, it paid only Rs 1,060 crore of the third instalment this year. Agriculture minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy too, appealed to banks to issue fresh loans before September 30. Noting that some of banks were collecting interest from farmers for their outstanding loan amounts, the agriculture minister requested bankers not to collect interest and asked them to remit the amount of interest already collected to their respective accounts.Later, Srinivas Reddy told the media that the banks had disbursed Rs 11,556 crore as crop loans against the target of Rs 17,460 crore for the current kharif.""The banks are obliged to issue another Rs 6,000 crore before the end of this month,"" he added. He also said that the government would release the pending input subsidy to farmers in drought-hit mandals soon. He said that Telangana had witnessed good monsoon with 711.8 mm rainfall recorded as on Monday (September 19) resulting in considerable cultivation. ""Farmers have sowed in 37.73 lakh hectares as against the normal 43.4 lakh hectares. Except paddy all other crops, including maize (190 per cent), soya bean (148 per cent), red gram (167 per cent), and green gram (142 per cent), have crossed the normal level.

NAFED decided to intervene in the market by establishing procurement centres with the help of the Karnataka State Cooperative Marketing Federation in Kalaburagi, Bidar and Koppal districts, the three major greengram growing areas, on September 10, after a majority of the growers sold their produce in the wholesale market.Although the prices of green gram in the wholesale market had increased from Rs. 3,500 to Rs. 4,200 a quintal to Rs. 4,800 to Rs. 5,200 a quintal after the market intervention, the response from farmers has been lukewarm.Low quantityAs per official information, only over 177 quintals of green gram had been procured at the procurements centres established at Chincholi, Sedam, Chittapur and Kalaburagi in Kalaburagi district and only 23.24 quintals procured at the procurement centres established at Bidar, Aurad, Basavakalyan and Humnabad in Bidar.The procurement centres established at Kuknur and Kustagi in Koppal were yet to procure the pulse.NAFED was offering Rs. 5,225 a quintal for the pulse procured directly from the growers and this sum included Rs. 4,800 a quintal as MSP fixed by the Union government and an incentive of Rs. 425 a quintal."

58f6ab577be9e031f13b9a82,Govt misled ryots on cotton cultivation?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/Govt-misled-ryots-on-cotton-cultivation/articleshow/54436534.cms,2016-09-21,"HYDERABAD: A government advisory not to grow cotton this kharif crop season has landed state farmers in trouble with prices of alternative crops they were encouraged to grow falling. And rubbing salt into their wounds, the price of cotton has been witnessing a dramatic rise.Further, there has been no word from the government so far on initiating market intervention measures and procuring of produce at minimum support price (MSP).The gravity of distress in the farming community this Kharif has been such that more than two farmers a day - 74 in all - killed themselves in the state just in August, according to Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), an NGO that works on issues related to the farming community. This makes August this year the deadliest for farmers in the recent past. ""When the government advised the farmers not to grow cotton at the beginning of Kharif, it was its responsibility to put in place a support system even before the farmers went for alternative crops. The system should have been ready to procure produce from farmers at reasonably good prices. In the absence of these steps, the government advisory has wreaked havoc and farm suicides have risen at an alarming rate even before the end of monsoon season,"" said Kiran Kumar Vissa , state executive member of RSV.Predicting low prices for cotton ostensibly based on projected global market scenario, the government advised framers not to grow cotton and, instead, asked them to go for crops such as soybean, pulses, and millets.Consequently, in Telangana, the third largest cotton producing state in India, cotton sowing fell drastically this Kharif and cultivation of other crops like soybean, red gram, green gram, maize almost doubled. But much to the farmers' shock, with Kharif drawing to close, price of cotton has gone up and prices of crops that they have planted have fallen. The farmers, in addition to being faced by dropping prices for their produce, are also having to contend with moderate yields that have been below par for the alternative crops thanks to the dry spell that took hold in the middle of the monsoon season. In different agricultural market yards in Telangana, cotton that was sold at Rs. 4,050 a quintal last year in August-September, is now fetching between Rs. 8,000 and Rs. 10,000 a quintal. Only a few are rejoicing this upbeat scenario since a majority of farmers abandoned cotton following the government's advisory. Against normal cropped area of 17.09 lakh hectares, cotton was sown in 9.86 lakh hectares this Kharif.On the other hand, cultivation of soybean went up by 148 per cent from 2 lakh hectares to 2.96 hectares. Redgram cultivation increased from 2.5 lakh hectares to 4.175 lakh hectares that is 168 per cent rise. Maize and greengram saw 190 per cent and 142 per cent respectively with cropped area of 4.91 lakh hectares and 2 lakh hectares.However, the prices of other crops have plummeted drastically. Greengram sold at Rs.6,965 a quintal last year is now selling at about Rs. 4,500. Soybean now sells at Rs. 2,800 against it's last year's price of Rs. 3,700 a quintal. Price of maize has fallen from the last year's Rs. 1,419 to Rs.1,200 per quintal. Redgram has seen a steep decline from Rs 7,000 to Rs.5, 827 a quintal.The government, however, is attributing the fluctuation in price to demand and supply dynamics.""It is natural that price of cotton is going up since cultivation of the crop has drastically gone down across the country. And farmers went for over cultivation of alternative crops because of which their prices have crashed,"" said principal secretary of the agriculture department C Parthasarathi.He said the government issued advisory against cotton to avoid a monocrop situation in the state and asking farmers not to plant cotton was not on the basis of price alone. 'However, the government is ready for market intervention, The farmers need not be worried,"" Parthasarathi said."
590494027be9e04154df8bfd,Central government should also compensate Indian Railways for its subsidised services,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/central-government-should-also-compensate-indian-railways-for-its-subsidised-services/,2016-09-21,"The next annual budget of the central government is to be substantially different from the previous ones. This is the outcome of the decisions taken today by the union cabinet which has decided to advance the budget presentation of the union government by a month and to stop the practice of bringing out an annual rail budget, which was initiated during colonial rule, by incorporating it in the union budget. Moreover the next years budget would also stop categorising central government spending as plan and non-plan, as announced in the last budget, given that the NDA government has already dismantled the planning commission and done away with the plans.One important implication of advancing the presentation of the union budget by a month to the last week of January is that the government will be able to get it approved by parliament well before the start of the financial year in April, as is done by most other countries across the globe. Similarly the discontinuing of the expenditure in plan and non-plan spending will also ensure greater flexibility in the use of funds.So the biggest change is the elimination of the railway budget and its incorporation into the union budget. The move is ushered in the belief that it would reduce the populist pressures for doling out more subsidies on passenger fares and that it would help railways raise prices and mobilise the much needed financial resources for enhancing investments and bringing in cutting edge technologies in line with international benchmarks.So the move to eliminate the railway budget will in some ways hopefully limit the growing pressures on the railway minister to commission unviable new lines and introduce new trains on a network which is running much above capacity on important routes. It will also help railway to resist the pressure from parliamentarians to hold down passenger and freight fares below cost.However, the elimination of the railway budget and the reduction of populist pressures for subsidised services is only a first step in the measures needed to bring back the railways to a sound financial footing. The bigger and more urgent task is to help the railways to reduce the huge losses that the railways make in meeting its social services obligations.This is no easy task as the railway accounts show that the costs on account of subsidised passenger services was a humungous Rs 35,928 crore in 2014-15. Eliminating this huge losses is a task that the railways will have to grapple with in the long to medium term as any one time hike in passenger fares would be suicidal for the government in political terms.So the elimination of the railway budget will only have a positive impact on the railways if the central government works out a time bound programme to improve railways services and raise fares in tandem so that the consumer get value for money and dont feel cheated by a sudden hike in fares. This process can be also hastened if the central government comes forward to meet a part of the social costs of subsidised services by linking such funding to improvement in efficiencies in the rail network.Such a move will give some breathing space for the railways and also provide it an incentive to hasten the process of modernisation which will help improve services and reduce costs. Such an approach is nothing new as the government has already ushered in such measures in the electricity sector by setting up regulators to fix power prices and asking the state governments to meet cost of power subsides from the state budgets. So it is time that the central government tried the same approach and paid for the social service obligations of the railways from its pockets and let the railways mobilise fresh funds that its desperately needs to improve its services. But this can happen only if the government set up a railway regulator to fix freight and passenger fares and move up its efficiency levels to global benchmarks. A simple amalgamation of the rail budget in the central government budget is thus only a first step of a long and difficult journey for modernisation of the Indian Railways."

Natarajan here on Friday, S. Sathiah, secretary of the society, said NABARD had helped with a financial assistance of Rs. 50,000 to train 30 women members of the society in making jaggery at Kavakulam in Kadaladi block.Though palm jaggery made of neera, the palm nectar extracted from inflorescence of toddy palms, contained nutritious and medicinal values, it could not be marketed well for various reasons. To promote the sale of palm jaggery, the society had decided to add value to the product after tying up with NABARD, he said.Neera was filtered and processed for making value-added jaggery, comprising dry ginger, coconut, cardamom, groundnut, sesame and green gram. The product could be directly consumed by people of all ages, he said, adding it was an ideal substitute for sugar and served as medicine for diabetic patients.We proposed to train more women members in making jaggery and help them earn additional income, Mr. Sathiah said. The production would start after the season begins in February next year and about 300 kg of value-added jaggery could be made in a day. It was priced at Rs. 300 per kg and commanded a good demand in market, he added.Expressing concern over indiscriminate felling of palm trees in the district as well as in others parts of the State, Mr. Sathiah urged the Collector to come out with a scheme to protect palm trees. There were about six crore palm trees in the State and one crore in the district, and during the last five years, at least 50 lakh trees in the State, including 10 lakh in the district, would have been felled, he said.Village Administrative Officers and Tahsildars could be sensitised to the importance of protecting the State Tree on the lines of protecting teak, red sanders and sandalwood trees, he suggested.The society, on its part, had planted about 55,000 trees in the coastal areas of Pudumadam, Kalimangundu, Karan and Idumori in the district since 2008-09, he added."

58f4bbe360de4776e3694317,...And battle with a 100-dish feast,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160926/jsp/nation/story_110279.jsp,2016-09-26,"A sadya, not 100-dish, spread War on poverty or not, if you are in Kerala in the month of Onam, it is hard to escape sadya, the Malayali feast without which no festive occasion is complete. So it was for the Prime Minister, who reached Kerala around 10 days after Onam for the BJP national council meeting.On Sunday, he was treated to a 100-dish sadya, according to PTI, which added the spread included five varieties of payasam (the sweet dish known as kheer or sevaiyan in some other parts of India and payas in Bengal.) Asked over the phone from Thiruvananthapuram, some BJP leaders said they could count only 50 dishes and two payasams. Hairs were split with such precision probably because the BJP national councils political resolution focuses on a hard-to-swallow concoction called povertarianism. Usually, a sadya, which is vegetarian, will have around 26 dishes and costs between Rs 300 and Rs 2,000 a head,depending on the category of the hotel. The dishes can be stretched to 100 by having various types of vegetable preparations, pickles and payasams. Served on a banana leaf, the dishes have to be placed in a particular order. Some of the dishes have to be eaten in a particularsequence. It is unfair to accuse the BJP of cooking up or mixing up its sadya statistics. For the uninitiated, it will be difficult to keep count as well as keep the rice and curries from flowing out of the banana leaf. A picture clicked by PTI showed a contemplative Prime Minister concentrating deeply on the leaf during the lunch. The way his fingers are made into a cone suggests (but not confirmed) he is trying to have a brown payasam from the servingleaf  a task that requires a fair amount of skill. Sources said one of the payasams was made of green gram, which mixed with jaggery can be brown. Payasam-slurping, executed clumsily, can leave incriminating splotches on the white clothes that the Prime Minister (as a true-blue sadya gourmet should) is wearing. Some faint-hearted and butter-fingered modern Malayalis drink the payasam from a tumbler  a sadya sacrilege to say the least. A minor transgression seems to be that the Prime Minister is seated at a table. Ideally, he should have sat cross-legged  childs play for a yogi like Modi  on the floor and enjoyed the feast. The Prime Ministers leaf looks more or less wiped clean  a sign that will be appreciated by the host because it suggests the guest had a hearty meal. Rajnath Singh has a long way to go but his posture and the absence of a mound of rice on his leaf suggests he is about to give up.Yes, you are allowed to slurp and lick your fingers at the end. But it is not clear ifModi did either."

This prompted the government to direct NAFED, FCI and SFAC to start procurement a month in advance. At a inter-ministerial review meeting, Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande directed government agencies to give wide publicity to the procurement operations in pulses-producing regions.So far, 200 centres have been set up in pulses-producing states and more centres will be added after the arrival of tur crop in October-November, an official statement said.The production of pulses is estimated to rise 57% to a record 8.7 million tonnes in the kharif season this year from 5.54 million tonnes in the previous season. According to the Agriculture Ministrys estimates, Maharashtra is expected to lead with the production of pulses being pegged at 1.7 million tonnes."

The rains display a diversity of wild pulses , which nature lovers love to relish. Many wild pulses, today, go unnoticed and neglected as the current generation is not aware of their usage in making scores of edible, tasty species. Parents choose to stick to packaged food for a quick solution to their kids' cravings rather than introducing them to the natural and healthier resources lying abundantly around them.Wild pulses help increase soil fertility by their virtue of nitrogen-fixing properties. Vigna, a genus of flowering plant in the legume family, is one of the popular wild pulses.These pulses grow on poor soil, without supplementary nitrogen and provide subsistence to the farmers through their pods. Vigna vexillata, locally known as Bhirmulo or Halunda, is a perennial climber and it bears cylindrical and straight pods, containing seeds like moong.""We used to eat the pods, after collecting them from a creeper that was found in our locality. Sharing and eating them with our friends used to be joyful moments,"" says Ramdas Shetkar from Shiroli-Sattari.The United Nation's general assembly has already declared 2016 as the international year of pulses in recognition of their critical contribution to global security. Indian Institute of Pulses Research has established a garden of wild accessions of different pulse crops. The scientists found the wild relatives of domesticated pulses possess a wide range of useful traits that can help strengthen food security. Besides, these pulses are highly nutritional and more resilient to changes in the environment. Rutuja Kholte, a researcher associated with the botany department of Goa University, said, ""Goa University campus has different species of these crops. There is need to document traditional knowledge pertaining to these wild plants."""

Picture by Prashant Mitra Ranchi, Sept. 28: They are mere students, but already have tips up their sleeves to improve yield of pulses, ensure better food security and welfare of farmers. The schoolchildren shared their thoughts at a two-day state-level students' science seminar that kicked off at Amar Shaheed Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo Plus Two Zilla School on Main Road in Ranchi today. Around 44 students from Classes VIII, IX and X from 22 districts of Jharkhand are taking part in the event organised by the department of secondary education. On Day One, 28 students from 14 districts voiced their opinion on Pulses for Sustainable Food Security - Possibilities and Challenges on Day One. Tomorrow, the remaining 16 will air their views on the topic. Atharva Shukla, a Class X student of St Xavier's School, Chaibasa, laid stress on chalking out innovative schemes for farmers to grow pulses. ""Pulses like chickpeas, masur, urad and moong are high in nutritional value but owing to the sudden rise in their prices, many farmers find it difficult to sow them. I feel the government should provide adequate land to these farmers to help them grow pulses. This will, in turn, be a financial boon for farmers and help them make profits,"" said Atharva. Ritu Kumar Pal, a Class IX student of Kasturba Gandhi Residential School, West Singhbhum, suggested measures to increase productivity of pulses. ""This is only possible when the government takes the initiative to make farmers aware of modern agricultural methods and also provide them high quality seeds,"" said Ritu. Aradhana Patnaik, secretary of department of school education and literacy mission department, was the chief guest on the occasion while Manish Ranjan, director of state secondary education department, was the guest of honour. ""I am amazed to hear such alternative remedies suggested by these children to combat malnutrition. Many poor kids do not have proper access to pulses or even milk. I genuinely wish the government acts on alternative ideas shared by the students,"" said Patnaik. Echoing Patnaik, Manish Ranjan said that in 1950, per capita consumption of pulses was only 50gm in comparison to 150gm in 2016. ""When we look at countries like Canada and Australia, even today per capita consumption of pulses is 50gm. Malnutrition is a major challenge which needs to be tackled and pulses are one of the prerequisite ingredients to combat the problem,"" he said. Winners will be judged on parameters like pictorial presentation, oratory skills, question-answer sessions and relevance of speech. The first prize winner will get the opportunity to take part in the national-level science seminar to be held at Nehru Science Centre in Worli, Mumbai, on October 4."

Two other farmers of the same village also sowed green gram and black gram only to incur huge loss as there was no yield at all.Earlier, we used to develop our own seed and cultivate the crop. But in recent times, we are depending on seed made available in market. This time, we purchased seed from the block office that was supplied by the government, and wondered how the government can supply spurious seed. Where do we go? asks Bagaiah, whose two-acre plot of back gram and green gram has no yield.Pulse crop was sown in about 150 acres in the village by about 20 farmers, and all of them reported losses.

The TPCC president alleged that the State government diverted Rs. 720 crore, which was received from the Centre towards input subsidy for farmers.The government, in its report, stated that recent rains and floods damaged crops spread across only 445,792 acres, including soyabean on 78,000 Ha, cotton on 39,000 Ha; paddy on 31,800, maize on 9,400 Ha; bajra on 5,400 Ha, and chilli on 8,000 Ha. These estimations were completely wrong and the damage is much higher, but the government, instead of extending required help, was suppressing real figures and submitting an erroneous report to the Centre.He demanded that the government undertake a real assessment of damage on war footing and prepare a comprehensive report. He wanted Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao to take an all-party delegation to New Delhi to seek Central assistance for the affected farmers.The government must pay compensation of Rs. 10,000 per acre for paddy, maize, and wheat crops immediately without waiting for the Centres help. Similarly, Rs. 20,000 per acre should be paid for chilli, cotton, and soyabean, and Rs. 35,000 per acre for toor and moong dal. Similar compensation should be paid to fruits and vegetables growers.The CM had no money to clear dues of crop loan waiver scheme, fee reimbursement, and the Aarogyasri scheme, but was religiously ensuring prompt payments to contractors of Mission Bhagaritha and Mission Kakatiya, the Telangana PCC president said."

According to initial official estimates, crop worth over Rs 500 crore has been damaged in at least three districts of Latur, Beed and Osmanabad, which had been under a severe grip of drought till recently for the fourth consecutive year.In all the three districts, soyabean is the major crop, followed by cotton, tur and moong. In Latur, crop on over 4 lakh hectares  sowing had been done on over 6 lakh hectares  has been damaged. Soyabean crop has suffered complete damage on 4 lakh hectares, said an agriculture official in Latur. Officials in the department put the loss at over Rs 300 crore.

All major rivers in the district are overflowing at present.Nana Barde, a farmer and sarpanch of Masurdi village in Ausa taluka that was among the worst affected by drought in Latur, said, Over 400 farmer families, which had sown soyabean, tur, urad, til on 1,000 hectares of land have lost all the crop For four years, we had severe drought and now this tragedy.Beed District Collector Naval Kishore Ram said soyabean crop on 2 lakh hectares had been damaged. Our initialestimation is that the crop worth around Rs 200 crore must have been damaged. But it is difficult to give out theexact figure, said Ram.For the last couple of days, the officials claimed, the district administration had been busy rescuing people trapped in flood waters. Scores of villagers, especially those living close to rivers, have been rescued in the last couple of days, said Ram.Osmanabad district seems to be worst affected in Marathwada. District Collector Prashant Narnaware said his administration had been hard-pressed to bring the situation under control as all major dams were overflowing and rivers were in spate. According to initial estimates, Narnaware said, crop spread over close to 3 lakh hectares had been damaged. Sowing had been done on 3.5 lakh hectares. But these are initial estimates We estimate that the loss could be up to Rs 250 crore, he said.Nanded Collector Suresh Kakani said crop loss in the district had been reported along the overflowing rivers. Last night, we rescued 22 people near Limboti dam after there was discharge of water.Both Ram and Narnaware said farmers should not worry as their crop had been insured. We will carry out proper assessment and ensure that each and every farmer gets the insurance benefit, said Ram. Narnaware said the Kharif crop might have been lost but this rain would benefit the Rabi crop.After a couple of days lull, the rain started pounding Marathwada from Friday. In the last two days, Latur, Beed and Osmanabad have received maximum rainfall.All three districts, which were once worst hit by drought, have recorded over 100 per cent rainfall so far, withBeed receiving maximum 125 per cent rain.In the last 24 hours, Latur has received 69.75 mm rain, followed by Beed (50.64 mm), Osmanabad (41.69 mm), Nanded (32.31 mm), Hingoli (38 mm), and Parbhani (29.9 mm).Collectively, all eight districts in Marathwada have received annual average rainfall of 107 per cent.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

What has alarmed the state is the failure of the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to predict the intensity of the floods.The preliminary reports from districts indicate 50 per cent Kharif crops have been washed out due to floods. The farmers growing soyabean, cotton and jowari will be among the worst hit. The exact crop loss both in terms of area of cultivation and financial would be ascertained once the water in the fields recede, said Agriculture Minister Pandurang Phundkar.Admitting that the floods were unexpected, he said, There were no reports of floods from the IMD. It had indicated rains.Of the total 149 lakh hectares of crops sown, soyabean accounted for a stretch of 35 lakh hectares. The remaining stretch covered cotton, jowari, tur dal, moong, udat and others.At an internal session before the Cabinet meeting, sources said, Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis indicated that financial help to the farmers who suffered crop losses would be given higher priority. The district collectors, along with revenue department and agriculture department officials, are learnt to have been asked to provide the estimate on crop loss and agriculture area affected by the floods.The meeting decided the sugarcane crushing season would commence from December 1. Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said, There are already set guidelines on relief that needs to be extended to the farmers when hit by natural calamities. The government will surely extend all possible help.Highly placed sources said the Aurangabad Cabinet meeting was initially supposed to discuss development projects to tackle the problems related to agriculture and employment, but the floods would now shift the focus on the immediate relief that could be provided to the affected people.At the Cabinet meeting, an additional Rs 4,500 crore, as per the revised cost estimate, would be allocated for two mega irrigation projects that have been in the pipeline for the last two decades.A comprehensive district-wise plan for skill development projects to train the unemployed youths, coupled with water management through water grid projects worth Rs 15,000 crore, is likely to be discussed at the meeting. Once the actual losses are ascertained, the possibility of the state government seeking more aid from the Centre to override the crisis cannot be ruled out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The state has about 150 lakh hectare land under Kharif. A state agriculture department official said that 80% of the damage has been in Marathwada while crops in Nashik and Ahmednagar too have suffered heavy losses.Crops that were worst affected include soybean , split black gram (urad), split green gram (moong), cotton, maize, jowar, bajra, vegetables and onions.A state agriculture official told TOI that the damage figures are set to rise in the coming days as the data from districts is still trickling in. ""Soybean has been the worst hit. Preliminary figures reveal that approximately 70% of the soybean crop in the state may be affected. Soybean has high content of oil and protein, hence it is prone to damage caused due to humidity. Soybean seeds in the pods have now begun to germinate in the field, which is not a good prospect,"" the official said.The official added that though the rains have been inclement in the past few days, it would not affect the state's crop productivity. ""Previous years with excessive rainfall too resulted in crop damage, but the average productivity increased during those years due to a good rainy spell,"" the official said.Another official said that the recent spell of rain, especially in Marathwada, may impact production of soybean considerably. ""The impact has been majorly felt on crops that were ready for harvest,"" he said.N Chattopadhyay, deputy director general of meteorology (Agrimet) at the India Meteorlogical Department (IMD), said that good monsoon this year has resulted in spectacular Kharif sowing and such localized damage may not have any significant impact on the overall production in the country.""There has been some damage to soybean in Madhya Pradesh and paddy in West Bengal , while cotton and soybean crops in Marathwada too have been hit. Weather forecasts show that Marathwada and central Maharashtra will receive only isolated rainfall after two to three days and dry conditions would prevail in the state from October 7,"" said Chattopadhyay.Ajay Srivastav, senior research analyst at Agriwatch, a farm research and consulting body, said that around 30% split black gram (urad) crop has been damaged in Maharashtra, mainly in Marathwada. ""Close to 50% of soybean in the state may suffer quality issues in the coming days due to the recent spell of rainfall. Around 50% of cotton may also experience quality issues,"" he said, adding that yellow rust formation on 'tur dal' or split pigeon peas has been noticed by some farmers.Srivastav said that cotton and soybean may face quality issues because both get affected when exposed to excess water.""The cotton inside a cotton boll turns yellow once it is exposed to water. This, of course is not ideal, as white cotton is considered to be of the best quality. In the case of soybean, most of it has matured by now in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. Farmers who have been unable to harvest the matured crop will come across quality issues such as seed damage, yellow rust formation, among others,"" said Srivastav."

It is likely to come down further to around Rs. 100 by January 2017, traders say.The retail price of toor dal was between Rs. 110 and Rs. 125 in September.The current rise in the price, traders point out, is owing to depleting stock in the market.There are also fears of reduced output in the State following damage to the standing toor crop on 40,000 hectares in Kalaburagi owing to the recent floods. Traders say the price is better this October compared to the corresponding period last year when it cost Rs. 170 a kg.Despite the fears of reduced output from the traditional toor growing belt in Kalaburagi, Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, told The Hindu that the output is likely to be balanced owing to increase in sowing area in other regions.Incidentally, the sowing area in Raichur where farmers have shifted to toor from Bt. cotton has increased from 40,000 hectares last year to 96,000 hectares this year. However, wholesale dealers are keeping their fingers crossed and hoping that fresh harvest starts arriving by November end, he added.Meanwhile, Shivanna H.S., a retailer in R.T.

Due to inadequate rainfall in the district, most of the crops have withered away. It is estimated that crops cultivated on total 74,783 hectares of land in the district have withered away, with losses running into at least Rs 43.76 crore.The period between April and September are considered to be monsoon months. Usually, sowing of crops takes place during these months. The district normally receives 724 mm of rainfall. For the last few years, unfortunately, the figures are not encouraging.

They have estimated that crops cultivated in at least 74,783 hectares of land have suffered damage. Of this, more than 33 per cent of crops have withered away in total 66,972 hectares of land and at least 64,356 hectares of land out of this, is rain-fed.The highest crop loss has been reported in Bangarpet taluk, with crops having withered away in 17,911 hectares of land. The lowest crop loss has been reported in Srinivaspur taluk with damages reported from 12,843 hectares of land.

(Representational Image)IIT-BOMBAY, the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), the NGO Sneha and Sion hospital are partnering in an experiment in Dharavi to eliminate malnourishment in 300 severely undernourished children across the slum. In six months, the ICDS will be able to take a call on whether to replace its standard supplementary nutrition for children  Take Home Ration (THR)  with a new nutritious meal. The THR, provided in the form of upma or shira, has already been widely rejected by tribal as well as urban children who dislike its taste and have refused to eat the free government-funded food despite no alternatives.Mumbai has 51,934 undernourished children, of which 2,886 suffer from severely acute malnourishment, according to data until August from the ICDS. Dharavi houses 2,174 malnourished children. Other hotspots in Mumbai are Shivaji Nagar, Mankhurd, Goregaon East and Santacruz East, all of which carry a huge migratory population burden. In Dharavis 300 anganwadis, ICDS has now selected the 300 most critical children who will be given an alternate meal every day for three months and then will be followed up with for three more months to check improvement in their weight.We will provide them with a meal of 100-150 gms every day in addition to the free breakfast and lunch served at the anganwadi. According to the childrens weight and age, seven different recipes have been prepared, said Bapurao Bhavane, the nodal ICDS officer in Dharavi. The idea to provide a meal tastier than THR was the brainchild of IIT-B, which is also sponsoring this programme. Most mothers refuse to take the THR. They say the kids dont like its taste, said supervisor Sandhya Pavnivar.The new meal  a mixture of soyabean, urad, moong, chana, wheat and other ingredients  will cost Rs 12 per child per day and has been prepared with a taste that will be appealing to children below six years of age. At Sion hospitals Nutrition Rehabilitation and Training Center (NRTC), where malnourished children from Dharavi are taken for treatment, a medical nutrition therapy has been available since 2010. At the cost of Rs 25 per cup, it is 100 gms of food with protein, iron, zinc, calcium and other minerals. Most importantly, its taste has been made child-friendly. In 2013, we served these cups to 100 malnourished children in Jawahar and saw over 60 per cent children recover faster from severe acute malnourishment, said Dr Alka Jadhav, head of pediatrics at Sion hospital.Ensuring that urban children dont eat junk food and shift to nutritious meals is essential to control malnutrition, said dietician Disha Gade. NRTC is currently the citys only rehab center for malnourished children. It receives between 30 to 40 children every day. According to experts, more such centers are urgently needed in suburbs where families cannot travel long distances to admit their child in Sion.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: October 9, 2016 2:51 am"

Now they have started cultivating only once a year as Karnataka have not been releasing Tamil Nadu's fair share of Cauvery water.Similarly, farmers who depend on the South and North Rajan canals in the district, who had cultivated crops twice a year followed by cultivation of black or green gram, were now cultivating only once a year.The Veeranam lake, which receives water from the Vadavar canal, irrigates roughly 45,000 acres while the North and South Rajan canals irrigate roughly 1.44 lakh acres in the district.The Vadavar, North and South Ranan canals receive water from Lower Anaicut constructed across the Kollidam river, a tributary of the Cauvery river.The Cauvery delta zone in the state roughly comprises 35 lakh acres of land spread in the districts of Thanjavur, Nagapattinam, Thiruvarur, Trichy, Perambalur, Cuddalore and Pudukottai.""In the current year, no water is coming from Mettur dam as the Karnataka government is blocking all water to Tamil Nadu. As a result, cultivation by direct seed method is used for which regular rain water is needed. As the monsoon for the year has not been set in so far, the paddy crops raised by direct seeding method is withering due to lack of seasonal rain. As the ground water is decreasing day by day, bore sets stopped functioning and no water is available even for spraying,"" Elankeeran pointed out.The farmers also said if the current scenario continued, the farmers and agricultural workers in the region would lose their livelihood. ""The economic condition of the farmers in this area will become bad to worse and our very existence is at stake. We request you to do the utmost to save the farmers and agricultural workers of the region,"" Elankeeran said."

(Express Photo: Narayan Pawle) Flooded fields below the bridge connecting Latur to Renapur in Maharashtra. (Express Photo: Narayan Pawle)Through much of September, Sopan Garje of Dadegaon village in Beed districts Ashti taluka, was quite a content man. President of a farmer-producer company, a festive Diwali seemed around the corner for his group of farmers cultivating nearly 1,000 acres of moong (green gram) and urad (black gram).But towards end-September, the water body not far from their village adjoining the Kada Medium Irrigation Project suddenly filled up to 40 per cent capacity, after having been practically bone dry for months. I knew something was wrong, says this progressive farmer in his 40s, who uses every available agro-met service to plan his cropping schedule.WATCH VIDEO|Fortunately, it was raining heavily in just the five-km area around the Kada project, covering Dadegaon and nearby villages. Garjes group managed to harvest their urad and moong crops in the nick of time. But just a few days later, his own onion crop got washed away. Other group members similarly saw their soyabean crops suffer severe damage from the torrential rains through the first week of October. Small patches of bajra (pearl millet) and cotton were also destroyed.Shock after repeated tragedies is how Amol Jadhav, a local journalist and a farmer himself from Kaij in Beed, describes the latest setback. After consecutive drought years that crippled the rural economyof Marathwada  impoverishing even relatively better-off agricultural households  it is the excess rains from the withdrawing southwest monsoon that has caused heavy losses for many farmers of the region this time.Marathwada received 824.8 mm of rainfall during June-September, over a fifth higher than its normal quota of 682.9 mm for the four-month monsoon season. And it hasnt stooped raining even after September 30. During October 1-12, Latur district has recorded 200 per cent excess precipitation, with these at 197 per cent for Hingoli, 172 per cent for Nanded, 171 per cent for Beed and 159 per cent for Osmanabad. The regions other three districts  Jalna (111 per cent), Parbhani (104 per cent) and Aurangabad (73 per cent)  have also registered above-normal rains so far this month, even if not to the same extent.In all, out of the 76 talukas in the Marathwada region, 23 have already received more than 125 per cent of their total average annual rainfall quota. And significant part of these rains have come since the last week of September  just when the standing kharif crop has been due for harvesting or closer to maturity. The contrast with the situation just a few months back  when the Maharashtra government pressed in a record number of water tankers for the parched regions villages and towns  couldnt have been starker. This time, an estimated 3,800 villages of Marathwada have been affected by excess rains, as opposed to its 9,000 villages that were declared drought-hit earlier in the year.According to initial estimates made by district collectors, crops worth more than Rs 500 crore have been damaged in Latur, Beed and Osmanabad alone. That figure is likely to go up with more detailed village-level surveys. An early assessment has pegged the total crop loss across Marathwada at 9,15,431 hectares, out of the 49 lakh hectares area that was planted to crops during the current kharif season. Latur has been the worst hit, accounting for nearly 3,94,000 hectares of the regions total affected farmland. In Beed, as much as 3,68,000 hectares out of the districts 7,98,000 hectares of agricultural land have officially sustained crop damage.Soyabean has been almost wiped out. Out of the 2,40,000 hectares that was sown under the crop, approximately 2,05,000 hectares has been washed away or damaged, said Beed district collector Naval Kishore Ram. Soyabean, which has become increasingly popular among Marathwadas farmers over the past decade, is a light plant particularly prone to losses from either water-logging or extreme dryness.Besides soyabean, another one lakh hectares under Bt cotton has also been affected in Beed. Areas such Patoda and Majalgaon with fields on the banks of the Sindphana and Bindusara  tributaries of the Godavari  are reported to have suffered damage extending to all crops, including soyabean, cotton, tur (pigeon-pea), moong and urad.While soyabean has been the worst-affected, farmers say that even the cotton bolls have been soaked and damaged, while tur in many places has witnessed sprouting of the grains. An assessment of damage from fungal infections is also still underway.The India Meteorological Departments rainfall map depicting the south monsoons performance for the whole season has shown only four sub-divisions in the country to have received excess rains this time. Marathwada is among the four  a rare occurrence for a region that has experienced deficit monsoon in three out of the preceding four years.This year, it has rained so much that six of the 18 floodgates on the Dhanegaon dam across the Manjara River had to be opened. Farmlands across one km of either bank in Beeds Kaij and Ambajogai talukas and in several places of Latur are still water-logged. The same Dhanegaon dam ran dry early this summer, necessitating a dramatic supply of drinking water to Latur city via railway wagons. Latur municipality, then, was in a position to supply water only once a month.But wouldnt these excess rains be of help at least in the coming rabi season? Garje isnt optimistic even about that: One in every four or five farmers is facing problems of severe erosion of their soils from the latest rains. That will make field preparation for the next crop challenging. In some areas, the flooded farmland is too soggy for farmers to even enter the fields for any kind of land preparation for sowing, according to Garje.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

As many as 14 elephants take part in the Dasara procession every year.The elephants will be given utmost care in camps and will be provided with special diet rich in protein and carbohydrates. Every day, the jumbos will be fed green gram, wheat, boiled rice, vegetables, urad dal, jaggery, black gram, sugarcane, boiled cereals, pulses, onions, coconut and several nutritious supplements to make them gain more weight. By gaining weight, they get good stamina to brave the sun and bare heavy loads. They are brought to Mysore Palace 45 days prior to Dasara in order to give them special nutritious supplements which helps the elephants gain weight up to 450 kg in a month. Once they return to their respective forest camps, they miss this royal food. Thus, measures have taken to set up an exclusive camp for pachyderms who participate in the Dasara procession.Speaking to Express, RFO Devaraj said: The Dasara elephants have gained 250-300 kg weight in the last one month. This was possible as we gave them nutritious food with special care. Veterinarian Dr Nagaraj said on an average, Rs 4,000-5,000 is spent on Dasara elephants food daily during festival time."

In the present system, just 45 days prior to the Dasara event, these elephants are brought from different camps. Elephants take their own time to get adjusted to the surroundings. If we have an exclusive camp, there won't be a need 40 or 45 days. They can be brought to the palace just 15 or 20 days prior to the Jamboo Savari. This will bring down the expenses for the government."" During Dasara, on an average Rs 3,000 to Rs 4000 is spent every day on each elephant.

Telegraph picture Nagaon, Oct. 13: Major irregularities have come to the fore in the proper implementation of rural development projects in Karbi Anglong and Dima Hasao, the two hill districts of Assam. This came to light after a BJP legislator brought to the notice of chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal that nearly 80 per cent of the houses sanctioned under the centrally sponsored Indira Awaas Yojana (IAY) do not exist but funds sanctioned for their construction have been shown ""utilised"" on paper. BJP legislator from Bokajan, M. Momin, has claimed that some dishonest officials, taking advantage of the ignorance of unlettered villagers, siphon off money sanctioned for the construction of concrete houses. According to norms, a house under IAY costs Rs 75,000 and the money is paid in three instalments. Initially, a beneficiary was required to have a joint account with a junior engineer but recently New Delhi brought about some changes in the system and started paying the money directly into the beneficiary's account. Karbi Anglong had received financial support for the construction of 27,809 houses between the fiscals 2012-13 and 2015-16. The number of houses in case of neighbouring Dima Hasao is 6,887 during that period. All the houses have been shown ""constructed"" by officials of development blocks under the District Rural Development Agencies (DRDA) of the two districts. Sources in the Karbi Anglong rural development agency admitted misuse of funds and claimed that different factors were responsible for it, including unwanted political interference coupled with middleman- raj. #""When we receive funds for houses, some local people with political clout move the block offices with a long list of beneficiaries forwarded by political leaders. Once the money is deposited against these beneficiaries' bank accounts, they withdraw the money,"" said a block development officer of Karbi Anglong district. Sources said in case of a joint account (beneficiary and junior engineer), it was found that at times both the parties had an understanding to withdraw money and share the spoils. Again, the junior engineer, who had the power to stop the second instalment of funds if he was not satisfied with the progress of the project, would file a false report and the second instalment of funds was sanctioned despite the fact that the particular house never came up in the first place. Again, the junior engineer could dupe a beneficiary by making him sign the cheque and withdrawing the money. DRDA officials blamed beneficiaries for their preference for money over house and also alleged irregularities by some bank officials. There are allegations that officials of SBI Kheroni branch withdrew Rs 1.2 crore meant for construction of IAY houses in areas under Sochang development block. Sources said discussions were on between the SBI and DRDA officials to return the money. Karbi Anglong DRDA project director David Timung told The Telegraph over telephone that at times the money deposited in a beneficiary's bank account was withdrawn without the consent of DRDA officials. He said they had taken action against some corrupt block development officers and junior engineers engaged in the construction of IAY houses, but could not specify the number of officials against whom action had been taken. Momin said Sonowal would order an inquiry into the IAY scam. ""Those involved in misusing development funds will be punished according to the law of the land. We hope the truth will come out soon,"" he added. Karbi Anglong has 11 and Dima Hasao five development blocks. According to official records, Somelangso development block in Karbi Anglong and Doyang Valley development block in Dima Hasao made maximum use of IAY funds during the 2012-13 and 2015-16 fiscals while funds misuse is suspected to be maximum in Sucheng development block in Karbi Anglong and New Sangbar development block in Dima Hasao."

""During our eight years intensive research at CAZRI organic farm, which is a certified organic farm, we have come to an unequivocal conclusion that the organic agriculture is the panacea of all the ill-effects caused by the use of the chemical fertilisers and pesticides and in increasing the soil health as well as the tolerance of the crop"", he said.He said that the vast stretches of desert offered an ideal condition for promotion of the organic farming as this land here was still protected from the negative impacts of these chemicals and would be fast adapted to the practices of the organic farming.Adding to him, Regional Organic head of the Bhartiya Kissan Sangh, Tulcha Ram said that the interest of the farmers has gradually been growing in organic practices of farming. ""Consistent use of chemicals in the form of fertilisers and pesticides had not only reduced the potency of the soil considerably but has also cost them their health as well as money"", he said.According to Sharma, if the second Green Revolution has to be brought in, focus would have to be shifted to organic practices from the chemical farming by focussing on 60% dryland, which we have today.Till now, about 400 bigha agricultural land in Dantiwara has been put under Organic farming practices through constant motivation and assistance to the farmers and the crop, which have been promoted here includes moong, bazar and til predominantly.""Gradually, we were looking forward to bring entire agriculture land of Dantiwara under the fold of Organci Farming and then present as the model village for others to visit and experience the benefits"", Sharma said."

Amid efforts to revise the draft to satisfy the objections raised by the Centre, the state government has indicated that it would mainly rely on improvement of domestic supplies and drives to check hoarding to control prices.In a snub to the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Maharashtra, the Centre has returned states draft legislation for regulating and capping prices of pulses.In April this year, the state government, which had come under fire for spiralling tur dal prices, had introduced the draft legilsation for controlling prices of tur dal, black gram, bengal gram, green gram, lentils, and beans, etc. Reaching out to the middle class in the state, the Devendra Fadnavis had claimed at that time that it was the countrys first government to adopt such a price control mechanism.Watch what else is making newsBut the piece of legislation has failed its first hurdle. While the state cabinet had referred the draft to the Centre for the Presidential assent, Mahesh Pathak, Prinicipal Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies, when contacted, confirmed that the Centre had raised queries on the draft, which had been returned back to the state.Amid efforts to revise the draft to satisfy the objections raised by the Centre, the state government has indicated that it would mainly rely on improvement of domestic supplies and drives to check hoarding to control prices. Pathak informed that the governments move to distribute subsidised tur dal had already impacted retail prices, which had overshot the Rs 150 per kg mark in April. The retail prices are now hovering around the Rs 110 per kg mark, whereas the wholesale rates are about Rs 100 per kg, Pathak said. The senior bureaucrat informed that on similar lines the Centre had recently allotted 500 tonne of split bengal gram to the state. We plan to distribute it at a subsidised rate of Rs 55-Rs 60 per kg. The supplies will be distributed within the next fortnight, he said.Sources in the government admitted that the Centres refusal to grant assent to the bill could lend more ammunition to the Opposition to fire salvos at it. The consumption of pulses is expected to soar during the Diwali festival at the end of the month.Officials said that the Centres main objection to the draft legislation was a provision for penalising a producer or a trafer found violating the price cap norms. While the government had proposed an imprisonment of up to one year, the Centre has said that it was not in consonance with the universal Essential Commodities Act (1955), which advocates seven year imprisionment for violators. Some other minor technical inconsistencies have also been identified, said a senior state government official.Till the time of filing this report, the state government appeared divided on the revision measure. While the states Law department has mandated a Cabinet nod for the revision to the draft, the Food and Civil Supplies department feels this wasnt necessary, a source said.

Well, it's true, and Malabar Regional Cooperative Milk Producers' Union (Milma) has now taken steps to help farmers make their cows belch and fart less through dietary interventions.India, which has the world's largest livestock population of 512 million, produces 11.75 million tonnes of methane - a strong greenhouse gas which is over 20 times more potent than CO2 as a heat-trapping gas, every year. This was revealed in a study done at the Ahmedabad-based Space Applications Centre in 2009.Figures released by ministry of statistics and programme implementation in 2015, based on 2007 data, pegged the figure at 10,099 thousand metric tonnes of methane, accounting for 49.11% of the total national methane emission of 20,564 thousand metric tonnes.After the recent Paris accord on climate change, the cattle dietary change is being touted as a new step to control emissions! Malabar Rural Development Foundation (MRDF), under Milma, has started a campaign to cut methane and other GHG emissions from livestock by prodding farmers to provide balanced rations to animals by popularizing its TMR (total mixed ration) feed. MRDF has dished out a short animation video, with handy tips, on methane mitiga tion to farmers.""Reduction of methane emissions from livestock is vital for long-term sustainability of dairy industry.It has been demonstrated that methane production by cows can be reduced by making appropriate changes in nutrition and feed.Apart from expanding the ration balancing programme to around 25,000 animals in the Malabar region, we are also popularizing our high quality TMR feed formulation, which is easily digestible,"" said MRDF CEO K Damodaran Nair MRDF officials claim that TMR had the optimum mix of fibre and protein content which helped in easy digestion and thereby causing less flatulence in cattle.He said that the ingredients in TMR include highquality forages like alfalfa along with groundnut, maize hay, grains like maize, tapioca powder, brans like rice bran, chunnies of black gram, green gram, molasses, salt, mineral mixture etc.Technical officer of MRFD's ration balancing programme (RBP) N Ahammed Khais , said that a study conducted by national dairy development board (NDDB) showed that cows fed with balanced ration under RBP programme emitted around 10-15% less methane.""Cows traditionally fed on low quality roughages like dried rice straw produced more methane. Also overfeeding adds to the problem. But now as many as 25K animals in the region are being fed a balanced ration on the basis of prescription made by local resource persons we have deployed under RBP in 334 dairy cooperative societies,"" he said."

From cycling tracks to rental services and more; city is all set to pedal the Amsterdam way and cycling enthusiasts couldn't have asked for anything better...Cycling is the most important means of transportation in the Dutch capital where they have well-planned and extensive cycle tracks around the city, which makes it convenient for cyclists to pedal around. Since Nagpur has been listed in the Smart Cities' list, the time is right to bring the same model here. ""We have already started planning to build a similar model for Nagpur,"" says Municipal Commissioner Shravan Hardikar . ""As part of making Nagpur a green, smart and clean city, public bicycle sharing system is a major requirement and we are working towards that goal. Apart from building cycling tracks in various parts of the city, we will also pedestrianise many areas. Our plan is to develop a proper biking plan to promote a healthier and pollution-free Nagpur.""A typical Amsterdam street scene sees countless cyclists either heading to work or back home. From students to police officers, from banking staff to courier guys, everybody's on a bike and mayor of Nagpur Pravin Datke wants a similar plan for the city. ""We will build cycling tracks alongside Nag River and there will be two rental stations from where Nagpurians will hire a bike by paying a small amount for the entire day,"" informs Datke.While the public bicycle sharing system will boost a biking culture in the city, some feel that a major hurdle in this goal is encroachment. ""This is a welcome move,"" says adventure enthusiast Amol Khante who adds, ""We have a long way to go to bring Amsterdam like biking culture in Nagpur. The existent cycling tracks and footpaths have more hawkers and parked vehicles than cyclists or pedestrians. And the condition of the roads is also pathetic. This plan might help reduce traffic woes but traffic needs to be disciplined for it to be implemented in the first place.""According to NMC figures, on an average, 300 new vehicles are registered in the city on a daily basis. Multiply that by 365 days and the sheer number of vehicles on the roads is humungous. ""With so many vehicles plying on the road, traffic congestion and increase in pollution levels is but obvious. On the other hand, the bicycle reduces the problems of air and noise pollution along with traffic congestion and accidents,"" says an IT professional, Satyendra Singh"

Last time, we were here for Osama Jalalis Delhi Durbari khana, and the taste of mutton kheer is still on our palates.Having eaten Deos food at a previous event, Bhasin tells us he patiently waited for the rains to bid the city goodbye before inviting her. It is all about coastal food, so the fish should be fresh, he says.Deo says that Karwar cuisine mainly consists of coconut, rice and fish. In our vegetable curries, we use a lot of ash gourd, snake gourd, and ivy gourd, she says. The use of garam masala is minimal, mainly dry coriander and sukha byadgi mirchi with tamarind. Even chicken and mutton is not relished. Though the recipes of mutton stew and curry, and chicken sukke on the menu are recipes I learnt from my grandmother.As a child, Deo reminisces her visits to the village with her parents. My father would go to the river and catch fresh fish, which my mother and aunt would cook, she says. I remember the rawasa ambat (fish curry), fried prawns, and sungta ambat (prawn curry). We even made fish wrapped in banana leaf.Karwari sweets are mostly made using coconut. We have the chana dal payasam and kesar bhaat. In our village, there is a festival called Nopi, which follows Ganesh Chaturthi. Every year, one family has to cook for the entire village. Our turn comes every five years. No matter what is cooked in the main course, the kesar bhaat is always made. We love it, she smiles.Deos family also makes their own sevaiya (homemade rice noodles). We soak the rice, make a paste and cook it in a pan till it thickens. We make balls of it and steam them in banana leaves. And then put it in the moulds and make them, she says.While our chat continues, a veg thali arrives with fish and mutton dishes on the side. The former comes with a raita, dal, a dry vegetable of okra and turiya (ridge gourd), a watery curry with whole green moong dal, valval (vegetables with coconut and green chillies), dry aloo sabzi and rice and neer dosa. It could jolly well be a meal sampled at a home in Karwar. The toor dal has a light tadka of curry leaves, and pairs well with the paper-thin neer dosa. We have this with the gourd and okra sabzi, which is crunchy and cooked in coconut oil.The fried Surmai has a coating of a masala paste comprising garlic, coriander, red chilli powder, kokam and salt. This is shallow fried with rice and semolina flour, which gives it a delicious crust.When the lid on the Karwari Lamb Biryani is lifted, aromatic steam escapes. This biryani is sweet (from the onions) and spicy (from the green chilli and ginger paste) at the same time, and the chunks of mutton are succulent. Laden with coriander and onions, green chillies and coriander powder make up most of the masala.As a sweet end to the meal, we are served the chana dal payasam: a thick, hot and milky concoction, with cashew nuts, chana dal and raisins. The coconut milk lends a smooth texture and we lap this up wondering what Bhasin has in store for his next gastronomical adventure.The author is a freelance writerRivaayat-e-Karwar is on till October 21 at Maya, Trident, Bandra Kurla Complex.Call 66727777 for reservations."

The main reason offered for postponing crushing operations by a month was to increase sugar recovery by mills.Arun Magdum is a relieved man. The source of it is the Maharashtra government reversing a decision, taken on October 4, not to allow sugar mills in the state to crush any cane for the new 2016-17 season before December 1.Had that been implemented, it would have led to 10-15 per cent weight loss for my sugarcane, says this six-acre farmer from Mangaon, a village in Kolhapur districts Hatkanangale taluka.Mills in Maharashtra normally start crushing from end-October or early-November and wind up operations by late-April/early-May. It enables farmers, then, to plant a quick crop of summer moong (green gram) or groundnut on their vacated fields, before the main kharif season. A one-month delay in crushing rules out cultivation of moong, which, apart from giving me extra income, is also good for replenishing soil nutrients. The governments decision would have dealt a double blow, by reducing the weight of my cane and also preventing me from taking a summer crop, notes Magdum.Watch Video: Whats making newsOn Wednesday, a committee  comprising Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, minister for cooperation Subhash Deshmukh, agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar, the sugar commissioner Vipin Sharma and representatives from the sugar industry  decided to rescind its October 4 decision. The starting date for the season has now been fixed at November 5.The main reason offered for postponing crushing operations by a month was to increase sugar recovery by mills. With severe drought conditions till almost the middle of this year impacting plantings, the state government expects mills to crush only 445 lakh tonnes (lt) of cane in 2016-17, down from 742.94 lt and 930.41 lt in the preceding two seasons. That would translate into a sugar output of just 50.28 lt, the lowest since the 46.14 lt produced in the 2008-09 season.Delayed crushing would have allowed for increased sucrose concentration in the cane, resulting in higher recovery. But now, instead of an average 11.30 per cent sugar recovery, you will have a rate of 11.2-11.25 per cent. Also, the cane that is crushed would be relatively immature with lower yields. It could lead to sugar production dropping below 50 lt, says Jaiprakash Salunkhe Dandegaonkar, vice-president, Maharashtra State Cooperative Sugar Factories Federation and chairman of the Purna Sahakari Sakhar Karkhana Ltd at Hingoli.That view is also shared by S S Katake, scientist and farm in-charge of the Pune-based Vasantdada Sugar Institute. According to him, the cane crop can give 0.2-0.5 percentage points additional sugar recovery, if allowed to remain in the field for an extra month. This year, if crushing were to start by early November, mills will have only around 400 lt of cane to crush. Average recovery, too, hovers between 8-9 per cent during October-November and rising to 10-12 per cent from December. If crushing happens in November, especially this time when there is hardly any cane, you may even end up with sugar production of 40-45 lt, he warns.Low sugar recovery may also hurt farmers, as the fair and average price (FRP) of cane is linked to this rate. The more the sugar recovery, the higher is the FRP payable by mills. Farmers, however, are not buying this argument. For them, the weight loss in cane from a delayed start to crushing and the opportunity foregone in growing a summer moong or groundnut crop far outweigh any gains from higher sugar recovery.Interestingly, the industry itself has been divided on the issue. Mills in the Marathwada region and the adjoining districts of Ahmednagar and Solapur  which include those belonging to both the chairman (Shivajirao Nagavade) and vice-chairman (Jaiprakash Dandegaonkar) of the state cooperative factories federation, and also the cooperation minister Subhash Deshmukh  have been in favour of commencing crushing only from December 1.But mills in western Maharashtra  the districts of Pune, Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur  have opposed delay in crushing, mainly because of worries over their cane getting poached. Sangli and Kolhapur arent too far away from Karnataka, where mills are expected to begin operations by November 15. There is a shortage of cane in Karnataka. If we do not start in time, the mills there will pay upfront to our farmers, who wouldnt mind diverting their cane, notes Arun Lad, chairman of the Kranti SSK mill in Sangli.Magdum confirms that he was contacted by representatives of Karnataka mills to accept upfront payment against supply of cane. Personally, I wouldnt have wanted to give to these mills, as they pay Rs 200-500 per tonne less than the price I get from the factory here. But if the crushing was to take off only from December 1 (mills starting before that date were liable to pay a hefty fine of Rs 500 for every tonne of cane crushed), I would have been left with no option, he adds.What has tilted the equation, forcing the Fadnavis government to go back on its earlier decision, has been the greater clout wielded by western Maharashtra mills. In normal years, the Marathwada region along with Solapur and Ahmednagar contribute roughly 50 per cent to Maharashtras total sugar output. But this time, 70 per cent of production is likely to come from the four western Maharashtra districts, which were comparatively less impacted by the drought.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He also issued directions to officials of the Agriculture Department to plan and expedite the harvest, while addressing a day-long meeting organised on Friday for preparations for rabi crop season.As hailstorms are common occurrences in the first week of April, it will benefit farmers to wind up all agricultural operations, including harvest, before March 31, he said, briefing the media persons on the meeting held with the agriculture officials of the newly-designated districts.He expressed hope that the harvest will be good this rabi, as water availability has improved due to September rains, and there is no power shortage too. Major crops for the season include groundnut, Bengal gram, maize, and green gram apart from rice.Seed distribution is in progress, and it will be done only through cooperative societies. So far, 22,157 quintals of groundnut seed and 13,813 quintals of Bengal gram have been distributed. Fertilisers already existing in the warehouses will cover two-thirds of the requirement.In a significant development, the government has also opened procurement centres for soyabean, for the first time ever, the Minister informed. A meeting was conducted with owners of the factories involved in soyabean processing. Seven factories have been entrusted with the crop in seven districts, with MSP fixed at Rs. 2,775 per quintal for A-grade crop and Rs. 2,400 for B-grade. Procurement will be done through societies."

After a dark Dasara, merchants are hoping that things pick up at least before Diwali.Movement of goods between Tamil Nadu and Karnataka is taking place smoothly now but with a 25-35 per cent increase in freight charges.Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Association president Ramesh Chandra Lahoti says truckloads of pulses, Sona Masuri rice, steam rice and onions are among the items sent to Tamil Nadu daily. Apart from the regular rates of `22,500 for a truckload of goods, an additional `15,000 was paid to transport goods last month. There were literally no Dasara celebrations for traders due to the additional costs incurred, he said.Trucks parked at Yeshwanthpur yard in Bengaluru | Pushkar VThe cost of transporting 1kg of any item shot up from `1.50 to `2.50 last month. Things normalised a week ago, but the previously prevalent rates are not being charged. The cost of transporting a kg is now `2, which is nearly a 35 per cent increase over previous rates, Lahoti pointed out. Traders are forced to pass on the burden to consumers, he added.Bharat Shah, a consultant to many foodgrain and pulses merchants in the city, says the increase in charges applies to both exports and imports between the two states and the end result is that the consumer has paid more for commodities exchanged between both states (see box). Dasara sales have definitely slumped for all the traders here, he adds.Vastupal Sanghvi, proprietor of Sree Mookambika Trading Company at APMC Yard, Yeshwantpur, imports truckloads of pulses daily from Chennai. I used to pay `120 for transporting one quintal (100 kg) of either urad dal, tur dal or moong dal by truck. It shot up to `170 a quintal for a fortnight when the agitation was at its peak. The transportation cost has reduced to `150 now but it is still 25 per cent more than what I used to pay earlier,  he says.When asked about why they are made to pay increased freight charges, he says that some truckers still stop their vehicles at the border between the states around 6.30-7 pm. They halt there for a few hours and enter only under the cover of darkness. Hence, the additional charges are levied, he says.Things will be okay after Nov 5Yeshwantpur APMC Local Lorry Owners Association president G Kumar conceded that the transportation charges were on the higher side now.Some top exporters have declared a one-week to 10-day closure of shops for Diwali. This has forced lorry owners to reduce the number of trucks on the roads. Due to the reduced number of vehicles plying, the rates have gone up, he said.He assured that rates would stabilise and go back to the days before the Cauvery protests, by November 5. When asked if the hikes during festive season was an annual occurrence, Kumar said, No. Those plying lorries last month had to undertake much risk when crossing the Hosur border. Hence, transportation charges were jacked up. It has continued after that."
59048c9a7be9e04154df86e2,Women are saving US from Prez Trump,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/women-are-saving-us-from-prez-trump/,2016-10-22,"The US presidential election is still three weeks away, but nobody doubts that Hillary Clinton will thrash Donald Trump. Opinion polls put Hillary ahead by 5 to 11%, which is huge. Many US elections are won on margins of less than 2%.Trump has been sunk by the leak of a 2005 video showing his prowess in what he calls locker-room talk. He says, You know, Im automatically attracted to beautiful womenI just start kissing them. Its like a magnet. Just kiss. I dont even wait. And when youre a star they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the pussy. You can do anything.That must be the most memorable quote in US campaign history. Earlier, some opinion polls put Trump ahead, but after the video went viral, his poll numbers crashed.Does this represent a fitting popular verdict on a vulgar male chauvinist pig? No, top US poll analyst Nate Silver has come up with a sensational finding: there is a huge gender divide after Trumps video. If males alone could vote, Trump would beat Hillary by a humungous 11%! He would win all the key battleground states that swing elections  Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Colorado. He would win 350 Electoral College votes to her 180.However, if women alone could vote, Hillary would thrash Trump by a whopping 33% margin. She would beat him in Republican strongholds, including Texas, ending up with 450 Electoral College votes to Trumps 80.So, Trumps downfall is entirely due to scandalised female voters. Male voters are astonishingly empathetic. Internet reactions to his video confirm that he has strong male support, even envyI laughed because thats how almost every guy acts! Ladies Im sorry but thats just an average guy at the end of the day talking some shop.An 11 years old video how cute whats gonna be next? something he said in showers after P.E. when he was 14?I hope Im cool enough to talk like this at 59.If not for unnatural laws, men would grab a girl by her pussy as it was some centuries ago, and its natural.Oh please. This is how guys talk about women when women arent around. It doesnt make us all rapists.Trump is right in thinking that political and showbiz stars get away with a lot. Bill Clinton and John Kennedy are obvious examples. Filmstar Arnold Schwarzenegger was accused of groping by several women when he ran for governor of California, earning the nickname Gropen-Fuhrer. Yet he won two successive elections with big margins. But for the fact that foreign-born politicians cannot run for president, he would have been a strong Republican candidate.The Republican Party is supposed to be the party of family values, of the Bible Belt. Clearly even men professing strong family values and faith in the Bible are secretly with Trump in viewing women as sex objects. In open voting, I doubt if a majority of men would raise their hands in favour of Trump. But in a secret ballot, they would support him overwhelmingly.Things are probably worse in India. Here we have female infanticide, dowry burnings, routine wife beating, and the treatment of women as commodities and the property of males. The rich and powerful believe they are above the law and can misbehave with impunity in a hundred ways, not just groping. The public widely believes actor Salman Khan killed a man with rash driving, and shot protected black bucks for entertainment, even though he eventually managed to get acquitted. Did the charges dent Salmans popularity or box-office stature? Not at all. Shiney Ahuja, a character actor, was convicted of rape. Did that ruin his career? Absolutely not.So, the appalling truth is that Trump is right in saying that stars can get away with almost anything, certainly with groping. The casting couch is a standard institution in Bollywood and Hollywood, viewed more as a form of frolic rather than an outrage.In sum, beneath a thin veneer of political correctness and gender equality, most males across the world remain chauvinist pigs, and powerful males believe they have the right to grope. Women could not vote till the 20th century in most democracies. Their inclusion in electoral rolls has helped civilise society and democracy in ways that are not evident. They are saving the US from President Trump."

Officials said both the mother and calf elephants are healthy.However, before the celebrations were over, activists pointed out that the officials including the veterinarian had so far maintained that the elephant had some stomach ailment, and raised a series of pertinent questions: Why were the forest veterinarians not aware that the elephant was pregnant? How could the forest department allow the animal to be lifted using belts and crane? Why was the animal in such a condition taken to the camp that lies over 35 kms away?Initially, forest veterinarians did not consider the pregnancy factor due to its age. So they lifted the sick elephant using crane, as there were no other option to lift it before transporting it to the camp at Chadivayal, according to R Mohammad Saleem from the Environmental Conservation Group (ECG).After the controversy erupted, veterinarian NS Manokaran, who was maintaining that the animal was suffering from a stomach ailment for which it was being treated, took a U-turn, claiming that he was aware that the animal was pregnant. He, however, added that they were not sure which stage of pregnancy it was.We knew that the female elephant was pregnant, but the pregnancy period of a female elephant is between 18 to 22 months. So we did not know which stage of pregnancy it was and when it would give birth. But the animal is improving following treatment, Manoharan said.According to him, the forest officials were informed about the pregnancy and the need for special care during treating her. There was disturbance from the large gathering on public, there is no lights and a lot of wild elephant movement at Thadagam. It was hence decided to transport it to Chadivayal camp as part of precautionary measures, he said. That is why when we lifted it using cranes, the belt was tied in such a way that there was no pressure on its stomach, Manokaran added.But these explanations have not satisfied the activists who charge that this could have been yet another case of elephant deaths if not for the miraculous birth.Manokaran was caught in a controversy earlier this year after the death of the wild male elephant, a rogue which the locals named Madukarai Maharaj, following its capture and translocation. Animal experts had alleged then that the elephant died due to tranquiliser overdose. He was also part of the team that in 2012 captured a weak and starving tiger, which later died in custody. A year prior to that, an elephant that was tranquilised so as to fit a radio collar on it, died soon afterwards.In this case, fortunately, the worst seems to be over for the mother, who finally stood on its own after the delivery, with the help of a trained elephant at the camp. She is now being given special diet like special rice, green gram, ragi balls, nutrients and vitamins. Officials added that they will closely monitor the health of the mother and its calf for two more days."

All the 1.03 crore BPL families will get one kg dal each per month, which will cost the government an estimated Rs 360 crore per annum. A kg of dal carries a subsidy of Rs 30 and the government will give any of the dal variety such as tur and moong, depending on their availability in the market and the cost, Food and Civil Supplies Department Secretary Harsh Gupta said.The government is already spending Rs 2,000 crore per annum on the Anna Bhagya scheme. The beneficiaries get free foodgrains (rice, wheat, ragi, jowar), palm oil at subsidised rates and salt every month under the scheme.Dal distribution has been planned in such a way that it will not be a burden on the government for at least a year. For, Karnataka was entitled for reimbursement of local transportation cost on foodgrains and 50% commission to be given to fair price shop owners from the Union government under the Food Security Act with effect from 2014.The Food and Civil Supplies Department recently received Rs 330 crore from the Centre. The entire money is being utilised for dal distribution, sources in the government said. The finance department had initially objected to the proposal as there was no budgetary provision. But it finally agreed when Chief Minister Siddaramaiah directed it to clear the proposal, the sources said."

Express Archive Succeessive drought years have left the state with a negative growth in agriculture for three years on the trot. Express ArchiveBY THE summer of 2015, when the new state government was about six months old, the refrain in rural Maharashtra was that voters might have miscalculated terribly in being swept up by the Modi wave. Led by the BJP, a mostly urban party, the government appeared to be at a loss on how to stem the rising rural discontent.Now, two years into its tenure, the government finds that succeessive drought years have left the state with a negative growth in agriculture for three years on the trot. But with the rain gods having finally offered respite this year, September-end sowing data showed that a recovery could well be under way in the fields  the state government has recorded a 11 per cent increase in area under cultivation, storage levels in the big reservoirs augurs a likely good Rabi season too.The biggest challenge for this government in this sector was handling drought, and hardly any relief or compensation was paid to farmers and agricultural labourers, said Dr Ashok Dhawale, national joint secretary of the left-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha. In fact, as the rural economy worsened owing to drought, the state persisted with time-worn relief strategies, spending more and more on fodder camps and water tankers. In 2014-15, the state sought a Central assistance of Rs 6,013.28 crore  it received Rs 1,962.99 crore. It then sought Rs 4,002.82 crore in 2015-16 and received Rs 3,049.36 crore.In worst-hit Marathwada, from subsidised foodgrain to free fodder camps for animals, state relief measures were central to farmers lives during the summer months, but the impact of the distress on various aspects of rural life continued to deepen.Additionally, the bankruptcy of the governments policies is seen in its inability to offer a right price for farm produce. This year, to give you one example, soyabean and moong prices are half of last years prices  the peasantry has more crop this year but still, less money, said Dr Dhawale, adding that issues such as the connection between rising malnutrition-related infant deaths to agrarian distress had not even been touched upon.In fact, farm prices have been a recurring ground for criticism of the states agriculture policies, across commodities.Due to the low price of sugar, mills ran into trouble last year with many failing to clear payments to growers  a first for the sector. Together, the state and the Central governments had cleared Rs 1,200 crore as excise and soft loans for the sector to help them pay the growers. Millers on their part had wanted the above amount as a grant, which the government refused. They have to start repayment of the loans from this season. Non- payment of the fair and remunerative price (FRP) to growers also led to action against 34 mills in the last two years  the highest ever recorded in the state. While millers accelerated the payments, the crushing season of 2016-17 kicks off alongside unpaid dues of Rs 123 crore. This, despite the presence of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana  representative of thousands of cane growers  in the state government.Millers concede that this has sent out a strong message to the powerful sugar barons  no more largesse and bailouts to the sector, something it had been accustomed to. One of the promises on which this government was elected was a fair price for farm produce, and the government has committed a breach of faith of farmers, said Raghunathdada Patil, senior farmer leader who contested the 2014 Lok Sabha elections on an AAP ticket. Worse, multiple laws this government passed have been anti-farmer. The beef ban law, for example, has led to interference of the state even on a farmers pashudhan (livestock). And then, whether its a bullet train or smart cities or other land acquisition, its the farmers who are at a loss.The state has also not been able to reverse the low coverage of agriculture insurance in Maharashtra. In 2014-15, Maharashtra had 22 per cent of gross cropped area insured, not even half the percentage scored by Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan. On the positive side, there is now an agriculture policy of the state government, with the mission-mode objectives clearly stated  to achieve 4 per cent growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors, to promote entrepreneurship in agriculture and allied sectors, to increase net farm returns, crop diversification, etc.Also on the positive side, during 2014-15, Maharashtra stood first in terms of fruit production with a 12.22 per cent share in total national production, despite low productivity.In a huge reform, the state has also launched farmer-to-consumer markets alongside taking forward the APMC reforms for more barrier-free markets.Some of these moves are seen as political. The market committees, for instance, have been strongholds of the NCP and the Congress. The government has now taken to appointing expert directors on these bodies. Former NCP MLA and president of the federation of APMCs Dilip Mohite Patil called this an attempt by the Sena-BJP to gain a backdoor entry to these bodies.Another innovative reform is a pilot project of 10,000 solar pumps for agriculture, offering round-the-year power, a reduced demand-supply gap and a lower subsidy burden to the state electricity board. The policy also makes mention of infusing public investment in agriculture, to boost growth and build capacity, about furthering agricultural research and, critically, the revival of district cooperative banks. Much of this, however, will only begin once the government is well into its third year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The gram is sown in June ahead of the onset of monsoon. But with the region reeling under drought, the area of cultivation has reduced. Green gram was sown in 3.27 lakh hectares last year. With a normal monsoon expected this year, green gram was sown in 4.2 lakh hectares with farmers expecting a bumper yield.The prices have dropped in the wholesale market due to the arrival of large quantitties of green gram.Green gram is grown in Ramdurg, Bailhongal and Soundatti taluks of Belagavi district. In Ramdurg they are sown in 16,180 hectares, 4,042 hectares in Bailhongal and 21,728 hectares in Soundatti taluk; in all green grams were sown in 41,950 hectares in Belagavi district. The APMC has set up buying centres in these three taluks. However many of the farmers have been ignoring these centres and selling their produce to traders at low prices. B M Shrinivas, APMC secretary, said that though prices have come down by at least 50% this year farmers have not suffered losses. ""Farmers have been ignoring the APMC centres. Prices may recover in the coming days, ""he added."

KSRTC bus drivers were in for a surprise when around 27 NSS students along with two teachers marched to the nearest bus stand from the college and made sure that the 'ana vandis' dazzled before they left the stand.It was during a seven-day camp at Ashokapuram that the idea of cleaning buses struck the students, says Resmi Varghese, assistant professor of the college, who headed the activity. She adds, ""We had earlier cleaned railway stations and public spaces. However, a bus was something new. The motive behind this was to send a strong message to the people so that they can derive inspiration from the act."" One day prior to the entire cleaning process, they took permission from the station master, Resmi says.Meanwhile, cleaning an entire bus might seem like a humungous task but the students say they had fun. Liandra Pius, a student, says that they were provided with the necessary equipment by the Regional Transport Officer. ""We were all in full spirits. There was so much enthusiasm that each one of us were actively involved in the clean-up act. We were least bothered about our clothes getting soiled.""Simi TS, a student of B Sc Botany, hopes that people who saw them cleaning the buses would think twice next time before damaging public property.Fathima Kunjumon, another volunteer, says that the fact that it was a united effort triggered more interest in them to perform the task. She explains, ""We cleaned a luxury bus and an ordinary bus, and the entire activity lasted for about three hours.""People including Assistant Transport Officer and some of the drivers congratulated the students for their selfless effort, they say."

Four of the five taluks in the district - Dharwad, Navalgund, Kundgol and Kalghatagi - have already been declared drought-hit. Of the 2.75 lakh hectares of sown area, there has been either stunted growth or failure of crop in 1.41 lakh hectares in the district. The major cause is lack of rain and moisture. Only green gram, which is grown as a short-term crop, had come up well but the crash in its price has left farmers in the lurch. This had resulted in the state government opening of centres to procure the produce under the minimum support price.Major crops like maize, soya, cotton and chilli have failed and 50% of the area under onion has suffered failure.The crash in price of onion has further troubled the farmers. Onion is grown in parts of Dharwad, Kundgol, Navalgund and Kalghatagi taluks. Farmers were forced to spend money to remove the standing onion crop and clear the field for rabi sowing. The price of the onion had fallen to Rs 100-125 per quintal and many farmers did not bring the crop to the market at all.Farmers have not received the crop insurance amount for the previous year. They were expecting the rabi crop this year to compensate for the kharif loss but failure of rains have again left them worrying. Agriculture minister Krishna Byre Gowda recently said that the entire state will have to be declared drought hit if there are no rains in the next week.Under these circumstances, the visit of the central study team has raised hopes of the farmers. They are expecting drought relief works to be taken up and employment provided to check migration. They also want the elected representatives to impress upon the central government to understand the plight of the farmers."

Harpal SinghWhile the world measures wealth in terms of currency the Adivasi Gonds and Kolams of Agency areas in Adilabad district continue to measure wealth in terms of number of cows and for these tribes Lakshmi Puja, on the day after Diwali, is time to worship cows.On Monday the members of the two tribes performed Mura Mituswal or cow worship, an important event in the Adivasi ethos. The cows are fed with sauted round eatable made of green gram garkang, a stuffed sweet roti puran poli and rice with ghee ghato before its puja.According to the tradition the woman of the household stands close to the cattle shed handing out rice to neighbours for sprinkling on the cows to bless the animals. The householders are then greeted by those who worshipped their cows.As Gond and Kolam farmers were livestock breeders the tradition was well celebrated until about three decades ago. Every Adivasi household in the Agency areas of the undivided Adilabad district had boasted of at least five cows.For example, Kanaka Pollu of Marlavai village owned 30 cows in the mid 1990s. Now he has only three as taking care of the bovines became an increasingly difficult task due to lack of hands in the family. From a milk consuming society, these aboriginal people have strangely been rendered as those who have no use for the dairy product, within the last three decades. Not many own cows these days and those who do, are a shade better in terms of resources but aim only at breeding bullocks.Pastures are dwindling, fodder has become costly and we are unable to spend time for herding the cows to graze in nearby jungles, Kodapa Rama Rao of Jainoor in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district said explaining the reasons for the dwindling number of livestock."

The teams will travel to Chitradurga, Ballari, Koppal, Gadag, Dharwad, Haveri, Davangere, Ramanagaram, Chamarajnagar, Mysuru, Hassan, Mandya, Tumakuru, Chikkaballapur, Kolar and Bengaluru Rural districts. The teams will have a wrap-up meeting in Bengaluru on Saturday. The panel will later submit a report to the Centre.In a pre-visit presentation before the panel on Wednesday, state government officials pointed out that Karnataka was facing drought for the sixth consecutive year. It was pointed out that buoyed by good rains during June, kharif cultivation was taken up briskly by farmers.The good rainfall received during June and July was offset by deficit rainfall during August and September. The rainfall deficit was 72% in south interior Karnataka and 36% in Malnad during September.The deficient rains resulted in poor inflows into major reservoirs. In the presentation, it was pointed out that major agriculture crops grown during kharif primarily included green gram, black gram, tur dal, groundnut, jowar, soyabean, maize and cotton.Prolonged continuous dry spell in drought-hit taluks resulted in crop loss estimated at Rs 11,051 crore. Horticulture crops such as onion, potato, chilli, perennial and plantation crops like pomegranate, mango, coconut and arecanut were also severely affected due to moisture stress.Horticulture crops on as much as 1.89 lakh hectares have been affected and crop loss is estimated at Rs 1,094 crore."

Karnataka's UMP promises more options for sale. For the local trader in the mandi (market), it also offers the opportunity to access a larger market for secondary trading.

It also demands serious investigation about who was with the deceased when he took the extreme step, who provided the poison and if anybody may have taken advantage of his troubled mind to provoke him to take the extreme step,"" an official said.Government sources said that had Grewal approached the ex-serviceman welfare cell his case could have been resolved amicably. The government said that it had made sustained efforts to ensure disbursements relating to one rank, one pension with just one lakh of a total of 20,60,000 yet to receive their dues.

It is a matter of serious concern. Our government is focussing on the development of crop varieties tolerant to climatic stress. Our universities and agricultural scientists need to concentrate on this area of research which is expected to gain much importance in the days to come, he said.In the first phase, the Minister added, climate resilient crop varieties of red gram, green gram, chickpea, jowar, ragi, maize and other such crops that are essential for food and nutrient security would be developed. These new varieties would not only be climate resilient but they would also give 30 per cent more yield as compared to conventional varieties, he said.The Minister also advised the farming community to rapidly shift from conventional farming to scientific and advanced farming by reaping the fruits of technological innovations and advancements in the farm sector.It is by adopting newer technologies, crop varieties and advanced and scientific farming methods only farmers can face the newer challenges in the sector. We cannot always view agriculture emotionally. We have to inevitably move from conventional farming method to scientific and advanced farming methods with which we can get more yield with less investment and less cultivation area, he said.As many as 12 farmers, one male and one female farmer from each district of Hyderabad Karnataka, who made significant achievements in the field of agriculture were honoured and conferred with Shreshta Krishika (male) and Shresthta Krishi Mahile) awards on the occasion.

All is not well, however, for the state's moong or green gram farmers. An analysis of prices paid for moong in the state's markets shows farmers have been paid less than the Minimum Support Price . While the MSP announced is Rs5,225 per quintal - Rs52.25 per kg - most farmers have sold their stocks for less than Rs50 per kg. At retail shops in Jaipur, a kg of moong is available for about Rs160.""I paid Rs 75 per kg when I bought seeds to sow but when I went to the market with my produce, I could not get anything beyond Rs50 per kg. There were rains close to harvest time and some of the moong got wet. So that lot commanded an even lower price,"" said Vakta Ram, a farmer in Pali.Lal Singh of Rajasamand said, ""In this part of the Aravalli belt, the rain was not as good this year. The harvest was not so good. I got just about three sacks of moong. I could only get about Rs45 per kg. If you consider how much effort went into it all and then calculate from what I earned, I've got about Rs20 for all my labour per day."" Rajasthan is among the country's largest producers of moong, accounting for a quarter of the country's total production. India is the largest producer and also the largest moong consumer in the world. It is also a net importer, getting stocks from Myanmar. Moong is a warm-weather crop that is good for fixing nitrogen in soil. Fallen leaves add to the soil's nutrient value too.About 45 of the state's 86 mandis reported arrival of moong on November 3, the latest date for which data is available on Mandi Online, website of the state Agriculture Marketing Board Total arrival of moong in the mandis was 17,271 quintals. Average mandi price was Rs 4,597 per quintal, i.e. Rs 45.97 per kg, as against Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,225 per quintal. Only at the Chomu mandi near Jaipur was the farmer paid the MSP.MSP rate for arrived quantity translates into Rs902.41lakh, whereas mandies paid Rs793.86 lakh. Estimated production of moong in 2016-17 in Rajasthan was 84.27 lakh quintals, according to the state agriculture department.The government, to promote price stability, procures produce and distributes these through the public distribution system . This is one method of offering minimum price to farmers and ensuring food security for the poor. However, by waiving stock restrictions, the government is allowing private players to make a killing while providing little aid to farmers and also putting at risk the food security of the poor - moong is a significant source of protein.The difference between MSP and market rate of moong is Rs628 per quintal. If we assume that farmers will sell about 60 lakh quintals of the total production of over 84 lakh quintals, the loss would be a staggering Rs 367 crores (628 x 60 lakh) to farmers.State principal secretary agriculture Neelkamal Darbari said the price depends on quality of the produce. ""If the stock is wet, then its price is a little less,"" she said, requesting this reporter to call back after a few hours so she could check on prices at the mandis. A few hours later, however, she did not answer the call."

After the pilot phase is carried out for three months, the government is likely to extend the scheme to all districts, the Minister said. Women will have to come to the anganwadis for the midday meals, which will include egg and milk. Those who do not consume eggs will be given two glasses of milk.S. Varalakshmi, State president of the Anganwadi Noukarara Sangha, applauded the governments move. In several parts of the State, very young girls who are malnourished, give birth to infants who are also malnourished. Although the government provides rice, wheat, jaggery and green gram to these women under the Integrated Child Development Services, many women, particularly those from lower economic backgrounds, do not consume it themselves. They use the ingredients to cook for their family, she said.However, the government has to work out the infrastructure and logistics before launching the programme, she added."

More specifically, the 14% bigger, 30% brighter supermoon.Supermoons are a sight to behold but the November 14 one is extra special because this is the closest the full moon has been to Earth since 1948. In fact, if you miss todays supermoon, another one like it will only come by in 2034.Before you prepare to do some moongazing, here are a few questions answered:What is a supermoon?The moons moves in an elliptical orbit around the Earth, not a circular one. This means that at times, it is closer to our planet and at times, farther away. The point when the moon is closest to Earth is called perigree and when it is farthest is called apogee.The moon goes through different phases such as a full moon, crescent, half-moon etc. So, when the two conditions coincide  that is, a full moon passes closest to earth  astronomers call it the supermoon.Whats super about it?Well, since it is closest to Earth, the moon appears larger in diameter and shines 30 per cent brighter. To the naked eye, the difference is really not that remarkable. The moons larger-than-usual appearance does bring higher tides.What's the recipe for a #supermoon? When the moon is full as it makes its closest pass to Earth. Learn more: https://t.co/cmX1LorOBw pic.twitter.com/EZsZdmL6Jd  NASA (@NASA) 14 November 2016So, if theres a supermoon, is there a micromoon as well?Yes, there is! When the moon is at the apogee, that is, the farthest away from Earth in its orbit, it is called a micromoon. In fact, astronomers often take photos of the supermoon and the micromoon with the same set-up to highlight the difference.Whats the best time to view it?According to NASA, the moon will be at perigee at 6:22 am EST and full moon will occur at 8:52 am EST on November 14. For India, this means the moon will be closest to Earth around 5:30 pm while the full moon will occur around 7:22 pm.What are the best places to view it from?Viewing the moon from a dark place adds to the charm, since you wont have electric lights competing with its brightness. If youre near a beach, an optical illusion will make the moon appear much larger near the horizon. A desert is also a good place to take in the breathtaking view, but if you are stuck in the city, go to the roof of a tall skyscraper for a better view.How do I take a photo?You can download an app to help you track the progress of the moon. Bill Ingalls, NASAs senior photographer has tips for you. Dont make the mistake of photographing the moon by itself with no reference to anything, he says. Ive certainly done it myself, but everyone will get that shot. Instead, think of how to make the image creativethat means tying it into some land-based object. It can be a local landmark or anything to give your photo a sense of place.What if I miss this supermoon?Dont worry. A bigger moon than this will only appear in 2034, but 2016 has another supermoon in store for you on December 14."

""People don't usually come together like this in Sydney for a natural phenomenon.""Tourists, office workers and couples crowded the Hong Kong waterfront as the supersised moon rose over the skyscrapers of the financial hub, while in the Chinese capital Beijing the moon climbed spectacularly over the city's skyline.The supermoon was visible across much of India although residents of New Delhi, the world's most polluted capital, struggled to see it clearly through the toxic smog that has been shrouding the city in recent weeks.In Thailand, astrologers were variously predicting the supermoon would bring disaster or great fortune.The supermoon means a stronger high tide, something that gets surfers giddy with excitement, not only at the prospect of riding bigger waves, but doing so at night.Astronomers say it can be hard to notice that the moon appears brighter than usual. Once it is high in the sky, it can also be hard to tell it is larger.To get the best view, Pascal Descamps of the Paris Observatory advised choosing somewhere with a well-known landmark in the foreground for comparison.Supermoons are actually quite common -- there is one every 14 months on average.""But some supermoons are more super than others,"" said Descamps.After Asia it was the Middle East, Africa and Europe's turn to peer upwards, with eager moongazers on all continents heading to popular landmarks to see the supermoon up close -- with mixed results.In Athens, the hundreds gathered at the ancient Acropolis were treated to the sight of the massive orb rising between the monument's famous columns, bathing the site in its glow.But thick clouds spoiled the show in several European capitals including London, Paris, Berlin and Rome.Amateur photographers took up positions on London's Waterloo Bridge hoping to see the moon rise above St Paul's cathedral, but cloud had blanketed the sky all day and mobile apps were the only way to track the moon's progress.In Poland, the great rivalry between Warsaw and the old royal capital Krakow reared its head as heavy clouds thwarted moongazers in the former. But in Krakow, further south, the massive moon rose victoriously above the clouds.""I think the moon is more golden than usual -- it doesn't have the usual cold silver colour,"" said Roman Kwiatkowski, a Krakow psychotherapist making use of his large balcony to enjoy the spectacle.Parts of east Africa also had an excellent view, from Nairobi to Dar es Salaam.Johannesburg got a storm instead, with one disgruntled Twitter user, @Runningflyhalf, renaming the phenomenon ""supercloud"".But in Cape Town, thousands of people were rewarded for making the hour-long trudge up Lion's Head mountain with the sight of the huge moon reflecting off the glimmering bay below.""I think it's well worth waiting another 34 years to see it,"" tourist guide Leslie Edgar, 30, told AFP. ""I will do it again. It was spectacular."""

On an average, around 100 lorries carrying 10,000 quintals of grain, pulses, and oil seeds would leave the Gandhi Gunj market. But that has been reduced by at least 50 to 60 per cent, Basavaraj Dhannur, who runs a red gram processing mill, said.

Gobindo Sarkar, 42, was found dead at his home in Khiripara village in Bamungola, about 55km from here. While his family said Sarkar had committed suicide because of the cash crunch, police said the reason was yet to be found out. According to the police, Sarkar had returned from Hyderabad about a week ago. ""He had returned with some money after working in Hyderabad. He had run out of cash after settling debts. His wife, Anguri Sarkar, is a domestic help in Delhi. The couple have three children, Champa, 18, Sagar, 15, and Shampa, 11. The eldest daughter is a first year student in Pakua College. Her younger siblings study in Pakua High School,"" a police source said. Champa, who ran the household in the absence of her parents, said all the cash that her father had brought had been exhausted. ""My mother sometimes sends money to my father's bank account from Delhi. We had run up dues to the tune of Rs 10,000 at the local grocery. There was no cash at home. Since Monday, I have been going to the only ATM of the State Bank of India in Pakua, about 2km away. There was a huge queue before the ATM on Monday and I could not withdraw money. Yesterday, too, I stood in the queue but before I could enter the ATM, it had run out of cash. I returned home and told my father that I was not able to draw cash. He turned furious and scolded me. I, along with a neighbour and my brother and sister, went to the ATM after sunset. We returned around 8pm and found my father hanging from a beam in the ceiling,"" Champa said. Prasanta Sarkar, Gobindo's elder brother, said he and his brother struggled to make both ends meet. ""We are extremely poor and somehow manage to eke out a living. My brother and his wife work outside and they have a bank account in Pakua where they send money for their children. About a week ago, he returned home. They had run out of cash and could not buy food and the grocer had stopped giving them credit. Even though there was some money in his bank account, his daughter could not withdraw it because of long queues and the machine running out of cash. Gobindo broke down mentally and committed suicide,"" Prasanta said. Today, some of the villagers stood by the family to pay for Gobindo's last rites. ""After his death, his family did not have money for the last rites. We started a collection and some money will be handed over to his children. We paid for his last rites. We are angry and upset that he had to kill himself because of the cash crisis in the wake of the demonetisation decision,"" said Pralay Biswas, a neighbour. Asutosh Pal, the officer-in-charge of Bamungola police station, said he couldn't say before investigation whether the suicide was triggered by the cash crisis. ""There was some problem in the family and that is why the man committed suicide. Whether it was due to the cash crunch can be said only after a thorough investigation,"" Pal said."

(PTI) Guwahati, Nov. 19: Assam today witnessed a moderate voter turnout in byelections to the Lakhimpur parliamentary and Baithalangso Assembly constituencies. The turnout in Lakhimpur was slightly over 60 per cent, while it was 74 per cent in Baithalangso till the filing of this report. The development, which comes just seven months after the Assembly polls that recorded nearly 90 per cent turnout, has kept the BJP guessing and Congress keeping its fingers crossed. The BJP recorded a landslide victory in the Assembly polls in April. The BJP had attributed the high voter turnout in the Assembly polls to the people's desire for a change against the misrule by the Congress. The Lakhimpur bypoll was necessitated after chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal vacated the seat following his election to the Assembly from Majuli, which falls under this Lok Sabha seat. In Baithalangso, it was necessitated after Congress MLA Man Sing Rongpi resigned and joined the BJP in July. While political analysts were reluctant to cite any reason for the low turnout, some voters said they did not find the elections exciting and were so tired of standing in long queues to get old currency notes exchanged during the past week that they did not want to stand in another queue. ""Since today was a holiday for the byelection, I decided to remain at home to take rest and rejuvenate myself to stand again in the queue to get new currency notes from Monday. Money has become more important for us than elections,"" a voter at Jonai under Lakhimpur constituency, said. The voters of Gelua (under Jonai segment of Lakhimpur constituency) refused to cast their votes as the booth was shifted to Mechukachari LP School 12km away. The villagers blocked the road in protest. Though they withdrew the blockade when the judicial magistrate and poll officials met them, they did not vote. However, they said if repolling is ordered for them, they would exercise their franchise. Jonai sub-divisional officer Atul Sharma, who is the assistant returning officer, and B. Karmakar, returning officer for lakhimpur constituency, told The Telegraph that ""something"" would be arranged for Gelua voters. Former Union minister and Congress leader Ranee Narah, who had earlier been elected as Lakhimpur MP, told reporters in Lakhimpur that the Congress's victory is certain as the BJP had failed to deliver on its promises. Sources in the state BJP headquarters at Hengerabari here said the party is studying the causes of the low turnout. ""Though low voter turnout has helped the Congress in past elections, things will be different this time. The BJP will win both the seats,"" a BJP leader said. He said since this is the paddy harvesting season some voters were busy in their fields instead of going to polling stations. The counting for both the seats will be held on Tuesday. Five candidates - Pradan Baruah (BJP), Hema Hari Prasanna Pegu (Congress), Amiya Kumar Handique (CPM), Hem Kanta Miri (SUCI-Communist) and Dilip Moran (Independent) - are in the fray in Lakhimpur. In Baithalangso (ST) constituency in West Karbi Anglong, three contestants - Man Sing Rongpi (BJP), Rupon Singh Ronghang (Cong) and Rajen Timung (Independent) - are in the fray. Sources said the poll battle will be between the BJP and the Congress in both constituencies. Additional reporting by Sarat Sarma in Nagaon and Vinod Kumar Singh in Dhemaji"

She helps run a self-help group of 18 women in this village in Sangareddy district, which borders Karnataka and is 168 km from Hyderabad.The village is readying up for rabi sowing. Many of the villagers are Dalit tenant farmers. Chandramma and her husband decided to cultivate sugarcane this year. Already late to sow, they needed an urgent need to borrow Rs 30,000 from the nearest Andhra Pradesh Grameen Vikas Bank, 25 km away in Narayankhed, a town with just one other bank, SBI.That was when demonetisation struck. There are only three buses to Narayankhed; some days none. And then the bank, which had never said no to Chandramma in the past, refused to lend to her this time. So she turned to a money lender, borrowing at a monthly interest rate of 3 per cent or 36 per cent annually .As Chandramma speaks, two men join her side and she stops talking. Gunendar Rao and T Nandu Singh are both money lenders and do not seem pleased that Chandramma is talking to the press. Everything is fine here, one of them says. People are just a bit inconvenienced here. The banks will sort things out.Gunendar Rao decides to justify himself. I dont charge too much, just 3 per cent, which amounts to Rs 900 a month for Rs 30,000. Im trying to help these farmers because the banks arent giving them any money.Nandu picks up the theme, Now the banks dont have money to give, so they come to us. We dont have any problem accepting their Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes.There are whispers that the moneylenders take a cut of Rs 100 from each demonetised note.Kharamungi is separated from the Karnataka border by the Manjira river. Villagers can choose to cross the river and travel to Bidar, a distance of 15 km, or travel 40 km by public transport to the nearest agricultural market in Bidar. It is easier to get demonetised notes exchanged there than go to the Narayankhed banks. Narayankhed is the connecting point for 43 villages in Manoor mandal, serving over 50,000. Last Thursday, there were long queues snaking out of the towns two banks. The only ATM was closed in the morning and had a long queue in the evening.Pushpa Thakur has money due fromthe local dairy | SATHYA KEERTHIBack in Kharamungi, Pushpa Thakur and her husband dont own the home they inhabit with their son. In 2015, they borrowed Rs 40,000 from a money lender to farm a land they leased. The banks did not give them credit as they dont own the land. But the Manjira flooded that year, resulting in crop losses for most farmers in this village including Pushpa Thakur and her family. Pushpa switched to selling cows milk to Vijaya Diary to get by. But the dairy company has not made any payments for October and November. Everytime we ask them, they say next week. Now they say they dont have money, says Pushpa. She is afraid she will default on her payments to the moneylender.Demonetisation was sprung upon Kharamungi at a time when rabi crop sowing season was due. Now with banks and microfinance companies not lending to farmers owing to the currency shortage, farmers are left with no option but to approach the local moneylenders."

He was a relative of the woman who was kidnapped on April 4, and was found murdered three days later.Read |Key witness in Kairana gangrape, murder killedSeven people from the village  all of them Muslims  have been named in the murder case on the basis of a complaint registered by Brahmpals brother.Watch What Else Is making NewsSHO A P Bharadwaj said one of the accused was arrested on Tuesday, but did not name him.There are contradictions in the complaint made by the victims kin and the circumstantial evidence. For instance, why did they not call the police when they saw the killers running away? We got a call about the murder on Monday morning  that also from the PAC personnel who are deployed barely 150 yards from the victims house. He said more policemen have been deployed in the village to maintain peace. Raids are being made to arrest the others to verify the allegations, as there is tension in following the murder, Bharadwaj said.Addressing a gathering of about 150 locals later in the day at the villages only temple, BJP MP Hukum Singh said, Anyone who kills a poor man has to suffer. Wo to chahte hi hain ki tum unse daro or ye gaon chhod kar chale jaao. Magar unhe jeetane mat do. Sangathit raho.

We have to take Brahmpals fight forward.Akbarpur Sunheti has a population of approximately 5,500 about 30 per cent of them Hindus.While Singh was addressing people, many Muslims were gathered around Dawood Ali, the village pradhan, who had a different version. Brahmpal was a good friend. He was annoyed that they had named Muslims in the case, and believe me, he was not pursuing the case the way they claim he was, Ali claimed. He called Brahmpals murder suspicious and sought a fair probe. Kisi ko nahi bataya unhone; bas mandir me jaa ke loudspeaker par bola. Ye bhi koi baat hui, Ali asked, referring to the fact that the family did not call police but went to the temple and announced Brahmpals death over loudspeaker.The family claims calls to Police Control Room did not elicit a response. Police say that claim has to be verified. Brahmpals father Phool Singh, 96, blamed people from the other community for killing his son.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Express Archives) The PCA Stadium in Mohali, the venue for the third Test between India and England. (Source: Express Archives)The only aural intrusion to the pervading quietude of the PCA stadium was the shrieky whirr of the solitary mower, assiduously trimming the outfield. Fighting off the urges of a nap, ushered in by the balminess of the November afternoon, its driver occasionally yawns. Familiar as he must be with the contours and dimensions of the ground, he could afford the drowsy-driving.He, though, carefully evaded an enclosed central parch, where seven rectangles of varying shades of green are in a bucolic slumber, side-by-side and unattended. The baldest of them would be subject to many inquisitive, even sceptical and quizzical, glares from Thursday, leading up to the Test that begins on Saturday.In the days to come, its complexion, texture and character would all be speculated upon, assessed and eventually judged in microscopic detail. Should the pitch talk cease to exist a day after the match, the grounds seasoned curator Daljit Singh should feel reasonably satisfied, for good pitches are seldom discussed after the match, while the bad ones continue to keep haunting their makers.Daljit, the affable custodian of this 24-year-old ground would know better of the fickleness of judgements, appraisals and vilifications. He was severely criticised for the inaugural Test wicket here, a surface that helped mould Mohalis reputation as the liveliest in the country, endowed with sufficient bounce, decent pace and even some lateral movement in the first session. Tired overseas pacers tend to look at Mohali like a well-spring in a desert. Which is not always true.Before we begin unravelling this Mohali myth, lets get back to the first ever Test here, between West Indies and India in 1994, by the end of which Daljit bore the wrath of the Indian team management. This was because the curator had dished out a surface tailored to suit the gifts of West Indies pacers. Though, defected by the absence of Curtly Ambrose, the touring teams pace attack was at his furious best, with Courtney Walsh, Kenny Benjamin, Cameron Cuffy and Anderson Cummins around.The story goes that the then skipper Walsh, impeded by a recurring neck strain and with a neck brace in tow, was a doubtful starter. That is until the giant Jamaican cast his eyes on the strip. He duly banished the neck brace and made himself available for the match, and with the help of his fellow pacers squared the series with a massive 243-run victory, Indias first defeat at home in six years. The enduring image of the match was a bleeding Manoj Prabhakar, his helmet and nose battered by a Walsh bouncer. The centurion in the first innings was rushed to the nearby hospital, the facilities of which didnt impress him much either. He was left grumbling about the pitch and the hospital.Bloody bouncerIts a pity that this photograph doesnt adorn the stadium walls  where you can find frames of crickets glitterati and other epochal events in world cricket. There is Steve Waugh, Garfield Sobers, Jack Hobbs, Michael Holding, Sir Donald Bradman, and even Michael Atherton doing the walls; theres Rahul Dravid and VVS Laxman trudging off to the pavilion after their remarkable Eden Gardens heist, there is Dravid again, with Virender Sehwag after their humungous partnership in Lahore, that of Laxman wildly gesticulating at Pragyan Ojha in that nail-biter at this very ground in 2010.But not one of Prabhakar, with the blood-drenched towel on his face or that of a growling Walsh or his fiery understudy Benjamin bouncing out a stupefied Vinod Kambli. The only remnant of this Test match is Benjamins name  in fact the very first name  on the wooden honours board that greet the visitors at the PCA lobby. Its not that PCA doesnt celebrate the Tests it has hosted, but its the general, almost intrinsic paradox you find here. After all, they had their health club inaugurated by Sourav Ganguly, among the least fitness-conscious cricketers of his time and a swimming pool inaugurated by Inzamam-ul-Haq. Well you could imagine Pakistans gentle giant dozing off in the pool, or wading through the waters with the same indolence he showed while running between the wickets.This paradox has continued to haze the perceptions of visiting teams here. Prevalent is a forethought that the surface here invariably assists seamers, and there were even wanton rumours that England had stuffed their side with as many as six fast bowlers with the hope that the Mohali surface will disproportionately assist the faster men. Somehow reach Mohali unscathed and unleash their pack of fast bowlers on the Indian batsmen, seemed to be their tack.It must have been but a hollow rumour, for the England team management are not foolish enough to not dig up the recent numbers the ground has churned out. In fact, since the maiden Test, Mohali has turned out to be a stomping ground for the hosts, having not lost the 10 Tests since, and winning half a dozen of them. In the last Test here, against South Africa, the wicket-ratio will make an alarming read for them. Spinners accounted for as many as 34 scalps in a match that wound up in less than three days. Even as novice a part-timer as Dean Elgar picked up four wickets on the first day.Lost biteEven if you discount the recent fixture as an aberration, given the preconditions of the match, Mohali has incrementally lost its fabled bite. Only that its sometimes made to look pacer-friendlier by the general deterioration or sluggishness of most other subcontinental surfaces. In the fixtures since the West Indies Test, both spinners and pacers have haggled wickets off it. The honours board offers unmitigated proof.Beneath Benjamin, the first entrant on the honours board, are Dion Nash and Javagal Srinath, but then you have to read out the names of Anil Kumble (twice), Danish Kaneria, Harbhajan Singh and Danish Kaneria to find another pacers name of the board, thats Mitchell Johnson,when he took five wickets for 64 runs.The same match had another entry that of Zaheer Khan5/94. But on both instances, the respective teams had posted 405 and 428, suggesting the batsmen werent left feeling quite bedevilled. The pace-bowling entry is Peter Siddles, his 5/71 coming in Indias first-innings total of 499. This implies seamers havent had much of an incisive, or decisive, influence on the match. In fact Australia lost both these matches.This, though, is not to say Mohali affords negligible assistance to seamers. It does offer bounce and carry, and pretty uniformly throughout the match. It rewards the bowlers who bend their back and hit the deck hard. Also, its not where one ball would snort at the batsmans throat and the next will creep shin high.It can never be a dustbowl eithereven the South Africa Test wasnt an fiendish subcontinental turner, and while it did help the spinners from the first day, there was a perceptible lack of application from batsmen of both sides.But in general the surfaces tend to become slower as the game progresses here. It might have to do with the ageing squares, which havent been relaid since the first Test. So understandably, its firmness too deteriorates, though the nature of the soil is such that it doesnt break up dramatically.On Thursday, Daljit would escort the media up till the main strip and patiently answer their queries in diplomatic platitudes, with a disclaimer that we cannot predict how the pitch would behave on the fifth day and the assurance that the pitch will last all five days. There again is a telling paradox. Either way, it wont be the sort of pitch where Broad will feel compelled to shrug off his tendon strain on the foot and do a Walsh. Or an Indian batsmen would fear for a Prabhakar encore.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

During the last Rabi season, in the entire erstwhile Adilabad district, only 67,000 hectare were cultivated while paddy was cltivated in onyl 14,352 hectares. Of this entire cultivable area, not a single acre was under the irrigation projects concerned. In Kharif season, the farmers cultivated pulses and other short duration crops while a majority of the farmers shifted to pulses from cotton as it was lost due to heavy rains.Besides sufficient water in the projects and the increased ground water levels, the state government is supplying nine hours of uninterrupted power. The farmers are likely to cultivate maize, jowar, paddy and green gram. Agriculture officials are also distributing green gram seed to farmers on subsidy.B Srinivas, a farmer of Kaddem mandal said he did not cultivate Rabi crops for the last two years but this year he is going to cultivate paddy and other crops.Under Kaddam project, 68,150 acres are covered in Kaddam, Jannaram, Luxettipet, Dandepally and Mancherial mandals.Under Sri Ram Sagar Project, there is 35,000 acres of ayacutt in Nirmal, Laxmanchanda, Khanapur, Mamada and Kaddam mandals but a single acre was not cultivated for the last two years.

Similar tactics are being employed by traders for other crops like paddy and moong (green gram). Farmer leaders say that traders were not ready to buy their crops at prevailing rates, causing them losses.A farmer from Kalod village in Bhiwani district, Suraj Bhan told TOI that an offer on those lines was made to him when he sold his 4.5 quintal of raw cotton in his village recently.Another farmer from the same village, Rattan Singh said, ""The same formula of rates was laid out before me when I inquired about raw cotton prices from a trader in the village on Saturday.""Sources said the traders were taking benefit of currency crunch as even government agencies were not able to make spot payments for crops.

Pilot said the farmers were not granted crop loans either. ""Earlier farmers suffered because of natural calamities and now they are suffering because of government imposed 'calamities' (demonetisation),"" he said.The Congress state president said farmers were the worst hit by demonetisation, as rural areas lacked basic banking infrastructure.

These are enhancement of farmer-scientist interface, economically viable technology options, partnership and institution building and Internet-enabled knowledge sharing, said Director, Central Institute for Freshwater Aquaculture (CIFA) Dr P Jayasankar.Addressing a workshop on the sidelines of Farmer First programme here on Tuesday, Jayasankar said CIFA pursues a farmer-driven approach towards problem identification, prioritisation, experiments and management. Strong partnership with farmers for developing location-specific, demand-driven technology option will be the guiding principle for the Council in the coming days, he said.CIFA has selected five villages (three in Jatni and one each is Balianta and Balipatna blocks) in Khurda district and involved around 400 farming families for the programme. Modules on improved technologies on crop, horticulture, livestock and fishery will be promoted. Besides, skill development and technical back-up will be provided to beneficiaries with focus on small and marginal farmers and farm women.CIFA officials informed that during the rabi season, cultivation of green gram in rice fields, introduction of improved variety of pointed gourd, capsicum and strain Kaveri bird will be popularised. The scientific carp culture and integrated fish farming will also be on the agenda.Among others, District Agricultural Officer Rabi Narayan Mahapatra, Assistant Director of Horticulture Pradosh Kumar Panda, block level officers, scientists and farmers representatives attended."

(Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje) Farm labourers harvesting late-kharif onions at a field near Nashik. (Express Photo: Mayur Bargaje)Its already a bit late in the season, but three out of Nandu Awatis seven-acres holding are yet to see any rabi onion plantings. The 42-year-old from Ambegaon, a village in Yeola taluka of Maharashtras Nashik district, had sown onion seeds in his nursery by mid-October and begun transplanting the germinated seedlings from these towards the month-end. By November first week, he had finished transplanting in four acres, when disaster struck in the form of demonetisation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. That was on November 8.I had to abruptly stop, as there was no cash to pay labourers and they werent ready to take the old notes lying with me. Nor are the new Rs 2,000 notes of any use, because people know you cant buy daily essentials and get proper change with these, observes Awati. He, like many other onion growers, was looking at a bumper crop on the back of good monsoon rains this time. Last two years, we suffered from drought. The year, we have enough water, but this cash crunch has upset all our calculations, he points out.Watch what else is making news:Onion cultivation is a highly cash- and labour-intensive affair. Transplanting of rabi season onion  which has to be done within a month of sowing  starts from October-end and continues for the next two months. In some pockets, transplantation extends to even mid-January, though anything beyond December tends to severely impact yields. Around 60 per cent of transplantation happens between November 15 and December 15, and this is when labour demand is really high. On an average, about 40 farm hands are required to undertake transplantation operations over an acre in a single day. It costs about Rs 7,000 per acre, and may go up to Rs 8,000 if the labourers are not locally sourced. Harvesting labour also costs the same amount. Out of our total cultivation cost of Rs 40,000 per acre, Rs 14,000-15,000 is for labour, with expenses on fertilisers, pesticides and other inputs making up the rest, informs Awati. According to Santosh Gorade, a farmer from Takali Vinchur in Nashiks Niphad taluka, growing onions require twice as much labour as maize, moong (green gram) or wheat. Gorade managed to complete transplantation in two of his four acres land, when the sudden cash crunch forced him to suspend operations. The labourers in my field included 16 who were from various villages in Ratnagiri district. I had to tell all of them to leave, after they were half-way through their job. They were obviously not going to accept the withdrawn notes, he notes.Maharashtra produces roughly 30 per cent of Indias annual onion output of 185-195 lakh tonnes. Almost 60 per cent of it is from the rabi crop, which, depending upon the time of transplanting, gets harvested from end-February to mid-May. Rabi onions, especially from Maharashtra, are amenable to storage unlike the kharif (October-November harvesting) and late-kharif (December-January) crops. The stored rabi crop is what feeds the market during the April-September period, till the kharif onions are ready for harvesting.For farmers in Maharashtras onion belt  mainly Nashik, Ahmednagar, Pune and Dhule districts  the acute shortage of Rs 100 and Rs 500 notes to pay labour has affected transplanting operations. Data from the state agriculture department as on November 25 shows only 1.46 lakh hectares (lh) being planted to rabi onions. Last year, at this time, 2 lh had already been covered and overall acreage touched 2.5 lh, despite widespread drought conditions. The current years shortfall appears to be largely due to the inability to pay farm labour. Apart from local labour, the onion belt also engages farms hands from the Konkan region. They mostly comprise smallholder farmers, who, after harvesting paddy from their own fields in October, come to Nashik for transplanting of onion.Farmers like Awati and Gorade were keen to plant onions this rabi also because prices have recovered from their lows. The modal price of onion  the rate at which majority of trades happen  at Nashiks Lasalgaon wholesale market has risen from Rs 417 per quintal in September to Rs 587 in October and Rs 872 in November. Demonetisation has seemingly not just wrecked farmers plans, but also raised the possibility of prices climbing on account of lower rabi plantings. Deepak Chavan, director of Farm Features Private Limited, a Pune-based commodity research firm, believes that there will be significant price correction after March. Low mandi prices till a couple of months ago had already prompted farmers to switch to maize, wheat and chana (chickpea). The cash crunch post-demonetisation will only exacerbate the trend, he adds.While Chavan sees up to a quarter of the rabi onion area this time being diverted to less labour-intensive crops, Nanasaheb Patil, director of Lasalgaons agriculture produce market committee, thinks otherwise. His take is that the onion belt farmers have no real competing alternative cash crop. Yes, absence of ready cash to pay labour is an issue, but farmers will find a way out of this, including by involving family members and neighbours in transplanting and harvesting operations, claims Patil. But he, too, admits that the total rabi onion area in Maharashtra will barely match the 2015 level  which itself was below the average of 3 lh  notwithstanding the abundant water availability.If Gorade and Awati are bemoaning the sudden stop to their rabi onion transplantation operations, the situation is worse for Rambhau Gangurde, a farmer from Dighwad village of Nashiks Chandwad taluka. He is stuck with five acres of his late-kharif onions still to be harvested. In the normal course, I would have harvested it from the coming week, allowing me to also grow rabi onions in three acres. But with the cash crunch, both harvesting of my existing crop and transplantation of rabi onions look a tall order, he complains.But the worst hit are farm labourers, who, without any forewarning, have seen all work opportunities drying up. Sharad Borade and his two brothers eke out a living working for daily wages at others fields. Residents of Takali Vinchur, the same village to which Gorade belongs, they have now decided to travel 63 km to Malegaon, a city in Nashik district. Farmers here have no cash to pay us. So, we have no option but to look for work away from home, says Borade, who isnt sure, though, whether things are any better in Malegaon. This withdrawal of notes, we are told, is good for us in the long run. I, too, hope the present hardships are temporary, he sums up the situation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

(Source: Sahil Walia) Sukhbir Badals resort near Chandigarh. (Source: Sahil Walia)OPPOSITION PARTIES came down heavily on the Badals inaugurating their new business venture in the form of a resort and spa in Mullanpur, near here, stating that it smacked of brazen promotion of self-interest. Reacting to the news report by The Indian Express that Deputy Chief Minister Sukhbir Singh Badals pet project  the Oberoi Sukhvilas Resort and Spa  has become fully operational from Thursday, senior Congress leader Sunil Jakhar said, The resort would be akin to Taj Mahal for the Badal family where their dreams of ruling Punjab for 25 years will lie buried.Watch What Else Is Making NewsJakhar said the resort was a cruel joke on the people of the state who have been awaiting fulfilment of false promises made by the Akalis. As they say in Hindi, ye to chhati pe moong dalne wali baat hai. Without feeling any compunction for pain and suffering of the people of the state, they are busy expanding their businesses. This will draw peoples ire who will not tolerate their mockery by putting up extravagant shows of wealth, he stated, adding that the move will boomerang against the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).Punjab Congress leaders Jagmohan Singh Kang, Balbir Singh Sidhu and Deepinder Singh Dhillon accused the Badals of brazenly promoting their own interests. Accusing Badals of misleading and befooling the people with false announcements, without having any intention of ensuring their implementation, they demanded immediate imposition of the code of conduct by the Election Commission in the state to prevent the government from continuing to abuse official machinery to promote Akali interests.The Aam Aadmi Party, too, issued a statement saying the Punjab government permitted the construction of the Metro Eco Green Resort, Pallanpur, belonging to the Badal family, by violating the state policy regarding ecotourism and other norms and even by concealing facts.Dinesh Chadha, co-convener of RTI Wing of AAP, said in a statement that construction of this resort was against environment norms and even against the rights of local people and residents of Kandi. Chadha further revealed that according to the Punjab Eco Tourism Policy (2009), the aim of launching the ecotourism project is to secure the livelihood of local residents with development of permissible and ecologically sound ecotourism infrastructure and to improve their economic conditions. It is specifically mentioned in this policy that the ecotourism project will not be allowed purely on commercial consideration. But, on the other hand, the Metro Eco Green Resort has been constructed on commercial considerations in collaboration with The Oberois instead of improving the economic condition of local residents, he claimed.Chadha also alleged that rules regarding setting up of the resort had been circumvented and facts concealed while taking permission to use land for the purpose.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"
590470fe7be9e04154df6c8e,Bikaner’s amazing street food,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/paperweight/national-anthem-tales-from-long-ago/,2016-12-02,"The mirchi bada is as big as a brinjal, and tawny like a camel. It stands amongst others of its kind on the counter of Bhikaram Chandmal, one of Bikaners best snacks-and-sweets shops. It isnt the thing for me, I know, but my finger has pointed at it. Now, it is lying on its tummy, turning around slowly in the white microwave. In a few moments, it will rest in my hand, daring me to bite. Were the shop crowded, I could have slunk away, but it is that in-between hour, between breakfast and lunch, when Bikaneris reluctantly go off to work.Beep-beep-beepmy time is up. A paper plate floats before me eyes. The idle salesman fixes his gaze upon me. I clamp my eyes shut, open my mouth wide and dig into the mirchi bada Nothing happens at first. The thick jacket of deep-fried besan lulls the taste buds into dropping their guard. Then, the chilli strikes with its full incendiary force. It has been deseeded and filled with even more potent spices. It sets my tongue aflame, makes my ears turn red and leaves my brow dripping with sweat. But I am glad I have been introduced to Bikaneri food the Rajput way, with a trial by fire!Savouring itIt is only the first of my three afternoons in Bikaner: the land of bhujia and legendary bhujiawalas like Haldirams and Bikanervala. And I am determined to savour every one of the towns many sweet and spicy treats. So, shortly after checking in at the RTDC hotel, I have made my way towards Station Road, the new hub of Bikaners bhujia- and mithai-walas.After the mirchi bada, everything else on the counter seems tame stuff. Some of it, like the dhokla and the besan papdi, is not even of Bikaneri extraction, but then the Bikaneri, although blessed with a discriminating palate, never discriminates against food from other places. As one friendly local puts it, We love food, not politics. I certainly admire his sentiment but see no point in celebrating the masala dosa and aloo tikki in Bikaner. For now, I want strictly Bikaneri treats, and the mirchi badas counter-mate, the kofta, becomes my next prey.Kofta? The Bikaneri variety doesnt look like any I have eaten before. It is round and batter-cased like a batata vada,probably a pakora by another name, but it signs off like neither. Behind its thick besan defence lies a thin shield of soft, white paneer. And then, the invading teeth sink into a spicy mash of potatoes mined with plump, juicy raisins. Salty, spicy and sweet (in that order), the flavours rise and fall with each move of the jaw. The kofta doesnt stand a chance against my appetite, but even in its loss it wins a lifelong adherent in me.Bhikaram-Chandmals stands in a lane leading towards Kot Gate, away from Station Road, but from its entrance I can clearly see the small outlet of Bikaji, flagbearer of the nationwide Haldiram brand in Bikaner. Further down Station Road lies Laljis, precursor of the not less illustrious Bikanervala and Bikano brands. And still further stands the local favourite, Chhotu Motu Joshi. I reckon it is time to move on from Bhikaram Chandmal, but not before some gond halwa.This halwa is a winter specialty: quite evident from the number of black peppers in it. It is also completely soaked in ghee. It would be the perfect thing to have of a January night in Delhi, but this is a February afternoon in Bikaner, so I decide to go easy on it. Although made out of whole wheat flour, it just melts away in the mouth, leaving behind a taste of coconut, almonds and pepper. As for the gond (gum), the halwa contains some amount of a natural gum (gum Arabica), which also goes into the making of its (rather distant) cousin, the gond pak, but that I will try laterThe Bikaji outlet is a maze of namkeens. Jars and packets full of the crisp, spicy savouries line its counter and shelves, but I am only interested in the original, unevolved bhujia, Bikaners most famous export and a national habit today. Although the bhujia has spawned many variants, including the very popular aloo bhujia, the basic variety remains by far the most sought after. In Bikaner, it is invariably mixed with thick, extra spicy nuggets called dhankoli.Now, bhujia is made across the country today, so what makes the real Bikaneri bhujia stand apart, I ask the old salesman. The flavour, he says. Everything from the air of the place, to the water used for mixing the ingredients and the oil used for frying the bhujia matters, he explains. Talking of oil, the better shops in Bikaner all use groundnut oil for frying. It is expensive, but imparts a splendid flavour and aroma to the bhujia that palm oil, vanaspati and other cheapies are completely incapable of producing.The first-time visitor would be astonished by the number of bhujiawalas and mithaiwalas in Bikaners markets. Every second shop here is a shrine to the palate, seemingly of considerable age, and evidently with no dearth of patrons. At Laljis, for instance, the crowd always spills out onto Station Road. Although gond pak is at the top of my mind as I approach the shop, its their moti pak that tempts me most.This one is a rich sweet that looks the part. It is decorated with silver leaf and rose petals, and tickles the palate with its granular, albeit soft, texture. Although it tastes very different, the moti pak turns out to be a sibling of the ubiquitous motichoor laddu thats a staple of north Indian weddings and also temple prasad. Unlike the laddu, though, it has more ghee and considerably less sugar. So, the stomach, rather than the palate, is the limiting factor!Laljis also does numerous halwas, and while I can resist the newfangled pineapple variant, their moong dal halwa is another thing. How much, asks the man at the counter. A plate, I say, then quickly correct myself: would 50 grams be possible? The man gives me an amused look and hands me a sampler  gratis. And I finish it, although my stomach is now threatening to do rude things. Phew! And Ive only been to three shops so far Station Road suddenly seems an interminable stretch. I give up  for the time being  and head back to my hotel.This kind of indulgence needs serious practice. And in order to do better the next day, I need to calm my stomach now. So, no dinner tonight: only bananas and oranges. The restraint pays off, and morning arrives to find me VERY hungry. I leave the hotel at a very early 8am (its winter), and walk the 3km to Station Road with the twin aims of killing time and further honing my appetite. But I arrive none too soon. The discarded daunas outside the shops suggest the party is already over.Well, not quite: jalebis are still frying at Chhotu Motu Joshis. And theyre supposed to be the best in town. The Bikaneri jalebi, unlike the fat, juicy one at Chandni Chowks Jalebiwala, are very thin and very crisp. The batter for them is not squeezed out of a cloth but allowed to leak out of a pot under its own weight. And while I do have reservations about their cheery red colour, a bite is all it takes to banish them.I have begun the day on a sweet note, and were I a child still, I would be happy to pamper my sweet tooth some more. But age and last nights fruity dinner make a strong case for something salty, and spicy. The kachoris in Chhotu Motus hot case are probably an hour old now, but a microwave can easily remedy that. Two kachoris later, I am all set for one last sweet before starting with the sightseeing.Its a tossup between the ghewar and the gond pak at Bhikarams. And not willing to spurn either, I try a bit of both. The ghewar, well, is milder than what we get in Delhi, and topped with cream to boot. But the gond pak is a revelation. Although made from humble wheat flour, and closely related to the gond halwa, it has a character all its own. Yes, it wouldnt melt in the mouth without the plentiful ghee, but whoever said sweets would help you to a size zero figure!To neutralise the sweet taste, I pop in some crisp hara matar (sun-dried and fried green peas) and moong. Neither of these simple, healthy and delicious namkeens are mainstream in the big cities. Sigh! Tonight, it will have to be a normal dinner, and tomorrow, again, I might not find the time to indulge myself on this many-flavoured street. But before leaving this town, I promise to find Gulab Singhs shop in bhujia bazaar that specialises in phini, that oh-so-fine delicious labour of love. Its said that an expert phini maker can draw 4,000 strands of phini from a lump of dough. Ill see how, before I go!"

About 152 of the 158 APMC markets have been linked to UMP in the state.Arrival of bulk commodities such as green gram, black gram, Bengal gram, groundnut, paddy, cotton, copra, onion, coconut, rice, dry chilli and arecanut has eased after farmers began accepting cheques and RTGS payments from processors and exporters, and the price spike after initial shortages post-demonetization also encouraged farmers to come to mandis, officials said.Manoj Rajan, managing director and CEO, ReMS, said traded volumes had come down by 38% and the value of total trade by 35% in the first week after demonetization. ""But things improved after the cash-based system was largely replaced by financial instruments and it is now close to returning to normalcy,'' he added.In the current month, trade value recorded around Rs 2,275 crore and the number of lots sold in the APMC market is roughly around 3 lakh, comparatively the same over last year. ""In fact, the last week of November saw an increase of 13% growth over the first week of November,'' Rajan said.Data of day trading in APMCs indicated that small farmers have supplied about 75% of the lots in the range of one quintal to five quintals, using the online platform. Nearly 30 lakh farmers have registered for online payment in APMCs. ""After demonetization, market participants became cautious and farmers were skeptical about bringing their produce, while traders and commission agents were not fully participating in the markets, owing to the liquidity crunch. Though farmers still ask for cash, they have started accepting cheque payments and are also ready for online payments,"" Rajan said.""Online payments in agriculture markets will gain further momentum if banks provide support by opening extension counters at markets and enable farmers to withdraw cash,"" he added.DEMONETIZATION AND AGRICULTURE MARKETS IN KARNATAKAPeriodNo. of lots tradedValueNov 2 to 872,5335,99,32,98,418Nov 9 to 1542,7263,65,18,81,045Nov 16 to 2268,5144,43,13,01,701Nov 23 to 2988,2926,77,06,08,6382,72,06520,84,70,89,803* During Nov1-8 period (first block) a total of 74,619 lots were traded* Nov 9-16 (second block) 48,892 lots were traded which shows decline of 34% in market arrivals* Traded volumes down by 38% i.e. from 137 lakh quintals in first block to 85.1 lakh lots in second block* Value of total trade recorded a drop of 35% -- from Rs 633 crore in first block to Rs 414 crore in second blockTIMES VIEWKarnataka's digital initiative to automate APMCs is paying rich dividends -- at a time when demonetization has hit all market sectors hard, the state's agricultural trade remains untouched. It has proved to be a platform where there is little scope for corruption and gives the farmer a fair chance with transparency in prices. With more farmers accepting cheques and online payments to counter the cash crunch, the e-mandi is playing an inclusive role and nudging them towards the way ahead. No surprise then, that the APMC's e-mandi model is being replicated across India."

590471727be9e04154df6d51,Migration in India still largely remains a social rather than an economic phenomenon,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/migration-in-india-is-still-largely-remains-a-social-rather-than-an-economic-phenomenon/,2016-12-05,"The most recent numbers on migration from the decennial census of 2011 highlights the magnitude and the nature of migration in the country. Migration in census parlance means that a person has shifted from the place of birth to another town or village maybe for reasons of business, employment, education, marriage, the shift of family residence or for any other reason.Overall there were 45.36 crore migrants in the total population of 121.05 which takes the share of migrants in total population to more than a third or 37.5%. However, it would be a misnomer to confuse the India migration phenomenon as a purely economic issue that now riles the world. In fact the primary reason for migration as is borne out by the numbers show that is more a social phenomenon.Of the 45 crore migrants in the country more than half were women. In fact the size of the migrant women population was 31.26 crore which is more than double the male migrant population of 14.09 crore. This was because the single largest reason for migration was marriage with the share a humungous 49.4% for the population as a whole. The gender composition shows that while marriage contributed to more than two third of the migration of women (69.7%) the share of mens migration from marriage was only 4.3%.Thus we find that of the 31.26 crore women migrants as many as 21.78 crore shifted because of marriage. In case of men only 60 lakh of the total male migrants numbering 14.09 crore shifted due to marriage. Thus the primary reason for migration was social rather than economic as usually happens in the case of long distance migration. The share of other factors to women migration was rather limited. The second factor contributing to womens migration was shift of households (12.3%), followed by movement after birth (6.2%). Economic factors like education, employment and business contributed to only a miniscule 2.4%, 1% and 0.4% of womens migration.However, economic factors played a more important role in mens migration. This is because the single most important reason for male migration was employment. Of the 14.09 crore male migrants more than a quarter or 3.89 crore (or 27.7%) listed employment as the primary reason for shift in location. The second most important reason for male migration was shift of households which accounted for 3.14 crore or (22.3%) of the male migrants. However, the contribution of other economic factors like education and business to male migration were a relatively minor 2.3% and 3.4%.From this one can safely conclude that economic factors played an important role only in the case of male migration and that it was the social factors like marriage of women which was the largest driver of migration in the country."

As for paddyIII crop, farmers could pay premium towards the insurance scheme until December 31.Addressing media personnel here on Monday, he said that farmers did not have scope to insure these crops. After having approved the inclusion of these crops in the insurance scheme at a State-level special committee meeting, a report has been sent to the Centre. Further, he said seawater desalination plants with a total capacity of 100 MLD would come up at Alandhalai in Thoothukudi district and at Narippaiyur in Ramanathapuram district. Currently, these development projects are under evaluation process, he added.Joint Director of Agriculture, P. Vanniarajan said the district has been facing deficit rainfall this year and hence all farmers were advised to insure their crops. The annual average amount of rainfall in the district is 662 mm, but so far the district had received only 203 mm rains.The district should have experienced an average of 429 mm rainfall till December 5. Owing to inadequate rain, almost all the 53 system irrigation tanks in the district had no water. Moreover, many rainfed tanks in rural panchayats did not have sufficient amount of water.Cultivation was considerable on rainfed tracts in Kayathar and Pudur blocks and these blocks require just one more spell of rain and farmers were keeping their fingers crossed. But, more rainfall is required to raise crops in Ottapidaram and Ettayapuram and its surroundings.To withstand the drought situation, farmers have been advised to spray one percent of potassium chloride fertilizer. The Joint Director of Agriculture said that rainfed crops such as black gram, green gram, maize, cholam, cumbu, cotton and chillies have been cultivated on 1.38 lakh hectares. During last year, the crop cultivation cover was 1.42 lakh ha, he said.Joint Director of Agriculture said the district has been facing deficit rainfall and farmers have been advised to insure their crops"

Be it a vendor selling groundnut (moongfali), a tea vendor, or a food-stall owner, they have made the transition gradually over the past month, ever since the demonetisation of older Rs 500 and 1,000 notes took 85% of the currency out of circulation in the country.The announcement last month had come as a blow to business that largely depend on cash, said Sunil Choubey, a tea-stall owner in Phase 8 (industrial area). I first opted to allow my regular customers to defer making payments. But that was making survival difficult. It was a customer who suggested I use PayTM, a digital wallet.A customer paying through PayTM at a stall in SAS Nagar. (Sushil Prajapati/HT)How does it work? Most digital wallets (also known as mobile wallets or e-wallets) let you create an account on their mobile application or on website with basic details, and you generate a scannable QR code. You can take a printout of the code (or use ones given by the firm), which can be scanned by customers using the same app on their phones, and the money is transferred from their digital wallet to yours. After that, you can simply shift the money to your bank account.Representatives of several e-wallet providers are approaching vendors. No extra charges are being levied at present, say vendors.The digital wallets allows people to make payments for smaller denomination as well. I have been using it for about 15 days, and it also saves the trouble of keeping change, added Choubey, who has made several fellow vendors to opt for cashless transactions.Going to the bank means losing a day of work, and even standing in queues does not guarantee you money. I just that the shop from where I buy grocery also starts using the e-wallet, said Bhola, a samosa vendor.The companys people came and told me how to use the digital wallet. Also, these days, many people come with the Rs 2,000 notes. How could I arrange so much change since our sale value is not that big per transaction, said Rahul Kumar, a juice-cart owner in the same area.In the last one month, there were days when I had to manage by eating roti with chutney as I had no money to buy ration. For almost two weeks after the demonetisation, there was virtually no sale. But, now, clients are coming back, added Anirudh Shah, who sells groundnuts worth about Rs 2,000 per day."

Wholesale prices in Akola and Latur , the key pul se market in the state, fell to Rs 4,500-4,875 a quintal this week--below the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,050. MSP is a price decided by the Centre and no trader can a offer a rate lower than it for the produce. The average price during June was Rs 9,1009,450. Farmers and experts say this rate could further dwindle once fresh stocks reach the market as harvest picks up over the next two weeks. Officials said one of major reasons for the fall in prices is the current cash crunch, which has affected the cost of agricultural produce in the state.""Other than the cash crunch, traders who had hoarded the stock have begun to liquidate it to create a demand-andsupply imbalance, which have led to a massive crash in prices,"" said an official from the Akola wholesale market.Huge import of pulses that the Centre has ordered has affected the prices too.Officials say last year's drought saw a huge shortage of the dal, forcing prices to spike. This year the production has been good, as the area under cultivation also increased after Maharashtra's special incentives to farmers last year to grow pulses in an effort to stop shortage of pulses in the market and arrest a surge in prices. The government has given free seeds and fertilizers to farmers willing to grow pulses. ""Not only Maharashtra, but other pulse-producing states such as Karnataka , too, had a good crop this year. Looking at the market situation with demonetisation in the backdrop, the Centre will have to start buying from the market to stablize the prices,"" said an expert.Retail prices of tur dal have dropped marginally in some parts of the city .""This season we have had a bumper harvest of not just tur dal but other dals as well. The wholesale rates of moong dal, masoor dal and tur dal have fallen by Rs 20,"" said Deepak Gala , a wholesaler at APMC .On Thursday , retail price of tur dal in Bandra was Rs 140 and in Andheri Rs 160.

Most flights in and out of Chennai were either cancelled or diverted. Having messed up the Andamans a few days ago, she tore into a wide swathe of land from Sriharikota to Marakkanam and left a trail of destruction. But the biggest damage was to the green cover in the city as almost every street had trees uprooted or broken.Having learnt from last years supercyclone that was the worst in living memory, the Tamil nadu administration did well by evacuating people living in low-lying areas, deploying the National Disaster Response Force and announcing a days holiday for all institutions and workplaces. That to an extent eased the pressure on the road traffic system and kept most people safe indoors. Hospitals and rescue personnel had been put on high alert. Also collapsed trees were cleared as quickly as possible to make roads motorable. But under-construction drains across the city got flooded and posed a big threat to people and vehicles unfamiliar with the area. And the lack of electricity since the morningcompounded peoples problems. On the positive side, Chennai and its adjourning areas got plenty of rainwater, but the price paid was humungous.The government must take immediate measures to offer relief and rehabilitation. The focus must be on saving lives and expediting medicare to the needy. Also steps need to be taken to restore the livelihood of the poor who were the worst hit by the cyclone. If the experience of last Decembers cyclone is anything to go by, the state needs a visible, proactive administration that is responsive to the calls for help. The O Panneerselvam government has begun well. The follow up needs to be equally good."

The livelihoods of farmers in Thoothukudi has been affected as the district did not experience the normal rainfall this season. Most of the standing crops in rainfed tracts are on the verge of withering.If it did not rain in the next seven or ten days, almost all crops would wither away, K. Perumal, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, told The Hindu here on Monday.Anticipating monsoon rains, crops such as black gram, green gram, chillies, onion and maize were sown in parts of Ottapidaram, Kayathar, Kovilpatti, Ettayapuram, Vilathikulam and surrounding areas. But maize crop has not been affected severely due to shortfall in rainfall.Paddy farmers are bearing the brunt of a truant monsoon.Cultivation area reducedCrops are raised over 46,000 acres of rainfed area during normal monsoon. Unfortunately, deficient rainfall has forced farmers to considerably reduce the cultivation area to 3,000 acres that too with the aid of water pumps this year.Only some farmers have raised paddy nursery beds in Srivaikuntam, Tiruchendur and Alwarthirunagari.Banana farmers have also lost their hopes as the crop requires good amount of water.While the district administration has been taking efforts to include banana and onion crops in the insurance scheme to benefit farmers, the possibility seems remote, according to farmers.Even the much awaited insurance benefits due to farmers in 2015-16 are yet to be received.Hence, he appealed to the district administration to recommend to the State government to declare Thoothukudi district drought hit to receive relief from the Centre and save the lives of farmers.P. Vanniarajan, Joint Director of Agriculture, said that the area under cultivation ised to be at 1.4 lakh hectares when the normal northeast monsoon rainfall was at 429 mm. But, so far, only 147.89 mm rains had been received.The annual average rainfall for the district is 662 mm, but only 209.38 mm had been recorded this year.Around 18, 000 farmers had insured their crops so far and other farmers could insure their crops till January 15."

Look at him eat the sprouted mung bean! my friends marvelled.I wanted to stand up and crow, Look ye trifling earthlings! See what repast my progeny hath digested (or something like that). Instead, I smiled nonchalantly and batted their praise away as though to say Pshaw! What else do you think he eats?He never ate another sprouted bean again.Ma ke haath ka khaana. Amma samaiyal.

No tantrums, tears or throwing things at passersby. He topped all of this with an action etched forever in my mind. He ate a sprouted bean.Oh my God! Your son is too good! Look at him eat the sprouted mung bean! my friends marvelled. I wanted to stand up and crow Look ye trifling earthlings! See what repast my progeny hath digested (or something like that). Instead, I smiled nonchalantly and batted their praise away as though to say Pshaw!What else do you think he eats? He never ate another sprouted bean again.Ma ke haath ka khaana. Amma samaiyal. Its the stuff of legends. Mothers love to cook, feed children and watch their cheeks become round and flushed with good health. We preen when our children eat well and despair when they dont. We take it personally. Good food habits in a child, good parenting after all.But we sometimes fail to take into consideration one thing: some kids are a f****** pain to feed. My five-year old, meals and I are currently embroiled in a love-hate relationship that would star Alia Bhatt, Siddharth Malhotra and Varun Dawan if it were a movie. Mealtime starts off well enough, with my Stepford smile firmly in place as we all set the table together. By the time the rice hits the plate, the shit has hit the ceiling.The green thing, I hate it. Take it away. This is spicy. Its too chewy. Too mushy. Dont let the rice and the dal touch. My stomach hurts. Im dying. I need to burp. I need to pee. Im warning you. This is so yucky. Indian again? My five-year olds mealtime conversation is a Ginsberg-esque stream of consciousness.At school, I ask the teachers if he eats. Oh my God! Hes the best. Eats everything and so neatly. We wanted to ask you how you do it. With his grandmother he asks for seconds and thirds and praises the food in terms that would make the late AA Gill proud.With me, its Mutiny on the Bounty. I try not to take this to heart, my cooking cant be THAT bad. Right? Right???Last week, after a particularly long weekend, I had had enough. I finished eating and went to my room to read a book.

I waited to feel like a bad mother. For him to wake up hungry and crying. For a bolt of lightening to strike me down. None of that happened.

While wheat price records an all time high in Odisha leading to surge in price of flour, suji and maida, prices of pulses have fallen considerably much to the delight of consumers.Market sources said wheat price has soared from Rs 2,000 per quintal to Rs 2,700 in the last one month whereas dal prices witnessed a downward trend since early December.Tur (Arhar) dal, which was being sold Rs 10,000 to Rs 11,000 per quintal a month ago, is now priced Rs 7,500 to Rs 9,500. While green gram (moong dal) priced Rs 8,000 per quintal is now sold Rs 6,000, Bengal gram is priced Rs 13,000 instead of Rs 12,000. Similarly, red lentil is sold at Rs 6,000 per quintal against its earlier price of Rs 8,000 and black gram is priced Rs 8,500 to Rs 9,500 instead of Rs 12,000.The price of pulses is likely to fall further. General secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders' Associations (FAOTA) Sudhakar Panda said the price of arhar would slide down to Rs 6,500, moong Rs 5,000 and black gram Rs 7,000 in January.While the country has a requirement of 2.2 crore tonnes of dal, this time pulses production is expected to touch 2.3 crore tonnes. Plus, 40 to 50 lakh tonnes of pulses will be imported.In wheat, the situation has been worsened by stocks with FCI which is yet to start open sale. This was largely a result of last years crop loss.Panda said since Odisha, which needs 16 lakh tonnes of wheat, largely depends on other States, the import is hit by cash crunch. ""We used to send money to the traders through RTGS and they pay cash to farmers. Since currency crisis still prevails in Punjab and UP from where we procure wheat, the traders are unable to buy,"" he added."

Rajendran, former Kovilpatti MLA, said they could not bear the loss of damages and hence it was essential for the government to provide them drought relief to save them from debt.The agitating farmers, who rely on rainfed crop cultivation, demanded the government to offer compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre for damaged crops.Collector M. Ravikumar, Thoothukudi Sub Collector Deepak Jacob, District Revenue Officer (in-charge) Rasaiah reached out to the agitating farmers and convinced them saying that the demand for drought relief assistance would be made to the government.Unusually, Muthu Arangam, the meeting venue at the Collectorate was jam packed with farmers. While all chairs were occupied, some farmers with withered maize crops sat on the floor.Addressing the farmers, the Collector said a team of officials had been conducting inspection to assess the crop damage. The district has been facing a deficit rainfall of 66 percent with just 209.49 mm rain against the annual average of 662 mm. As for December, the average rainfall is 92 mm, but only 7 mm rain had been received, so far, he said.Crops such as banana, coriander and chillies had been included in the new crop insurance scheme and government order is awaited. Hence, farmers could utilise it. Around 28,000 farmers had insured their crops so far in the district. The paddy II crop cultivation touched 905 hectares and of which 802 hectares had been insured. Farmers, who rely on rainfed crop cultivation, could pay premium towards the new insurance scheme until January 15 in 2017 and for paddy-III crop until February 15, 2017. The rainfed crop cultivation was covered up to an extent of 1.10 lakh hectares in the district, so far.The Collector also appealed to all farmers to insure their crops. On crop loans, he said Rs.53 crore had been provided to farmers through cooperative banks and during the last forty days, 625 farmers were provided with loans of Rs.3.95 crore.Referring to illegal groundwater suction issue, he said 20 borewells in Thoothukudi taluk, 12 borewells in Srivaikuntam and seven in Tiruchendur had been sealed. Besides, 35 tanker lorries, including 26 in Thoothukudi and nine in Tiruchendur were seized by the Regional Transport authorities.On irregularities alleged in cooperative banks, he said the secretary of such a bank in Saminatham was placed under suspension and enquiries on similar irregularities were in progress at banks in Perungulam and Chettikurichi.Further, he said adequate stock of certified seeds and fertilizers were available and farmers could avail it.Thoothukudi Sub Collector Joint Director of Agriculture, P. Vanniarajan, Executive Engineer, PWD Tamirabarani, Subramanian, Joint Registrar of Cooperatives, Arockya Sugumar, Kovilpatti RDO, S. Kannabiran and Tiruchendur RDO, Thyagarajan attended the meet."

Photo: Rajendra Singh HajeriWhile many toor farmers have to watch their standing crop wither owing to deficit rain, the sight at the farm of Anand Bagalkot is the envy of other farmers.On the five-acre farm in Somadevarahatti village, the lush green crop which stands over five-feet tall is a stark contrast to most of the crop in the district.The main reason is that Mr. Bagalkot has used the new variety of toor seed, BSMR-736, which is believed to be the best for irrigated land.It has been developed by University of Agriculture Sciences, Dharwad.Speaking to The Hindu , Manjunath, Joint Director of the Agriculture Department, said that unlike the traditional variety, which gives a maximum yield of five quintals per acre, the 736 variety could give a yield of nearly 20 quintals per acre if maintained properly.However, the crop takes about 210 days to grow while the traditional crop takes only 130 days. Though the farmers will have to spent couple of more months to get the crop, yet the benefits of waiting is high, he said.He said that another advantage of the improved variety is that since the first three months is only the vegetative period, the farmers could use the time for inter-cropping to sow groundnut or green gram which would give additional revenue.He said that the cost of cultivating the traditional crop is around Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 12,000 per acre. The 736 variety will cost the farmer around Rs. 18,000 per acre.After that, the farmer could earn around Rs. 80,000 per acre while the traditional variety will fetch the farmer only Rs. 30,000 per acre, he said. He said the variety is good for places such as Bidar which receives around 800 mm rain per year, but in places such as Vijayapura, the farmers should have irrigation facility as the district does not receive this quantum of rain.The official said that since pulses do not damage the soil fertility commercial crop such as sugarcane, the traditional sugarcane farmers could switch over to this variety of toor for higher yield."

A similar fate has befallen shallot farmers of Perambalur district , who produce close to 75,000 tonnes of small onion on 20,000 acres. A cold storage facility built by the state government in 2014 for storing these onions shelling out `1.15 crore has been remaining useless for the simple reason that onions perish if stored in the cold! At the centre of this fiasco and waste of public money is the department of agriculture whose officials have been groping for answers and refusing to come on record.The department of agricultural marketing and agri business in Perambalur district has been well-known for production of small onion (sambar onion) and onion seeds.The seeds produced here are supplied to various parts of the state and neighbouring Karnataka. After harvesting the seeds, the stock is preserved under `Patty' (conventional storage technique) for a few months.As the produce is perishable in nature, the government constructed the onion marketing complex at Chettikulam at a cost of `1.15 crore. This included `11 lakh for establishing cold storage, `22 lakh for refrigeration system and generator for `6.50 lakh.Elixir Engineering company had executed the project and handed over the facility to the agriculture business officials on February 25, 2014. The then chief minister J Jayalalithaa inaugurated the complex on June 26, 2014 which started to function from September 17, 2014.However, the far mers found to their surprise that their produce when stored in the cold was perishing as the structure was technically unfit to preserve shallots. The Centre was forced to transform into a mere auction centre and the farmers returned to their conventional method of storing at their farm land itself.""Usually we don't store onion in refrigerators. Without knowing this basic fact, how can officials spend more than a crore of rupees for such a facility. The farmers believed the agriculture department officials and were eagerly waiting for the complex to work wonders when we got this shock,"" said Raja Chidambaram, Tamilaga Vivasayigal Sangam general secretary, Perambalur.M Mani, a farmer from Semmanapadu, a village near Chettikulam, who has been cultivating onion on four acres was one of the victims of the fiasco as his stocks perished when kept in the new facility.""To store onion, we need a combination of heat, cold and air. Our conventional method of storing was effective for a maximum of six months. We thought that without spending much, we could store our produce. But in reality the produce we kept in cold storage, completely perished"", Mani lamented.A Natesan of Irur village in Perambalur said officials had claimed that onions could be stored upto 10 months in the cold storage, but it couldn't last even a few days.After coming to know that the facility with a capacity of 50 metric tonne was not fit for storing onions the officials rented it out for storing fruits through TANFED. However, as no one come forward to use the cold storage, it was further let out to a farmer for storing horse gram and green gram.As he did not pay his dues, he was asked to vacate and the facility has been lying vacant since June 30 this year.Agriculture department officials refused to respond when contacted by TOI."

The pain was so severe that she was unable to walk.When an X-ray scan didn't show anything significant, her blood test was done, which showed her platelet count to be below 1 lakh, indicating exposure to some kind of viral infection.This is how many patients of viral infection with atypical symptoms are coming to orthopaedic clinics in the city over the last few months.""Since August this year, we are seeing almost two to four cases of viral arthritis every week at our clinic. While in some patients, a single major joint is involved, a few have complained of pain in multiple joints (poly-arthralgia). Initially, they only have joint pains. Usually within two to four days, they start getting fever and rashes,"" orthopaedic surgeon Kiran Shete of Spinalogy Clinic in Aundh said.Shete said, ""In some cases, many patients suffered from incredible knee joint paint after recovering from the viral infections. Tests have revealed that they suffered from viral arthritis .""Orthopaedic surgeon Ramesh Ranka of Ranka hospital in Mukundnagar said, ""In my practice of last 15 years, I have seen maximum number of viral poly-althralgia (multiple joint pains) in the last four months.""""This time, the presentation however has been very different than what I had seen in the previous few years. On an average, I see six patients of viral poly-althralgia (multiple joint pain) per day with acute onset,"" Ranka said.Strange enough, in the acute onset, the patient has fever for two-three days. But in half the number of patients, the fever is only for a day.""I even came across pati ents who did not complain of fever at all, but only weakness, generalized muscle and joint pains. The vulnerable age group is 40 years and above. The patients who had maximum duration of pain post-infection are mostly above the age group of 50,"" Ranka said. Those who had pre-existing vitamin D3, calcium and vitamin B12 deficiency suffer the most. So correcting these is important for early recovery of joints, he added. In the present cold weather, doctors suggest to keep body warm by using appropriate thermals and clothes while maintaining a good amount of motion of the joints. As far as medication is involved, doctors said, painkillers must be avoided in these cases.Orthopaedic surgeon Surendra Patil of Polaris hospital said one should avoid nonsteriod anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or painkillers as far as possible and should manage it with paracetamol tablets only. ""Turmeric and ginger are both anti-inflammatary and come handy in most cases of arthritis. Green gram or green moong dal is also a good remedy as its has vitamin A,B,C, E, iron, calcium and potassium content,"" Patil said.When contacted, orthopaedic surgeon Parag Sancheti of Sancheti hospital said, ""I see around 20 cases of viral arthritis per week. Hot water fomentation, rest, compres sion of the joint can help assuage pain. Early diagnosis and treatment are key for faster recovery.""Chronic joint pains are seen in about one in 10 cases of chikungunya infection. Rheumatologist Anuruddha Temebe warns that all chronic joint pains after viral fever may not be viral arthritis. ""If joint pains are not recovering after eight weeks, one shall consider other causes of polyarthralgia such as rheumatoid arthritis,"" Tembe added."

The RBI restriction has virtually brought the PACS operation to a halt as the crop credit and other cash requirement of individual members are far more than the withdrawal limit.With a deposit of over `2000 crore, the PACS are in a position to meet the cash needs of the farmer members. However, the RBI restriction has put these short term cooperative credit structure in a bind as their deposits are with respective DCCBs.Government Chief Whip Ananta Das has taken up the matter with Cooperation Minister Damodar Rout following objections from members of Purusottampur PACS in Balliapal block of Balasore district. They have a deposit of about `80 lakh in the PACS.As rabi operations are in full swing and farmers are positioning themselves to go for moong and biri cultivation, those who have applied for loans said they have no time to go to the district headquarters, where the DCCBs are mostly located, to open fresh accounts.Das, representing Bhogarai Assembly constituency, has urged the Cooperation Minister to ensure that the farmer members of the PACS draw required amount from their accounts in the primary societies instead of opening new accounts in DCCBs.The state has 2513 PACS and 212 LAMPS (Large Area Multi-Purpose Societies) with a total membership of 50 lakhs out of which nearly 12 lakh are loanee members."

Traders are expecting the prices to slide further before stabilising. Similarly, prices of moong dal and urad dal have come down to Rs 65 and Rs 80 per kg respectively in the last few days. Prices vary depending on the quality.However, the retail prices of pulses are yet to come down and it is expected to happen in the coming days. The scene was just the opposite last year. Tur dal price had touched Rs 180 to 200 per kg, forcing consumers to dig deeper into their pockets.Tur (unsplit dal) production this year is expected to be two-and-a-half times that of last year. The production is expected to be 7.5 lakh tonnes against 2.5 lakh tonnes last year. Farmers took to tur dal production in a big way this year as prices were very high last year, Gokul Prasad, deputy director (statistics), agriculture department, said.Though most parts of the state had been reeling under drought due to failure of both the south-west and the north-east monsoons, tur-growing areas of Kalaburagi, Yadgir and Bidar received rains. The only exception is Vijayapura, where tur crops were damaged due to a continuous dry spell. But the production is expected to be high this year because of an increase in the area of production. The total area under tur production this year is 12.35 lakh hectares against 7.30 lakh hectares last year, he said.Bumper production might have brought good news to consumers, but demonetisation has dampened the spirit of the traders and farmers.The main reason for the crash in prices is demonetisation. The traders have not been able to purchase the commodity from farmers due to liquidity crunch, Bharat Shah, chairman of the internal trade committee of the Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said.He said farmers who want on-the-spot payment were being forced to sell tur at Rs 48 to Rs 50/kg. Else, the payment will be delayed. Most traders are running the business on credit system. There is no demand for any commodity in the market. Note ban has affected the demand-supply chain, he said."

This was when domestic supplies were only coming from Karnataka.Now, as farmers from other states, including Maharashtra, are bringing their produce, retail rates have come down to Rs 100-105. ""The lower varieties cost less than Rs100,"" say traders.Rates of other pulses like moong and urad dal have come down to Rs70 to 95 a kg, respectively as against over Rs 100 earlier. ""Chana dal, which is in short supply, remains at Rs120 a kg, but this will be short lived,"" said Motwani."

""I have no intention to contest elections, but my only agenda is to safely bring back Indian prisoners lodged in Pakistan and jails of other countries,"" said Dalbir, while talking to TOI after joining BJP at Fazilka, during the Kissan Morcha Sammelan. She said home minister Rajnath Singh had to induct her into the party, but he could not make it at the sammelan due to inclement weather. So, she joined the party in the presence of state president Vijay Sampla and other senior leaders.However, on being persistently asked about her political ambitions, she said: ""For now, I will only campaign for the BJP, tell people its friendlier policies, and how Modi can bring about a desired change in the country."" Immediately after joining BJP, her tone and tenor turned political, as she said: ""People call Modiji anti-Dalit, anti-Muslim, and anti-Sikh, it's not so. Political parties are spreading canards about him, and I will tell the truth to them as to how only BJP is the hope of the people."" About other political parties, including Congress and AAP, she said: ""People have tested all of them. No party has come up to the expectations of the people, but the BJP.""During her quest to bring back Sarabjit from Pakistan's notorious Kot Lakhpat jail, Dalbir had contacted the top leadership of all major political parties and earned immense popularity, triggering speculations about her joining politics once again. While several Indian spies die unsung, even Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi visited Sarabjit's native place Bhikhiwind during his funeral, and Sarabjit's wife got a job in Guru Nanak Dev University (GNDU) on the recommendation of Congress president Sonia Gandhi. It was because of Dalbir Kaur's popularity that the state government declared three days of mourning, a state-level cremation of Sarabjit Singh , assistance of rupees one crore to the family, a gas agency, and government jobs for Sarabjit's daughters.Convinced about her struggle, Bollywood actress Aishwarya Rai Bachchan played Dalbir's role in the Omung Kumar directed movie 'Sarabjit'. Notably, Dalbir began her political carrier with Congress Sewa Dal , and had also been an active member of Congress Mahila Morcha. Later, she came close to BJP during the tenure of then BJP state president Avinash Rai Khanna. Reacting to Dalbir Kaur joining BJP, senior party leader Luxmi Kanta Chawla said: ""Whoever joins BJP is welcome, but people joining the party for tickets, or for their personal interests ahead of elections should not be welcomed."""

The agitation was led by P. Velumayil, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association.Owing to failure of North-east monsoon, the farmers suffered severe crop loss, and hence, the district should be declared drought-hit, the agitators said.Until November end, the district had received only 369 mm of rainfall against the average rainfall of 703 mm. Due to poor rainfall, the area under paddy cultivation in the district had shrunk to 5,685 hectares this year from 28,283 ha recorded last year. Paddy crop on a chunk of the area withered due to lack of water, they said.Rainfed crops such as black gram, green gram, maize and long-term crops like coconut too withered in many areas. Water level in dams came down to unprecedented levels, and wells had no water. This situation had brought agricultural activity to a halt. There was a serious threat to livestock, which did not have grazing land and adequate water to drink. The farmers had also been facing a scarcity of cattle feed, they added.The agitators said, and demanded a compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre of damaged paddy crop, Rs. 50,000 for an acre of damaged sugarcane crop and Rs. 15,000 for an acre of rainfed crops.Besides, a compensation of Rs. 10,000 should be given to each farmer, whose land turned fallow, and an equal amount should be extended to the families of each farm labour, they stressed.They also urged the government to waive crop loans taken by the farmers. Cattle feed should be given to them at subsidised rate.Mr. Velumayil said wages for those engaged under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme should be increased to Rs. 400 and the 100-day programme should be extended to 200 days. K.G. Baskaran, district secretary, CPI (M), participated.In Thoothukudi, the farmers, led by K.P.

58d7d1b0a3d24b75f2770120,"Now, rare mongoose hit by Polavaram dam",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/now-rare-mongoose-hit-by-polavaram-dam/articleshow/56267896.cms,2016-12-31,"HYDERABAD: Even as the ambitious Polavaram dam gained steam on Friday with AP chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu launching the concrete works, the fate of stripe-necked mongoose, discovered in the Papikonda hills earlier this year, hangs in balance. Papikonda forms part of the picturesque Eastern Ghats and a major portion of these hills will be submerged in the backwaters of the Polavaram dam across the Godavari.There are a number of plant and animal species endemic to the Papikonda hills and they will lose a major portion of their unique habitat once the dam is ready. The stripe-necked mongoose, which is a native of the Western Ghats and Sri Lanka, was discovered in Eastern Ghats earlier this year through camera trappings. This is the first time that this variety of mongoose has been found outside the Western Ghats. Wildlife enthusiasts fear that the stripe-necked mongoose will lose its new habitat even before zoologists could fully explore the animal. Incidentally, the animal was featured in the latest issue of the 'Journal of Threatened Taxa' published on December 26, the day AP government received Central funds for Polavaram.Research scholars, Kumpatla Balaji from the department of zoology in Andhra University , Visakhapatnam, and Jarugulla Eswar Satyanarayana, from the department of environmental sciences in Acharya Nagarjuna University , Guntur, have discovered the stripe-necked mongoose in the Papikonda hills. They not only obtained camera trappings but also sighted the animal in the Papikonda sanctuary. Though the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in its latest 'Red List' classified stripe-necked mongoose as ""least concern"", wildlife activists argue that the Polavaram dam will rob the animal of its new habitat.Besides the new variety of mongoose, Balaji and Satyanarayana also spotted rare animals including the Gaur, Indian spotted eagle and Indian peafowl. ""Local tribes Konda Reddy, Koya Dora and Valmiki call the stripe-necked mongoose 'Yentawa mungisa'. There was a historical sight-record from the Horsley Hills in the Eastern Ghats but hitherto dismissed as doubtful. There has been no records of the stripe-necked mongoose from the entire range of the Eastern Ghats. Hence, this is the first photographic evidence,"" they said.The researchers emphasized the need for a thorough research on the conservation status of the stripe-necked mongoose.The threat to the animal should be studied in detail before the dam is ready."
