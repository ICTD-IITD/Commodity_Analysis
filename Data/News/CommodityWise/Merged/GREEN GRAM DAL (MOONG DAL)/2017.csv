Sources said Subbaiah had borrowed `5 lakh from a private finance company by pledging his wifes gold ornaments to cultivate 50 acres of his agricultural land.He had raised maize on 30 acres, black gram on 10 acres and green gram and cholam on 5 acres each. The crops had died due to scanty rains and this sent him into a state of worry, sources said.His brother Rengasamy (50) said Subbaiah used to regularly visit his fields and had worriedly discussed the ways and means to repay the debts. I asked him to keep his cool and not to get vexed, he said.Meanwhile, Subbaiah woke up, complaining of chest pain, at about 2.30 am on Saturday. He lamented over the accruing debts even as he was having the pain, but managed to sleep after some time. Though his routine was to get up at 4.30 am, he did not wake up. Since he was lying without any sign of movement, his family members rushed him to a private hospital in Ettayapuram where he was declared brought dead."

Ramesh, district secretary of the party, who submitted a petition to Collector M. Ravikumar, said the Thoothukudi was facing acute shortage of even drinking water in the wake of monsoon failure and it should be declared drought-hit and the Centre recommended to allot adequate relief funds to protect the livelihood of farmers.The authorities should enforce a ban on drawing water from Tamiraparani river by industries and conserve the water to meet the basic needs of people on a priority basis. Steps should be taken by the government to prevent further incidents of suicide by farmers owing to crop loss and debt burden.Farmers of Kumareddiyapuram village in Ottapidaram taluk brought sheaves of withered crops to the Collectorate demanding drought relief. The farmers said that they lost maize, green gram and black gram raised on around 2,000 acres owing to monsoon failure and sought compensation of Rs.30,000 per acre."

Traders say the prices have dipped by at least 50 per cent, reaching their lowest rate in three years.The wholesale rates of toor daal (thuvaram parappu) and urad daal (ulatham parappu) started to dip around December 15, while the price of Bengal gram (kadalai parappu) began to plummet in the last four to five days, said C. Janarthanam, secretary of Vellore Navathaaniya Mandi Vyabarigal Sangam.Prices are dropping because its harvest time. In addition, traders are not keen on cash transactions due to demonetisation. Many do not want to purchase stock. Business has been dull as people are not purchasing, he said.He said that the last week of December saw the prices of toor daal and urad daal drop drastically. When compared to last year, the pulses are cheaper by 50 per cent, he stated.Toor daal that was being sold for Rs. 150 to Rs. 170 a kilo is now priced at Rs. 80 in the wholesale market. The top quality is available for Rs. 80 now, while the second quality is sold for Rs. 70. Similarly, urad daal that was priced at Rs. 160 is sold for Rs. 100 (top quality) and Rs. 90 (medium quality), he added.Bengal gram that earlier used to sell for Rs. 130-120 is now available at Rs. 100. The cost of green gram (payatham parappu) is the lowest. It was sold for up to Rs. 150 earlier. The rate has come down to Rs. 70 and Rs. 60 depending on the quality, Mr. Janarthanam said.He added that the Government of India was importing pulses and its import policy had an impact on the price position. Whether these prices will continue depends on the governments import policy. If they want the farmer to get the price for her produce, they will increase the import tax. This way, the prices will go up. We will have to see what the government decides, he explained.The approaching harvest season and demonetisation were the main reasons, traders say"

The trend that started after Onam is expected to continue until March if not for any unexpected natural event.Of the 23 items under the tubers and vegetables category in the ESD list, 17 have lower prices than previous January with some like carrot and tomato showing over 40 per cent dip. Exceptions are elephant foot yam, tapioca, colocasia, cucumber, banana and plantain which recorded 4-56 per cent hike in prices.While the milk price is stable, a dozen white leghorn eggs now cost Rs 1.40 less. V P Jayakumar, a vegetable trader in Chalai market and a former office-bearer of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said now there was a surplus supply of vegetables from Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, unlike previous years.Prices are down after Onam and the situation is likely to continue until March, he said.Cereal is one category that survived the downfall trend and firmed up. Except Chamba rice, all other rice varieties showed an upward trend, 7-18 per cent growth from previous January. Sugar too recorded a 23 per cent growth. According to Satheesh R N, Supplycos marketing manager, the new governments decision to sell 13 commodities at the same rate during its tenure has helped control the prices of major cereals and pulses.The 1,400-odd outlets of Supplyco help our consumerist state to control food prices. Commodities other than the 13 classified items are sold at prices 40-50 per cent less than the market rate. FMCGs are sold at 2-30 per cent discount, he added."

(File) Vanita (right) at her stall selling organic moong and flour. On the extreme left is her daughter and daughter-in-law. (Below) A woman entrepreneur displays her implements to fashion rolling pins. Express Photo Kavitha Iyer. (File)FOR SNEHA Devgirikar and women running the 59 other stalls at the Mann Deshi Mahila Festival for rural women entrepreneurs, demonetisation is no longer a hurdle. Ever since she took her first loan of Rs 12,000 from the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, nearly a decade ago, to launch her business selling homemade papads, Sneha has learnt to upgrade her skill set at every milestone. The Satara resident had in six or seven years learnt how to market her business, burnish her brand called Renuka Masalas, package her organic products so that they appeal to urban consumers and more.So, when Mann Deshi Foundation decided to move its annual festival, showcasing farm produce and rural women entrepreneurs products from Satara to Mumbai for the first time, Sneha and the others simply got acquainted with the mobile wallet technology and downloaded the apps necessary.In Prabhadevis Rabindra Natya Mandir, each one of the 60 stalls selling farm produce  ranging from bajra, jowar and millet to freshly-handcarved wooden rolling pins and homemade pickles  comes with a story not unlike Snehas. Every stall is run by a woman who has built assets by developing her potential as an entrepreneur and a leader. All these women are associated with the Mann Deshi Foundation, which is headquartered in Mhaswad, Satara, and had been active in the drought-hit district since 1996.Vanita Pise, 42, a resident of Mhaswad, never completed her Class X. Chaperoning her daughter and daughter-in-law at her stall where shes selling organic moong and flour, Vanita talks confidently about the drought, market fluctuations and the dipping demand that affects her multiple businesses. She further explains how a drought year hits farm economy and how she had tried to focus her business ideas on areas that are not water dependent.I had been in touch with the Mann Deshi Foundation since 2003, when I started small savings in a bachat gat. Through my association with the women at the foundation, I started a business making paper cups. I bought a machine and started making cups, working hard to make sure not to let loadshedding hours affect my output, she said. The idea of a paper cup-making machine came from the foundation as did the training in marketing and sales, but Vanita added to it her own chain of raw material suppliers and the buyers of her finished products, along the way employing women who she paid weekly. I also managed to give employment to one young girl, who was disabled, she added.Vanita is now a director of the board of the Mann Deshi Mahila Bank, and though she never completed her matriculation, she made sure her children get the best education she could afford. Even as she expanded her business to also make premium paper plates, she saw one daughter complete her MCA degree while the younger girl is studying to be a civil engineer.That sense of empowerment alongside willingness to work hard and beat the odds is common among all our women, says Vanita Shinde of the foundation. And so, at the exhibition is Sanjana Salunkhe, who grows sugarcane in a small three-acre patch of land. She cut the cane herself and had it loaded into a tempo to bring to the exhibition where shes selling freshly-crushed sugarcane juice in disposable tumblers.Also at the exhibition is Kantabai Salunkhe, one of the first women to have approached the founders in the mid-1990s, complaining that banks denied her a applications for loan because, at her daily savings rate of Rs 2 or Rs 3, she was just not an affordable customer for any nationalised bank.Chetna Sinha, 58, the founder of Mann Deshi Foundation, is thrilled at the success of their first attempt to bring their annual exhibition to Mumbai. Even though there are only 60 stalls here, compared to the much larger 200-plus stalls and exhibition grounds in Satara city, business is booming at each of these stalls. There is still work to be done and improved upon, she says. For one, access to credit for rural women remains an area that needs sustained research by banking institutions. Mann Deshi offers a model, but there is still so much to understand about a range of possibilities between microfinance and the Mudra loans for micro units.Theres one more thing Sinha believes is the need of the hour. More promotion and more recognition for men and families who really support women entrepreneurs, without that, this movement will find it difficult to move forward. The Mann Deshi exhibition by rural entrepreneurs concludes on Sunday at Ravindra Natya Mandir, Prabhadevi; 9.30 am to 8 pm)For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Rajalakshmi and Collector M. Karunakaran on Friday.The team visited Maanur, Kaanaarpatti, Vannikonenthal, Marukkaalankulam, Thirumalaapuram, Aayaalpatti, Thonukaal, Melaneelithanallur, Kurukkalpatti, Sankarankovil, Perunkottur, Perumpaththur, Karivalamvanthanallur and Panaiyoor during its whirlwind inspection organised on Friday.The farmers had cultivated black gram and green gram in most of these areas while farmers of Medina Nagar and Panaiyoor near Sankarankovil had cultivated maize. Since there was no rain during the northeast monsoon, there is no water in any of the waterbodies in this region, where groundwater table has fallen beyond 500 feet. So rain and our waterbodies have let us down. Consequently, all farmers have suffered huge loss though they had gone in for rainfed crop cultivation. The government should come to our rescue, said P. Velumayil, district president of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam.Farmers who had cultivated paddy in the district had suffered heavy loss, he said.The team, based on its findings, will submit its report to the government within a day or two so that the official machinery would take appropriate decision on declaring the district drought-hit."
58e4b88ea3d24b1c91edf035,Hope a failed harvest for farmers as cash runs dry,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hope-a-failed-harvest-for-farmers-as-cash-runs-dry/articleshow/56385254.cms,2017-01-07,"Sale of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides fell 40% post demonetisation 02:01More than 50 days after demonetisation , farming remains hit by the twin blow of a continuing cash crunch , which is making crop inputs such as fertilizers difficult to procure, and rockbottom prices of produce.TOI travelled across a 400km slice of south-western Uttar Pradesh flanking the Yamuna and found farmers simmering with anger at the damage caused by the move.Cash shortage had led to vegetable prices crashing, delayed wheat sowing and inadequate inputs for winter crops as well as a fall in wages.Among the more marginalised sections such as small farmers, brick kiln workers, small vendors, construction and casual labourers, the effects were magnified and severe.Post December 30  the cut-off date announced by the PM for a transition to better days  the situation doesn't appear to have changed much.Queues continue at many village banks, stoking worry among farmers for their winter crops. This ground reality appears to contradict the optimism expressed by the finance minister that increased sowing this year was an indicator of farmers' ""support"" for demonetisation.In Aligarh, Mathura and Agra, normal wheat sowing is done in the first fortnight of November. Because of the sudden note ban , it was delayed by 15-20 days, said farmers at Managarhi village in Mathura district. ""We used stored grain for sowing since there was no cash for buying. Other expenses are pending. Now the worry is, how to water this crop and arrange for fertilisers?"" said Raj Kumar, who has sown about five acres.The same worry haunts farmers in Etawah and Auraiya, although their normal sowing time is in the first week of December. Sadan Kumar from Ekghara village in Etawah has also used stored grain as seed and plans to use less fertilizer. Irrigation is a bigger concern because mostly pumps are used and this requires cash for diesel. For those who don't own a pumpset, buying water is a major expense at Rs 4,500 per acre, said Kundan Singh in Mathura.That the rabi crop is not getting required inputs of seeds, fertilisers and pesticides or fungicides is confirmed by traders. Sanjeev Yadav in Saifai and Ram Khilona Mishra in Bakewar are vendors of agri inputs. They told TOI that ""sales were down 30- 40%"" despite them offering some credit facilities.From Mathura in the west to Auraiya in central UP, growers of cauliflower, brinjal, potato, chillies, tomatoes, etc told TOI that vegetables sold for one fourth to one tenth of expected prices after note ban.""We have never seen such a time,"" said 80-year old Saudan Singh from Mitholi village in Mathura who sold his brinjal harvest for just 80p per kg and tomatoes for Rs 3 per kg in November.In Ankodia village in Etawah, Anoop Kumar said that cauliflower went for just Rs 5 per kg while potatoes dropped to Rs 2-3 per kg. While the kharif harvest of paddy and pulses like arhar was sold for lower prices in mandis, transactions were mostly done in the old notes till December end.As long as petrol pumps were allowed to accept the old notes, farmers would use payments from wholesale traders to buy diesel, said a trader in Etawah.But across the Chambal river near Etawah, in Bhind, MP, where the main crops are less water-requiring bajra, moong, urad and til, the mandi wears a haunted look as farmers are not selling their produce because they don't want to be paid in cheques. E-transactions are virtually absent.Says Akhtar Khan of Khanpur village in Auraiya, ""I haven't sown my four bighas. It is located near a forest area and requires a lot of care. Where will Iget the cash for all that?"""

Already, the State had witnessed flood damage owing to a recent cyclone which devastated the northern districts. All schemes executed by the late Chief Minister, Jayalalithaa, would continue. Equal importance was being given to protect wild life also, he pointed out.While presiding over the review meeting, Higher Education Secretary A. Karthik said 113 out of 130 village panchayats were affected in the district. The worst-affected were the horticulture and rainfed crops. The officials should visit rest of the villages and submit their full report within a day or two, he advised.Collector N. Venkatachalam said that paddy crop was raised in 2,761 acres out of total 14,707 acres of which 261 acres were affected. With no water for irrigation, hundreds of paddy growers did not raise the second crop and had left the land barren.A total of 20,271 acres of major rainfed crops including 8,063 acres of maize, 3,369 acres of sorghum, 1,238 of red gram (Toor), 4,014 acres of black gram 1,384 acres of green gram, 1,860 acres of horse gram and 7,000 acres of oil seeds and other crops, he added.Andipatti MLA Thangathamizh Selvan appealed to construct a dam across the Vaigai river and store the river water in 30 tanks to irrigate the dry crops in grey area of Andipatti block. Such a measure would improve the groundwater table also, he added.The Minister assured him to take the project to the notice of the government.Farmers at Veppampatti showed the damaged banana crops and briefed about the damage to standing crops. They said that loss per acre was around Rs.70,000. They appealed to the government to give compensation for crop loss quickly. With no livelihood activities, farm labourers had been struggling for survival, they added.The team had inspected S.S.

58f55abc7be9e01a17c97fda,Note ban: Trade slows to a trickle at MP mandi’s busiest time of year,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/note-ban-trade-slows-to-a-trickle-at-mp-mandis-busiest-time-of-year/articleshow/56431171.cms,2017-01-10,"BHIND (MP): An eerie calm welcomes you at the 'galla' (grain) mandi in Bhind town. The sprawling grain shed where farmers offload their produce is uncharacteristically clean, and absolutely empty. Around 90% of the wholesale grain shops that flank the market remain shuttered. Except for a lone truck being loaded at the far end, there's no sign of activity.It's noon on Tuesday, a normal working day at the mandi. But the deserted market seems to point to a new normal. A few grain merchants and transporters standing around a tea stall describe the situation in a single word: ""Notebandi"".""This is usually one of the busiest times at the mandi, when you wouldn't find enough space to place a foot. But demonetisation has reduced trade to a trickle,"" says Manoj Sharma, a grain trader.This is the time of the year, Sharma says, when farmers bring their bajra, oilseed, arhar and moong produce to the market. But this season, merchants are unable to pay them in cash and most farmers wouldn't accept cheques because getting cash from banks is still a big struggle, he adds.""A truckload of oilseeds goes for Rs 10-12 lakh, and bajra for around Rs 2 lakh. How will merchants raise that much money when the withdrawal limit for current accounts is Rs 50,000?"" asks Sachin Sharma , a transporter, adding that his three trucks have been sitting idle for days.The mandi normally handles around 1,000 bags of grain per day during this season, says Devendra Jain , another trader. ""But this time, we have been getting just 50 to 100 bags,"" he says. In Bhind district, only about a third of the sown area is irrigated. And, two-thirds of the irrigation is by deep dug wells, often going down to 350 feet.Hence, crops that consume less water, such as coarse grain, pulses and oilseeds, are grown. These crops can be stored for a relatively longer time. And that's what many farmers seem to be doing instead of selling the produce on credit or getting paid in cheques.The winding-down of trade at the mandi is affecting livelihoods all around. ""We have not got our salaries for the past five months,"" says Ashok Kumar Shakya , a clerk at the mandi office. He explained that the office staff is paid out of the corpus the market receives as commission on sales. ""As August to October are lean months, we usually get our arrears in November. But this year, demonetisation happened,"" he says. ""With trade still down, we don't know when our salaries will come through,"" Shakya adds."

Poet-saint Andal speaks of akkaraadisil in her Nachiyar Thirumozhi and of pongal in Thiruppavai.At a recent event titled Akkaraadisil and Andal at The Park hotel, guests were served akkaraadisil , venn pongal , samba dosai (a speciality of Azhagar Koil), Kancheepuram koil idli , chutney and yummy gothsu without onions or garlic, using only traditional ingredients, just like the recipes followed in temples.The old waysFood traveller Rakesh Raghunathan explained that the dishes had been prepared traditionally, on wood-based stoves.Historian and writer Pradeep Chakravarthy spoke of Andals Nachiyar Thirumozhi, and of her prayer to Sri Azhagar in Thirumaliruncholai, a hill temple near Madurai, in which she promised to offer him 100 thada s (thats equivalent to a pond) of butter and 100 thada s of sweet akkaraadisil if the deity united her with her Lord. The tale goes that she finally becomes one with her Lord but the promise remained unfulfilled. It was Saint Ramanuja who instituted a festival on the 27th day of Margazhi at the Azhagar temple, where butter and akkaraadisil are offered even today, he added.Though akkaraadisil is a tough dish to make, Mr. Raghunathan showed how to make a quick and easy version.Here is the recipe: Pressure cook one cup of rice and 1/4 cup of toasted moong dal together. Add a cup of water to three cups of powdered jaggery and strain it. Boil two cups of whole milk with three cups of water. Mix a whiff of nutmeg, the cooked rice and dal , the strained jaggery, cardamom, fried cashew nuts and raisins. Alongside, Mr. Raghunathan sang verses of Andals poetry as Mr. Chakravarthy explained their meaning."

In the last kharif season, nearly 65,000 farmers had availed Rs 64 crore loan while during rabi crop, only 19,960 farmers availed crop loan of Rs 36.78 crore.The farmers of the district have not shown interest in getting their crops covered under the scheme mainly due to official apathy and lack of farmers account in cooperative banks. The farmers hesitate to open the accounts in cooperative banks with a contention that their earlier agri-loan arrears will be deducted from the PMFBY amount. While the insurance amount differs for every crop, lack of information on the scheme is also one of the reasons for the failure of the scheme in the district. The insurance scheme covers only four crops, including green gram, black gram, groundnuts and potato. While potato is covered in Kujang block, groundnut has been declared as notified crop for Balikuda and Nuagaon blocks in the district.In January 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the new scheme to minimise the burden of premiums on farmers who take loans for their cultivation and safeguard them against inclement weather. There will be a uniform premium of only 2 percent to be paid by farmers for all kharif crops and 1.5 percent for all rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid will be only 5 percent.Lead Bank Manager Anil Pattnaik said not a single farmer has availed the crop insurance under the scheme from cooperative banks in the district while 50 farmers have insured their crops of `30 lakh for the rabi season through UCO Bank. Meanwhile, the disbursement of crop loan through cooperative banks and Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) has been affected due to demonetisation as it is a cash-based transaction.Farmers leader Bansidhar Mohanty said due to lack of awareness and Government apathy, the disbursement of crop loans to farmers through PACCS and cooperative banks has been affected. Collector Yamini Sarangi expressed displeasure over the status of crop loan during rabi season and said steps have been taken to ensure the benefits under PMFBY in the next kharif season."

Rich aroma of Aresalu is wafting into the streets. Bylanes are reverberating with the singing of Haridasus and kites of various desgins are soaring high in the sky.The enitre State is ready for the celebration of rich Telugu culture and traditions. It is Sankranti.Why it is celebrated?Makar Sankranti has a uniqueness to itself. Unlike other Hindu festivals which follow the lunar calendar, Makar Sankranti is probably among the very few festivals that is observed as per the solar calendar.This makes it the only festival to fall on a fixed date every year - January 14.The mode of celebrations has an agararian overtone and in Andhra Pradesh, being a major agrarian economy, it is arguably called the mother of all festivals. The harvest festival is celebrated for four days in Andhra Pradesh.Women playing kolatam during Sankranti celebrationsat A Convention Centre in Vijayawada on Friday | ExpressDay 1 - BhogiThe festival starts with the Bhogi, a day preceding Sankranti. People shed old and derelict things and welcome the new symbolising transformation.Before the day break, bonfires (Bhogi Mantalu) are lighted with logs of wood, other solid fuels and wooden furniture that are no longer in use.It stands for realisation, transformation and purification of the self by a change for the better.Day-2 Makar SankrantiOn Makar Sankranti, the second day of the festival, people wear new clothes, offer prayers to God, and make offerings of traditional food to ancestors who have died. Beautiful and ornate drawings and patterns are drawn on the ground with chalk or flour (Rangoli or Muggulu) in front of houses and these drawings are decorated with flowers, colours and small, hand-pressed piles of cow dung, called Gobbemmalu.Day-3 KanumaOn the third day, Kanuma is celebrated. Kanuma is very dear to the farmer community as it is the day on which they showcase their gratitude to cattle which are the symbolic indication of prosperity.The animals are given a bath and adorned with ornaments. Girls feed animals, birds and fish as a symbol of sharing.To ensure the happy gathering of the family members, any travel on this day is considered inappropriate.Day-4 MukkanumaThe fourth day is called Mukkanuma which is popular among the non-vegetarians. On this day, farmers offer prayers to the natural elements like soil, rain and fire for blessing them with good harvest. People in Coastal Andhra do not eat any meat (or fish) during the first three days of the festival and do so only on the day of Mukkanuma and the day following Mukkanuma call for celebrations with union of families, friends, relatives followed by fun activities, which include cockfights, bullock race and kite flying.The young damsels come together and put forward cute little dolls coupled with other things and narrate a scenario. Although this tradition of Bommala Koluvu is slowly fading, people of all ages love to see the display as friends and relatives are invited to have a look. In the olden days, local handicrafts like Kondapalli and Etikoppaka toys and dolls were showcased but now collection of handicrafts across the country are being displayed.HaridasusDressed in an attire unique to the art form, with an Akshaya Patra on the head, a Tambura, and Chidatalu, the Haridasu is the one who ushers in the festive spirit associated with Sankranti. Haridasu goes from house to house and ask for bhiksha. Haridasu says Krishnarpanam when he receives offerings from people.Lip-smacking delicaciesFor this festival, most of the families prepare Chakinalu, Nuvvula Appalu, Gare Appalu, Madugulu (Jantikalu), Bellam Appalu, Kudumulu, Ariselu and Dappalam (a dish made with pumpkin and other vegetables) to make an offering to God. The sweet delicacies include a sweet porridge like dish known as Chakkara Pongal which is made with rice, jaggery and mung lentils, flavoured with cardamoms and dry fruits. Symbolic of joy and festivity, Poornam Boorelu is the most popular sweet prepared in the homes of Andhrites.CockfightsCockfight is a tradition that has been followed by the people. It is a bloodsport between two roosters held in a ring called cockpit. It is the favourite sport of people living in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh.The fights are organised in sprawling fields with thousands watching. Three or four inch blades are attached to the cocks legs. Knockout fights to the death are widely practiced in the State.Different celebrations of Sankranti across IndiaIndia is known for Unity in Diversity and at the same time India is known as the Land of Festivals.

Even outside apartment complexes pumpkins with camphor on it could be seen at the entrances. Some people were scrambling for last- minute purchases of groundnuts and sugarcane.With sweet and spicy pongal in abundance, health conscious people avoided a lot of it. This is the third helping I have had in a span of two hours. The rice and moong dal preparations are high on carbs, and heavy on the tummy, said Darshan Kirani, a techie.While Bengalureans made the most of the festival in gated communities, some felt they missed the rustic charm of the festival that villages offer.It is in the rural areas that Sankranti can be best experienced in. Back in our village we would see farm animals being bathed and seasonal crops being worshipped. Cattle horns are painted and ribbons are tied around them. Thats where people should be to experience a harvest festival. Stacks of hay are set on fire and the livestock is run through it.

The BPL card holders are given sunflower oil instead of palm oil in Bengaluru and Mangaluru. Whatever subsidy was being given to palm oil will be provided to sunflower oil too and consumers have to pay the differential amount.Coupon systemKhader said that biometric coupon system for collecting food grains under PDS will be extended to all fair price shops by March 31. The system was introduced to bring in transparency in the distribution of food grains. At present, the coupons are generated at selected gram panchayats and selected franchise in the state, he said.He also said that the state government wants to convert fair price shops into a seva kendra related to ration cards including submission of applications, making corrections in ration cards and so on in the future.Online applicationsThe Food and Civil Supplies and Consumer Affairs department launched online registration for APL ration cards and has received good response in the last four days. The department has received 1,101 online applications seeking APL cards in Dakshina Kannada district. This includes 791 applications in Mangaluru taluk, 111 in Puttur taluk, 95 in Bantwal taluks. Out of 1,101 applications, 652 applicants have taken the temporary print out of the ration cards.Instead of producing multiple documents, Aadhaar card will be enough to apply for an APL ration card online.Stating that the government has taken several measures to make PDS attractive, Khader said Karnataka is the first state to bring ration cards under Sakaala scheme. With this, the applicant will have the right to know the status of application of the card and expect its delivery within the specified time.The applicants who have already filed an applications for BPL cards should visit the gram panchayat office and file the application at least once.The government has cleared a proposal to sell white kerosene oil in the open market to cater to the demand for the product. Anyone interested in selling the kerosene may approach the department for obtaining licence.Cash couponsThe minister said the department has been planning to bring in changes in its ration coupon system to make it convenient for consumers by issuing cash coupons instead of ration coupons. This could be used to purchase ration from designated retail stores apart from the usual fair price shops.However, it would be made only optional for the BPL card holders. The scheme is in initial stage and will be discussed with the chief minister before its implementation."

""But administrative work will continue, and we can give out notices to take back open spaces from private players,"" said additional municipal commissioner Sanjay Deshmukh, also in charge of civic gardens department.On January 15, 2015, Fadnavis stayed the open spaces policy after activists criticized it, claiming that it favoured political bigwigs. The CM also sought that the 216 plots adopted by private players be taken back immediately . These included Horniman Gardens at Fort, St Xaviers Ground in Parel maintained by Mumbai District Football Association headed by Yuva Sena chief Aaditya Thackeray , and Swatantra Veer Savarkar Udyan in Borivli and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Kridangan in Kandivli maintenan ce guided under BJP MP Gopal Shetty . But till date, the BMC has only taken back 140 plots.""It is clear that plots with a political backing have not been taken back,"" claimed activist Shailesh Gandhi, also former information commissioner with Central Information Commission. ""With the BMC bringing in an 11-month interim policy, it appears that third-party interests in open spaces will continue to be created. It would be a welcome move to see political parties in the upcoming polls assure their voters that no open space would be given out to private players,"" he added.Activist Ashok Ravat alleged, ""There is clearly a nexus between netas and the administration owing to which the BMC has been shying away from taking back all plots...For a corporation flushed with such a huge budget, it is important that it looks after all open spaces.""TIMES VIEW:With a humungous annual budget of Rs 37,052 crore, out of which Rs 312.2 crore was allocated in the year 2016-17 for gardens, the civic body has no reason not to maintain Mumbai's open spaces on its own. Activists have been right in saying that creating third-party interest in public open spaces could lead to such spaces getting usurped. It is unfortunate that a year after the CM's diktat, only 140 of the total 216 open spaces with private players have been taken back by the civic administration."
5923bd157be9e01fcef058dc,Artisans need govt help to survive,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/591985/artisans-need-govt-help-survive.html,2017-01-17,"Artisans need govt help to surviveSudhansu R Das, Jan 18, 2017 23:31 ISTThe state govt should provide raw material to artisans, who have no direct access to buyers and exporters.For centuries Indians knew how to prepare utility and decorative items from material available in nature. The Rigveda literature gives description of different kinds of patras (containers) and household items. Later, the artisans with their skill and imagination added high value to those items which constituted one of the major items of Indias export.Economic historian Angus Maddison in his book The World Economy  A millennial perspective noted that from first century AD to 15th century AD, India was the worlds largest economy with 32.9% share of worlds GDP. The East India Company used to buy Indian goods worth five lakh pounds every year before 1757 AD for export.It is not only the art objects the Indians knew, the technique of building climate friendly houses and knew organic farming techniques. In fact, Indian economy was an extension of eco-system which can be rewoven to generate employment and foreign currency.The brassware industry of Moradabad has an estimated annual turnover of Rs 8,000 crore out of which Rs 6,000 crore come from export. Indian gold sector employ 2.5 million artisans to export gold ornaments worth $20 billion per annum.The wooden toy makers of Nirmal in Adilabad district of Telangana add high value to idols of gods and goddesses, large sized horses, elephants, eagle and figures from the Indian mythologies. Only about 50 artisans survive to work for one handicraft production centre of the state government. Their income hardly exceeds Rs 300 per day after nine hours of hard labour.The artisans do not have direct access to buyers and exporters. Here the state government should provide raw material-poniki wood, transparent marketing facility and social security to the artisans. In 1960s, every house in Salem had a loom. Today, hardly 100 handloom weavers struggle to keep the tradition alive.The handloom tradition has declined due to poor cooperative leadership, corruption and mismanagement. The weavers were forced to pay commission at the time of buying yarns, receiving order and while receiving payment which is delayed for more than one year. The majority of the buyers cannot distinguish a pure Salem silk from a mill-made one. Salem may miss all its genuine handloom weavers in the next five years.Similarly, the Paithani silk saree weavers of Aurangabad are left with little enthusiasm. Some 10 to 20 senior weavers in the city work for traders on daily wage basis. Genuine Kashmiri carpet is losing to mill made carpets which are sold in the name of Kashmiri carpets. Here, the state government should create awareness among buyers about the genuine Kashmiri carpets which are worth gold.Senior artisans of Srinagar can make fine papier machie work. One can see the different shades of rose petals drawn on papier machie work with a magnifying glass. India has many craft traditions namely rose wood, coir, cane and mask of Kerala, dhokra craft of Odisha and Chhattisgarh, religious paintings of Odisha, Himachal Pradesh, AP and Bihar, wood craft of Bastar tribe, the warli paintings of Maharashtra, the bidri craft of Bidar, bangles and pearl work of Hyderabad, embroidery work of Gujarat, paintings of Rajasthan and hundreds of exotic crafts from different parts of India. India can have a big share of world artisans products which is estimated at $ 800 billion.Decorative itemsLike bio degradable utility and decorative items, Indians knew organic farming practices in the later Vedic period from 1000 BC to 600 BC. Organic farming is going to be the future agriculture. As per The World of Organic Agriculture: Statistics & Emerging Trends 2016, the global organic food market reached $80 billion in 2014 and is growing at 10% per annum, India can tap the ancient organic farming techniques which are still practiced in many places.Tribal in Malkangiri of Orissa grow organic turmeric, horse gram, green gram, tur daal, small rajma and mango jelly. Dedicated research on organic farming, district-wise bio diversity survey and documentation of the farming practices can evolve a well thought out national organic farm policy.Houses in India were also built to suit different climatic conditions. One can come across houses with roof made with tile, nim leaves, wood and clay were made to offset summer heat in Karimnagar district of Telangana. A simple mason from Kerala understands the geographical and climatic condition well. Houses with sloping roof of clay tiles, palm leaves, hard wood and timber used to fight harsh sun, heavy rain, the wet and humid condition in Kerala.Bamboo, cane, cane leaves, mud, and lime used for the building material in North East India were most suitable to the climatic condition of the region. There are houses made of wood with slanting roof of stone slates to fight rain and snow in Himachal Pradesh.One can come across a wide range of dress material which are made according to different climates of the country. Like the dress materials, Indians knew how to prepare the widest variety of nutritious homemade food in the world. How to tap Indias huge economic potential enshrined in Indian way of life is the biggest challenge before the Modi government."

A report prepared by the Department of Farmers Welfare and Cooperative shows Maharashtra has reported 18 lakh hectares of sowing as against 12 lakh hectares of last year.DEMONETISATION WOES may have eased out to quite an extent in the urban areas but its effect is still felt over the rural regions of the state. Cash crunch with the rural banks has resulted in just 24 per cent disbursal of Rabi crop loans till December end as against 31 per cent disbursal noticed last year. Rabi acreage in Maharashtra is significantly lower than Kharif but still is an important source of income for the farmers. In many parts of the state, a quick Rabi crop of moong is cultivated to replenish soil nutrients. Disbursal of Rabi crop loans starts in September and major chunk of the loans is disbursed by end of January.Figures from the State Level Bankers Committee (SLBC) showed that the target set for crop loan disbursal for the year 2016-17 was Rs 13,558 crore, of which Rs 3,277 crore has been disbursed till end of December. District Central Cooperative Banks (DCCB)s have just disbursed 11 per cent of their target while public sector banks had disbursed 28 per cent of their target. Private banks with their disbursal of 31 per cent loan was the best of the lot.Watch what else is making newsThis years disbursal stood much lower than the last years despite the fact that in 2015-16, the state was drought hit. The Rabi crop loan target for last year was Rs 12,074 crore and by December 2015, Rs 3,791 crores was distributed  31 per cent of the target. DCCBs had disbursed 18 per cent of their target while public sector and private banks had disbursed 38 per cent and 44 per cent respectively.Low disbursal of crop loans was a clear effect of demonetisation, said bankers. Rural banks both cooperative and commercial had complained of severe cash crunch even as urban centres were referred to by banks over them. With a highly-intensive cash dependent rural economy, less disbursal of loans would mean that this will have a direct impact on the agriculture sector.A report prepared by the Department of Farmers Welfare and Cooperative shows Maharashtra has reported 18 lakh hectares of sowing as against 12 lakh hectares of last year. Agriculture commodity export Deepak Chavan said sowing figures showed that the rural area has adopted an informal credit system which has sustained them. The dip in crop loan disbursal is in tandem with the cash crunch being faced by the rural banks, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

It shows that there has been an overall increase of 30% over the same period in 2015.Critically, the import of tur dal has risen by nearly three times from 2015 to 2016, which has ensured adequate supply of the variety in the market, thus helping to stabilise both wholesale and retail prices despite muted domestic production last year.The total importing of masur and moong dals was much lower in 2016 compared to the previous year, primarily because of a good domestic harvest and thus higher domestic stock. This also indicates imports are in line with the demand on ground.Statistics also reveal a significant jump in the import of yellow peas over 60%.According to IPGA officials, this increase is mainly because yellow peas are a cheaper yet equally nutritious substitute for more expensive varieties. ""If this trend continues, seasonal dal crisis may be a thing of the past as people seamlessly move to other dal options when one is in short supply,"" an official said.Wholesale traders said they don't foresee any demand-supply gaps this year.Kavish Dugad, a wholesaler operating in Market Yard, said, ""Not only are imports sizeable but the domestic crop too has almost doubled. We are also expecting more and a better crop of chana dal to hit the market soon.""Retailers estimate that the prices would fall further. P L Ojha of Shivaji Provision Store on Sus Road, said, ""Supply is more than sufficient in Market Yard, from where we buy our stock. Of course, as per the rule, we are buying at a little more than the minimum support price (MSP) to benefit farmers. Customers are happy and back to buying pulses in bulk. Prices of other commodities like poha and soyabean have also dropped significantly.""Customers like Aditi Mishra are elated. Mishra said, ""Monthly grocery expenses have now dropped significantly. While we did not really change our eating habits too much when the prices were sky-high, this respite in prices is welcome and gives us a margin to reorganize our expenditure."""

Last year, it was sold at Rs 170 per kg in wholesale and crossed even Rs 200 mark in retail.At grocery shop, it varies from Rs 65 to Rs 85 a kg, said Motiram Wadhwani , a wholesaler in at Hanumanganj grain market.Urad dal has gone down to Rs 75 to Rs 80 in wholesale market, which was sold at Rs 160 a kg. The price in retail market goes up from Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg depending on variety of the pulse. Similarly, price of masoor has also gone down from Rs 80 a kg at wholesaler to Rs 55 to Rs 60.Good harvest has led to decline in prices of major pulses, Wadhwani said. After unprecedented increase in tuar rate last year, farmers covered more area under cultivation of pulses.In Madhya Pradesh, pulses cultivation went up by 50% from 4 lakh hectares to 6 lakh hectares last year.Agriculture department sources said, ""Area of cultivation of long duration tuar went up as many farmers opted for tuar instead of soyabean.""""Many farmers preferred pulses like urad, moong and even maize over soya in last kharif season. A good output has resulted into decline in prices,"" sources said. In fact, price of most vegetables mellowed and have come down much these days.Vegetables, including potato, onions, tomatoes and all green vegetables are being sold at low price because of good production."

Tiwari, Under Secretary (Skills), Ministry of Rural Development, R. Alagesan, Director (Monitoring), Ministry of Water Resources and accompanied by Dakshinamurthy, Director of Agriculture and Collector M. Ravikumar inspected drought-hit fields at various locations in the district on Tuesday and assessed damages caused to crops in the wake of monsoon failure.Initially, the team took stock of the damage to blackgram on a field at Jegaveerapandiapuram in Ottapidaram Block. R. Radhakrishnan, a farmer, who had cultivated blackgram on nine acres at Jegaveerapandiapuram, informed the team that he suffered loss as crops did not raise owing to lack of rainfall. Mostly, farmers in the Ottapidaram Block were dependent on rainfed cultivation of crops. In 2015, yield from an acre about five to six quintals of crop following good rainfall, but it dwindled to just ten kilograms last year. Despite incurring an expenditure of about Rs.12,000 to Rs.15,000 per acre, he said he could not even earn enough to meet the expenditure. Hence, he sought the team to recommend to the government for providing compensation of Rs.15,000 per acre.R. Ragunathan, another farmer and Ottapidaram Union Secretary of Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, pressed the need for providing compensation to farmers for crop damage, as well as provision of insurance benefits at the earliest to ensure their survival.Subsequently, the team moved to Eppodhum Vendran and inspected the tank, which remained dry. Among the farmers present, P. Muthusamy said the former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had allocated funds to desilt the tank at Eppodhum Vendran, but owing to official apathy no such work was taken up so far.During the rains in 2015, large amount of surplus water from this tank was let waste thanks to poor maintennance. The team, which sought details of the total area of the tank and its silt deposits, asked the officials to accord priority to desilt it.The Director of Agriculture said while talking to reporters at Eppodhum Vendran that four teams comprising 10 members were involved in assessing drought-hit areas. After assessment, the teams would compile the report and forward it to the government, he said.At Mela Eral, Krishnamurthy, a farmer said green gram and maize were totally affected due to drought and pleaded for compensation. Ponnusamy, another farmer, said he had no money to repay the loans he had obtained from cooperative society due to crop loss. Since there was no other source of income to repay the loans he sought more time for repayment.After inspecting Sinthalakarai, Ariyanayagipuram and Surangudi, the team assured the farmers of all help to extend adequate compensation. Joint Director of Agriculture P. Vanniarajan and Assistant Directors of various blocks also accompanied the team."

Initially, the transplantation process had slowed down in the district due to severe cold, which affected the growth of the seedlings.As per reports, paddy seedlings have been transplanted in 4,687 hectares of land till January 27 against the target of 14,635 hectares for the current rabi season. Generally, paddy transplantation picks up from the first week of January during rabi season. But, stunted growth of the seedlings led farmers to put the transplantation on hold and wait for the sapling to attain the right size. However, the transplantation has gained momentum from the third week of January after the seedlings gained right growth.Umesh Mishra, a farmer of Satupali village under Dhankauda block, said, The severe cold badly affected the growth of paddy seedlings.

Yadav, who was subsequently brought to his battalions headquarters in Rajouri, had alleged that the poor quality food, including watery dal without tadka and burnt chapatis, was a result of pilferage of supplies by senior officers. The outrage generated by the viral video ensured it was probed by a court of inquiry headed by a deputy inspector general (DIG) of the paramilitary.The inquiry looked into the supply of items such as cumin, garlic, ginger and onion, which are required for tadka.Sources said that cumin was not available for two to three days at the base but by the time Yadav put out his selfie videos, the vital tadka ingredient had reached the base. High-altitude posts are supplied with dehydrated onions but even these were not available at Yadavs position then. Garlic and ginger are not supplied to the base at all.Apart from dal, there were other food items on the menu but Yadav didnt complain about them, said an official source privy to the preliminary findings. BSF spokesperson Shubhendu Bhardwaj said that the inquiry report is expected in the next few days. The inquiry is always instituted to look into an incident. It is not against an individual. In this case, Yadav alleged non-availability of tadka dal and so it was necessary to look into it, he said.Yadav had used his sons Facebook account to circulate the videos on January 7-8. The court of inquiry, said sources, checked the menu on those days. It was found that jawans were served chapati, cooked vegetables, pickle and coffee for breakfast. For lunch, they got rice, chapati, fruits and moong dal, and for dinner they were served fish, moong dal, chapatti, rice and vegetables.Read | Soldiers can tell their problems directly to army chief through WhatsApp messageThe menu keeps changing. On some days, jawans get parantha for breakfast and rajma-rice for lunch. In fact, other food items available to jawans are visible in the selfie video posted by Yadav, said a source. Yadav had applied for voluntary retirement from the force, which had been accepted a few days before he posted the videos. He was to serve with the force till January 31 this year but due to the court of inquiry, his request for voluntary retirement has been denied for now.Sources familiar with the findings of the court of inquiry said Yadavs allegations of pilferage are not supported by other jawans posted at the same base. The inquiry report would also establish whether Yadav breached discipline and violated the Official Secrets Act by revealing the base structure in his videos."

Turn to Ayurveda,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/feb/04/want-beautiful-skin-turn-to-ayurveda-1566673.html,2017-02-04,"HYDERABAD: Beauty isnt skin deep, it goes much deeper. Skin being the most absorbent organ of the body, requires special care. With the environment already unleashing high level of toxins on our health, its time to be alert about not just our lifestyle, what we eat, drink and even breathe, but also what we apply on your body. This is where Ayurveda come to your rescue. Unlike beauty regimens, Ayurveda is ideal for all skin types.In conversation with Hyderabad Express, Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush, reveals why it is time to throw those bottles and tubes of creams and packs, and head to the kitchen and fridge instead.We often witness college-goers wrap their faces in dupattas to keep away the pollution but it still gets to them. Suggest some skin care routine.Wash face with lukewarm water mixed with 1tsp honey and 1 tsp lemon juice twice a day (in the morning and as soon as you reach home). Massage face and neck with oil which helps in enhancing complexion like Chemparathyadi Coconut oil (based with hibiscus) and Nalpamaradi Coconut oil (Based on Nalpamara viz., Ficus family and Turmeric). These medicines are available in all Ayurvedic pharmacies. If you are used to drinking milk, boil garlic (3 gms, peeled, washed and crushed) in 1 cup of milk, filter and take it internally at bed time. Alternatives are: honey (1 tsp) mixed with 1 glass of lemon water or carrot juice mixed with orange juice. This regular routine will help clear the pores of the face and keep the skin fresh.Models and creative artistes put on a lot of makeup viz., toner, primer, foundation etc. What kind of Ayurvedic products can one use to protect skin from an onslaught of such cosmetics?Generally synthetic ingredients cannot give any textural enhancement, and some of them are even harmful to the skin if used over long periods. It is better to protect the skin on a daily basis by mild face massage with Nalpamaradi Coconut oil/ Nisoushiradi tailam/ Eladi Coconut oil and face steam with tulsi (Basil leaves) water. Doing this on a regular basis shall help to open the clogged pores and remove the impurities thereby preventing harm to skin. Later cleanse the face with any vegetable pulp (e.g., cucumber/ tomato Pulp) or fruits like orange pulp/ fresh black grapes pulp. Then wash your face with fresh lukewarm water and put face mask with fine coriander powder with coconut milk and honey. Regular maintenance with above said facial care shall help maintain the skin texture and tone.Suggest a few tips on combating the pollutants in the city traffic.To protect from the pollutants in the traffic, it is better to scrub the face with a handful of incha (bark of the climber Acacia intsia, traditionally used for bathing after Ayurveda oil massage) which is available in all Ayurveda stores. Then wash with lukewarm water and gently massage with pure coconut oil and face steam with lemon water (cut the lemon into pieces and boil in water). Then massage the face, neck, shoulder with a paste of green gram boiled in milk and honey. Along with this, hydrate face with cooked rice water. Apply, face pack with carrot, tomato pulp.Suggest some personal care across the day using five or six proven Ayurvedic tips.The best method of personal care is using regular oil bath. This routine can be done at home or at an Ayurveda centre. Oil like pure coconut oil/ sesame oil can be used. An Ayurveda doctor will be able to select a suitable oil based on your body nature and general constitution.Exercise and Yoga enables one to improve inhalation of more oxygen and thereby purifies the body. This aids cell repair (hair follicle included) and activates metabolism.Early to bed, early to rise and early morning bowel evacuation is important for healthy body and skin.Regular eye wash and application of medicated collyrium (anjana) is important to maintain eye health.Regular foot massage during bed time after cleaning feet is advisable which helps to relax the nerves of body and ensures good sleep. It also helps to protect the eyes.Wholesome food habitsProactive in performing regular, designated and rightful duties towards oneselfand for the nation.Does loose hair touching cheeks cause any harm to the skin? If yes, then what can be doneabout it?Hair is of elastic nature. Continuous rubbing can scar the skin thereby reducing the softness of cheeks. Apply a cream made by swirlingbutter in turmeric (Kastoorimanjal) and honey on cheeks.What do you think are fiveessentials that every youngster in a polluted city must consume everyday to maintain good health and clear skin?Avoid Constipation. Hydrate the body tissues by regularly drinking adequate water.Accelerate the skin peeling process by having regular bath after body massage with oil.Regeneration of body cells is essential which can be enhanced by regular intake of amalaki, ghee, honey and milk.Staple food specific to the region should be consumed. Eat seasonal fruits and vegetablesAyurveda advises to take green gram soup and horse gram soup which help in maintaining the minerals, vitamins and protein required for the body. Green gram soup recipe: Soak a handful of green gram dhal overnight. Pressure cook the same until it is well cooked. Strain it and season the juice with pure ghee and salt to taste.Dr GG Gangadharan, Director Ramaiah Indic Specialty Ayurveda, Ayurvedic advisor, Lever Ayush"

Jayalalithaa, the camp was introduced first in 2003 and was not held only from 2006 to 2011, during the DMKregime.Should the proposal sent now be cleared, the camp may commence on February 9. At a cost of a little over Rs. 90 lakh, arrangements have been completed on a sprawling six acres of land along the banks of the river Bhavani at Thekkampatti near Mettuppalayam in foothills of the Nilgiris. The campsite is ready to host about 30 elephants from various temples and mutts in Tamil Nadu. There will also be two guests from Puducherry  the elephants from the Manakula Vinayakar and the Thirunallaru temples.The ninth such camp is also the fifth organised at Thekkampatti in Mettuppalayam (the first four camps were held at Theppakadu in Mudumalai). Considering the tiring uphill journey for elephants, who travel all the way from various temples across the State, the venue was shifted to the more scenic Thekkampatti.Plus-size facilitiesArrangements include a massive kitchen for the jumbos, another for the mahouts and cavadis (who also undergo rejuvenation and receive medical aid), and a kilometre-long walking track for the jumbos depending on their gender, age and weight, they walk for a minimum of one round and a maximum of three rounds. The resting sheds and toilets for mahouts are already in place. Considering the new terrain, and in a bid to prevent elephants getting from entering the river, showers large enough to accommodate three elephants at a go have been put up.Three-tier security arrangements to prevent wild elephants from entering the campsite include a hanging solar power fence, a barbed-wire fence, and the closure of unauthorised entry points with barricades and tin sheets. The campsite is also fortified with five watchtowers manned by binocular-wielding security personnel.Though the State maintains a list of nearly 50 elephants belonging to various temples and mutts, only 32 attended the camp last year. Old and ailing elephants, and those that refuse to board trucks, have been exempted for the last three years. Similarly, the Forest Departments elephants will enjoy their 48-day rejuvenation at their respective camps in Top Slip near Pollachi, Theppakkadu in Mudumalai in the Nilgiris, and at Chadivayal in Coimbatore.Collaborative hospitalityThe Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Board has already deputed 40 staff in three teams, besides 25 personnel from the Forest Department, to protect the visiting elephants. The State animal husbandry department has deployed veterinarians and their assistants.Upon their arrival, the jumbos will have their health checked . A diet and exercise chart will be prepared, with their healthful diet to include rice, ragi, horse gram, green gram, jaggery, plantains and fresh green fodder. Medicinal supplements such as chyavanprash, ashtachoornam, vitamins, minerals and bio-boosters are also prescribed.Visitors may stop by to see the elephants from 8.30 a.m. to 12 noon and again from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m., but from a distance, in the area earmarked for them, official sources said."

They submitted a memorandum, addressed to the President, at the deputy commissioner's office in Dharwad on Wednesday.The protesters took out a rally before staging a sit-in protest in front of the deputy commissioner's office. They stated that the government and insurance companies have been indifferent to their problems, making the life of farmers miserable.Due to drought in the kharif and rabi seasons, Navalgund taluk recorded 100% crop loss and all the investments made by farmers were wasted, the memorandum said. Insurance companies have not paid compensation in a scientific manner, the memorandum said. Uniform crop compensation pattern has caused more loss to genuine crop losers, the protesters said.A large number of crops were damaged due to floods in Bennihall and the government is yet to release the compensation despite conducting a survey.Some farmers, who managed to grow green gram and onion, were in for a tough time when there was a drastic dip in their prices. After repeated appeals, the government announced a minimum support price for green gram and onion.However, there is an inordinate delay in releasing the amount to the farmers.Even after two months of purchase of the produce, there is still no information from the government on the release of money, the protesters said.They also demanded withdrawal of cases against the farmers booked for protest in Navalgund."

The uniqueness of our cuisine is that we use 100-year-old recipes originally tried and tested by our mothers and mothers-in-law (smiles). Marwaris also experiment with new recipes, picking them up from the places we live in.The first dish I learnt from my mother-in-law was plain khakhra (thin wheat-based crackers) and when I tried, there was too much salt (laughs). A couple of years ago, my nephew tasted my theplas and asked me if I wanted to start a business selling my food to people. He convinced me and today, I am the Chief Chef at Gulabs, a hand-crafted snack manufacturing start-up.Romani AgarwalMarwari food is unique because of the seasonal ingredients and spices we buy from Rajasthan. In winter, we eat a lot of millet and warm, heavy dishes such as bhajre ki roti, bhajre ka dahliya (cracked millet) and gehu ki kheer (wheat porridge). This is to keep us warm on winter nights.We also use a lot of seasonal fruits. During mango season, we make a sweet mango pickle and mango gunda pickle. Mostly I use wheat because, that is the base for rotis and khakhras.Im not a great fan of fusion. When I decide to cook a particular dish, I stick to its speciality. For instance, while making a South Indian dish, I use podis and masala powders.Mogar ki roti, methi theplas, matar ka pulao, tava poori along with dal chawal or rasam chawal are my home meals speciality.During Diwali, we make this special dessert called laapsi with ghee and nuts; for Holi, its meetha chawal (sweet rice), and for Raksha Bhandan, its seviya kheer.Having been cooking for so many years, it took time for me to master moongadi khakhra (khakhras made with yellow split lentils). Yes, cooking has evolved itself over the years, but we are also getting back to our traditional recipes, ingredients and methods of cooking, which are more healthy. My fondest memories of cooking have to do with seeing my family and friends satisfied with what I serve them."
593bc25c7be9e04db645dfd1,On the Waugh path: Fascinating parallels between India’s fiery skipper Virat Kohli and the original Iceman,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/on-the-waugh-path-fascinating-parallels-between-indias-fiery-skipper-virat-kohli-and-the-original-iceman-4532137/,2017-02-18,"While Kohli is not yet a Waugh when it comes to his charisma or aura, he, like Waugh, has drilled in a sense of aggression and ruthlessness and cohesion. While Kohli is not yet a Waugh when it comes to his charisma or aura, he, like Waugh, has drilled in a sense of aggression and ruthlessness and cohesion.From the window of his hotel room in Sydney, Sadagopan Ramesh could see the distant explosion of the streaming flames, inking the sky in plumes of pink and purple, ushering in the new millennium. If they stretched their necks, they could spot the sails of the unreally illuminated Opera House. But inside the hotel room, he felt restively hollow. The series sewn up, they were dead-horses waiting to be flogged. Ramesh, twitching and turning on his bedspread but careful not to hurt his right thumb, felt a cold sweat slivering through his body. His mind was constantly revisiting the fiendish bouncer that fractured his thumb. He came to bat the morning after the blow, on the last day of the Boxing Day Test, but the pain was so excruciating that he retired hurt after the first over. He had injections and pain-killers and stoically willed himself to bat the next morning. But he simply couldnt.While the physical pain of the blow subsided, the psychological torture of it only accentuated in time. The sight of Lee, his flock of blonde hair bouncing in the breeze, or in the whizzing fury of his run-up, and the wicked bouncer recurred in his minds scape. Often, batsmen remember the balls that hurt them than those that nailed them. Its something of a mental clutch.Back home, the fallacies of his technique were dissected and exaggerated. Even in Ranji matches, some muck-as-any fast bowler would barrage him with bouncers. He would disdain them to the fence with alacritous felicity. But the shadow of Lee and that vicious bouncer still lingered, like a distasteful smell of the past. He was promptly shunned, and even though he did make a comeback, his international career folded in unfulfilled.Then Ramesh was just another of the countless, now faceless, youngsters who left the rough Tasman shores with a heavy heart and heavier brunt of defeat. For touring cricketers, it was a sporting death row, or a crucible from which only few emerged unburnt. From his own colleagues, only four returned for the next tour, another four never played Test cricket again. His skipper, Sachin Tendulkar, was to shun captaincy for good. Kapil Dev, never ventured into the business of to coaching. There were few plausible excuses for a series where they showed neither fight nor guts.Only Tendulkar tallied 40-plus and VVS Laxman 30-plus. Among bowlers, only Ajit Agarakar had a respectable aggregate of 31. It seemed, the rest had just turned up. But Australia, then, was a different beast. At that point, Steve Waughs men had yet to be likened to Bradmans Invincibles or christened the Untouchablesthe India whitewash was their ninth successive win. There were hushed whispers, but the hype was just building up.***The Channel Nine feed for the 1990-2000 series was unusually grey, or was it really? The greyness of the frames, though, was in sync with the mood. But when Tendulkars men were touching new depths, a restless West Delhi boy would, groggy-eyed, was hooked to his idol on telly. He, like most, would switch off the television when his idol got out. He like, many, would have felt the angst of his idol perishing to umpiring howlers.Virat Kohli and Steve Smith will go head-to-head in the upcoming India vs Australia series.But it was not just his idol that left an impression on the 11-year-old. There was something so appealing, or even admirable, about the adversaries led by a tiny-eyed man who hardly winked or smiled. He batted, if needed bowled, fielded and even led his side as if in a trance. The painted faces, the volleys of advice (abuse), the prototypically Australian will to win, left an edifying impression on the young fellas mind.Maybe, thats where Kohlis captaincy ideals were loosely formed, at least subconsciously. The template was set deep. And when his chance arrived to lead his country, he has led them with the same set of ideals his young mind had soaked in while watching that gloomy feed of Channel Nine. Or so it seems. Dare we liken Kohlis India with Waughs Australia? It sounds nigh blasphemousa stronger case shall be put forth if Kohli can replicate a similar streak of success overseas. But we are only suggesting, or even imagining, that Kohlis India is like Waughs Untouchables.There, though, are irrepressible threads that compel comparison. Lets begin with their immediate predecessors. Mark Taylor became Australias captain, because he was the best captain. The vagaries of his fluctuating form were balanced out by his tactical whizthe master of bluff as he is so famously deigned. So with MS Dhoni, who was captain, because he was the best captain around; not because he was the best batsman. But Waugh became the captain because he was the best batsman just as Kohli was. After 23 matches, their record is beguilingly similar. While Kohli won 15 and lost only two, Waugh too has the exact number of triumphs but a defeat more. At home, both were yet to taste a Test defeatWaugh, in fact, never lost a Test series at home. Let alone being defeated, both sides have looked remotely beatable at home.The margin of victories paints a clearer picture of their infallibility at home. Under Kohli, Indias lowest margin for victory in India has been 108 runs, the only time they chased a target, they did so with eight wickets in hand. Half a dozen of those wins were by a handsome margin of 200 runs or in excess (twice by 300 runs), and twice were England inflicted innings defeats. Thats domination.Just as Waughs was at a similar stage. India were thumped by 285 runs, 180 runs and by an innings an 141 runs. Before them, Pakistan were beaten by 10 wickets, four wickets (the closest they ever came to defeat) and by an innings and 20 runs. Later, West Indies were inflicted a brace of innings defeats and a humungous 352-run thrashing.Soon upon assuming reins from Taylor, Waugh encouraged his batsmen to race along at a minimum of four runs an over. Most of them, readily took on that challenge. Even the others were forced to change their tack, like Justin Langer. Ditto for Kohli, unless the situation warranted attrition or caution. To draw another refrain, Kohlis Langer is perhaps Pujara, whose batting has a newfound enterprise. Thus while Waugh became the most successful Australian skipper at breathtaking speed, Kohli is galloping to the helm himselfhe is already the third most successful Indian skipper.Virat Kohli is on an exemplary run scoring form at the moment. Virat Kohli is on an exemplary run scoring form at the moment.The loudest appraisal of the invincibility of Waughs side came from the toughest of his adversaries, Brian Lara, after they were steamrollered 5-0. There is something remarkable about this team, and about the way Steve has led and inspired them. At this moment, they look unbeatable, he said.Almost kindred in spirit was Waughs observation on Kohli. Virat Kohlis leadership is also very contagious. The Indian players feel positive and they feel they can do anything. It seems that the new Team India can achieve anything, he added.While Kohli is not yet a Waugh when it comes to his charisma or aura (and by the way Kohli hasnt published a single tour diary, while Waugh wrote as many as nine without a ghostwriter), he like Waugh has drilled in a sense of aggression and ruthlessness and cohesion. Also like Waugh, he has moulded a set of personnel who could put a fist through the wall for their skipper.There was a favourite anecdote of Richie Benaud on how Ricky Ponting, Waughs successor, won the trust of his teammates. In the selection meeting for the 2003 World Cup, Ponting wouldnt get up from the selection table until Symonds was picked. Finally, the selectors relented. Then arrived the moment for Symonds reciprocation. Australia were reeling at 90 for 4 in Johannesburg, with Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis in their ethereal zen. Ponting then told Symonds, I want you to listen to me, because Im going to ask you to do something for me. I want you to be here at the end. Symonds nodded his head and rattled off an unbeaten 143. You can expect any of Kohlis colleagues to do it for him too.***Bhoot gaya toh palit aaya, admits Irfan Pathan. While both his tours to Australia were memorable, the first in which he issued a memo of his potential to the world and in the second which restored his merits, there was a hint of admiration than contempt for Australias batsmen, as any bowler who had toured Australia at the peak of their powers would say. Dangerous batsman gaya toh doosra aaya. Australia se match ke time pe bahut jyada mehnat karni padti thi because they kept a benchmark, he adds.Pathans words ring true for the present Indian team as well. Just as a wet-behind-the-ears Pathan was overwhelmed by the ritual proficiency of Australias colossus of batsmen, a retinue of bowlers who had toured India of late would vouch for the combined and personal prowess of Indias new-age batting galacticos. You dislodge KL Rahul and Murali Vijay early, you still have Cheteshwar Pujara to weather the storm, then the mightiest of them all, the skipper himself, who when he bats seems to be obliged with a perpetual mission to raise the bar of his batsmanship. Then if youve, somehow contrived to see their backs, you still have to chalk up measures to whittle out Ajinkya Rahane and a more than canny lower-order. Perhaps, India lacks the ingenuity of Adam Gilchrist at No 6, but England bowlers will fully attest to the faculty of Indias lower-order batsmen, who then take turns to harass them with the ball.Virat Kohli trusts his instincts and his teammates strongly on the field as has been seen by his review decisions. (Source: AP) Virat Kohli trusts his instincts and his teammates strongly on the field as has been seen by his review decisions. (Source: AP)The Australians didnt necessarily need any undue instigation to go hard at their opponents. They seemed to be entirely driven by the killjoy to see their adversaries writhe and bleed in mental and physical agony. If you are bowling 140 plus they will come down the track to you. They will do whatever they can to demoralise the opponents. This is what the Indian team is doing now, they are demoralising teams, points out Pathan. Like Ramesh a decade and a half ago. Ask Ben Duckett or Ross Taylor.Like great teams, they instil into the opposition an inferiority complex, sometimes even before they land. This aspect, more than skill, distinguishes this Indian team from the predecessors. While the best Indian teams of the past had a tinge of romancewhich ascribed to a tendency to not always squeeze the pulp out of their opponents, even if the situation beggared toKohlis batch is perhaps the most pragmatic Indian team ever. Hence, the absolute lack of heightened drama when they win matches. Its a de rigueur.They are not bereft of cracksas was Waughs great side which couldnt brag about a quality all-rounder (whether they needed one is a different debate)but they are obscenely useful at papering over their weaknesses. And at no point would they ever concede an impression that they have a weakness. Man for man, barring Kohli or Ravichandran Ashwin in this form, none of them are automatic entrants to an all-time Indian XI, or even a 21st century Indian XI. But they have, at least, numerically shaded their predecessors. Even on a philosophical plane, for you cant recall any India side that has flaunted such schadenfreude, or cockiness. If Pathan felt playing in Australia was like going to a war, playing India in India is now akin to a war. A war that encompasses within it a variety of battlesof skill, words, and wits.***Steve Smith was unusually low-key in his first press conference upon landing India. Maybe, unlike most of his predecessors, he is mild-mannered by nature. Or perennial cynics of Australians as we are, we might conjecture that he had deliberately embraced a meek, almost self-depreciating self. Whatever the reasons be, missing was the famed Aussie braggadocio, which is not just atypical, but antithetical to the very outback spirit of the Aussies. It nonetheless left a void, rendering the series a little blase, and stripping it off some lively pre-series verbal kitsch and false-intrigue. Even more surprisingperhaps reflective of the phase Australian cricket is treading now was his response to the very obvious question of stopping Kohli. We are trying to form a game plan, he mumbles. Verbs like try and hope wouldnt have tumbled out of their lips.Maybe, its a consciously conceived ploy to not talk big. After all, it could gloriously backfire. A likelier case is that they have plainly resigned to the reality (the present and impending), which shows they have been pottered around by a Sri Lankan side in transitional shambles, then harangued by an AB de Villiers-less South Africa, and a Test later Steyn-less South Africa.Virat Kohlis sheer will to win has also rubbed off on his teammates. (Source: PTI) Virat Kohlis sheer will to win has also rubbed off on his teammates. (Source: PTI)The chastening at the hands of Sri Lanka was more morale-battering. It was their third successive series whitewash in the subcontinent, and at the end of the series, which had begun promisingly with them skittling out the hosts for 117 in Kandy, Smith was a wind-beaten man. He could just lament, Its a hard one to really grasp.It isnt hard to grasp for neutral eyes. Australias grim reaper was spintheir batsmens inability to negotiate spin on turners and their bowlers inability to prise out wickets. Its an age-old conundrum for visiting teams in the subcontinent. The touring sides that had triumphed in the subcontinent had all exemplary spinners as well as players of spin. Australia of 2004 had Damien Martyn, Michael Clarke and Matthew Hayden, England of 2012 had Kevin Pietersen, Ian Bell, and Alastair Cook. And Australian batsmen, even of recent vintage, were masters in masking their weaknesses. They will make you feel that they can tackle anything be it spin or slow wickets. Such has been Australian teams that they will never show the struggle, points out Pathan.The present group, as Harbhajan Singh says, doesnt inspire dread. You look at Shane Warne, there isnt a bowler half as good as him, there is no bowler half good as McGrath or Gillespie. Their batting order just doesnt match with Langer, Hayden, Ponting, Martyn, Steve Waugh and Gilchrist. They are a different lot, he says.Maybe Steve Smith, like Allan Border in the dynamics-shifting Ashes of 1989, would catalyse a sudden, unprecedented shift in fortune. The resurgence, cricket historians claim, began with a needling sledge. I am prepared to be as ruthless as it takes to stuff you, Border apparently told David Gower before the first Test at Headingley. Australians, then distant odds to reclaim the Ashes, won it back 4-0 with a fledgling side.Smith looks too likeable to repeat a similarly loaded line to Kohli. He looks as tetchy as Tendulkar in that forgetful series at the turn of the century. Its tempting to foretell a Tendulkar-like calamitous narrative awaiting Smiththe skipper waging lone battles, his callow support cast tied in notional knots, the bowlers reaping frugal fruits of labour. Throw in a couple of umpiring howlers (which DRS would punctually nullify), and the series will have a 1999-2000 feel about it. A mirror reflection, in fact.(With inputs from Devendra Pandey)For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The stock came down to nine. During this time, he observed that the soil had turned hard due to the use of chemical fertilizers. He switched to natural farming and, after 2000, started collecting varieties that he had lost  and the ones which were not in his possession from other parts.Many varieties grown elsewhere in the country can also grow in Dakshina Kannada, says Mr. Parameshwar Rao.Pointing to a Manipuri variety, he says the grain is light blue in colour.A doctor gave him a Thailand variety called Jasmine, he says. The JB 1 variety, from which tasty kadubu is made, is no longer available.

A recently published study on water quality of the lake has revealed surprising figures which clearly indicate that the lakes water quality is still close to that of drinking water. Experts say that one of the reasons behind this is the protection that the lake has received over the years in the form of Government Order (GO 111) which has been implemented in bits and pieces.The figures of water quality parameters revealed by the study, and a comparison of these figures with those of Hussain Sagar water, gives another reason as to why the GO 111 needs to stay rather than be repealed.During the study conducted by VNR Vignana Jyothi Institute of Engineering and Technology over a span of a year, water samples were collected from different locations of the lake in winter, summer and rainy seasons. The samples were then analysed for various physicochemical and biological parameters including Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Solids and Phosphates.While some parameters were found to be slightly above the drinking water quality standards prescribed by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) and Central Pollution Control Board(CPCB), others are much lower than the maximum permissible limit.Sample this: As per CPCB, BOD should be 2 milligrams per liter (mg/l) or less for drinking water. The value in Himayath Sagar was recorded at 3mg/l in whereas that in Hussain Sagar and Musi river goes up to 20mg/l and 80mg/l respectively. Similarly, Total Solids should be absent as per BIS. It was recorded at 3.4mg/l in Himayat Sagar and a humungous 1,000mg/l in Hussain Sagar and Musi.Protection ensured good quality of waterDr MVSS Giridhar of Centre for Water Resources, JNTU-Hyderabad said: Though Osman Sagar and Himayath Sagar have been polluted over the years, the amount of pollution has been low due to the lakes being protected under GO 111. This makes it necessary to ensure that the lakes stay protected.Dr Giridhar added, One argument being made is that Hyderabad is no more dependent on Himayath Sagar or Osman Sagar for drinking water as we are getting Krishna and Godavari water. It should be kept in mind that climate change is a reality. Drought year or floods due to sudden downpour can strike anytime. The lakes will play essential role in both situations, for providing drinking water and controlling the floods."

Ordinarily, Cauvery delta farmers are given special packages of assistance for the short-term Kuruvai and the long term Samba crops, whereas dry land farmers have remained largely out of sight of the authorities.At present, there is only one scheme  rain-fed area development programme  that provides some assistance to these farmers on piece meal basis.But, it is for the first time, the government has come out with a scheme to help the dry land farmers in a systematic way, an official says.Even though the Government Order, sanctioning the scheme, talks of appropriate cropping system in the proposed dry lands, the officials say the plan is to encourage the farmers to raise pulses, oil seeds, minor millets and cotton.However, the farmers themselves, aided by block-level teams of officials and scientists from the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, will decide the suitability of crops.As for the exact number of farmers to be covered, the officials say an enumeration exercise is underway, only after which a clear picture will emerge. Approximately, the tally may be in the range of 12 lakh to 15 lakh.Promotion for pulsesMeanwhile, the government has issued another order, approving a special package of Rs. 50 crore for the cultivation of pulses over 24,000 hectares in 17 districts.This has been done to provide the scope for income to farmers in the present context of drought, the officials point out, adding that the pulses, especially black gram (urad dhal) and green gram (moong dhal); fetch generally Rs. 40,000 to Rs. 50,000 per acre.Moreover, these two grams are of short duration which goes on for 60 days. Apart from providing Rs. 2,000 per acre, the authorities will distribute portable sprinklers and rain guns. While 19 per cent of farmers in each block should be from Scheduled Castes and one per cent from Scheduled Tribes, at least 33 per cent of the overall beneficiaries should belong to small and marginal farmers and 30 per cent to women."

""The failure of the Delhi Police to act against ABVP goondas who unleashed unprovoked violence at Ramjas College on February 22 has clearly encouraged such heinous threats,"" said Captain Amarinder.He warned that failure to crack down on ABVP would encourage more anti-social elements to take law in their hands.Lauding Gurmehar's courage in launching a social media campaign against the ABVP, Amarinder said instead of allowing her to be victimized for her stand, the authorities, including Delhi and central governments, should ensure that the perpetrators of the Ramjas College violence and the subsequent threats to the martyr's daughter are given exemplary punishment for vitiating the DU campus atmosphere.In the wake of the Ramjas College incident, Gurmehar had changed her Facebook profile picture holding a placard which read: ""I am a student from Delhi University. I am not afraid of ABVP. I am not alone. Every student of India is with me. #StudentsAgainstABVP."" The reported ABVP threat came even as her profile picture went viral and evoked humungous response on the social media."

Anju Chaba Agnihotri Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba AgnihotriCrop diversification and moving away from the entrenched paddy-wheat cycle has been the buzzword among Punjabs policymakers for at least two decades now. It will remain so even when the next government takes over in a couple of weeks time. But on the ground, farmers are still planting paddy during kharif and wheat in the rabi season as before. Some have gone in for diversification, but not the way policymakers, both in the state government and the Centre, would want them to. Theres no better example of this diversification dilemma than spring season maize; and it should be an eye-opener for future policymaking.Spring maize is currently being grown in about 30,000 hectares of Punjab, especially in the Doaba region covering Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts that also constitutes the states potato belt. It is planted from mid-February to mid-March, just after harvesting of potato. Spring maizes popularity is precisely because it fits well into the potato cycle. A 95-110 day crop, it is harvested by June, well in time for planting of basmati/non-basmati paddy or even kharif maize. The latter crops are harvested in October, which is also potato planting time.The above cropping cycle, however, is not viewed favourably by the authorities, who feel it doesnt address the more fundamental problem of depleting water tables in the state. The Punjab government wants farmers to grow maize only in the kharif reason to replace water-guzzling paddy. We arent keen to promote spring season maize, as it also consumes too much water, says Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director of the state agriculture department.A senior scientist at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana, too, seconds this view: Temperatures start rising after March and hit 35-45 degrees Celsius level by May-June alongside sunshine duration of 9-9.5 hours. This necessitates frequent watering of the standing maize crop. As an alternative, the government is encouraging farmers to grow spring/summer moong (green gram), mah/urad (black gram), sunflower, vegetables (cucumber, brinjal, capsicum, gourds, beans, etc) and green fodder  which can all be planted in February.But there are no takers for this logic amongst farmers. Why should we grow maize during the kharif season when its yields are not even 25 quintals per acre? We get 36-39 quintals or more from spring maize hybrids. And with rates of Rs 1,000-1,500 per quintal, the returns are more than even from wheat, taking 24-25 quintal/acre yield, minimum support price of Rs 1,625/quintal and 145-day crop duration, points out Jagat Prakash Gill, secretary of the Potato Seed Growers Association who cultivates spring maize of 70 out of his 100 acres land at Thammanwal village in Jalandhars Phillaur tehsil.We prefer spring maize since it is high-yielding, has shorter duration and there is good demand in the market from poultry and animal feed makers. If the government wants us to grow kharif maize, why are PAU and others not developing hybrids that yield close to what we get from the spring-planted crop? Alternatively, why dont they breed spring maize hybrids requiring less water? asks Gurraj Singh. This farmer, who cultivates spring maize on 20 out of his 25-acre holding in Jugral village of Jalandhar tehsil, also points to the Indian Institute of Maize Research, which is being shifted from Delhi to Ladhowal, not far from Phillaur: What are the people there doing to help us?This disconnect between policymakers objectives and farmers preferences has meant that the market for spring maize hybrid seeds is today controlled by private firms. The most popular hybrids in Punjab include DKC 9108 and 9120 of Monsanto and Dupont-Pioneers P1844, P1855 and 31Y45. The biggest grouse of farmers has to do with their prices, which are totally unregulated. Till a couple of years ago, these branded seeds were being sold to farmers at Rs 150-200 per kg. This season, their rates were in the Rs 525-550 per kg range. At 8 kg seeds per acre, it translates into a cost of Rs 4,200-4,400.The distributors/dealers of the seed companies promised us a rate of Rs 1,300-1,400 per bag of 4 kg in early-January. But when sowing began, we ended up paying Rs 2,100-2,200, which was above even the maximum retail price mentioned in the bags. After much hue and cry, they reduced the rates to Rs 1,600-1,700. But by then, much of the seeds had already been sold, complains Arvinder Singh, a 50-acre farmer from Sofi Pind village of Jalandhar who grows spring maize on 40 acres. He further alleges that the dealers did not even provide bills or invoices against their sales.When asked about these seemingly anti-competitive pricing practices, the spokesperson of one of the multinational firms told The Indian Express that we made the seeds available to the dealers at Rs 1,525-1,550 per bag and there was no shortage of material supplied from our end. He, however, admitted that we have no control on our distributors. Equally interesting is the response of the government, which has chosen to be a mute spectator, conveniently citing that it is committed to regulate prices and supply of only kharif season maize seeds. Its another matter that farmers arent interested in growing kharif maize. As a result, they are left with no choice but to deal with private sector monopolies and unscrupulous dealers who have exploited the demand for seeds to jack up prices. The government wants us to grow pulses and sunflower. But we have seen the way moong prices have collapsed within the last one year. For maize, there is at least a market and no lack of buyers, notes Jagat Prakash Gill.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Marginalized farmers are busy gathering their harvest but lack of support to sell the strawberries beyond the local market is creasing their brows.The local market is their only conduit of sale and so the farmers feel they could focus on by-products like jams and jellies for bigger gains. But there is no infrastructure to support refrigeration, processing and marketing of the fruits.For close to five years, varieties like 'Sweet Charlie' and 'Festival' have been the toast of Karbi Anglong. ""We are in talks with representatives from the Karbi Autonomous Council and bureaucrats in Dispur so that the farmers can get infrastructure support,"" said Jiten Saranphanso of the Karbi Anglong Ginger Growers' Cooperative Federation Ltd (GINFED), and the owner of an orchard. The process of transportation of the fruits from the fields to the market needs refrigeration, storage, preservation and marketing support, he said.""To make the best use of the leftover fruits, a processing plant has to be in place,"" he added.The fruit as of now is being cultivated in the Diphu subdivision and Manja. Over 50 farmers are engaged in the cultivation in Karbi Anglong with each farmer growing the fruit in half bigha plots.Kurusar Timung and PP Hanse were the pioneers to take up strawberry cultivation. Later, GINFED started imparting training to the farmers in the art of strawberry cultivation. GINFED now has a team of especially trained strawberry farmers.Saranphanso, himself planted 900 saplings last November on a plot of two bighas. The rich soil of Karbi Anglong is excellent for growing the Sweet Charlie variety. ""We need transportation facilities as strawberries are perishable items and require proper maintenance during transportation,"" added Saranphanso.A kilo of strawberries is sold between Rs 500-800. The involvement of GINFED and the agriculture department has ensured farmers from limited economic backgrounds are able to sell their produce directly to the consumers."

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd.

She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion.

They are run by his nephews or brother. Srivastava's opponents Saurabh Srivastava, from BJP , and Rizwan Ahmad from BSP , had gone to these outlets.""Just like every petha is called Panchhi Petha in Agra, here every lassi comes from one or the other Pehalwan shop,"" says Brijesh. With BHU's intelligentsia around the corner, mahants of temples, and sharp divide on caste including thakurs, dalits, nishads (boatmen) and theosophical socie ties, the Banaras town survives on its endless political talks and gastronomical highs. None of that is complete without a food trail in Varanasi.Be it refreshing paan morsel, zesty kachauri bite, piquant tomato and moong namkeen chaat, sweet langlata (flour recipe) or some bhaang, campaigning is not complete without a halt at the famous local shops that serve these delights. According to political scientists, Vara nasi's food and its purveyors have seamlessly dictated the political campaigns and subsequent victories since 1950.""We have seen three definite periods of feasts and fares since 1952. The first period from 1952 to 1980 belonged to paan and bhaang when Congressman Kamlapati Tripathi, a Brahmin and SP's Raj Narain chewed paans endlessly in their campaigns and served bhaang on Holi or meetings before elections. From 1980 to 2014, there was kachauri and jalebi as then visiting Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was served these dishes in plenty during her campaigns. Of course, 2014 set a trend for tea as Narendrabhai Modi arrived and his campaign was built on that,"" says Koushal Kumar Mishra, professor in political science, who specialises in modern Indian political systems.""And, 2017 has brought chaat and lassi to the fore,"" he quips, as he himself bites into his favourite meetha paan."

590472217be9e04154df6e70,Any expectations of a turnaround in the performance of Air India is misplaced,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/any-expectations-of-a-turnaround-in-the-performance-of-air-india-is-misplaced/,2017-03-08,"The news report that the government is working on setting up a special purpose vehicle to transfer the large debt burden of Air India and provide it with a stronger balance sheet to facilitate a faster turnaround makes one apprehensive. The airlines performance has spiraled down in the last two decades with its markets share in the domestic segment shrunk to a bare 14.1% by the start of 2017, which is less than half 39.8% share of Indigo airlines the market leader. Numbers for the end of the year shows that Air Indias share of the international travel was at an even lower 10.5% despite tens of thousands of crores spent on the airline to make it more viable.And things are likely to even worsen for Air India as the private carriers have a better and larger fleet and much more grandiose plans for the coming years. Most recent numbers show that the average age of the Air India fleet of aircraft is 9.0%. In contrast the average age of the fleet of market leader Indigo was only 5 years. Not only is Air Indias fleet size much older its plans for fleet expansion is also limited.Thus while Indigo airlines is expected to add 59 new aircraft over the next three years Go airlines and Jet airlines are expected to add 63 and 55 airlines respectively to their fleet over the next five years. In contrast Air India is expecting arrival of 49 aircraft over the next two years from orders placed many years back. But there is no way it can raise the funds unless its balance sheets are wiped clean.Where will Air India find the resources to buy new aircraft? The value of its fixed assets in March 2016 was Rs 46,075 crore whereas its outstanding loans have shot up to Rs 46,570 crore by the end of the year. But this is happening even after the government is spending tens of thousands of crore on this huge white elephant.In fact an earlier financial restructuring plan worked out to turn around the airlines in 2012 set apart fresh budgetary support of Rs 30,231 crore over a ten year period that is by 2021. This was to be used for infusion of equity, meeting cash deficits, guarantying aircraft loans and repayment of Air India debts. And the government has already spent Rs 23,993 of this package by the end of the last year.But despite all the spending there is hardly anything to show. Though the losses have declined marginally the numbers continue to be too large. Thus net losses were Rs 6,280 crore in 2013-14, Rs 5,860 crore in 2014-15 and Rs 3,836 crore in 2015-16. In fact the total accumulated losses of Air India stood at a humungous Rs 41,380 crore by March 2016.The only thing that Air India has to show for these huge efforts was the emergence of a small marginal operating of Rs 105 crore in 2015-16, most of which would be on account of the lower oil prices. In contrast the operating profits of Indigo Rs 2,502 crore in the year. Though claims are being made of a further improvement in operating profits in the current year, it is likely that the gains have been dented by the rise in oil prices in recent months.In fact the data even shows that the number of domestic route that are making losses for Air India has gone up from 22 in 2013-14 to 31 by 2015-16 even while the number of loss making routes in the international sector has come down from 32 to 5, probably by cutting down operations. And pressure on margins of Air India is going to rise with oil prices going up further and the more efficient private airlines adding to their fleet.Such a dismal scenario after massive injection of funds only serves to highlight the futility of such efforts."

590471917be9e04154df6d86,Delhi government has done the right thing by focusing its budget on things it can do best,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/delhi-government-has-done-the-right-thing-by-focusing-its-budget-on-things-it-can-do-best/,2017-03-09,"The Delhi government, which has been hobbled by the central government moves that has centralized power over the administration in the lieutenant governor, has done well to focus its 2017-18 budget on segments where it has greater control. Consequently it has focused on improving social and physical infrastructure with education and health alone getting more than a third of the government spending.Of the total budget expenditure of Rs 48,000 crore in 2017-18 as much as Rs 17,036 crore going to health and education. While education gets the lion share of Rs 11,300 which is almost a quarter of the budget, health gets Rs 5,736 which is one eight of the total budget. The other major outgo on the social spending is social welfare which gets Rs 3,467 crore or 7%.On the physical infrastructure side the highest allocation is for transport which gets a tenth of the budget with an allocation of Rs 5,506 crore. Urban development is another big gainer with its allocation Rs 3,113 crore. Water supply and sanitation also get an allocation of Rs 2,108 crore. The Delhi government has also raised the total financial support for local bodies by a larger proportion to Rs 7,571 crore which is about 15% of the state budget.In the education sector the focus is on better use of available infrastructure. While just two dozen new schools are to be started the number of new classrooms to be added is a humungous 10,000. This is over and above the 8,000 classrooms built in the current year. Preprimary school facilities are also to be scaled up with 156 such facilities in government schools. Five schools of excellence with English medium education are also to be set up.Midday meal range is also to be expanded by adding fruit and eggs to the menu and to classes up to 12 in all girls schools. An amount of Rs 180 crore has been set aside for purchase of computers. Amenities to teachers are also to be improved by providing them with computer tablets, workstations, lockers and vending machines for beverages.On the higher education side new campuses to be added to Ambedkar University is expected to raise intake capacity from 2,100 to 10,000 students. Similarly the intake of the Delhi Technological University is to be raised to 12,000. Other prominent scale ups planned includes expansion of student intake of Netaji Subhash University of Technology from 4,000 to 10,000 and that of GB Pant Engineering College from 3,000 to 7,000.On the health side also the focus is on getting services down to the people. The government hopes that 150 Mohalla clinics, which offers free diagnostics services and essential drugs, will be up and operational in the current year and that the numbers would be raised by another 1,000 in the 2017-18. The number of Poly Clinics, which also provides similar services, is to be raised from 23 to 150.The best part however is that the number of hospital beds will be enhanced doubled to 20,000 in the next 18 months. Similarly another 7 new hospitals are to be set up with 5000 beds which will raise the number of beds to 25,000. The innovations on the health side will include a health card to provide insurance to all citizens and collaboration with 41 private sector hospitals to provide 30 critical surgeries. Another major move is the steps to make Delhi open defecation free. The government has already built 8,000 toilets and another 6,000 are to be completed by June 2017. And another 5,000 will be constructed in 2017-18. The plan is to then put up 19,000 new toilets in the city.However, the government is still slow on improving public transport. The number of new buses to be added is just 736 which falls far short of the thousands needed. The 10,000 new auto permits to be granted are a poor alternate to mass transportation systems. The other major move has been to reduce the vat rate on Air Turbine Fuel from 25% to 1% for flights to far flung regions under the regional connectivity scheme.The best thing of the budget is that the Delhi government has been able to fund all these schemes even while not raising taxes for the third consecutive year."

Well, I found out with my visit to My Fortune, Bengaluru this week.Their Anglo - Indian food festival features dishes from the yesteryears of the Bangalore Cantonment. The menu introduces one to the tastes that emerged from the combining of the British and Indian palate.The menu includes dishes such as Canteen Macchi, Platform Potatoes Madras Club Quoorma, Railway Lamb Curry and Mutton Koftas alongside an Zafrani Chicken Pilaf or Chickpea Pilaf served with raita.The festival is currently ongoing and will last until March 14. The festival menu is available for lunch and dinner at My Indian Oven.Dhal Churchuree is green moong dal and topped with ghee. It is thick in consistency, is smooth and flavourful.Platform Potatoes is a dry preparation of spiced fried potatoes and has dry mint in it. I love potatoes, so I had no complaints with this one, especially with the vegetable taking the centre stage with this one. The dish also has bites of jeera, so for all sukhi bhaaji fans, this one is a must.The Baluchi Kabhuli Pulav is a chickpea pilaf, served with raita. The rice is flavourful with spices, however none of the masalas or the spices overpower the other. I truly enjoyed this pulav.A special mention to the chefs dal makhani. Hands down, the best one I have had ever. The dish isnt part of the food festival menu, but I had heard good things about this dal and I couldnt help myself from ordering one. The daal makhani is buttery smooth, laced with malai, thick in conistency and tastes purely of daal and is full of flavour. If you are at My Fortune, Bengaluru; you have got to order this dal.Nargisi Kofta is a preparation od mutton mince coated boiled egg kofta served in a sweet gravy. The outer coating of boiled eggs tastes like sausage.Canteen Machhi reminds one of Bengali preparation of fish curry because of its heavy mustard flavour and prominent use of turmeric. The boneless fish is cooked well.If you happen to order dessert from the a la carte, then do ask for beetroot halwa and rasmalai served with ice cream. The halwa is smooth, with just the right amount of sweetening and served hot with shredded badam toppings.The rasmalai and ice cream combination is sure to win your heart."

Kadai and tandoori paneer, ajwain parathas, phirni, paan gulkand, flavoured lassis and aam panna are some favourites,"" explained Monisha Gupta, also from Vashi.For Gupta, the religious sentiment is as important as the food.

Lack of government purchases and regular imports from overseas has dampened prices of pulses.Most pulses are trading below the MSP in the wholesale market but not much of the benefit has been passed on to consumers as retailers are not passing on costs of benefits, leading industry participants said.They said that farmers are suffering huge losses due to poor remuneration.A senior official from the agriculture department said, ""The government has started purchasing pulses from farmers at the MSP at few centres. We will gradually increase the purchasing centres.""Industry players said the government is not purchasing much and the process of procurement is also very slow.They estimated that production of pulses in the country rose by close to 220 lakh tonnes this season as against 170 lakh tonnes a year ago leading to oversupply in the market.Madhya Pradesh is the leading producer of pulses in the country with a share of 35-40 per cent in the total country's production. Indore is a major trading centre for pulses.Suresh Agrawal, president, MP Dal Mill Association (Indore) said, ""Farmers are suffering huge losses this season as they are forced to sell their produce at about Rs 1,000 below the MSP. Pulses are trading below MSP in the market and they are forced to sell at the available prices.""He said that tur is trading at Rs 4,300 per quintal and moong at Rs 4,500 per quintal in the wholesale markets as against the MSP of Rs 5,050 and Rs 5,150 respectively.Agarwal said most of the farmers in the region do not have the capacity to horde their produce due to which they have to sell at whatever prices are available in the market.Industry participants said that farmers are not even able to sell their produce in neighboring states due to stock limit that restricts the buying of traders.They apprehend farmers may reduce their sowing area for pulses next season due to weak prices this season."

Picture by Gautam Dey Ranchi, March 11: Unseasonal rains and western disturbances coupled with local phenomenon resulting in thunderstorms and squalls in some isolated places in Jharkhand are being seen as a boon by agricultural experts in the state. According to Birsa Agriculture University's (BAU) agro-meteorological division scientist A. Wadud, the current phenomenon will help the soil retain its moisture and assist crops in the upcoming rabi season. ""This same condition with a few spells of drizzle and light rain is expected to continue for the next couple of days. This will be highly beneficial for crops, but if it turns into heavy rains, accompanied with hail and thunderstorm, it can have an adverse impact,"" he said. ""Heavy rains will wash away the seeds of wheat, fruits and other allied crops sown in this season. However, moderate rains will be beneficial for a state such as Jharkhand where irrigation facilities are still not up to the mark. There are few standing crops such as wheat and mustard at the moment and harvesting of green peas is yet to happen,"" he added. A BAU advisory for March 8-12 has asked farmers to postpone the harvesting of any rabi crops and store the harvested crops in a safe place. ""Farmers may utilise this rain to sow green gram (moong) and vegetables and spray urea over crops. Inter-culture operations should be done to preserve the moisture for a longer duration,"" it stated. Wadud said those looking to cultivate green gram, may use the rain to prepare their fields for sowing. R.P. Singh 'Ratan', director extension education of BAU, said they had not received any report of excessive rains in Jharkhand from any district. ""The most important thing is that the developments have created a favourable condition for vegetable crops. Rainfall that has happened is isolated pockets will be good for the soil,"" he said. According to the Ranchi Met office, a cyclonic circulation in the upper air over north Chhattisgarh and its neighbouring areas have weakened. ""While there is a possibility of rain with thunderstorms in isolated pockets of the state, especially in the northern region after late Saturday afternoon, there is no such possibility on Sunday,"" a Met official said. He said a trough from northwest Rajasthan to southwest Madhya Pradesh and a cyclonic circulation in the upper air over the eastern parts of Bihar and sub-Himalayan Bengal are being closely watched."
58f5881e7be9e01a17c9bcfb,"Services a mess, but BMC sits on Rs 61,510 crore cash pile",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/bmc-sits-on-rs-61510cr-cash-stash-yet-services-a-mess/articleshow/57639930.cms,2017-03-15,"MUMBAI: Hold your breath, Mumbaikars, it can now finally be revealed. Your municipal corporation, known more for its inept and poor service delivery, and largely responsible for the city's decrepit condition, is sitting on a cash pile currently worth an eye-popping Rs 61,510 crore.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has parked this humungous stash in fixed deposits in 31 banks (including four private ones) as of January 31, 2017. The annual interest itself works out to over Rs 4,500 crore, given the average interest rate of 7.41%.If the civic administration were to equally distribute this amount among the 12 million people living under its jurisdiction, each resident will receive Rs 51,250.TOI has ferreted out this data from the municipal finance department to give a perspective about the BMC's phenomenal wealth at a time when civic services have deteriorated and civic infrastructure i s crumbling due to inefficiency and corruption. This is also why political parties are so desperate to control the cash-rich corporation.According to the finance department figures, the largest single deposit of Rs 8,581 crore is in one bank alone (Corporation Bank). It largely prefers PSU banks, but puts smaller amounts of Rs 300 crore-Rs 500cr in private banks. ""Every day we invite quotations from banks. The bank which offers the best interest rate gets the money,"" said a municipal accountant, adding the fixed deposits are for periods of 12 months to 15 months.Of the total deposits of Rs 61,510 crore, the provident fund and pension fund of municipal employees aggregates Rs 10,455 crore. A surplus fund of Rs 10,927 crore also constitutes the total deposits. The civic special funds form the largest chunk of Rs 34,258 crore. The BMC's biggest cash flow comes from octroi collection -- around Rs 12 crore a day.""Is the BMC an investor financing banks or a service provider?"" a highly-placed civic official wondered, alluding to the shoddy services India's richest municipal corporation provides to its residents.The politicians who rule the BMC are always keen on revenue expenditure, which allows them to shower largesse by way of recruitments and operational costs, said officials. ""The corporation has become like an employment guarantee scheme for many. It's a culture of entitlement and little commitment to improving delivery systems,"" they said.Take for instance, the city's roads. In the past three years, the BMC has spent Rs 9,000 crore to repair, resurface and cement concrete roads. Civic sources said 80% of this is shoddy, inferior quality work because of unscrupulous road contractors who are hand-in-glove with civic engineers and contractors. Last year, over two dozen municipal engineers and contractors were arrested following a police probe into the multi-crore road repair scam. A BMC inquiry exposed how contractors tasked with building superior cement concrete roads had dug barely 25cm to 30cm deep when they were stipulated to dig up to 85 cm. For mastic roads, the requirement was to dig only up to 12 cm. ""But records showed that on paper they were digging as much as 80 cm to get more money,"" said a civic official.Unfortunately, big money does not translate into better planning or accountability towards citizens. For a city that aspires to be on the global map, the sheer incompetence of the civic administration is dragging it down. ""It is political and administrative failure,"" admitted a senior official, not wishing to be identified.As an example, Mumbai disgracefully discharges a humungous 2,700 million litres of untreated sewage waste into the sea every day because the BMC has no modern sewage treatment plants. This has messed up the city's coastline and its marine environment. At present, only roughly 600 million litres of sewage is treated daily. It is only recently that the BMC decided to set up six sewage treatment plants for tertiary treatment of sewage at a cost of Rs 10,000 crore at six different locations in the city.For garbage disposal, Mumbai still depends on landfills, an outdated concept which is dangerous for sub soil and public health. The world over, cities now scientifically treat waste.Other big-ticket civic projects funded by the BMC include the coastal road (Rs 14,000 crore), Goregaon-Mulund Link Road (Rs 1,300 crore), and converting waste into energy at Deonar dumping ground (Rs 1,000 crore)."

Market sources said this takes the wholesale rates of tur dal at Rs 70 a kg as against Rs 65 two weeks ago.However, much change is not expected in the coming days, said traders. Tur dal is available at Rs 75-78 per kg in retail stores.Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Grains and Seeds Merchants Association, said rates of pulses across the board are down this year. ""For example, moong dal rates have come down to Rs 55 a kg, it's Rs 75 to 90 a kg for udad dal, with most of other varieties available below Rs 100 a kg in the bulk market,"" Motwani said.Sources in the retail market said moong dal is available for Rs 72 to 76 a kg, while the price of udad dal is Rs100 and Rs 78 a kg of chana (chickpea).Market sources said the rates are down because of sharp increase in production as well as huge stocking by the government. The government is buying tur from overseas markets in large quantities which has created a huge buffer stock of the commodity.However, this has put farmers at a loss as they have to settle at a price even below the MSP, said an importer of pulses in the city."

Seeds of black gram, green gram, and cowpea were sown in 30 hectares at the Payyanalloore and Pallickal padasekharams earlier this week.The paddy fields, known as Virippu and Mundakan padams, belong to the midland areas of Onattukara, a fertile region of central Kerala, where farmers follow a peculiar pattern of farming different from that of low-lying puncha fields of Kuttanad. The area has a tradition of raising multiple crops such as sesame, pulses, and sugarcane, but the practice had waned owing to poor support to farming over the years.Around 50 farmers have come together to take up farming of pulses with the help of the Krishi Bhavan and the local panchayat. Paddy farms at Onattukara depend on irrigation in the absence of rain.This year, irrigation through canals was grossly inadequate. Lack of rain added to the woes of farmers who had to abandon the crop. Investment worth thousands of rupees had gone in vain, Omana Vijayan, Palamel panchayat president, told The Hindu .The next paddy crop season will begin in September. Pulses, which do not need much water, are being raised as an interim crop, says Krishi Officer Siji Susan George. Cultivation of pulses will make sense as 2016 has been celebrated as International Year of Pulses, she adds.The Krishi Bhavan has helped the farmers in setting up a marketing facility. We have weekly markets on Tuesdays and Fridays. About 150 weekly markets have already been organised since it began during the Onam season in 2015. An eco-shop for sale of organic produce is also doing well, she says.The panchayat has agreed to extend support to the farming of pulses to help farmers recoup the money lost in paddy cultivation. A fund of Rs. 3.75 lakh has been set apart for farm initiatives, a portion of which could be utilised for the pulses project. The panchayat has readied two large ponds in the area and arrangements are being made to pump water to irrigate the crop."

(Source: PTI) Ravindra Jadejas five-wicket haul was the highlight of the day for India. (Source: PTI)In a way, Ravindra Jadeja is the mirror image of Ravichandran Ashwin. Almost everything Ashwin does with the ball is memorable for some reason or the other. However, this home season has featured an organic evolution in Jadejas bowling  not aesthetically  but in terms of skill and thought. You talk about Ashwins weapons of teasethe loop, the drift, the turn, the differently-named variations, the would-be variationsthe penchant for scripting records. Jadeja, in contrast, was seen as repetitive images of the ball landing at the same place, over and over again, a counterbalance to Ashwin. On Friday, Jadejas relentless accuracy was the decisive difference between Australia ending up with 451 runs and not posting a humungous 550-plus total that would have taken out the possibility of an Indian victory.Jadejas bowling isnt one-dimensional but the soul of his craft is accuracy and precision. Of late, he has added the skill of ripping the ball more  his slow (er) deliveries have more bite as a result and dont just float, and given him confidence to toss it more often and enhancing his potency on all kinds of surfaces.On Friday, that relentlessly-practised craft was the most valuable craft.And that possibly was the reason he was stand-in Rahanes most trusted weapon of the day .The priority, when Jadeja came onto bowl in the morning, was stifling runs. Both Umesh Yadav and Ishant Sharma seemed a touch rusty, while Glenn Maxwell and Steven Smith looked completely untroubled. In no time, Jadeja vindicated his skippers convictions. He reeled out four successive maiden overs, and exposed the first signs of the strip throwing tantrums. A rough just outside the right-handers leg stump was giving batsmen,especially Maxwell, reasons to bother.Maxwell, hitherto unfazed and on a hundred, suddenly looked a bit shaky. Jadeja first dried up the runs with his tight off-stump line, then continuously tickled the rough, and Maxwell eventually perished.The angle took the ball into him, before it spat off the rough to take his outside edge. Breaking the 191-run partnership, before it aquired a larger dimension, was pivotal to Indias comeback prospects.Later, Maxwell admitted the dilemma when facing Jadeja. There was this area in the wicket where it was a little bit dry and he kept on hitting around it and it just reacted differently. I got a couple of times beaten while playing forward, but it missed the bat by fair margin, he recollected.It sowed the seeds of doubts in his mind. If Im in and Im missing by that far it is not that easy. He was hitting that consistent spot and if it skidded on, it hit stumps. if it spun, you had a chance to nick it. It took him a while to find that awkward spot and we just wanted to find the singles last afternoon, but today he was very accurate, he confided.If Maxwell, a centurion himself, admitted of doubts, you could imagine how confounding a proposition he could have been to the lower-order batsman. Wade scored 37, but looked always uncomfortable when playing Jadeja. The rough would have been even more a menace for him, as he was a left-hander. After a chancy innings, the ball detonated off the rough to take his outside edge. Again, it came at a crucial moment when a partnership was building  he and Smith had already put on 64 runs.Umesh candidly summed up the crux of Jadejas bowling: If he gets even a bit of rough, he knows what his aim is and where he has to bowl.But the most defining moment involving Jadeja came when he flicked back a throw from the deep and affected the run out of Josh Hazlewood. It was a rare moment an Indian fielder showed some ingenuity. The other instances, were either comical or shocking. Sample these: At one point, Cheteshwar Pujara and Umesh Yadav collided at cover to let through a boundary. In the 108th over of Australias innings, Ishant Sharma threw wildly at the wrong end with Maxwell struggling to make his groundIn the broader canvas, he made up for Ashwins blandness. It must have been the latters ceaseless toil round the season that had eventually taken a toll, but he mostly bowled flat, quick and without his cryptic variations. The vaunted gifts were missing, as was that spark.In a sense, Ashwin was symptomatic of Indias own disenchantment. Maybe, they missed Kohli. In the moments when Indians seemed like they were waiting for things to happen, looking listless and letting things drift is when they needed Kohli to turbocharge them. Like he had on the tense second session of the second day against England in Mohali, or as recently as Australias second innings in Bangalore. Not that Rahane, as the stand-in, was forlorn or aloof, but they didnt have Kohlis energy to feed off. Their attention also seemed a little scattered, betraying an impression that there were several distinct opinions and voices on the field.Now its time perhaps the craft and gifts of Jadeja got an equitable appraisal as Ashwins. With it too the recognition that while we may not remember too many of those wickets with the kind of striking clarity Ashwin offers, they all read and look the same in the record book.And they all contribute to the larger cause of the team winning.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

Large parts of Marathwada, and parts of Solapur and Ahmednagar received unseasonal rainfall and witnessed hailstorms on Tuesday and Wednesday. The districts have reported huge losses of standing rabi crops , human life and livestocks. Since the rabi season has come to an end, most of the crop was either harvested and kept or was ready to be harvested.According to preliminary data, very few farmers from those areas had enrolled for the state government's crop insurance scheme, making it difficult for them to be adequately compensated. Official said 10-12% farmers from those areas may be insured.This rabi season, of the 1.36 crore farmers, only 7 lakh farmers across the state enrolled under the prime minister's crop insurance scheme under which they have to pay a 1.5% premium for the crop, and the rest is borne by the state and Centre. Last year, 36 lakh farmers had insured their crops. Good rain in 2016 had raised the hopes for a good rabi year for farmers, and they did not feel the need to insure their crops, said an agriculture department official.""Under the scheme, only 1.5% premium has to be paid by the farmer, but there was no interest in the scheme. In fact, under the scheme, post-harvest losses too are covered, which is more of what has happened in these areas, but unfortunately not many will be able to avail of the compensation,"" said an official.Meanwhile, the state government has ordered a survey of affected areas and the exact extent of losses will be revealed then. Estimates show that crops like green gram, wheat, jowar, grapes and pomegranates have been affected. Even the bags full of tur that the farmers had stored for want of a better price in the market too got moist, making it harder for the already loss-making farmer to find a buyer.Officials said the farmers can be compensated under the National Disaster Relief Fund (NDRF), which comes under the Centre, but compensation under it is inadequate as there is a blanket rate. Under the insurance scheme, farmers get compensation at the minimum support price.""It also takes very long for NDRF money to come to the state, as a report is prepared by the state, sent to the Centre for approval and then funds are released,"" said another official.Six deaths have been reported in the rain, and a Rs 4 lakh compensation package has been declared by the state government for their families."

The newly elected corporators wanted to know why the administration failed to spend the money on upgrading the city's infrastructure and civic amenities.They demanded that the tax burden on citizens be reduced in the wake of so much money lying in banks, pointing out that the BMC was into providing public services and not into profit-making.The report said the BMC, known more for its poor service delivery and largely responsible for the city's decrepit condition, has Rs 61,510 crore in fixed deposits in 31 banks (including four private ones).Public representatives stated that the civic body must not boost its bank balance when civic services have deteriorated and civic infrastructure is crumbling due to corruption and inefficiency.Under the law, BMC should keep a fixed amount aside (in fixed deposits) every year for contingency plans. Corporators demanded to know the break-up of the fixed deposit fund, as they believed a large part of it was what the civic authorities were unable to utilise for public work in the last few years.Former mayor and Shiv Sena corporator Snehal Ambekar said, ""We are not a business organization involved in profit-making. We are into public service and the administration's failure to spend budgetary provisions meant for public work, which is adding up to bank deposits, is not a good sign. We requested the administration to give us details of the works where they failed to use the allotted money.""BMC has consistently failed to spend even half of its budgetary provisions for five years even as citizens of the country's financial capital suffered due to poor infrastructure, mediocre healthcare and ineffective planning. In 2016-17, the BMC was unable to spend half of its budget of Rs 12,957 crore meant for public work till February. Money the administration is unable to use lapses at the end of each financial year and most of it goes into fixed deposits. In 2011-12, the civic authorities spent 49% ( Rs 2,154 crore ) of the allocated budget, 37.6% (Rs 2,257 crore) in 2012-13, 38.2% (Rs 2,344 crore) in 2013-14, a slightly better 49.7% (Rs 4,035 crore) in 2014-15 and 38.2% (Rs 3,561 crore) in 2015-16.Congress corporator Asif Zakaria said, ""The civic body has a Rs 61,510-crore fund in fixed deposits, so there is no need to keep increasing water taxes every year along with other taxes. There is no need to put an additional tax burden on citizens when we have sufficient contingency funds. The civic authorities work for public welfare and not for profit-making.""Samajwadi Party group leader Rais Shaikh said, ""The fund accumulated during the tenure of the ruling party and now suddenly it is concerned about it. The Shiv Sena should instruct the administration not to raise taxes. The administration is getting Rs 4,500 crore as interest from the fixed deposits, which is the total expenditure every year. So there is no need to tax citizens."""

Patel and his group, most of them, who have crossed their 70s, have been running this service since last five and a half years. And among those who contribute for this service are not only NRIs spread across the globe but also Muslim brothers - Imran and Mehboob, who have continued their father late Nanumiyan Malek's legacy of ensuring that 20 kg to 40 kg free fresh veggies reach at 7 am to cook the meals daily.""When we had started with the first donation, we were supplying 51 tiffins in a day.

This initiative is a part of the Odisha State Youth Policy. All the activities will be conducted by TSAF under the banner of Biju Patnaik Himalayan Expedition. The Odisha government and TSAF were in talks since August last year. The adventure body had also conducted an expedition to Mount Rurdagaira on a pilot basis in the end of September last year. The tie-up materialised on March 5 following the visit of Rajender Singh Pal, an Everester and manager of TSAF, to Bhubaneswar to hold talks with officials involved with the state's youth policy. Selection trials began on March 6 in Bhubaneswar. Odisha team's co-ordinator Jogabyasa Bhoi said 75 youths participated in the trials held in Bhubaneswar.

The official said the Jharkhand government had never approached them to conduct such activities. ""We are open to such a proposal from the state government.

I never imagined myself relishing beetroot so much that I asked for more shorba.Then came another star to fulfill my gastronomical cravings. I was served fried idli with lime pickle filling. The south Indian in me couldnt be happier to discover that the most underrated idli could be given such a makeover. It remained the show-stopper.I heard Pineapple rasam from the corner of the table and I jumped in excitement. There is no south Indian wedding that is complete without pineapple rasam. I wanted to taste the chefs style and it goes without saying, the spices of rasam, tanginess of pineapple and the infusion of red round chillis were intact.Ankuri Makkai Hara Pyaaz Ki Tikki was next on my plate. To explain it in local language, it was an exotic full moong dal ki vada. The green chutney complimented well. My main course had coconut rice with badami kofta and some cheese risotto. The desserts couldnt get any better with Paan kulfi, Andhra Special Putharekulu, poached pear and some edible flowers.Other delicacies included dishes like Murg Gulnaz, Matki Murg, Kothimir kodi, Khmer fish curry, SubzBadamiKofta, GuttiBeerakai Masala, Gongura Kodi Kura, under one roof.The Choose your Chef series will continue till April. Time: 7.30 pm onwards"

The children are supplied 450 gm of moong dal, 900 gm of jaggery and nutrimilk milk powder per month.Food supplement of 500 calories of energy and 12-15 gm of protein per child per day as take-home ration (THR) in the form of micronutrient fortified food and/or energy-dense food marked as ICDS Food Supplement is the right of every child who is enrolled in an anganwadi.On Tuesday, about 22,000 anganwadi workers staged protest at Freedom Park, claimed H S Sunandha, CITU anganwadi union general secretary.

But for our timely intervention against trapping the mice, we would have incurred a huge loss in terms of yield, a farmer said.He had raised the crop on six acres. Using borewell, he could irrigate the crop which has a duration of 65 to 70 days.We anticipate a good yield this season, anywhere between 800 kg to one tonne an acre. But the mice have been destroying the crop to a great extent, he said.Another farmer said he raised black gram and green gram this season. We are shocked to see a sudden rise in the number of mice in the fields, he said.The farmers have been utilising the services of labourers who are skilled in catching the mice. Within seconds after catching the mouse, the labourers damage its legs and teeth so that it could not escape.The labourers collect the mice in gunny bags. At least 600 mice could be trapped in an acre, they said.Farmers have to incur a huge expenditure for trapping the mice."

I go to the local sweetshop for this, and I find that their fare is usually good. But the last time I got our breakfast packed from this busy eatery, I was a bit disappointed. The chholey was fine but the bhatureys were a little hard. They reminded me of bedmi, and suddenly I yearned for the bedmi and hot aloo sabzis that Chandni Chowk is known for.Vegetarian sideOnce the stomach demands, the body obeys. So a few days ago, I decided that while the weather was still bearable, I needed to go to Purani Dilli. I had gone there in the evening once and had my fill of kababs. Now I needed to go to the vegetarian part of the Walled City in the daytime for bedmi aloo.Think bedmi, and you think of Shiv Misthan Bhandar. This is an old, old shop on the mouth of Kucha Ghasiram (Shop no. 375, phone no. 23921406). This is near the Fatehpuri Mosque side of Chandni Chowk, away from the Red Fort end. The shop has just 11 items on the menu.If you are there in the mornings, you can breakfast on nagori halwa (Rs. 60), a delicious dish of small puris which you pierce in the middle (the way golgappas come) and stuff with halwa and eat. Apart from bedmi aloo (Rs. 90), they have chholey bhaturey (Rs. 80), and kachori and samosa (Rs. 50). They sell six kinds of sweets  jalebi and imarti (Rs. 500 a kilo), gulab jamun (Rs. 450), suji halwa (Rs. 400), mung dal halwa (Rs. 450) and malpua (Rs. 400). You can also buy them by plate  two imartis, for instance, are for Rs. 60 and two pieces of jalebi for Rs. 50.When I used to go there earlier, you had to stand and eat. Now the place has expanded at the back and there is seating for at least 30 people. If you are eating there, helpers keep filling your slot for sabzi and chholey if they find it empty. I, of course, took the bedmis home  and had a delicious lunch of two big puris stuffed with a dal paste, a nicely runny potato sabzi and lightly cooked chholey. I had all this with some tart methi chutney and pickles.The best thing about Shiv Misthan Bhandar is that every dish is cooked in desi ghee. I love the flavour and taste of ghee, so bedmi fried in ghee is like ambrosia for me. And because there are only 11 items on the menu (unlike the big vegetarian fast food chains, where you get everything these days from pizzas and pasta to noodles and burgers and bhatureys and chaat), Shiv Misthan keeps a strict check on quality. I have been eating their food for years, and find that it is as good as it was when I first went there long years ago.The place is known for its chholey bhaturey and imartis, too. And I firmly believe that their jalebi is a lot better than the thick ones that you get in Dariba. Shiv Misthans jalebi is juicy, yet crisp. And its delicious when eaten hot, just off the kadai.My craving for bedmi aloo has been met. But its been a while since I had Shiv Misthans nagori halwa. One day soon, I tell myself."

Chandra Shekara Rao during the Question Hour, the Minister said that during the north-east monsoon period, the State received a rainfall of 85.3 mm between October 1 and December 31 last year as against normal rainfall of 296 mm.The Minister admitted that rabi sowings of major crops like maize, jowar, Bengal gram, green gram, and black gram were badly affected due to failure of north-east monsoon and lack of sufficient soil moisture.This has also badly hit paddy sowings during rabi under rain-fed tanks in Nellore, Chittoor, and Prakasam districts, and also under Nagarjuna Sagar Project (NSP), he said.He said to rescue the farmer, the government had promoted irrigated dry crops by providing seed on subsidy that helped them to opt for alternative crops.A total quantity of 34,705 quintals of alternative crop seed like pulses, groundnut, sesamum, and Bengal gram worth Rs. 1,483 lakh was distributed to farmers in Krishna, Guntur, Nellore, Kurnool, Prakasam, and Anantapur districts.To make up for the deficit area in rabi, an additional extent of 2 lakh hectares were covered with summer pulses in Nellore, Chittoor, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, and the Godavari districts, where farmers were supplied subsidised seed.Besides, 3,300 quintals of black gram and 2,479 quintals of green gram seed was kept ready to be supplied for 33.35 5 subsidy, he said.The Minister said, in coordination with the Irrigation Department, water release was regulated.This is to ensure judicious use by following water budgeting in the NSP and delta regions, he said.Mr. Pulla Rao said 5,652 oil engines and 3,058 units of water carrying pipes were supplied for judicious use of available water.To ensure judicious use, water release regulated in the NSP and delta regionsP.

Bor consumed poison at his home in the morning and succumbed at hospital while undergoing treatment.According to his family members, Bor had cultivated paddy and moong on two acres for which he had taken a loan of Rs 19,000 from the local cooperative society. He was visibly upset for the last few days. We suspect he took the drastic step apprehending that he might not be able to repay the loan he had taken for paddy and pulses crops, said a family member.The administration, however, rubbished the allegations. Basta Tehsildar Bhabataran Sahu, who visited Baliapati village, said it was an outcome of family disturbance as Bor was being neglected by his two sons and daughters-in-law after the death of his wife a decade ago.A couple of days back, he was ill-treated by his sons, who used to harass him publicly. They all had gone to Baruni mela leaving Bor alone at home. That day, he could not have food properly and it might have compelled him to take the extreme step, Sahu said.On crop loan, he said it was taken only three months back at an interest rate of 1 per cent and society officials did not ask him for repayment. On March 15, Sudam Khatua (40) of Pakharbada village under Sadar police limits had ended his life by consuming pesticide allegedly over crop loss. The district administration had refuted the allegation stating that family feud was the reason."

However, department officials argue that procurement had been done in a completely transparent manner.Quoting information obtained under the RTI Act, 2005, from the department and public documents and agriculture-based websites quoting prices for various commodities in open markets and Agriculture Market Produce Committees, Mr. Gadad said at a press conference here recently that a total 2,10,468 quintals of highly substandard green gram was purchased from National Commodity & Derivatives Exchange Limited (NCDEX) for a sum of about Rs. 12.653 crore in February and March this year. He alleged the department paid an average price of Rs. 6,012 per quintal, which was much higher than the average prices that range from Rs. 3,800 to Rs. 4,500 per quintal in open markets.Considering a minimum difference of Rs. 1,000 per quintal between vis--vis average procurement and market prices, the department has paid Rs. 21.04 crore over and above the market prices for green gram, Mr. Gadad alleged.Price of sugarSimilarly, it purchased 88,320 quintals of S-30 grade sugar at Rs. 400 per quintal kg and another stock of 16,900 quintals at Rs. 4,300 per quintal, even though the price of better quality of sugar was only Rs. 38 in markets. The price difference of Rs. 500 per quintal indicates that about Rs. 2.37 crore more was paid for the procurement of sugar.NCDEX e-tendersHowever, N.C. Gangadhar, Senior Deputy Director in the department at Bengaluru, categorically rejected the allegation stating that all procurements were made in a transparent manner through e-tenders from NCDEX, a professionally managed online multi-commodity exchange in Mumbai.Mr. Gangadhar told The Hindu that tenders for green gram and sugar were issued during November-December 2016 and commodities were purchased through e-tenders at e-prices from NCDEX as per the prices that prevailed on the day of purchase on condition of door-delivery. The procurement prices included the cost of door-delivery where sugar was supplied in a 50 kg bag and green gram in 1 kg plastic bags.He said the department was procuring commodities for PDS through the central e-marketing forum NCDEX with due permission from the government."

This translates into constructing 37.5 lakh homes every year. A tall order, indeed! Union minister for housing and urban poverty alleviation M Venkaiah Naidus statement in the Rajya Sabha recently conceded that only 82,048 units had been constructed since the scheme kicked in, in June 2015. At this rate, the Housing for All Mission may not see completion even after a century!Roping in private buildersWho, then, will construct these huge numbers? Government Housing Boards at best account for 10-15 per cent of the supply, and it is the private building industry that has to deliver the bulk. Therein lies the catch: private builders dont want to enter the mass/low-cost segments as they perceive the margins to be too thin and marketing task to the poor a veritable nightmare. They are happy to build high priced homes for the middle classes and the rich, even though sales are sluggish.The irony of the situation can be seen in the burgeoning inventory of unsold stocks at the rich end, while there is a huge, unsatiated demand at the poor end of the market. When the Maharashtra Housing & Area Development Authority (MHADA) advertised last September for buyers for 4,275 homes in Mumbais distant suburbs, it received an eye-popping 1.65 lakh applications for these low cost homes!No wonder, there is a desperate bid to rope in private developers. The latest February Union Budget has enlarged the definition of affordable homes  30 sq meters (323 sq feet) for the 4 big metros and 60 sq metres (646 sq ft) for other cities  as carpet area compared to the earlier smaller built up area definition.Builders making these homes can now claim 100 per cent deduction of profits under Section 80-1BA of the Income Tax Act, and projects under this scheme have been given up to five years for completion instead of three years earlier.What is affordable?But, can size define what is affordable? A 320 sq ft carpet area in south Mumbai today costs Rs 1.2 crore and a 645 sq affordable home in Bangalores city centre will carry a tag of Rs 1.4 crore. Hardly affordable!Ultimately, affordability is the cost to the buyer. The accepted norm is: a home should cost no more than 4-5 times a persons annual income. Beyond that, it becomes unaffordable.By this definition, an income earner of Rs 10,000 a month cannot afford a home above Rs 6 lakh; and at the top range, a Rs 30,000 a month earner, can muster up Rs 18 lakh for a home, if he wants to keep aside money for other needs such as education and food. Thats the earning range of 90 percent of Indians, and therefore affordability for the poor means a price range of Rs 6 to Rs 20 lakh. Size has to bow to cost!There are builders who are servicing this end, and for them success is all about price points. P Suresh, managing director of Arun Excello Realty, says his company has been constructing small, low-cost homes in Chennai and marketing them at just under Rs 3,000 a sq ft, and still making a profit. His target is the rickshaw driver, and anyone who earns in the Rs 10,000-20,000 per month range.Similarly, Sanjay Shah, founder of DBS Communities, has sold over 4,000 homes in projects spanning Ahmedabad, Surat and Vadodara -- all in the price range of Rs 7 to Rs 17 lakh.Suresh of Arun Excello, however, insists the government can do more. Stamp duty, registration and other taxes add Rs 90 per sq ft to my sale price, or a jack up of about 12.5 per cent. Multiple permissions cause six to 18 months of delay that add five per cent in admin costs. Take these two away, and the home can be 20 per cent cheaper!It is obvious that both the central and state governments need to do a lot more before affordable homes become mainline construction.(The writer is a senior journalist)"

But the business lost overseas may have found a domestic outlet in a southern state. Keralites, with a pronounced penchant for beef on the plate, have shown their appetite for red meat remains unsatiated. Its consumption keeps clocking a phenomenal growth.The consumption of beef has risen dramatically from 2.56 lakh tonnes in 2015-16 to 4 lakh tones in 2016-17. At about Rs 260-280 a kilo, raw beef worth Rs 11,000 crore was sold in the fiscal year gone by. Add to this the value addition it undergoes in the many nooks and crannies of the state, and we are talking about a humungous money spinner here.Therefore, not manyespecially the politicianswould want to take potshots at it and the state unit of the BJP is no exception, the recent retraction of an earlier statement by its Malappuram Lok Sabha candidate notwithstanding. Given these high stakes, Kerala has enough reason to be worried about the ongoing hype against cattle slaughter in other states. There is the danger of Kerala turning into a dumping ground for unhealthy cattle in the country. Telltale signs are already visible, with hundreds of tonnes of cattle carcass along with barely standing cattle getting ferried into the state through its porous borders. The reason: Farmers in most states who rear cattle are reluctant to take the animals to registered abattoirs owing to the ongoing protests.Considering 70 per cent of the people in the state are partial to non-vegetarian food, and with beef being the preferred meat of most Keralites cutting across religious barriers, there is a case for caution. Kerala should ensure the cattle that gets shipped its way are healthy and meat comes only from certified abattoirs."

On an average, temperatures have shot up by 2 degrees in all of north coastal AP as a result of deforestation and excessive carbon emissions. Carbon dioxide emissions are roughly 22.5 million tonnes annually,"" said researchers. They said there was a change in cropping patterns, where a major shift has been witnessed from sugarcane production and foodgrains to short-term timber.Though paddy production has gone up in Srikakulam district, it has decreased rapidly in Vizag and Vizianagaram district. Despite encroachment on forest land in the three districts, the area of acreage being sown for kharif stood at 5 lakh acres (in 2015), which corresponded with the area under cultivation in 1990.""It is not just paddy that is being effected but all food crops, including millets, green grams, black grams and horse grams. All this despite new irrigation schemes,"" said a researcher.The number of borewells in the agricultural areas of these three districts have gone up from 2,000 to 36,000 in 20 years till 2015, despite existing small irrigation projects."" Despite increase in borewells, the area under agriculture is decreasing rapidly. Over 200,000 acres of prime agriculture land has now been converted into short term timber plantation area,"" said a researcher.They said if the same trend as observed from 2005 were to be witnessed, it could result in abandonment of 25% of the existing agricultural land in the region by the end of this decade hugely impacting food productivity in the region. They said there has been a sharp rise in vector-borne diseases over the last 20 years and the number of cases have jumped from 40,000 to over 100,000."

Highlighting the need for encouraging farmers to undertake pulses cultivation, he wanted the officials of the agriculture to make arrangement for the distribution of seed of black gram and green gram in areas where the paddy harvesting was over.As the irrigation canals would be closed for the summer season from April 15, Mr. Arun Kumar asked the officials at the village and mandal-level to focus on filling up the summer storage tanks in the next couple of days. He also reviewed the summer drinking water programme chalked out by the Rural Water Supply Department and the opening of water kiosks in the urban areas.Later, addressing the Mineral Foundation Trust meeting, the Collector issued orders allocating Rs. 3.72 crore from the trust to undertake various developmental programmes all over the district.He said Rs. 2.34 crore would be spent on supplying safe drinking water in 11 villages under Prattipadu, Eleswaram and Rowthulapudi mandals, while the remaining amount would be spent on improving medical and health care facilities in the upland mandals."
593c7a9b7be9e00e964d27fd,Centre opposes state Bill to regulate price of pulses,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/centre-opposes-state-bill-to-regulate-price-of-pulses-4609624/,2017-04-11,"The Centre has ruled that the states much-touted draft Bill on regulation of prices of pulses made no economic sense and goes against the basic principles of a free market economy. Last April, the Devendra Fadnavis government, which had come under criticism over spiralling prices of pulses, had publicised the fact that it was the countrys first state to adopt a price-control mechanism for pulses when it cleared the draft Bill. But the Presidential assent for the Bill hasnt come a year later. Documents obtained by the Congress under the Right to Information (RTI) Act now indicate that the Bill may stay in cold storage. The RTI documents, which were released on Tuesday, reveal that the Union agriculture ministrys Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has raised strong objections to the proposed Bill.The department has commented, In a free market economy, prices of any commodity, including pulses, are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. The market prices provide a signal both to the producers (farmers) and consumers regarding the demand and supply situation. Accordingly, both the producers and the consumers take decisions on consumption and production of a particular commodity. The proposed Bill goes against the basic principles of the free market economy. Any artificial control on prices etc of pulses may create further distortion and parallel economy.While the states plan was to cap retail and wholesale sale prices for tur dal, black gram, green gram, lentils, beans, etc, across the state taking into account the availability of pulses, their demand and supply, the central government has opposed the states direct intervention.In case the Government of Maharashtra wants to protect the interest of consumers, it can provide pulses to the vulnerable sections at a subsidised price through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This will limit the distortionary impact on market prices and the market price signal for farmers will not be adversely impacted. Farmers will continue to have the relevant market signal to make investments in increasing production of pulses, the Centre has observed, while remarking that it does not support the Bill.Congress leader Sachin Sawant, who had filed an RTI application in this regard, alleged on Tuesday the state government had tried to scuttle the information to avoid public embarrassment. He said, I had filed an RTI in October. But was denied information twice. Official information was shared only after RTI commissioner Ratnakar Gaikwad stepped in and issued directives in this regard.Even when the Bill was passed, the Congress had reasoned that it did not make economic sense. The Centre has only reiterated our demand that the state government must procure pulses and distribute them under the PDS, he said.Cong attacks Sena, BJP on NDA meetMumbai: The Congress on Tuesday took a dig at both the Shiv Sena and BJPover Uddhav Thackerays decision to attend the NDA meet in New Delhi on Monday. It is not that long ago that Shiv Sena leaders were saying that those wanting to discuss Presidential polls should come to Matoshree. It is amusing to now see Thackeray himself travel to Delhi for the meeting and even endorse Narendra Modis candidature for the PMs race for the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, said Congress leader Sachin Sawant. He added, In the build-up to the BMC polls, BJP MP Kirit Somaiya had claimed to have evidence against Thackeray.

Nagar, Mysuru taluk and H.D. Kote where farmers have started preparing the land for short-duration crops, he added.The land preparation by way of tilling has been completed in most areas and farmers normally tend to opt for black and green grams which can be harvested in 90 days.The pre-monsoon showers have come on time but what matters is they should be steady over the next few weeks by when the crops will be in the growth stage, said Mr. Somasundar.However, farmers are in dilemna as similar rains set in on time last year as well but there was no build-up and due to lack of moisture during the growth stage, crops withered.The present rains have kindled a ray of home among farmers most of whom are under agrarian crisis. But there is also anguish as two successive crop failures have left us with zero income and mounting debt. There are apprehensions that rains could fail this season as well and farmers are finding it difficult to raise fresh loans, according to Atahalli Devaraj, a farmer activist.Bulk of agriculture in Mysuru district takes place under rain-fed condition as irrigation through water stored in reservoirs cover only 35 % to 40 % of the total area under agriculture and hence pre-monsoon rains are not ignored by the farmers, according to Vivek Cariappa from Sargur.But for many, raising fresh loans is the immediate challenge as they are burdened by mounting debts owing to past loans that are not cleared.However, K.N. Shivalingaiah, Chief Manager, Lead Bank, State Bank of India, explained that there was a standing instruction from the RBI that fresh crop loans can be sanctioned after re-phasing the outstanding loan if crops in the preceding year was drought-affected and notified as such.But farmers point out that such adjustments and waivers apply only in case they have raised institutional loan whereas a majority avail short-term loan from private financiers."

March is the seventh consecutive month that exports have picked up after almost two dozen months of shrinking outflows and the strong surge indicates that the ongoing export recovery is gaining momentum. However, imports soared up even faster with inflows picking up by a humungous 45.3% in the month. But import growth in the fiscal year remained marginally negative. Though monthly trade deficit rose to a five month high of $10.4 billion in March pushing up the total trade deficit to $105.7 billion the gap between exports and imports was still the second lowest in as much as 9 years.What makes the surge in exports in March especially impressive is that it extended to almost all major product categories like engineering goods, gems and jewelry, petroleum products, ready made goods, drugs and pharmaceuticals and organic and inorganic chemicals? The surge in exports of many labor intensive products should give a boost to employment too. Most remarkable was the gains in engineering goods and petroleum products which soared up 46.7% and 69.1.Exports of textile ready made goods also were an impressive 20.3%. While exports of chemicals grew by 15.4%, that of gems and jewelry increased 12.5% and of drugs and pharmaceutical 5.5%. Some important agriculture related commodities like marine products, meat, dairy and poultry products, spices and rice also registered substantial gains. Only exports of fruits and vegetables shrunk in the month. Among other primary products both iron ore, coal and other minerals registered notable gains.Now let us look at the reasons for the extraordinary surge in imports to more than 45%. As in the case of exports the imports surge was also extensive and covered almost all major import products like crude oil and petroleum products, electronic goods, gold, pearls and precious stones, electrical and non-electrical machinery, chemicals, resins and plastic materials and vegetable oil. This indicates that the import surge is driven by both the surging exports momentum and a revival in domestic demand which is good news on the growth front.However, the signs are no always positive. For instance crude oil imports doubled in March which indicates either a surge in oil imports or prices or both of them which is certainly not good news. Equally worrisome is the four fold increase in gold imports in March to more than $ 4 billion. While some of it would be marshaled by the recovery in jewelry exports a lot would also go into domestic consumption which is not only a dead investments but also a useful conduit for holding ill-gotten wealth especially when government is extending its work on rolling back the black economy."

The journey he began as a legislator in 1957 continues uninterrupted till this day, having won 13 successive elections from various constituencies on the ticket of the same party he later got to lead, the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam.Known for his excellent speaking and writing skills in Tamil, he began his professional career around 1945 as a screenwriter for the film Rajakumaari, in which M G Ramachandran was the lead actor. Karunanidhi made films a vehicle of the Dravidian movement by injecting ideology in the story line, which at times led to controversies. After the demise of the venerated C N Annadurai in harness in 1969, he became chief minister and the party boss, and made the DMK the principal pole in Tamil Nadu politics. MGR floated the AIADMK three years later to offer a credible counter to the DMK, which it did successfully over the years.Karunanidhi joined politics at the age of 14.His political experience spanning 79 years, which includes 60 years as a legislator, is a humungous basket of wisdom. Close associates recall he has an anecdote for every occasion. And the memory of an elephant. Unlike the popular belief that politicians are late for events, he was punctual to a fault. Known to be a consensus builder, he would flare up at fibbing and non-performance. While he has the gift of the gab and is delightfully quick at repartee, Karunanidhi was more a creature of broadsheet journalism in the A B Vajpayee mould who was not comfortable with new media and sound bite journalism.This newspaper has been a trenchant critic of Karunanidhi on policy matters and issues like nepotism and corruption, particularly the 2G scam, and the LTTE. But for the wisdom and experience he brought to the table, we have only one word. Respect. Both the DMK and TN need his margadarshan for many more years."

Touting the plant to be a bestseller, owing to the demand in the handicraft industry, they also assured to bring buyers.This happened six years ago. Even though a year has passed since the stipulated time, no official or buyer has come for the bamboos, which have reached maturity. Though not water intensive, bamboo needs a good level of moisture. A year past harvest time, with the bamboo yellowing due to arid conditions, the farmers are now worried that their hard work for the past five years will go waste.The farmers reportedly didnt get the promised subsidy. After the initial hype, officials did not even visit to see if the saplings were growing well, said sources.Even we have spent lakhs to grow bamboo. Even though the plants are six-years-old, to me, they look stunted. But since we have never grown it before, we are also not sure what to expect, said Ilango, a farmer from Ulundurpet.Adding to the woe, the Horticulture officials who advised them to plant bamboo left long ago, having been transferred to other districts. The current officials do not take any interest in this regard. When they approached agriculture department, they washed their hands off the matter, saying they cannot intervene in a project which was floated by a sister concern.With no previous experience or guidance, the bamboo planters had trusted the government to take care of them in experimenting with the cash crop. They had forgone fast crops like ground nut, corn and moong daal thinking the harvest after five years will be payback enough. Since bamboo was a clumping plant and did not allow other crops to grow in between, mixed cropping was also not an option.Demanding that the officials should take immediate action to save the crop, the farmers sought for payment of subsidies.

The new round of funding will keep Flipkarts fires burning against Amazons onslaught; more importantly, it will also keep the party going for the bargain-hunting Indian consumer.While the valuation of Flipkart has gradually eroded to $11.6 billion in this round of funding compared to the peak valuation of $15.1 billion two years ago, the money will infuse new life into Flipkart in a contest that seemed to be running away in favour of Amazon.Falling ShortE-tailing, or the selling of everything from mobile phones and electronics to books and bed sheets on the digital marketplace, hasnt performed as well as it had been predicted. After various forecasts of galloping revenues of $120 billion by 2020, today all the players put together are struggling at about $15 billion.Growth has been a measly 16 per cent last year with online sales accounting for just two per cent of total retail sales. China is over 40 times ahead with online retail sales of $752 billion in calendar 2016, a 26.2 per cent increase from the previous year; and online purchases accounting for as much as 15.5 per cent of the total retail pie.So far, Indian e-tailers have only losses to report. Flipkart more than doubled its net loss to Rs 2,000 crore in FY16. Amazon Indias losses for FY17 could touch Rs 6,500 crore.As funding is drying up, the industry is going through sharp consolidation. Snapdeal has initiated a merger process with Flipkart. Two years ago, Snapdeal founder Kunal Bahl boasted he would achieve gross merchandise value of $10 billion by the end of FY16. Today, Snapdeal is virtually non-existent.Discounting StrategyThe traditional big e-tailers strategy is to sell products at heavily discounted prices, with the option of returning the product. This cash burn route, they hope, will shift consumer behaviour away from physical stores to dependency on the ease and comfort of online sales. Once the consumer is hooked, discounts will disappear and profits emerge. But, the Indian story has never been so simple. The severe competition between well-funded players has ensured that discounts have gotten bigger. The advantage of saving on physical stores has been eroded by the huge cost of marketing and of logistics  of supply chains, of warehousing, and of dealing with returns.The Indian consumer is smart. He is not loyal to any seller and is willing to bend the rules. Sample this: A young professional in Dehra Dun who regularly shops online explained his modus operandi. When movies were still being watched on DVDs, he would order half a dozen, watch all of them overnight, and then ship the DVDs back claiming they were defective.No LeaderIn both the US and China, after fierce competition and cash burn, a single e-tailer emerged as leader and was able to call the shots in pricing and strategy. In the US, it is Amazon that dominates by a huge margin. For online sales for the 12-month period up to May 2016, eMarketeer reported Amazon revenue growing nearly 16 per cent to a humungous $82.7 billion compared to the nearest rival Walmart at $12.5 billion. Similarly, Alibaba has emerged the leader in China. Its various retailing sites control over 80 per cent of the market, and in 2016 notched sales of over $20 billion and net profit of $5.8 billion.In India, there is no leader. So far, it has been a three-way fight among Flipkart, Amazon and Snapdeal. Snapdeal has given up but there is a third fighter now waiting in the wings. The Vijay Shekhar Sharma-founded Paytm, which has successfully run an e-wallet operation, is now launching an online shopping marketplace in alliance with Alibaba. The China giant has pumped in $200 million so far and could hold up to 50 per cent in the new venture.This means, the three-way slugfest will continue with no dominant leader any time soon. This also means the happy times of bargains and discounts are here to stay for a while.(The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com)"

The yield has reduced to one-third of last years harvest, they rue. Out of five acres, I could harvest just eight bags of green gram, each of 100 kg, against 22 bags last year, said S. Muthukumar of Athukudi village. The price which stood at Rs. 6,000 has come down to just Rs. 5,200.Ditto with blackgram crop. S. Vasanthan, another farmer from the same village, said he raised black gram on an acre. Against six bags last year, he could get only three now. The price of each bag, which stood at Rs. 13,000 last year, had come down to Rs. 6,800.Adding to the list of woes was the rodent menace, which caused extensive damage to the crop when it was nearing harvest.To the farmers, the fall in prices against a low yield was a mystery. Especially, when they had not marketed their produce immediately and waited for the demand to increase in order to get better returns.But wholesale dealers said the abundant supply of green gram and black gram from adjoining states, particularly Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, resulted in the fall in the prices of the two crops. Though the yield was poor in Tamil Nadu, the adjoining states registered a steady increase in terms of yield."

Farmers are hopeful that the spell will continue till the actual monsoon sets in.According to the Indian Meteorological Department, Karnataka, which was the most rain deficient state last monsoon, is witnessing good pre-monsoon showers this year. The department has predicted 96% rainfall this year. Moderate to heavy rain accompanied by thunder and lightning has lashed parts of Hassan, Mandya, Chamarajanagar and Mysuru districts raising hopes among the agrarian community. Irrigation in Mysuru district through reservoirs covers only 35% to 40% of the total area and hence farmers depend on rains.Gramin Krishi Mausam Sewa, Organic Farming Research Station, Naganahallis Research Associate Narendra Babu told DH that the pre-monsoon season has begun at the right time and will continue till May.The monsoon season is usually from June. However, the pattern varies once in eight to 10 years, he said.Farmers are advised to take up ploughing in areas which have received rain. Farmers have been told to take up ploughing across the slope as it improves infiltration and conservation of rain water. Farmers have been advised to take up land preparation across the slopes and keep the land ready for pre-monsoon sowing.While sowing pulses, seeds should be treated with appropriate strain of rhizobium culture. Farmers are advised to buy seeds only from authorised dealers with blue tags only.Farmers here grow green gram, horse gram, red gram and other millets till the actual monsoon sets in.Later, if rains are on expected lines, they go for paddy, he said. Farmers are however, in a dilemma as the rain pattern was similar last year too but they were not steady, resulting in loss of crops.No change in temperatureAccording to Naganahalli Research Centre, heat and humidity will continue throughout the day and night during the season as pre-monsoon rain is intense but lasts for a short spell. Pre-monsoon rains will not affect the temperatures in a significant way as it will be for a short duration. The rain is usually expected during late afternoon, evening or early morning.The day temperature was 35.8 degrees Celsius on April 19 while it was 36 degrees Celsius on April 18. The temperature will hover between 34 and 36 degrees for the next few days.Sowing seedsWith Hunsur taluk getting a good spell of rain on Monday night, farmers began tilling their lands and are in need of good quality seeds, said taluk Raitha Sangha secretary Shankaregowda.Bilikere Raitha Samparka Kendra officer Prasanna Dewan said that they have sufficient seeds of green and black gram in stock. Monsoon begins in the state from June but farmers of Mysuru and Chamarajanagar have mistook summer rain to be the actual monsoon and are in a hurry to purchase seeds for sowing. The Agriculture department has taken measures to supply sufficient seeds, he said."
590467e37be9e04154df6760,Trade data shows that India is well placed to ride the global recovery in exports,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/minorityview/trade-data-shows-that-india-is-well-placed-to-ride-the-global-recovery-in-exports/,2017-04-20,"Despite growing uncertainties on global growth, the World Trade Organization (WTO) has moved up its forecast on the growth in volume of global trade from 1.3% in 2016 to 2.4% in 2017 with the range expected to vary from 1.8% to 3.6%. What is even better is that the multilateral organization expects the trade recovery to continue in 2018 with the growth rates moving up further in the 2.1% to 4% range.The large margins of the growth forecast in trade is because rising inflation can lead to tightening of monetary and fiscal policies and slow down GDP growth across major markets and also because of the growing wave of economic nationalism that has curtailed globalization efforts in recent times. A factor that may push growth to the upside is the recovery in emerging market economies. But then a reason for worry is the substantially weakening of the linkages between global trade and global growth with the ratio even falling below 1:1 level for the first time since the turn of the century.The 1.3% growth in global trade volume in 2016 was because of the stagnating imports into developing even as that into developed countries touched 2%. Export growth of both segments remained stuck a little above one percent. Geographically most of the demand for imports rose from Europe and Asia. However, the growth in trade in dollar terms tells a different story. Numbers here show that global exports of goods fell by 3.3% in 2016 while global exports of services largely stagnated. But the future is brighter as global GDP growth at market exchange rates is expected to go up from 2.3% in 2016 to 2.7% in 2017 and 2.8% in 2018.Prospects of Indias trade recovery in 2017 is relatively better given that it has been able to withstand the global slump relatively far better than its peers. Numbers on the merchandize export show that Indias exports declined by 1.3% in 2016 to $264 billion. In comparison the exports of Asean countries declined by 1.7%, that of Asian countries by 3.7% and that of China by a still more substantial 7.7%. Other Bric countries also registered notable falls. While Brazils exports fell by 3.1% in 2016 that of Russia fell by a humungous 17.5%. However, though India retained its global share of 1.7% of merchandise exports in 2016, even while that of China shrunk from 13.8% to 13.25%, Indias global ranking in merchandize exports dipped from 19th position in 2015 to the 20th position in 2016 with UAE overtaking India.In the case of commercial services, Indias record is even more exemplary. Indias commercial services exports rose by 3.5% to $ 161 billion in 2016 even as the global exports rose by a measly 0.1% and that of Asia rose by 0.9%. Chinas commercial services exports were badly hit in 2016 with the outflows declining by 4.3% to $207 billion. Across nations Indias exemplary performance in commercial service exports was surpassed only by a few developed economies like Japan and Ireland whose growth rates were a more buoyant 6.5% and 8.8% respectively. However, despite that India maintained its 8th rank among the top global exporters of commercial services.Given Indias relatively better export performance in 2016, it is very likely that the country would gain more substantially as global trade picks up in 2017 and 2018."

The board began issuing notices even before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) on Wednesday ordered shutting of industries polluting Bellandur Lake.The board is still not clear about the extent of the area to which the NGT order will apply. If the order is to cover the entire catchment area of the lake, which covers 40% of Bengaluru city, thousands of industries will face closure.The board identified 486 industries in a 5km radius of the lake, of which 97 water-based units have been issued notices for closure. Most are small-scale units involved in dyeing, washing, garments, laundry, leather tanning and automobile repair.""Four teams spent a month in the area and prepared a preliminary report. Based on the report, we have started issuing notices to the industrial units,"" said B G Mohan Krishna, chief environment officer of KSPCB, who heads the committee looking into industries polluting Bellandur Lake.The state government is yet to collate the final list of industries that will be affected by Wednesday's order. NGT has said industries in the vicinity of the lake should be closed, but officials are not yet aware of the area to which the NGT order is applicable.""We will study the NGT order to get clarity about the actual area. If it is the entire catchment area which covers over 40% of Bengaluru city, the task will be humungous,"" said KSPCB chairman Lakshman.He said a meeting of officials from KSPCB, Karnataka Lake Conservation and Development Authority (KLCDA), Bengaluru Water Supply and Sewerage Board (BWSSB) and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) would be convened on Friday to discuss the future course of action.As NGT has said no industry would be permitted to operate without the consent of the joint inspection team, KLCDA chief executive officer G Vidyasagar said the sealing drive would be intensified after Friday's meeting.Lakshman said the report of the committee headed by Mohan Krishna would be studied. He said NGT issued its order based on the committee's report. Notices had been issued to industrial units that did not comply with licensing norms such as setting up of captive effluent treatment plants, he said. ""Notices will be issued to more industries if they are not following licence conditions,"" said Lakshman.Shutting industries alone won't helpBengaluru: About 365 million litres a day (MLD) of industrial effluents and domestic sewage flows into Belladur Lake from Koramangala Valley (155MLD), Challaghatta Valley (110MLD), Agara Valley (90MLD) and Ibluru Valley (10MLD), so closing industries alone will not revive the lake. ""You cannot spruce up the lake just by closing industries. You need to stop domestic inflow too, which accounts for 30% pollution,"" said environment expert Y D Manmohan. Apart from enforcing laws regarding captive effluent treatment plants for industries, the government needs a holistic plan to manage pollutants. One suggestion is to divert sewage through natural treatment and wet land before it goes to the lake. The lake water could be subjected to tertiary treatment, including reverse osmosis and membrane treatment. ""By doing this, you can produce 200MLD of potable water which can utilised for industrial use if not drinking,"" an expert said."
5923bea77be9e01fcef059c2,More WB projects needed,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/607563/more-wb-projects-needed.html,2017-04-21,"More WB projects neededVeena S Rao, Apr 21 2017, 23:49 ISTCHRONIC MALNuTRITION : While a National Nutrition Mission was announced in 2014, no scheme has yet emerged, and the Budget makes no mention of it.The Global Nutrition Report 2016 places India off course for all nutrition indicators with some progress in stunting and underweight and none at all in anaemia among women of reproductive age and wasting of children.Indias jinx in tackling this last unaddressed outpost in its growth and development story continues. Though a National Nutrition Mission was announced in 2014, no national programme has yet emerged, and this years Union Budget makes no mention of it. Clearly, the subject appears to have been put on the backburner for the moment, and another opportunity seems to have been wasted.However, I have great satisfaction that all interventions of the World Bank-supported Karnataka Multi-Sectoral Nutrition Project being piloted by the Karnataka Comprehensive Nutrition Mission in Devadurga block, Raichur district and Chincholi block in Kalaburagi district have taken off and are working well.The strategy has many unique aspects:i) Its interventions are multi-sectoral and intergenerational, and directly address the root causes  the inter-generational cycle of malnutrition; the calorie-protein-micronutrient deficit among children, adolescent girls and pregnant/ lactating women; and the information/ awareness deficit among families regarding proper nutritional practices within existing family budgets, regarding proper child, adolescent and maternal care.ii) This is not another food programme. It begins with awareness generation and behaviour change through reasonably spaced nutrition messaging at household and community level. The food supplementation component commences only after the process of behaviour change has been triggered.iii) The most unique feature of this project is that it is being implemented through the Department of Rural Development and Panchayat Raj, and Zilla Parishads, for whom multi-sectorality is an integral mandate.iv) Sequenced interventions gradually bring about a spontaneous convergence and demand creation for other government programmes impacting nutritional status  immunisation, sanitation, drinking water etc.Operational logistics are simple. A Village Nutrition Volunteer (VNV) is appointed for each village and given basic training. There is a Project Supervisor for every 10 villages under a Block Project Manager. The VNVs first task is to identify infants below three years of age, adolescent girls between 11-18 years, and pregnant/lactating women, belonging to BPL families. There are 17,005 beneficiaries in Chincholi block, and 18,001 in Devadurga block.A Nutrition Card, customised for each target group, is given to each beneficiary. The card records the socio-economic details, anthropometric measurements, household details, sources of drinking water and sanitation of the target groups. There is a monthly recording and monitoring of height and weight for children and adolescent girls, and periodic monitoring of other parameters specific to target groups.For infants, details about immunisation, exclusive breast feeding, initiating complementary feeding, diarrhoea episodes are included. For adolescent girls and pregnant/lactating women, there is monthly weight monitoring. This data is computerised and monitored at field and mission level to assess impact and take corrective action.The VNV uses home visits to disseminate nutrition messages to the target groups and their families, and to counsel the beneficiaries, especially regarding prevention of child underweight, pregnancy weight gain, managing diarrhoeal episodes among children, improving condition of severely malnourished or wasted children, or managing any illness.A multi-layered communication strategy has been created for triggering behaviour change. Messages are disseminated in phases to families, community, womens self help groups (SHGs) through different streams of media posters and flipcharts for household counseling; radio, television and wall paintings for families and the community at large, and focus group discussions for SHGs.The messages are simple but critical, focusing on the inter-generational cycle of malnutrition; improving family diets within existing budgets; the importance of complementary feeding for infants after six months; improving health and growth of adolescent girls; proper weight gain during pregnancy and prevention of low birth weight babies etc.Early results show definite improvement in nutritional indicators of the three inter-generational groups  infants under three years of age, adolescent girls, and pregnant and lactating women. What is significant is that this improvement in nutritional status has happened solely on account of behavioural change brought about by the communication strategy and not because of dietary supplementation from the project.Target groupsThe next major intervention is bridging the calorie-protein-micronutrient deficit among the target groups. A medium scale energy food production unit with 2-tonne production capacity per day has been set up with assistance from the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition in both the blocks. Women from SHGs have been trained and are employed for production.Fortified energy food, branded as Shakti Vita and appropriate for the three target groups, is being produced from local farm produce such as wheat, green gram, defatted soya, and distributed to the beneficiaries. Energy food distribution started in October 2016 in Chincholi and in December, 2016 in Devadurga. December data for Chincholi is being analysed, and as expected, the results appear very positive.Convergence of the existing programmes too is done in phases. To begin with, VNVs motivated and assisted families to apply to the ZPs for construction of toilets in their homes. After project interventions started, 2,734 toilets have been constructed in both blocks by the end of March, and are being used.This will be followed by the more difficult areas of convergence such as complete immunisation and Vitamin A administration for children. Real time monitoring of the beneficiaries nutrition indicators, particularly underweight, stunting and wasting of children, BMI of adolescent girls, pregnancy weight gain, incidence of low birth weight babies, is stringently done at field level where corrective action is also taken, and at mission level.The pilot projects and their early results have been appreciated by the state administration, with a general consensus that they should be replicated in the chronic malnutrition pockets of Karnataka. So the people concerned are working on that, and on getting Karnatakas malnutrition on course.(The writer is retired Secretary to the Government of India)"

It will be followed by distribution of high quality drought-tolerant seeds to the farmers who are part of the scheme, said Joint Director of Agriculture M. G. Mohamed Iqbal. The farmers will also be extended back-ended subsidy to carry out summer ploughing that helps them destroy weeds at the root level and kill disease-causing organisms through exposure to sunlight. A cluster development team comprising officials of agriculture and allied departments, and farmers representatives would be coordinating the implementation of the initiatives to ensure its effectiveness."

No one can stop it,"" he added.""Bengal, which was once at the forefront of development, now lags behind. Unemployment is high and the TMC government is following the policy of appeasement (of minorities),"" alleged Shah.Talking about Modi's 'Sabka sath sabka vikas' slogan, he said development was reaching ""every nook and corner"" of the country, but the TMC government was ""not allowing"" it to happen in Bengal.The BJP president will also take the prime minister's message of ""development for all"" to a place where a violent movement to uproot Indian state had started, she said.Besides Shah, top party leaders, including almost every union minister, have been roped in to drive the campaign at booth-level to boost the organisation's prospects."

5922bfa27be9e01fe6dfa26e,Bidar fort beckons!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/apr/29/bidar-fort-beckons-1598902.html,2017-04-29,"HYDERABAD: After chasing blackbucks in the Jungle Lodge Resort in Vilaspur (Karnataka), I chose to kill the next day in the nearby Bidar, a mere 18 km from the resort. Bidar city is well known for its Bidri handicraft products, as much for its rich history. It is also considered one of the holiest places for Sikh pilgrimage (Gurdwara Nanak Jhira Saheb). I often find people travelling from Hyderabad for a days trip to Bidar, which is around 140 kms away  a three-hour drive.On the way they stop for cutting chai or cool watermelon or simply munch time-pass moong phalli (peanuts) in the air-conditioned comfort of their car. Of course, whenever something rural and fancy catches their eye, there will be a brief stop for a selfie moment.I did not enter Bidar city. Instead, I caught a glimpse of Karnatakas richly textured history in the rugged 15th century Bidar Fort: surrounded by a triple-moated wall hewn out of red rock, with intricate battlements and an imposing gateway.Took a walk through the ruins, which were once royal baths, kitchens, audience halls and pleasure pavilions. Experienced the Rang Mahal with its elaborately carved wooden pillars, Persian couplets engraved in tiles and exquisite mother-of-pearl inlay work. Whats more, I came back much invigorated!Bidar FortBidar Fort is considered as one of the most formidable forts of the country. It was distinctly planned and built on the brink of the Deccan Plateau by Sultan Ahmed Wali between AD 1426-1432. Engineers and architects of various countries were employed on its design and construction. The fort is surrounded by 5.5 km of defence wall consisting of 37 massive polygonal bastions and seven strong irregular rhombic shaped gates.The fort is entered from the southeast by a zigzag passage protected by three gateways. It is said that the unique triple moat defence, resembling the medieval European forts was made by Turkish mercenaries.Another interesting feature is the massive magazines for arms storage and tunnels for escape in emergency. Within the fort are interesting monuments like Takht Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Rangeen Mahal, Gagan Mahal, Shahi Matbakh (royal kitchen), Diwan-i- Aam (public audience hall), Sola Khamba Mosque, Naubat Khana etc. I spent time at some of the most noteworthy monuments.Sola Khamba MosqueOriginally it was the principal mosque, Masjid-i-Jami of Bidar. It is also called zanana masjid. In 1656 AD when Aurangzeb, as viceroy of the Deccan from the imperial court at Delhi, conquered Bidar, he hastened to this mosque to have the khutba recited in the name of his father Shah Jehan, as proclamation of his sovereignty in the newly acquired territory. In the inscription, dated to AD 1423-24, it is mentioned that the founder of this mosque was Qubli Sultani.The mosque is called so, as it has 16 pillars in the front. It is of vast dimensions and one of the largest mosques of India noted for its architectural style. It consists of a large prayer hall divided into a multitude of aisles by massive circular columns.The roof is crowned by a majestic dome, raised on a high clerestory with windows of perforated screen work in different geometrical patterns. A parapet of pleasing designs above the imposing arcade adds to its beauty. It is an excellent example of the second phase of the Deccani style.Gagan MahalThis was originally built by the Bahmani kings, but later the Barid Shahi rulers made some alterations and additions. The palace has two courts, the outer one apparently was used by the staff and the guards of the palace and the inner one was for the royal ladies. The main building of the palace lies to the south of the inner court, used by the sultan and his harem.Rangeen MahalRangeen Mahal, situated in the fort, near Gumbad Darwaza, is unique because of its decoration with blue coloured Persian tiles and other artwork. Woodcarving done here is not only precious but also unique.The walls of the mahal are adorned with mother-of-pearl of the finest quality inlaid in jet-black stone. Floral patterns and calligraphic text are also depicted here. Stone carving, stucco art are other attractions of this monument. It was rebuilt during Barid Shahi period. The design of this monument represents the blend of both Hindu and Muslim architecture. There are rooms in the basement of the Rangeen Mahal.Tarkash MahalIt is said to have been built for Turkish wife of the sultan. From the remains of the decorative work found in the ornamentation of the walls, it can be said that the mahal was built or extended by the Barid Shahi Sultans who had kept large harem with ladies from different nationalities. The rooms are decorated with stucco work.Takht MahalBuilt by Ahmed Shah, this royal residence was originally decorated with coloured tiles and stone carvings part of which can be seen even today. It has two side royal pavilions with lofty arches and a spacious hall at the back of which lies the sultan's room. The building has stately dimensions and exquisite surface decoration. The coronations of several Bahmanis and Barid Shahi sultans were held there. From the royal pavilion, which is situated behind the throne palace, I had a great view of the valley and low land below.After that leisurely wandering in the fort, I sat and watched some ladies doing a puja, right at the entrance of the fort gate. We chatted along as they broke coconuts, sprinkled haldi kumkum, lighted incense and showered flower petals. I thought the fort richly deserved the worship though they said the ritual was meant for a particular deity.(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs atvijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"
593d68c77be9e00dabcc0464,‘I am not emotionally attached to my films’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/i-am-not-emotionally-attached-to-my-films/article18350131.ece,2017-05-02,"Four years ago, Richa Chadda watched Fallen Art , a six-minute-long animated film. The film featured a military general arranging dead bodies of soldiers in a manner that it would resemble art. It was a dark comedy on war and in todays times, it is still relevant, says the 30-year-old actor. It is the same relevance that she hopes her debut short film Khoon Aali Chithi would manage to retain. Directed by Chaddas close friend Rupinder Inderjit, she agreed to back the project the very first time it was pitched to her. It was my friendship with the director that got me on board. It just happened by accident. I never consciously considered the idea of turning producer, she says of her decision to switch gears from acting to production.When The Hindu caught up with her, the actor was returning from Chandigarh where she had been to promote her production debut. She along with her team also visited the Golden Temple to seek blessings prior to the films online release. Confined to a runtime of 14 minutes, Khoon Aali Chithi is set against the backdrop of the Khalistani movement, with a narrative that traces the manner in which the political turmoil exploded and the repercussions of the same on the locals. The film portrays insurgents disturbing a villages calm, while serving as an obstacle to a certain budding romance. The film explores an innocent love story of a young boy who is set to write a letter with his blood for his lover but then tragedy ensues. The film is about the human casualty of conflict, explains Chadda, adding that the format allows the maker freedom to explore and experiment. With the present renaissance in online content, Chadda is confident her film will reach out to audiences through the format. If we were to make a feature film on the same subject, the budget would be significantly larger as we would have to invest in detailing the period the film is set in. Releasing a film online also means, theres no censonship, she smiles.The online channel on YouTube that Chadda has opted to showcase her short film on has previously buffered films such as Sujoy Ghoshs Ahalya , Jaydeep Sarkars Nayantaras Necklace , Neeraj Pandeys Ouch , Jyothi Kapur Dass Chutney, Vikram Bhatts Lets Play , among others. In the coming months, well see many bigger players entering the fray as the platform is growing at a disproportionate rate, she adds confidently.Chaddas journey in Hindi films began with the short yet memorable role in Dibakar Banerjees 2008 comedy, Oye Lucky! Lucky Oye where she essayed the role of Dolly. She also received many accolades for her last stint  playing Sukhpreet in Omung Kumars Sarbjeet. But Chadda doesnt believe in resting on her laurels. I am not emotionally attached to my films at all. I move on after a film wraps up, she says of her ability to disconnect with a project once completed. While Anurag Kashyaps noir gangster saga Gangs of Wasseypur saw her as the spirited and foul-mouthed Nagma Khaatoon, it was Neeraj Ghaywans Masaan, a role that brought her recognition and validation.  Masaan is a very special film for me. Masaan is a universal story and that it won awards at prestigious film festivals only further validates our belief in the film. When Neeraj came to me with the concept, he didnt have any backing for the film. But when I read the script, I knew right away that this is one film I shouldnt miss out on, she emphasises.Chadda will be next seen in the second installment of Fukrey where she will be reprising the role of Bholi Punjaban in the film which also stars Pulkit Samrat , Varun Sharma, Ali Fazal and Manjot Singh. Talking about how she has evolved as an actor, Chadda says, I have become a smarter actor now, technically, adding that shes now better informed about the technical aspects of filmmaking than when she first started out. I miss my initial days. There was a beauty of not knowing too much about everything."
593d6b527be9e00dabcc05f3,"CR bought 100gm curd for Rs. 972, refined oil for Rs. 1,253 a litre, finds RTI application",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/cr-bought-100gm-curd-for-rs-972-refined-oil-for-rs-1253-a-litre-finds-rti-application/article18350080.ece,2017-05-02,"A recent application filed as a second appeal under the Right to Information (RTI) Act by an activist has revealed that the Central Railway's catering department purchased certain food items to stock their warehouses at several times the maximum retail price (MRP).After railway authorities failed to share information on purchase of food items sought in his RTI application, activist Ajay Bose filed a first appeal. The response to this revealed that each kg of Amul curd was purchased an eye-watering Rs. 9,720. Mr. Bose had filed his query after learning that the catering department was running at a huge loss.I filed the application in July 2016, but didnt get a reply from CR. It appeared they wanted to cover something up. I filed an appeal and the appellate authority show-caused the railways asking them to provide details sought by me within 15 days. Despite this, there was no reply even after several months, Mr. Bose told The Hindu .Realising that the department concerned was intentionally ignoring his appeal, Mr. Bose filed a second one. This time, I received a reply with details, which were shocking: they purchased 100 grams of curd, which costs Rs. 25, for Rs. 972. In fact, the railways had bought most items at costs much than their MRP.The details pertain to items purchased by the railways catering department, which are stocked at the warehouse in CSTM and distributed to IRCTC's Jan Ahar canteens, railway base kitchens and trains like Deccan Queen, Kurla-Hazrat Nizamuddin Express.Mr. Bose alleged the railways was incurring losses due to such scams. I was provided with details after a long wait, and information for only a few months was shared though I had wanted it for a full year. Commodities like chicken with bone, tur dal , moong dal , besan and even tissue paper have been purchased at inflated costs.As per the reply, other commodities procured by the railways included 58 litres of refined oil for Rs. 72,034 in March 2016, or a litre of refined oil for Rs. 1,241. It also bought 150 packets of Tata Salt for Rs. 2,670, or Rs. 49 per packet instead of its then MRP of Rs. 15, water bottles and soft drinks were for Rs. 59 per bottle.A few items, however, were procured at the correct rates including samosas, onions and potatoes.Stock mismatchThe RTI reply also revealed a distribution mismatch. While 250 kg of flour was purchased for Rs. 7,680, the railways claimed to have distributed 450 kg of flour (90 kg to base kitchen and 360 kg to the IRCTC-run Jan Ahar canteen). Similarly, 35 kg of maida was shown as distributed, though only 20 kg was purchased. It also bought 255 kg of Basmati rice, but said it distributed 745 kg to the base kitchen and the Kurla-Hazrat Nizamuddin Express.According to the railway reports, the Jan Ahar Canteens and stalls at LTT and other stations are running at a loss, but the RTI reply gives us the actual picture, Mr. Bose said.Ravindra Goyal, Divisional Railway Manager (DRM), CR, said, This must be a typing error, but I will look into the matter. Subodh Jain, former General Manager, CR, said, There is a proper channel for purchasing these items. The purchase committee finalise the rates.Requesting anonimity, a senior railway official from New Delhi who has worked closely with CR, said, This cannot be happen on paper as there are some scandals in the past in which CSTM catering was at fault. Every year, the railways shows loss in crores of rupees, and the reason is such scams. These need to be looked into seriously.Subhash Gupta, member, Zonal Railway Users Consultative Committee (ZRUCC) and president, Rail Pravasi Sangh, said, This is a very serious issue and needs to be looked into by senior railway authorities. So many items being purchased at higher costs and a difference in procurement and distribution cannot be typing mistakes. This has been happening since long and passengers are always the losers. Due to such scams, the railways claims it is running at a loss, increases fares and decreases passenger amenities. Action should be taken against officials involved.This must be a typing error, but I will look into the matterRavindra GoyalDivisional Railway Manager, Central Railway"

The gingelly oil would be heated in a cast iron vessel, and pounded on my head by my grandmother, mother, or Meenakshi, our squat aayah. The gingelly oil would be replaced with kerosene when either my sister or I came home with lice. (My sister, bless her, took great pleasure in chasing me around the house on kerosene days with a box of matches in her hand, insisting that the treatment was only effective if the lice were burned to death.)The oil, once poured, was rhythmically drummed in with slaps and thumps, the intensity of which varied, depending on the mood of the person administering the massage. You would then be left in the bathroom, half blinded by the oil which had seeped into your eyes with a bowl of homemade powder (shikakai) and an unguent made of moong dal powder and other nice smelling things.Of course, I identify all of this as nice smelling now, but back then I hated it. I wanted to use the Body Shop shower gel from Singapore. The shikakai dries up and flakes out of my head and makes it look like i have brown dandruff Id whine. kozhambu again? Id groan.Post bath, homemade perfume (sambrani) was wafted through my hair, and i would hold my nose as a green kashayam was administered. After all of this, if you hadnt gone in to a catatonic state yet there was the aforementioned lunch.Why am I thinking of all of this? My parents just left after a two weeks stay with us during which my children were treated to (or in my younger sons mind, tortured with) multiple oil baths. The boys had a new experience, as in our home rituals are like winged unicorns. They dont exist. Baths and brushing teeth is a punishment and something to weasel out of or negotiate over: Ill brush my teeth if I can have 5 more minutes of screen time! Not that their grandmother was not interested in negotiations.In her no-nonsense demeanour that I remember from long ago, she corralled two slippery boys into the bathroom and proceeded to render them even more slippery with copious amounts of oil. Sucks the heat right out, my mother would mutter. This was new for the boys, as in our home, oil application is usually a quick squirt from a bottle of Parachute onto their head before a swim.My parents have returned and this morning, I attempted to coax the boys into having an oil bath. They looked at me and said that they would wait till their grandmothers next trip to have one and went back to playing with their Lego.Ah well. Some rituals are weekly and others take place twice a year. Amma, the boys are waiting.(The writers parenting philosophy is: if theres no blood, dont call me)"
593d293a7be9e00dabcbd930,Railways suspends 3 officials,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/railways-suspends-3-officials/article18365696.ece,2017-05-03,"The Central Railway on Tuesday suspended three officials and transferred one for giving out wrong information through RTI, which showed that the Railways had overpaid for certain purchases made.This follows a report on Tuesday in the Mumbai edition of The Hindu, which mentioned how an RTI application filed by activist Ajay Bose as a second appeal revealed that the CR had bought 100 gm of curd for Rs. 972 and refined oil for Rs. 1,253 a litre. The reply claimed that the commodities that were procured by the Railways included 58 litres of refined oil for Rs. 72,034 in March 2016, 150 packets of Tata Salt for Rs. 2,670 or Rs. 49 a packet, instead of its then MRP of Rs. 15, and water bottles and soft drinks for Rs. 59 a bottle.Taking note of the news report, Railway Minister Suresh Prabhu ordered the Chairman Railway Board (CRB) to enquire and take action on any wrongdoings.Addressing a press conference later in the day, Shailendra Kumar, Chief Commercial Manager, CR, clarified that the costs mentioned in the reply were incorrect and that it was actually an error by RTI staff, and that they have taken action against them.While Douglas Menezes, assistant commercial manager, has been transferred, T. Mani, chief catering inspector, looking after warehouse and catering accounts, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST), C.V. Bhise, chief catering inspector, warehouse, CST, and, Hanumesh Kulkarni, chief inspector, dealing with the said RTI, have been suspended.While preparing the computerised statement, an inadvertent typographical error occurred in the item of Amul curd for January 2016. Upon knowledge of this error, a corrected copy of the statement, along with the relevant documents of records, where the actual figure is reflected, was furnished to the RTI applicant, said a statement by the Railways.Mr. Bose, however, said the corrected copy of the details he had asked for came only after the matter was reported in the newspaper. Why did the Railways wait for 17 months to send me a corrected copy of the details I had asked for? They have made corrections only after I spoke to The Hindu . If they had realised their mistake, they would have sent me the corrected copy earlier, and not after it became news.The statement by the Railways said a detailed examination had revealed that the information was furnished to the RTI applicant by compiling and preparing tabulated sheet from voluminous records pertaining to multiple catering units located at CST, Lokmanya Tilak Terminus, Dadar, and the headquarters.Mr. Bose pointed out that while the Railways had, in its statement, spoken of corrected rates for refined oil, tur , moong daal , Tata salt, and Amul curd, the corrections given to him only pertained to the curd. Why was I not given the corrected rates for other items as well? Most items mentioned in the RTI are above the MRP rates.Narendra Patil, chief PRO, CR, said, The clerical staff failed to mention proper measurement units against the rates of certain catering items. It was further clarified that there is no scam and purchase is as per the market rate.Anil Galgali, an RTI activist, said, The fault is not only of the individual, but the full department, and the Railways is responsible. They have suspended their staff and this proves they are wrong."

The dal was then divided in equal quantity and sent to a public analyst and local health authority for examination.The public analyst in his report had said that the moong dal sample is adulterated and misbranded as the added colour in it was prohibited by the law. On the basis of the report, the local health authority of the civic body submitted complaint under the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act.Patel's lawyer argued in the court that there are no evidences that food inspector had cleaned or dried the bottles in which the mung dal was collected. However, advocate J S Pancholi, on behalf of the complainant, argued that the food inspector had followed all procedures of sampling, sealing and packing in accordance with the law.The court while sentencing the punishment to Patel observed that he had suffered a lot due to longevity of the proceedings for the last 24 years."

""If you're getting two dollars more, three dollars more, this money will be going to the traceability, due diligence and certification schemes."".Bafilemba, of GATT-RN, agreed, saying self-employed miners earn less for the minerals they sell because of ITRI fees imposed on exporters.""This money is ... charged back to the miners. So in principle, its the miners who are paying this money. Its not fair. It should be on the end-users, the giant electronic companies to pay this amount,"" Bafilemba said.But while digging near Numbi, 33-year-old Salomon Kahizi said that though the prices had dropped, the area was safer nowadays for these lone miners, who had frequently been victims of robbery in the past.""When you'd be digging or working they might show up and take everything... But nowadays, those kinds of attacks, we dont see them anymore,"" Kahizi said."

Around Rs 4.2 lakh of counterfeit notes, mostly in Rs 2000 denominations, were seized in the operation.In the first operation, Hamren Police seized a fake note-printing machine from a clandestine location at Harlongjubi village in Karbi Anglong district and arrested two persons. ""Special blank papers, used for printing the notes, were also seized from the printing press. The arrested persons were identified as Bajong Timung and Bidyaram Teran,"" police sources said.Besides fake notes of Rs. 2,000 denominations, small notes were also seized. ""The duo is suspected to be involved in exchanging notes on commission. Income Tax department has been informed about the recovery too,"" sources added.At the same time, in a separate operation in Darrang district, police nabbed one Billal Hussain, along with a fake note-printing machine, from Ananda Bazaar village of Dhula. Police are quizzing him to nab others involved in the racket. ""Inks and printers used for the purpose of manufacturing fake notes were also seized,"" added police.With the latest seizures, FICN worth over Rs 6 lakh has been seized across the state within the last fortnight alone. Last week, while one person from Bongaigaon, Sarat Basumatary, was arrested with Rs 85,000 from the city's Lokhra area, Border Security Force (BSF) personnel seized Rs 1 lakh in Rs 2000 notes from Khagrachar village near the Indo-Bangladesh international border in south Salmara district.FICN worth around Rs 95,09,000 has been seized from across Assam whereas FICN with face value of Rs 10,25,000 has been seized from neighbouring Meghalaya in the last three years.Recently, the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which is probing the FICN racket across the country, alerted state police that high quality counterfeit notes printed in Pakistan are being smuggled to the state through Bangladesh.The police source said, ""An agent is offered between Rs 40,000 to Rs 60,000 for each lot of FICN worth Rs 1,00,000 from Bangladesh. Once it reaches India through Assam from Bangladesh, a huge chunk of it goes to Uttar Pradesh and the southern states, particularly to locations from where terror modules are operating."""
5922f10d7be9e01fc7f5c421,"Unfair, unconstitutional: Multiplex association on capping of movie ticket prices in Karnataka",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/unfair-unconstitutional-multiplex-association-on-capping-of-movie-ticket-prices-in-karnataka/articleshow/58537546.cms,2017-05-06,"The Multiplex Association of India (MAI) and its members released a statement on Wednesday in response to the Karnataka government's decision to cap movie ticket prices at Rs200. Calling the decision unconstitutional, the association questioned the rationality of it and asked the government to withdraw the cap. The statement says, ""We believe that this step is retrograde, irrational, unfair, against the interests of film industry and the people of Karnataka, and also potentially unconstitutional."" The MAI urged the Karnataka government to withdraw this notification immediately.A national association, the MAI represents over 18 regional and national multiplex chains in the country. The associations claims that their members operate more than 500 multiplexes with more than 1800 screens across the country. They represent around 80% of the multiplex industry in India. Key points they made in the statement:In any democratic free market society, the State regulates the prices of only such goods or services which are essential or critical for the economically deprived sections of society, eg, life-saving drugs, or medical services, essential foodgrains, etc., in the public interest. It is extremely unusual, and even unfair, for States to regulate prices of discretionary spending like entertainment. With a multitude of television channels, internet broadcasting services, and other channels of entertainment delivery, all of which have absolutely no pricing control, capping ticket prices on cinema theatres alone, is patently unfair, and goes against the principles of equality enshrined in the Constitution of India.MAI believes that the move to cap ticket prices in Karnataka is extremely investor unfriendly and will stop the growth of new multiplexes in Karnataka. It would also lead to many existing multiplexes to consider shutting down because of financial unviability.Ticket prices vary per seat type, per screen, per show of the day, per day of the week, per movie being screened, per month of the year, and per nature of facilities/technology being provided. This flexibility in deciding ticket prices enable multiplexes to optimise occupancies and hence remain financially viable. This flexibility is an important element necessary for the survival of multiplexes, and if this flexibility is lost, the financial viability of multiplexes will be under serious threat.Being able to charge relatively higher prices on peak shows (like evening shows on weekends) help multiplexes charge lower prices on non-peak shows (like morning shows on weekdays). This helps multiplexes cater to all segments of the market. Loss of this flexibility will actually be counterproductive - if the peak price is capped, the ability of multiplexes to keep lower prices will also be reduced, and hence, this will deprive audiences with limited paying capacity to be able to enjoy a multiplex experience. This will therefore go against the interests of the relatively less affluent sections of the society.Multiplexes make huge investments in world class facilities, cutting edge technology and outstanding service delivery. The experience of watching a movie at a multiplex in India is second to no multiplex anywhere else in the world. These facilities, technology and service cost significantly and multiplexes need to charge ticket prices so as to be able to recover their investments. If there is a price cap, the industry will not be able to make investments in state-of-the-art technology. Features and formats like 3D screens, Dolby Atmos Sound, Laser Projector screens, Screen X, Playhouse/ Junior cinemas, Dolby Cinema, Barco Escape, etc will become unviable and multiplexes will not be able to afford the capex and the opex of such technologies.It is a myth that multiplexes charge astronomically high prices. Multiplexes only charge prices that the audience are willing to pay. Film entertainment is a discretionary spend. If multiplexes charge such a high price that patrons would not be able to afford it, then people would stop seeing movies, occupancies would start to fall, and this would be counter-productive to the commercial interests of such multiplexes.The two largest multiplex chains in India, which together account for around 50% of multiplex screens in the country, have a combined net profit margin of less than 5%, not even sufficient to provide any return on capital. In fact, most of the other multiplexes are barely able to meet their costs. With huge manpower, electricity and lease rental costs, as also extremely high burden of taxes, most multiplexes are either losing money or making very meagre returns on their investments. This clearly shows that multiplexes are not making humungous profit at the cost of their patrons. If there is a ticket price cap, as is proposed, even those multiplexes that are barely surviving, will start making losses.The Government does not control prices of other similar activities, like airlines, amusement centres, hotels, restaurants, etc. There are no price controls on other retail activities as well, like malls, etc. There is no rationale for controlling ticket prices only of cinema theatres, and not any other commercial activity.There does not appear to be any scientific basis for determining the cap of `200. Such arbitrary cap irrespective of the city, the quality of the multiplex, the kind of investments that have been made in the property, etc smacks of irrationality and arbitrariness. There is also no rationale for allowing only 10% ""gold-class"" seats to be free of a price cap, or for exempting only Imax, and not other advance technologies, from the price cap.-- With inputs from Niharika.Lal@timesgroup.com"

Driving past Gole Market the other day, I recalled how often I used to go there, and how many of those eateries are not there anymore.Once upon a time, kababs meant Galinas, which sold juicy seekh kababs and roomali rotis. If we wanted Kerala mutton fry, we went to Shridharans. Bengali food meant the Basu Lodge, where you got home-style dal and veggies, and a small sweet shop called Bengal Sweet Home, which sold delicious Bengali samosas. And when we wanted fish, we went to Gujarat Fisheries.The shops have all downed their shutters, and I seldom find myself in Gole Market any more. But a thread on Facebook pushed me into making a trip to this little market area in central Delhi a few days ago.The FB conversation  on this popular site called Delhi Food Walks  was on chholey bhaturey.Everybody had an opinion on where the fare was the best. I think the best chholey bhaturey are still to be found at Chachas in Kamla Nagar, Nagpals in Amar Colony, Nand in Sadar Bazar and Standard in Old Rajendra Nagar. But a few diehard foodies  including old friend Tulu Patnaik  swore by Odeon Sweets on Bhagat Singh Market in Gole Market.Always happy to try out something new, I landed up there. The name was familiar and I realised that I had actually eaten their chholey bhaturey long years ago when the sweet shop was on the middle lane in Connaught Place, near the Odeon theatre. This is now on the Bhagat Singh Market Road which is the main road that leads you to Gole Market from CP. The address is 22, Bhagat Singh Market, and the phone numbers are 64656470 and 9716345474.The place is known for its sweets, too, so I tried out a bit of the moong dal ki halwa (Rs. 600 a kilo), which I thought was good, well roasted and deliciously rich. But I was on Mission Chholey Bhaturey, so I packed some for lunch (Rs. 70 a plate) and went right back home.And it was quite an enjoyable lunch, too. The chholey bhaturey had come with some green chutney, thin strips of pickled raw mango, pickled green chillies and onion slices. I laid them out on my steel ki thali, tore off a bit of the fluffy bhatura, dipped it into a mound of chholey, lightly topped it with the green chutney and popped it into the mouth. Then I bit into a green chilli, had some of the mango pickle and the onion slices and burped elegantly.In the final analysis, I think my four favourites still get the tiara. This was nice, but the chholey would have tasted better had it been less oily and just a wee bit more moist. I found it a little too dry. The bhaturey was excellent, fluffy and light (well, they are not light, I know, but a good bhatura should always appear light). Overall it was a good lunch. Not quite healthy, I agree, but satisfying nevertheless.The Odeon sojourn makes me want to go back to some of my old favourites. I think its time I did a comparative study of chholey bhaturey shops in Delhi, and like the Miss India pageant (which, I may as well confess, we disrupted at a function in Delhi many, many years ago), give away crowns. Those who wish to join the panel of judges may please send in their applications."

To the Ahmedabad crime world, these are aliases of criminals as colourful as their personas. Crime is perhaps the only profession where having an ominously threatening nickname is a good career move. Where Mumbai has `Tiger' Memon or `Chhota' Rajan, Ahmedabad has its own line-up of felons, identified by their aliases got from their looks, habits, modus operandi or physical traits.Ahmedabad's Spiderman is no cute crime-fighting webslinger. He is 32-year-old Omkar Bhadoria, a resident of Ranip, who has been named in more than 50 cases of murder, loot and burglaries. ""His special skill is using pipes to break into houses at night. He targets houses on the topmost floor of a building. He slides down the pipe from the terrace to the house, burgles it and slides down the pipe to safety even as people look for him on the stairs or the terrace,"" said police.Interestingly, Bhadoria does not flee the society. ""He crawls up the pipes to the terrace in an adjacent building tower and spends the night there.When dawn breaks, he escapes with the loot. He also keeps changing his house frequently to avoid getting caught,"" said the police, who gave him the nickname after discovering his modus operandi.Usually, the police have a limited role in the `naamkaran' of goons. Often, their gang members or locals give them such singular sobriquets. ""The names give them a unique identity. It also strikes fear in the hearts of locals and rivals,"" said a senior officer.Kalupur residents Satish Ruparelia and Raju Panchal murdered a businessman in Shahibaug, cut off his head and dumped it at Adalaj ni Vaav in the early 90's. ""When they went to jail, Ruparelia got the name `Badi Mundi' while Panchal became `Chhoti Mundi,"" he said. Similarly, Kalu `Gardan' of Juhapura who was arrested for his alleged involvement in the murder of social activist Nadeem Saiyed earned the nickname because he would always attack his victim on the neck first.""When the details of such men are entered into our records, we retain the nicknames to help us identify them easily,"" said police.This might be a tad difficult when it comes to Bakra, or should that be Bakras ? Vijay `Bakra' Chunara of Gota is an expert chain-snatcher and burglar. ""The 34-year-old has terrible hygiene. He hates taking baths and stinks so much that even when we arrest him, we make him stand downwind to avoid gagging,"" said a crime branch official. Smelly as a goat, it is easy to deduce how he ended up with his nickname.Then, there's Ajay `Bakra' of Sardarnagar who is notorious for stealing laptops, as well as snatching chains and cash. ""He is always seen chom ping on vegetables. He will walk past vegetable laaris and pick up carrots, radishes, tomatoes to munch. Due to this habit, people began calling him bakra,"" said police.Zakir Shaikh Vejalpur is `Chuha' because he is sharp as a rat and tough to catch. ""Shaikh, who is involved in about 20 cases of house break-ins, has sharp hearing which alerts him to the presence of people. He scuttles away, abandoning his work rather than be caught,"" said police.Ritesh Garange of Kubernagar who specialises in stealing laptops from cars is known as `Andho' as he acts blind and fools his victims into belie ving he is innocent. ""When the victim looks elsewhere, Garange will steal laptops or other valuables from the vehicle within seconds. He operates mainly in areas like Satellite and CG Road,"" said police. Pappu Sharma of Vatva, who is accused of theft and robbery, is called Pappayyu by his gang as the 48-yearold's face resembles the papaya fruit.Gufran Pathan (37) of Rakhial who is accused of theft and loot is known as Hanuman due to his resemblance to the Monkey God.`Mungdo' is the moniker of Rajesh Jiliya, a 35-year-old from Kubernagar who steals insignificant things inclu ding animals like goats. ""He hardly speaks. So, people call him mungdo (dumb),"" said police.Aman Pathan, a 43-year-old from Juhapura who was charged with theft and possession of arms is known as `Bhangariyo', because he was a scrap dealer before he turned to crime. Kirit `Dhoom' got his nickname after a tipoff led cops to him for masterminding highway robberies using high-speed bikes. His MO was similar to ones used in the movie `Dhoom' and his gang members christened him with the nickname.In many cases, gang mates and even the police don't know the real names of the gangsters since they are known only by their nicknames. DCP Deepen Bhadran said, ""Aliases of names are an important part of police records and it plays a significant role in crime detection. Many criminals are known by their aliases whereas their names may not strike a chord."""
5922c7eb7be9e01fe6dfad75,From seed to cattle feed,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/may/07/from-seed-to-cattle-feed-1602032.html,2017-05-07,"SIRSI, CHITRADURGA : ere is some fodder for thought. The drought in the state has farmers looking for ways to get fodder. One option: growing fodder using the hydroponics method which requires less water. This green diet is making cattle in Sirsi and Challakere very happy.Two farmers--Mahesh S Shetty from Sirsi in Uttara Kannada district and Suresh of Challakere in Chitradurga district -- are reaping the benefits of adopting this practice. They say growing their own fodder is by far proving to be the most viable option.Growing green fodder hydroponically is now becoming popular in drought-prone areas because it requires less water. It is a technique of growing fodder without soil.Fodder has become a rare commodity for many farmers in Sirsi  they purchase fodder from the market or wait for government supplies.Acting upon a suggestion from a local veterinarian, Mahesh adopted the hydroponics system. According to the system that is practised in countries like Israel, seeds of maize or horse gram or green gram are first soaked in water for a couple of days.seeds sprout and become a six- to eight-inch high mat ofroots, and green foliage, which are fed to animals | ExpressIn a few days, they will sprout and in a week or so will become a six- to eight-inch high mat. The mat of roots, and green foliage is fed in its entirety to the animals. The advantage of growing fodder this way is that there is no big land requirement.Mahesh has been growing fodder for the last three years. He says that even during the current drought, he has enough fodder to feed his cattle. What's more, his livestock is giving 25% extra milk now.Mahesh has 11 cows at his dairy farm located near Sirsi. When he started farming at his backyard he was given a subsidy of `30,000 by Samarpana Multipurpose Society of Sirsi and he had to invest `30,000 on the system. With a total cost of `60,000, he set up a hydroponics unit at his dairy farm.Currently I am growing 50 kg green fodder by spending only `105 per day, and feeding 11 cows which are giving good quantity and quality of milk. The fat content in the milk has increased, he noted.The drought has hit agricultural business in the region. The arecanut and coconut farms have gone dry and many dairy owners are finding it difficult to get fodder. Now after seeing Mahesh feeding his cows with green fodder, many are coming forward to take up leaf farming. Even the district animal husbandry department has kept aside `9.75 lakh to help farmers adopting the system.Green initiativeThey say the grass is greener on the other side. But for Suresh of Gorlakatte village, Challakere taluk, Chitradurga district, the grass is actually green on his side. He too has adopted the hydroponics system to grow green fodder.While every graduate dreams of a good job, Suresh turned towards dairy farming. And has been successful too. He started off with just a couple of cows. Today, his Preetham Dairy Farm boasts of 100 head of cattle. Though there was enough fodder initially, he started facing hardships in the last three years due to severe drought.This prompted him to look for alternative methods of getting fodder for his cattle. He visited many places ---from Ahmedabad, to Mumbai and Udupi--- and found a viable mode in the form of hydroponics.Suresh has set up 16 units of hydroponics in his farm wherein fodder is grown in 1,075 trays. It can feed his 36 cows for months. Each tray consisting of 700 grams of maize can yield 6kg of nutritious chemical-free fodder. The cattle are getting nutritious green fodder and they yield good milk. The health of the cattle is also good as the fodder is chemical- free and nutritious, he saidExplaining how the system works, he said the best quality maize which is picked from the market is soaked in water for 24 hours and poured in an airtight bag and kept for the next 48 hours for germination. Once the seeds are germinated, they are placed in specialised hydroponic trays and kept in a designated place which will enable the robust growth of the plants. After a gestation of about a week, the maize plants are ready to be used as fodder.And like their cattle enjoy the green fodder, these farmers enjoy the substantial savings from this farming practice."

Reuters file photoWith the summer at its peak and water bodies fast depleting across the Deccan, persistent efforts by Jankidevi Bajaj Gram Vikas Sanstha (JBGVS) in 2016 in drought prone areas of Aurangabad, in line with Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan of Government of Maharashtra, are yielding results.This year, 30 villages including Harshi Khurd, Harshi Budruk, Thergaon, Dadegaon Khurd, Dadegaon Budruk, Nandar, Limbgaon, Kaundar, Karhol, Davarwadi, Darakwadi, Kolghar and Chaurhyahattar Jalgaon; have been freed from tanker dependency as of today. JBGVS has worked in these villages, either directly or by funding another NGO - AFARM.JBGVS and its team have been toiling in 51 dusty villages of the district throughout last year (42 before monsoon of 2016) and continue till date. It has achieved the humungous task of widening and deepening streams/nullahs over 55 km at sites upstream of existing cement nullah bunds (CNBs).This has been done across Aurangabad, Paithan, Vaijapur, Gangapur and Fulambri talukas, as a part of Bajaj group's CSR projects. Desilting of five percolation tanks has been completed.Besides, 27 new CNBs and 15 Gabion structures were constructed. With all this work, 25,000 TCM of surface water storage capacity has been created. Soil and water conservation trainings were also conducted.The increased storage capacity on the surface led to better percolation of water during the good monsoon of 2016, with all the nullahs that were deepened before monsoon were filled with water 2-3 times.Randhir Patil, Project Manager, JBGVS, informs, Due to the watershed work, aquifers were recharged. For instance, while digging in Harshi even in March 2017, water accumulated up to a two feet level. Similar digging in Karhol led to water seeping up to a 4-5 feet level, while Mharola also has some water left even now in the deepened nullahs.In the one km periphery of the deepened nullahs, wells and bore wells that had earlier dried up have now got rejuvenated and water level has increased by 3-7 metres. Drinking water problem for the dry season has been solved. At present, there is no need for tankers in the above mentioned 30 villages. Till 2015, tankers were required from September onwards.Improved agriculture and other benefitsIn many cases, multiple crops are being sown throughout the year with watering possible up to 3-4 times. Naturally, agriculture is improving. For instance, cotton yield, which had dipped to 3-4 quintals per acre, is expected to go up to 7-8 quintals.Moreover, the silt dug up from nullahs was used in restoring fertility of 144 hectares of farmland, building 20 km of temporary farm roads and protective bunds around 27 hectares of farmland and levelling 36 hectares of other land.Team spirit and better awareness about water conservation among villagers, revival of horticulture, water for domestic animals and women empowerment through reduced drudgery (no need to bring water from far) are the other tangible benefits.Commenting on the development, C P Tripathi, Chairman, JBGVS, said Taking inspiration from the age old practice of enabling retention and percolation of as much water as possible at the very place where it falls as rain, JBGVS has successfully transformed the water situation in many villages. We are happy to be a part of the Jalyukt Shivar Abhiyan of the government and we also congratulate the villagers for all the cooperation extended by them. We look forward to watershed work on a larger scale with inputs from all stakeholders."
5922ccc67be9e01fe6dfb3bb,Rats! they did it again,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2017/may/09/rats-they-did-it-again-1602735.html,2017-05-09,"The Bihar police claim that rats consumed several thousand litres of seized liquor from their maalkhanas, or record rooms, has led to much media mirth and merriment. Years ago, a police station in Kolkata had claimed that a hanuman had broken into their maalkhana and stolen a huge cache of jewellery recovered from robbery.While we might chuckle over such claims, rats do cause immense damage to police record rooms. Consider this: Hapless police in Karnal, Haryana reportedly hired a couple of domesticated white rats to scare away an army of rats merrily chewing its way through documents. The damage goes way beyond maalkhanas. Rats eat and contaminate thousands of tons of food stored in government godowns and trains. To the extent that a sub-clause in the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act, 1954, says wheat, maize, jowar, bajra, rice, masoor, urad, moong, chana and arhar shall be free of adulteration, but with five pieces of rodent hair and faeces permitted (per kilogram). When challenged, the government said that a zero-rat-excreta/hair level would be impossible to comply with.Rats gnaw into the insulation of power lines, causing short circuits and fires. Field rats, apart from damaging crops, build burrows which weaken irrigation canal banks, causing unexpected floods. In 2001, after terrorist rats attacked the Parliament, India mobilised troops along the border. This involved laying and mapping minefields in sensitive locations to deter enemy incursions. In 2002, when we decided to stand down without a fight, the area had to be demined. But field rats had apparently shifted hundreds of small anti-personnel mines to their burrows. Fifty-eight civilians and a 100 soldiers were killed, while 310 others were hurt by these landmines between January 2002 and March 2004 in the three states bordering Pakistan. After causing so much death and destruction, can we really blame the rats in Bihar for wanting a drink?"

That was very impressive because it was in the nukkad natak style and when all of them were enacting it, I was deeply moved. They are so inspiring. When you know about them and know what they have gone through and emerged stronger and more confident through it all, that makes you feel strong. Jisko aap achhe se, nazdeek se dekhte ho, toh uske liye aur strong feeling aati hai. I'm so happy that they've all come to meet me today because they all work. They have taken out time from their work just to meet me and that is indeed a very humbling experience. I am so happy to see them now, they look so happy and that's because they are financially independent. That happiness of prosperity is evident on their faces.""Ask Imtiaz if the story of any one of these women inspires him to make a film, and he says, ""I don't want to sound boring in anything that I do. I think that is against the concept of the entertainment that I have to be a part of or I'd like to be a part of. But the point is, I think it is also disservice if you have a movie that is about people in grief etc, that sounds really boring. I myself wouldn't go to watch a movie like that. And there's a general positivity in the outlook of women. I have that personally because of my values in life or just the women that have been around me when I was a child. I think that might be finding its way into the films that I make. So in a way, I want to celebrate women and not highlight their misery.""Celebrate women? ""Yes of course! Women are smarter than men, I'll say that. It's always easier to communicate with them because somehow, they are also less guarded. So it's always easier for me to talk to them - rather, I'd say it's more fun. Maybe that's a male thing, you know. It's always more entertaining and fun to be with women. It's just a different feeling when you're with men. So in a woman, I see so many dimensions that I am inadvertently attracted towards that character and I am tempted to celebrate that smartness and that openness. It comes out of my interest. It's my interest in women that makes me shape their characters well in my movies,"" he says.Imtiaz enjoying the khasta-aloo and jalebi he got from Chowk (BCCL/ Farhan Ahmad SiddiquiDoes he plan to make a film in UP, what with the state winning the National Award for the Most Film Friendly State and with so many filmmakers coming to shoot here? ""I have heard of the UP film policy, though I don't know much about it. But I guess they have some kind of rebate that they give to filmmakers because back in Mumbai, there were some filmmakers who were talking about it and thinking of making a film in UP. The prospects are quite good where shooting in UP is concerned. I'm thinking of coming here to shoot. I was going around Lucknow and I am kind of opening my eyes towards UP and also towards what Lucknow has to offer. My trips here have been so short that I really have not understood anything, honestly. I have only heard about it (Lucknow) and would like to see more of it before I think of setting a story here. I like to be familiar with a place before I set a movie there so that I can get the feel and nuance of the place right, so that my story and the characters fit in perfectly and don't seem out of place. So Lucknow can't be ignored, I feel. There's so much 'story' about Lucknow. Life is short, but I'd like to get into it at some point and shoot a film here,"" said Imtiaz."

Over the years, unable to bring about a change in mindset of the people concerned, we have reconciled ourselves to the prevailing situationbe it in the office, at home or in society. Gone are the days when we used to raise eyebrows at people buying edible stuff from vendors on the streets. Today, we have only happily joined them, lapping up all that is available, unmindful of the dust being kicked up by the passing vehicles or the insects swarming the area. With both hands busy, we ward off the flies sitting on our plate with our head much like the bovines, standing nearby.A prominent speaker at a health forum recently commented in a satirical tone that our bodies, over the years, have become so immune to virtually all disease-causing-germs and bacteria. Thanks primarily to the polluted environment that we live in and the contaminated stuff that we consume in our everyday life, if we were to live in good clean sanitary conditions or be served with pure hygienic stuff, we are more likely to fall ill.My colleaguehappily married for over twenty-five years had a tiff with his wife the other day, which picked up steam and nearly reached the family court for formal separation. The issuebasically started with a long grey strand of hair being found in the sweet porridge served to him by his better half as prasad, after performing the pooja. The presence of the alien particle annoyed my colleague who promptly raised the issue with his wife. And strangely, his normally docile wife chose to confront him in a no-holds barred mode.Just one hair strand and you flare up, she countered in a measured tone. Remember even the government permits five pieces of rodent hair and rat excreta in all the food material made available to the common man, like wheat, maida, jowar, bajra, rice, mason, urad, moong, chana and arhar. If you dont believe, read the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act 1954, where even the government has admitted that it is next to impossible to provide food items totally free from such alien stuff, she asserted.My colleague looked at her in disbelief. Enthused by the look on his face, she rounded off her reply authoritatively saying, in such a scenario, you complain of a single white hair which has inadvertently entered your share of the porridge. Let me tell you, this strand, unlike rat hair, is devoid of all impurities having been washed with the best of shampoos available in the market, endorsed by the celebrities you idolize. So stop cribbing, just remove it and get going!"

The UNI canteen on Rafi Marg was a particular favourite of mine. We used to live in the building next to that of the news agency, so breakfast often meant a plate of idli with sambar and chutney at UNIs open air canteen. Some afternoons I used to stroll down there for a plate of lemon rice or curd rice, pickle on the side, and evenings meant a plate of besan coated potato fries or a crisp vada.The PTI canteen, on the side of the road from where we lived, was not that exciting. I did go there now and then, and had a dosa or some upma, but the fare at the UNI canteen, we all agreed, was far better.Then, of course, we moved out of Rafi Marg. The last time I went to the UNI canteen some years ago, I found that it was not being run by the rotund Swamy we were familiar with, but somebody from Himachal Pradesh. And my last visit to the old PTI canteen (James canteen, it was called) would have been sometime in the late eighties.Actually, I did go there a few days ago, but this time it was to a brand new canteen that has just opened up in PTI. Apparently, its not a canteen, but a caf  PTI news caf. It is on the ground floor of the PTI building on Parliament Street. It caters to the news service housed in the same building, but is open to the public, too, from 8 in the morning till 10 at night.I found a lot of office-goers from the neighbourhood when I went there around lunch time. We had thought wed have a special thaali (Rs. 100) with a plate of chicken (Rs. 100), but it was a Tuesday, so I was told by the man at the counter that there was no chicken on the menu. So we had the special thaali and a plate of idli.I must say it was rather nice. The helpings are large, and the thaali consisted of two tandoori lachcha parathas, paneer, kadhi pakori, bhindi, raita, salad and rice. The parathas were excellent  crispy on the outside, and soft within. The pakori was prepared with spinach and besan, and was pretty good. The paneer, in a light tomato-based gravy, was mildly spicy, while the bhindi, a bit too mashy, reminded me of home. The idli was soft, the sambar was fresh and the coconut-dal chutney wasnt bad either.I am told the evening snacks there are excellent  the samosa is crisp and flaky, and the stuffing of potatoes is tasty without being overly spiced. The aloo bonda, again, has a nice crisp casing, and a stuffing of spiced, mashed aloo. The samosa and bonda are for Rs. 12 a piece, and come with coriander chutney.The menu is a comprehensive one, and has dishes such as chholey bhaturey, rajma chawal and chicken biryani on it. But there was no chicken that day, as I said, and chholey bhaturey and rajma chawal werent a part of the days menu, a helpful gentleman at the counter informed me.I saw that the menu listed moong dal halwa. So I rushed to get some, only to be told that there were no desserts that day. But I suppose since it has just started, they will face some teething trouble. And the lunchtime crowd can get a bit chaotic.Like old Arnie, I shall return. But I will make sure that its not on a Tuesday."
5922e7ca7be9e01fc7f5b81c,Portrait of the monk as a gastronome,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/portrait-of-the-monk-as-a-gastronome/articleshow/58651789.cms,2017-05-13,"Kolkata: Had a young Narendranath not loved to eat rasogollas, he might never have, years later, become Swami Vivekananda . For, a family elder, had persuaded him to meet Ramakrishna by saying the priest distributed the sweet amongst those who went to meet him. It is entirely possible that Naren, as he was known then, went more because of the rasogolla than Ramakrishna.Mani Shankar Mukherjee  or Shankar, as most of us know him as  has this and hundreds of such priceless nuggets of information in a new book on Swami Vivekananda. 'Ahaare Anahaare Vivekananda', as the name suggests, examines the spiritual life of the monk in a hitherto little-explored light  through his love of, almost bordering on obsession for, food.""In my journey through Swamiji's palate, I have actually been able to map several spiritual landmarks of his life,"" laughs the author when the spirituality-food connection is remarked upon, and recounts the rasagolla story. ""Again,"" he says, ""it was severe stomach ailment that kept bothering Swamiji's general health, especially after he left his mother's care and accepted sanyas at the age of 23. But this proved to be a boon in the larger sense. He had to travel first class both on train and ship so that he could access the toilet at peace. So he rubbed shoulders with the elite. On one such trip he met JRD Tata and told him not to depend on foreign products but start manufacturing steel in India itself. Later, he even advised him to start a science learning institute of excellence and IISc Bangalore was born.""Many other fascinating nuggets emerge. Though it is commonly known that Swamiji loved to eat fowl cutlet from Chacha's Hotel next to his ancestral house on Shimla Street, it was Peeru Hotel, again not too far away, where he was a regular customer. ""He probably got this from his father, who got a Muslim cook to instruct cooks at home how to prepare non-vegetarian dishes. Soon, with his young friends, Swamiji started the Greedy Club at home to experiment with food. What's more, the first item that he ever bought by saving up his pocket money was an encyclopaedia of French cooking,"" the author mentions in the book.And because the monk loved cooking and feeding people as much as he loved eating, he did quite a lot to popularize Indian cuisine wherever he went and with whomever he met. This penchant for cooking and feeding people went on unabated through early monkhood and even when he went abroad to tour the US and the UK. ""Just as he spread Vedanta among foreigners, he started making Indian cuisine popular too. He used to offer to cook Indian meals in the kitchens of whoever offered to host him during his long years of stay abroad. Cooking excited him so much that he decided to start a home delivery service in 1896. He was perhaps the first Indian to think of this kind of startup,"" Shankar says.In fact, Vivekananda's mortar and pestle, Indian spices and a liberal ration of cooking ingredients followed him wherever he went. He used to telegram the other monks at the Ramakrishna Mission to replenish his supplies whenever he ran out. ""Once he had asked for sona moong dal to be sent to him urgently because his khichudi had become a hit with his hosts. The monks roasted the entire supply of moong dal and sent it to him. He was so angry that he sent back a volley of verbal abuse, saying roasted moong dal spoils easily,"" Shankar says from his book.Vivekananda also loved spicy food and used to pep up everything he ate with a dash of green chilli. He missed this abroad, and his hosts tried their best to get some for him whenever they could. Once, in 1896, a host in England paid three shillings to buy just three green chillies for him, which he devoured in one go. ""Just as he loved the heat of spice, he loved the chill of ice-cream too and devised his own recipe. He would add sugar and crushed ice to scraped coconut and relish it. Was it his sweet tooth that finally led to diabetes or whether it was hereditary is not known, but both blood sugar and high blood pressure were added to his chronic stomach ailments to make life miserable for him. Towards the end, he even lost his eyesight because of diabetes. Unfortunately, insulin had not been invented then,"" Shankar rues. However, two of his brothers who outlived him and offered valuable insights into his life through their writings, lived to be over 80. Shankar met both of them and collected valuable information from them about Swamiji.Some of Vivekananda's critics used to pounce upon the fact that he ate non-vegetarian food abroad, something they considered ""sacrilege"" for a monk. ""Ask them to send me a cook and ingredients that can help cook food that they think is suitable for a monk. I don't think there can be any restriction on the food that a monk can have. In a foreign country, I have to eat what my hosts eat, no matter what the pundits at home say. I have allowed my fellow monks of the RKM order to have any kind of food they want. I don't want to impose vegetarianism on anyone but at the same time I must emphasise the benefits of a vegetarian diet. Give me khara (drumsticks) and I can walk any length of the earth to chew them,"" Swamiji had said.A lot of dust is often kicked up over whether Vivekananda had tasted beef or not. Reams have been written for and against it. ""There is no absolute proof on this,"" Shankar says. ""While he had said that he would gratefully eat whatever his hosts would prepare for him abroad, which might mean that he tasted all kinds of meat that foreigners have most naturally, on the other hand, he denied having had steak after his lecture at Chicago, though a monk of another religion who had travelled with him alleged that he had ordered steak after the speakers met at the basement for refreshments. Steak in America those days obviously meant beef steak.""But fish he loved, and of the many varieties he had, Hilsa was his favourite like a true-blue Bengali. Once, while on a steamer crossing over to Narayanganj, now in Bangladesh, he bought 20 Hilsas so that not he alone but even the boatmen could have a feast. But as the fish were getting cooked, he realised that he salivated for hilsa head cooked with pui shaak, a traditional Bengali delicacy. So he got off the steamer midstream, arranged for a smaller boat, went to the bank, disembarked, looked for pui shaak everywhere and finally managed to get some from a farmer who gave it to him in exchange for diksha, according to a nugget from the book. ""He bought 20 Hilsas for Re 1. That was in 1897, and can be easily used as an inflation index,"" Shankar says.""You cannot separate food from Vivekananda,"" says the author. ""In fact, if you have to appreciate his philosophy, you have to understand the gastronome in him that loved to eat and feed and experiment with food. I personally believe that food was his other mission in life, if not the most important one. It lorded over other topics in most of his letters and other pieces that he wrote himself and in what others wrote about him. Though we have access to many of these documents, there's much that is lost, and I will strive to discover them. His correspondences with his mother, for example, can throw open another unknown world of the Swamiji who never fails to inspire,"" Shankar signs off."

But there is yet another souring agent, which is now lesser known  the vatamba fruit.The vatamba or ottam or vat fruit grows in the wild and in its unripe form resembles a small sized green apple from afar. The tender fruit is sliced, seed, skin and all, into semi-circular shapes, salted and dried during the summer, and stored for use through the year.Rapid urbanization has restricted its use only to remote and forested areas of Goa today. Lesser availability means forgotten knowledge of the food, which often leads to it being mistaken for kokum. But vatamb actually belongs to the jackfruit family of trees, its botanical name being artocarpus lakoocha.""It has to be soaked for 15 to 20 minutes in water before it is used in cooking. You need to use it in more quantity than the kokum sollam as it is milder in its sourness,"" said Narendra Naik, a resident of Canacona.Malini Pandurang Shetye, a Mayem-based homemaker, said that it also gives a slightly different flavour to the food than the sharp sourness of kokum sollam. ""It can be used just as we use kokum sollam, in cooking moonga tondak, chanaya tondak and fish curry. Vata sollam are never ground, but added directly when the gravy comes to a boil, just like kokum,"" she said.Vatamb sollam are believed to be especially good when used in cooking dry fish curries. Its milder sourness means that it is a safer option if you tend to suffer from acidity.Cooking the yam or suran with vatamb sollam helps beat the irritation that can be caused in the mouth when eating suran.""The vatamb fruit turns yellowish when ripe and it has a sour-sweet taste. Though it is rarely eaten as a fruit, it is edible in this ripe form too. I remember eating it as a child because it was available in plenty at my maternal home in Naroa,"" said Shetye.Just outside of Goa's borders, vatamb sollam are used as the key ingredient in a chutney. The vatamb sollam are soaked in water for around 20 minutes.A few garlic pods, cloves, a green chili and a dry chili roasted in oil are ground to a coarse paste along with the soaked sollam, salt and grated coconut. And, you have an interesting new variety of chutney. Vatamb sollam can also be thrown into sambar.These vatamb sollam are now available for purchase on many sites online, which mistakenly label it 'kokum phool'."

Farmers holding large quantity of agriculture produce are disposing of their stock to private traders much below the minimum support price (MSP) announced by the government, said a resolution of the Krushak Morcha.Presiding over the State executive committee meeting of the farmers wing, Krushak Morcha president Sibaji Mohanty said private traders are offering below Rs 1,100 per quintal as against the MSP of Rs 1470 for fair average quality (FAQ) after arrival of rabi paddy.Agencies appointed by the State Government for paddy procurement are not lifting kahrif paddy from farmers after the start of rabi procurement from May 1. The BJP Morcha urged the Government to allow the procurement agencies to purchase the left-out kharif paddy during the rabi season.While the State Government has fixed a maximum production of 26 quintals of paddy from one acre of irrigated land and 24 quintals for an acre in non-irrigated areas, the actual production is much more. Unless the Government revised the production limit per acre, farmers will continue to suffer, State BJP vice-president Sameer Mohanty said.Complaining that moong is sold at Rs 4,000 per quintal as against the MSP of Rs 5,200 fixed by the Centre, the Morcha said this is due to non-procurement by Government agencies.In a separate resolution, the BJP Morcha decided to constitute Krushak Panchayat in gram panchayat level to fight for the cause of farmers. Each Krushak Panchayat will have minimum 100 farmers.Even as the State Government has failed to provide irrigation to at least 30 per cent agricultural land in each block after 18 years, the Morcha slammed the ruling BJD for its failure to utilise Central assistance under Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana."

That there was ample stress nevertheless was demonstrated by the humungous calls the official 104 helpline received from anxious students, parents and relatives on the result day.Parallelly, the government announced its decision to overhaul the school education syllabus perhaps realising that NEET could no longer be wished away. This paper had exclusively reported how a student in a Tirupur village with a cumulative average of 199.25 in physics, chemistry and biologywhich would have put her on top of the medical merit listfears she will not make the NEET cut since she could solve just about 50 per cent of its question paper. The blame for her NEET stumble rests on the existing rote learning system which failed to equip her with the skill sets required to answer questions seeking to test her analytical ability.The warning signals were always there. Hundreds of serving teachers failed to clear the Tamil Nadu Teachers Eligibility Test (TNTET) resulting in the government lowering the bar and introducing grace marks. And the latest Annual State of Education Report (ASER) showed Tamil Nadu at the bottom of the table in the category of subtraction and division skills in Class III among states in the South. While Andhra was the chart topper with 48.1 per cent, Tamil Nadu stood at a lowly 24.8 per cent.Yet, TN was long content in filling up its medical and engineering seats with State Board toppers without addressing the need to develop conceptual understanding among students, one reason why high scorers in Plus Two routinely flunk their initial engineering semester exams.NEET has served as a welcome disrupter. While revamping the syllabus, the school education department needs to revisit its question paper patterns and align itself with modern needs."
593563097be9e061b17376cf,Why do we suffer acidity — heartburn and acid reflux,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/back2basics/why-do-we-suffer-acidity-heartburn-and-acid-reflux/,2017-05-16,"Many of us have suffered through symptoms of acidity and heartburn after a wedding celebration dinner or a late night party. We blame it on the spicy food, the fried stuff and the late night shenanigans. But we never seem to go down to the basics of understanding why till it becomes a frequently repetitive situation or gets so chronic that family members may have to rush you to the hospital suspecting a heart attack.Acidity occurs when the basic PH balance of our stomach remains acidic over larger periods of time, upsetting the tender linings of our stomach. In certain cases a stomach abnormality called hiatal hernia can cause acid reflux. This happens when the stomach acid is thrown back into the esophagus because of the partial closing or failing of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If one is overweight then the diaphragm which is the muscle that separates your stomach from your chest is pushed upwards causing the LES to be stressed open.As we grow older, if one leads a sedentary lifestyle its not just your outer muscles but even the internal organs that slowly lose their tenacity and the LES can become weak as with the other sphincters and valves throughout your body.The stomach naturally produces HCl (Hydrochloric acid) to help with the digestion of food and has a higher acidic level than rest of the body (between to 2 to 5.5 as compared with 7.45 of rest of the body). The stomach also produces mucus at the same time which acts as a lining to protect its inner walls against the action of HCl.The HCl is required to kill bacteria that enters the body through food, and also to activate enzyme pepsin that helps in the breakdown of proteins in the stomach and the enzyme, Intrinsic factor that absorbs B12. Pepsin can only work in an acidic environment. If the food sits in the stomach for a longer period of time then the chances of increased acid levels can cause gases to be formed which in turn can result in bloating, burping, nausea, and heartburn due to acid reflux. Eating too much food can pressurize the stomach. Eating too high alkaline foods can cause more stomach acid to be produced to enable digestion, so balancing your meals are very important.Carbohydrates move quickly through the stomach, while proteins take longer and fats can sit in your stomach for almost 6 hours.While choosing your meals we should make sure we combine our food in such a way where we can get the maximum absorption of proteins while the carbs and fiber bind them while maintaining a good insulin balance. Fats should be preferably the unsaturated ones that go smoothly through the stomach till they are emulsified with bile in the small intestine to aid in absorption of the fat soluble vitamins, A,D,E and K.High alkaline foods are : Cabbage, broccoli, cucumber, avocado, spinach, kale, beets, celery, onion, tomato, garlic, carrot, almonds, coconut, pomegranate, olives, chickpeas, sprouted moong, soy.High acidic foods are : Meat (red meat as well as chicken, duck, turkey), eggs, Dairy (cheese, milk), oils, butter, cashews, peanuts, white rice, honey, jams, vinegar, mustard, cocoa, tea, coffee, alcohol, sweets, chocolate, fruit juices, and any food with preservatives.The rest of the foods fall into the medium category which we can incorporate into our everyday diets, in moderation ofcourse. However, it is very essential that when we have too much of either one of the high acidic or high alkaline foods we balance it with the other.Acidity should not be counteracted with anti acidity medicines over a prolonged time as they can inhibit your bodys absorption of essential nutrients. Make it a point therefore to eat well balanced, proportionate meals. Smaller meals that do not stay in the stomach too long, keep hydrating yourself in between the meals to make sure the stomach acids do not hurt the sensitive mucus linings of your inner walls.Eat before you are hungry and stop before you are full."

Since I come from the North-eastern part of India myself and belong to a minority race, I too have suffered from racism, at least in its milder forms. Ive been called chinky, momo, chowmein, and more. If I am thought to be from South Korea, China or Japan, Im treated very well, but once I am identified as a North-easterner, the problems begin.Stereotyping of North-eastern Indians is common. If you are a young man from the North-east India who wears tattoos and sports a certain hairstyle, then you are tagged as an alcoholic or a drug addict. If you are a woman from the North-east wearing shorts and a half-sleeve shirt, then you are automatically considered cheap, which provokes unwanted advances. Even polite smiles from such women are often misunderstood. All sorts of different people from the North-east are also typecast as some sort of insurgent. Yet it is not possible for North-easterners to stand up to discrimination if it means risking their livelihoods; economic opportunity is normally what has brought them to a place like Delhi in the first place.In 2007, I responded to this situation by helping to start the North East Support Centre & Helpline (NESCH), an initiative run by human rights activists, social workers, students, journalists, and lawyers. Our aim is to prevent the harassment, discrimination, and molestation of people from the North-east living in Indian metros. Since this helpline was launched, I have intervened in numerous physical assaults, hate crimes, and even rapes and murders.I face lots of challenges trying to protect human rights. Members of the NESCH support us with money from their own pockets. We do not have pro bono lawyers, but most victims are from poor families and have no money to pay for legal fees. Court procedures are long and tedious; victims frequently have no faith in the system or get discouraged in the process. Thats the reason why 90% of NE victims never get justice. Dealing with the police in Delhi, meanwhile, often requires our team staying awake all night, sometimes without food, to coordinate between officials and victims.While writing this piece, I am recalling many cases I handled in the past. There was Reingamphi, a young woman from Manipur who was suspected to have been raped and brutally murdered at her rented accommodation in Chirag Delhi in 2013. She was the main breadwinner of the family, her parents being rice cultivators with meagre incomes back in her home state. Then there was Mary Ezung from Nagaland, who was found dead in Delhis Safdarjung Enclave. Her post-mortem report clearly stated that she was brutally assaulted and murdered. Julie, a young woman from Mizoram, was murdered in her rented flat nearby in Munirka. One 19-year-old girl from Assam was raped at a guest house where she was working.It has almost become a daily affair to hear of North-eastern women being subjected to such abuse in Delhi and the rest of the National Capital Region. Other women suffer similarly, but these women from the North-east, hundreds of miles away from home, often face the extra burden of fighting their cases alone. Most of the women are hard working, the backbones of their families both financially and emotionally. Losing their daughters shatters a familys dreams: it means life will never be the same again.Stereotyping of North-eastern women continues even after their deaths. Every year, approximately 10 to 15 women from North-east India are found dead in their rented rooms in Delhi-NCR. Unfortunately, for all these cases there is not even a single genuine and proper investigation. Most of these women are not well known and they are not from influential backgrounds, so what does it matter to anyone? Police reports tend to conclude with causes of death like alcohol consumption, suicide, and natural causes.BLOODY TRAIL Men and women from the Northeast are routinely attacked. 10 to 15 women are found dead in their rented rooms every year. 2014JAN29 Nido Taniam, 19, son of a Congress MLA, was beaten to death by shopkeepers in Delhis Lajpat Nagar.

As demand for pulses and groundnuts is always high, farmers (share croppers in particular) decided to take up cultivation of the crops despite the fact the Government did not offer subsidy on seeds.Moong was sown in 42,116 hectares (ha) and the Agriculture department had set a target to procure 2.50 lakh quintals through NAFED, MARKFED and Odisha State Cooperative Marketing Federation Ltd by April first week.For Moong, the Centre has fixed a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,225 per quintal, including Rs 425 as bonus. For groundnut, MSP is Rs 4,220 per quintal, including Rs 100 as bonus and MSP for black gram is Rs 5,000 per quintal, including Rs 425 as bonus.As per the Central Governments suggestion, the State Government has directed all district agriculture officers to fix target for procurement of pulses and groundnuts in the State. Accordingly, agriculture officials of the district sent the procurement target report to the State Government.However, a month has passed but procurement is yet to begin. As a result, Moong farmers are being forced to sell their produce at Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,500 per quintal and similar is the plight of farmers who cultivated groundnuts and black grams. Activists of Naba Nirman Krushak Sangthan have submitted a memorandum to the local administration demanding immediate procurement. They also demanded opening of two procurement centres in each block so that farmers can easily sell their produce.Assistant District Agriculture Officer Nilamani Dash said as per the proposal, the Agriculture department had decided to procure only Moong for the time being. So far, three procurement centres have been opened in Jagatsinghpur, Raghunathpur and Balikuda and procurement of Moong would begin from next week."

The missing link in history just got discovered when the department of archaeology, Rajasthan , after nearly two decades excavated Juna Khera at Nadol on the banks of river Bharmal in Pali, an important early medieval settlement of Chauhan dynasty.""Juna Khera is the only site of its kind known across the state with tremendous archaeological potential of Chauhan settlement of early medieval period during the 12th century AD. The cultural archaeology provides a very vital cultural link between the post Gupta period and late medieval period that was so far a lacuna in history. But now we know exactly how the settlements in the 9-10th century existed,"" said Hridesh Kumar Sharma, director, department of archaeology & museums.A detailed survey was conducted at the site of Juna Khera for exploring the possibilities of excavation. After visiting the site that is protected under subsection 4 of section 3 of the Rajasthan Monuments and Antiquities Act 1961, it was decided by the archaeological department that the site should be re-excavated for understanding the planning of township, economy, trade, social stratification, public architecture and cultural sequence of the ancient settlement.Though the area was occupied by the Stone Age man since lower Paleolithic period, the recent excavation revealed that Nadol was a prosperous trade centre between Jodhpur and Udaipur. ""It is assumed that the site was flourishing during the 9th-10th century AD. The excavation also revealed traces of living rooms, kitchens with burning activities. Some traces of furnaces were also found during the excavations. It was found that massive undressed, semi-dressed and dressed stone blocks of marble and granite were used during the construction of buildings in the ancient time. Mud mortar was also part of their house construction and more than 20-cm mud mortar was applied on the floor of the rooms, which is interesting from the habitation point of view,"" said Dr Vineet Godhal, exploration and excavation officer, department of archaeology and museums.But besides that, kiln-backed bricks were used on stone blocks. Hearths with grains were also observed during the excavation work along with a big chunk of iron piece. The pottery was of typical medieval period and mostly wheel-turned red in colour with fine fabric, mostly treated with a wash of slip. The common shapes were bowl, lid-cum bowl and lipped bowl with spouted-channels. Stone sculptural pieces, representative of early medieval art, were also discovered. The excavations confirmed the hypothesis of Nadol as quite contiguous to Mewar.Some unfinished beads at the site also indicate that this place was used for some type of workshop related with beads. Add to the finished and unfinished beads, coins, iron objects of different types, copper rings and other objects were recovered during this season's excavation work. Seals bearing inscription in early Devanagari characters were also discovered. Coins with the inscription ""La"" probably referred to ""Lakshamana"", the founder of the Chauhan branch of Nadol, were also found.The first excavation was done by the archaeology department at Nadol in 1996 but the recent excavations revealed direct evidences about agricultural products like wheat, black gram, mung, moth, rice, arhar and kulthi at Nadol. ""The grains have been sent to Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeobotany, Lucknow, for the study,"" said Hridesh Kumar Sharma."

The farmers have sown sesame, yard long beans, ground nut and green gram. A few farmers have started tilling the land to take up farm activities.Seeds stockedAgriculture officials told DH that the seeds have been stocked in Raitha Samparka Kendras. About 2,000 quintal seeds have been distributed so far.All measures have been taken to ensure that there is no shortage of seeds. If the region continues to receive rainfall, then sowing of jowar, maize and sunflower will be taken up by the end of May-June. Farmers have sown onion in Shivani, Ajjampura, Birur and surrounding areas, they said.The pre-monsoon showers have filled the water bodies and have brought much relief to the farmers who were reeling under drought situation for the last three years.The farmers have started removing the weeds in the coconut, rubber, coffee, and pepper plantations while paddy growers are getting ready to sow in NR Pura and Mudigere taluks.S V Sadashiva, a farmer from Shivani, said, We have already received good rainfall in the last two months. Ihave sown groundnut. I am hoping for a good monsoon this year. If the region gets good rainfall, then onion will also be sown.

59355b0c7be9e061b1736f69,Class XI Boards will add to the burden: Students,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/coimbatore/class-xi-boards-will-add-to-the-burden-students/articleshow/58805458.cms,2017-05-20,"Those who are entering Class IX this year, have a new challenge in store. The Tamil Nadu government has planned to introduce Board Examinations for Class XI from 2018. Hereafter, a student's score in Class XI board exam mark sheet will carry 50 per cent weightage in the Class XII board exam mark sheet. The move is considered an attempt to improve the performance of students in competitive exams. Here's what Coimbatoreans have to say about it.I think the move will add humungous pressure on students. Students spend studying hard for 10th and 12th standard board examinations and it is only during the 11th standard that they get a breather. But, with this move, they will be constantly under pressure for three years. It increases the responsibility of the parents as well as they have to be watchful about their child's preparation for the exams and their health. I think it's an unnecessary burden on students.I understand that the rule is aimed at improving the standard of students preparing and appearing for competitive exams. But for the move to reap benefits, the syllabus has to change. We have been following the same syllabus for 12 years and it's time we moved ahead with times. Many also believe that this will curb rote learning. But, we at government schools do not encourage rote learning and hence, the students passing out of our schools are well-versed in their subjects. The only drawback is that they have studied in Tamil medium. With the new rule in place, teachers will have to concentrate on 11th and 12th in equal measure and it will surely add to our existing workload.I think this will ease the burden on us in 12th standard as we would have already begun the preparations in 11th. It will help us fare better in competitive exams as well as the standards would have improved. But, schools will definitely have to change their coaching style once the rule comes into place.Three years of successive board exams is sure to take a toll on the students. Students preparing for 10th and 12th tend to push themselves to the brink in the last four months and parents struggle in equal measure, too. With 11th standard too joining the competition, it's going to be a strenuous affair for everyone. Students should start preparing for the exams from the beginning of 11tH standard instead of piling it up for the last few months. If the rule is to be implemented in 2018, it would be advisable to provide educational counselling for all students and parents in their schools by the end of 10th standard. Parents should let their children pick the subject of their choice. The other options would be to give it a few years' time before the move is implemented so that parents and teachers get adequate time to mould their wards or gradually prepare them as they move up the ladder in 5th standard and 8th before they move to higher secondary.My parents have been dropping me early in the morning at the tuition centre and for special classes all this year. For parents, it's going to be a tough time for three years. I am awaiting the results of 10th standards and hence, won't have to face the 11th Boards. But, my younger brother will soon be part of the new system, once its implemented. It's going to be quite tough for him. He has to thoroughly work for three back-to-back years and has to adopt a new method of preparation. But, at the same time, I believe that the move will improve the standard of education in the long run as students will take their studies seriously."

Chandrababu Naidus plan to popularise and promote traditional and authentic Andhra cuisine internationally has sent a team of the Tourism wing on a delicious trail of identifying and moderating to add nutritional value to the most authentic traditional dishes, some of which are on the verge of extinction.A team led by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Authority (APTA) Joint Director Sudha Kumar, a culinary expert, is currently engaged in identifying and perfecting healthy recipes.There are some not-very-popular traditional recipes with the health factor intact in them. Ingredients such as pounded rice, organic vegetables and fresh local raw components add that extra flavour to Andhra cuisine, says Mr. Kumar and cites the example of a unique idli -making practice in Ambajipet of Konaseema region. It is called Pottikkal. Fermented idli batter is wrapped in jackfruit leaves in the shape of a cone and steam-cooked. The aroma of jackfruit leaves enhances the flavour of the idli , lending the dish a unique touch, explains Mr. Kumar, informing that the pyramid idli served with ulavacharu (the concentrated extract of horse gram) is very healthy.Method of cookingLeaves and flowers of drumstick, jackfruit and amla which have medicinal value, are also being brought into use. Method of cooking and use of traditional utensils like brass vessels and earthen pots, not seen much these days, is yet another focus area.The recipes thus culled out will be referred to a team of nutritionists for their expert advice and endorsement besides roping in an ayurvedic doctor to present his point of view on the identification of medicinal value of each recipe.After consulting with some of the top chefs in Hyderabad, Mr. Kumar and his team have identified about 30 recipes in different categories.AppetisersIn the appetisers section are delicacies such as Nalleru kada vada (vada made with the stem of Nalleru, a medicinal plant) and kobbari kudumulu (coconunt dumplings): under main course, mulaga puvvu thalimpu (tempered drumstick flower) and arati puvvu-pesara kura (banana flower-green gram curry); cereals- menthe kura-tomato annam (fenugreek leaves-tomato rice) and dampudu biyyam pesara molakala pulao (pulao with hand-pounded rice and green gram sprouts); pulses- Chintha chiguru pappu (dal with tender tamarind leaves) and in the non-vegetarian category dosakai mamsam (meat with yellow cucumber) and sora puttu (a fish delicacy).The team members are on an elaborate exercise of standardising each of these recipes for taste, texture, yield and nutritional balance. The cooked samples will be sent to the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibrating Laboratories (NABL) to evaluate the amount of carbohydrates, proteins and based on their feedback, the recipes will be further modified if need be.The final details of the recipes will take the form of a book that will be printed and published for public use. The Tourism Authority also plans to host food festivals across the country and cookery contests in the State.We can embrace healthy food with simple tips. Substitute use of sugar with brown sugar, palm jaggery or fruit syrups. For example, Kakinada khaja can be made using sugar syrup made with pineapple juice, banana juice or strawberry juice, he says. Eliminate deep frying which absorbs more oil and take to concealed way of cooking (dum style of cooking). Use more of ingredients like yellow pumpkin, raw banana flowers and stem, drumstick leaves, methi leaves and cow ghee."

593ae0527be9e009ad91b93a,"Motion pictures, limited",http://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/other/2017/may/28/motion-pictures-limited-1609899.html,2017-05-28,"CHIBA, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. Its April 1991 and the city is getting ready to host the World Table Tennis Championships. It is also gearing up for one of the most significant developments in a post-Cold War world. A unified sports team from Korea  a first since the Peninsula was divided after the second World War  is registered.The move is to generate goodwill amid an air of increasing hostility between the two nations.It works. The side generates a massive amount of eustress. That wave reaches a crescendo when the womens team, led by Ri Bun-Hui (North Korea) and Hyun Jung-Hwa (South Korea), beats China to gold. What had happened at the 1990 Asian Games adds to the occasion. Jung-Hwa beat Bun-Hui, but ended up losing to Deng Yaping in the womens event. Six months later, two foes become friends to get the better of China and Yaping.It has everything a director wants in a sports biopic  national pride, historical significance, geopolitical tension and enough drama to shoot nine seasons worth of Emmy-award winning episodes. So, in 2012, Ko-ri-a, hits the screens. Even before the film begins, the masses are on the edge, whistling and crying. The entire peninsula is sketched inside one of the alphabets as the title is displayed. It doesnt have the international border.The title fades and the biopic begins. Where hopes and dreams marry reality, even if its mixed with a generous dollop of fiction.***Right around the same time as As One (Ko-ri-a) premiered, there was a small but intangible change taking place in the corridors of Bollywood. Producers and directors began backing sports biopics. The smartly packaged Paan Singh Tomar (PST), the real-life story of an armyman who represented the country at the Asian Games in 1958 before becoming a rebel, in March 2012, meant there was a realignment of how the money men perceived stories of sportspersons, alive or dead. Lagaan, Iqbal and Chak De! India  all made in the first 10 years of this century  did prove viewers were willing to watch sports films, either fictitious or inspired by real events. But it wasnt until PST that the mentality changed.Ad film director Prahlad Kakkar agrees. See, you have to understand how the industry works, he tells Express. Nothing succeeds like success. Our film industry is reactive, not original. When romantic films were made, everyone made them. When action films were made, everyone started doing the same. But after the successes of PST and Bhaag Milkha Bhaag, there was a whole genre that was waiting to be tapped. And that is what you have seen over the last 18 months and will see in the months to come.That is true. There are films on Saina Nehwal, PV Sindhu, Pullela Gopichand and Dhyan Chand lined up as well as one on Mariyappan Thangavelu.Given that watching sports and going to the cinema are two of the most tribalistic pastimes, does he find it strange that its taken this much time for the industry to bring this category of film-making into the mainstream? It also depends on the story, he says. Dangal was a world hit because of how it was portrayed. The actual story segued superbly into the writing so much that there wasnt a need for willing suspension of disbelief. Or any outrageous scenes of jingoism. There is always a market for good stories provided the accuracy is maintained.Even so, facts were tweaked to bollywoodise Dangal; a familiar trope among film-makers around the world. But Babita Kumari, who won a gold at the 2014 Commonwealth Games, understands why the makers resorted to it. There was masala also, which I cant criticise because films need to do well at the box office, she says. It helped me reach out to the audience outside the Hindi-speaking wrestling belts. People who cheered for us at international events did not know about our parents and the roles they played in bringing us up.That is a powerful tool for film-makers. Everyone knows how Sindhu, Saina et al became Olympic medallists. But the medium of cinema is such that it gives the fan a behind-the-scenes look at what went into making them sporting heroes in a land that is devoid of them, by and large. A sports biopic also saves the producers a lot of money with respect to marketing and publicity, Kakkar opines. You just need to mention the word Saina or a Sindhu and the publicity takes care of itself.Sometimes that may be a detriment as well. Expectations are already set in stone and the protagonists themselves may not like to be a part of the film. L Ibomcha Singh, Mary Koms coach, was one of those dissenting voices. I am a coach and I did not want to be part of the movie (Mary Kom), he says. Movie is fantasy. So I refused to play any role. Even some Manipuri movie-makers tried to persuade me but I rejected their offer. However, he did share footage of training sessions with the stakeholders.***Sachin: A Billion Dreams, a documentary-drama that released over the weekend, is the latest in a spate of sports personality-based films to hit theatres. This, though, fails to strike a chord with people who grew up with Tendulkar. There are enough previously unseen footage to keep viewers interested, but it doesnt pull at the heartstrings like when he came out to bat. Its a movie made for the Instagram generation, not for the tape-recorder ones. However, one line in the movie  a part of his farewell speech at the Wankhede  is one of the reasons why sports biopics are being made in abundance these days. Ajit, he says, my brother, now what do I talk about him? We have lived this dream together.That is the essence. This genre allows people to not only dream, but live fantasies through prism of their heroes.In the pipelineSaina NehwalTo be titled Saina, biopic on first Indian shuttler to win Olympic medal will star Shraddha Kapoor.

After work, I go straight home and spend 45 minutes reading the Bhagavad Gita , before going to bed after a light meal of moong dal , steamed broccoli, and watermelon curry cooked in clarified butter for 22 minutes over a low, blue flame.But last week RK, a former colleague and senior journalist, was in town. We never got along when we worked together. But he sounded friendly, and wanted to catch up over a drink at the Press Club.I told him I avoided the Press Club as it was located in Lutyens Delhi, the headquarters of Indias Pakistan-friendly liberal elite. But RK was hunting for some left liberals whom he could tie to the Toyota Fortuner hed booked for his upcoming vacation in Srinagar, and wanted my help.I need you to identify them for me, he said, over phone. Ive received intelligence inputs that some plump specimens are likely to make an appearance at the club this evening. So I reluctantly agreed.RK greeted me warmly. I had last seen him seven years ago. He looked exactly the same, except for a tilak on his forehead and a saffron scarf around his neck.We found an Ayodhya-facing table and made ourselves comfortable. He ordered a Black Dog with cow urine while I settled for Sattvic Mary, an excellent Ayurvedic cocktail with a base of goats milk, the tang of basil juice, and the zing of eucalyptus oil mixed with Ashwagandha powder and crushed jojoba leaves.It was brave of you, I said, sipping my cocktail, to quit your job as a paid journalist and start your own magazine.I had no choice, he said, wiping his brow with the scarf. The mainstream media is only peddling leftist propaganda. Someone had to counter it. So I started The Sanatana Post .What a lovely name!We present the truth from the perspective of Sanatana Dharma, he said. News that furthers the cause of dharma is true. Everything else is fake news.A Modifest specialThe conversation drifted, inevitably, to what everyone is talking about these days: the NDA governments countless achievements after only three years in power.We are bringing out a special 600-page Modifest issue of The Sanatana Post , RK said.Thats so exciting!It would be a collectors item, he explained. Each page would talk about two achievements. The entire issue, printed on 200-orgasm art paper, would highlight the top 1,200 of the governments 3,500 achievements. Unfortunately, we wont be able to inform the public about the other 2,300 achievements.MAARU BUCOLINAL, I said.Whats that?Modis Achievements Are Unlimited But Column Inches Are Limited. I was shocked he hadnt heard of it.Precisely, he said, adding, IT + IT (UT/MT) = BUM + CHEE + AIYO.You bet! He raised a hand, and we did a high-five.Then I asked him what he would rate as the governments two greatest achievements.All are equally greatest! How can I pick just two?Try, I insisted.Well, my favourite is Sakshis medal at the Olympics. In 60 years of Congress rule, not a single Indian lady won an Olympic medal in wrestling. We did it in just three years of Modi rule.Thats indeed a great achievement, I agreed. The other one?Poverty has disappeared, unemployment is down to zero, and people are happy.Are you sure? I said. On my way here, I was stopped at a signal by a poor woman carrying an infant. She wanted money.That doesnt prove anything.She was begging, which means she was in poverty, and unemployed. People forced into begging arent happy.RK stared at me. So you are still taking money from the Congress to produce fake news against your own government?I was about to defend myself but he raised an imperious hand to silence me.My friend, he said, This so-called beggar could very well have been a rich young lady from Panchsheel Park preparing to audition for a role as a beggar in an upcoming Madhur Bhandarkar film. In other words, she is not poor, not unemployed, and happy doing something she loves.But thats not true! I protested. You just made it up!The whole world is maya , RK said, gulping down the last of his Black Dog. Do you know what that means? It means reality is what your consciousness cooks up.But you cant cook up things and call it the truth!I must leave now, he said, looking at his watch. Want to come with me to Srinagar? Ill take care of your transport."

This came up for discussion at a recent meeting between Sports Minister Vijay Goel and Indian Olympic Association president N Ramachandran. If insiders are to be believed, they think the nation is ready. The only doubt is whether it should be the Asian Games in 2030, which is financially more viable, or the more humungous Olympic Games in 2032.It may sound outlandish, but another reason that seems to be fomenting Indias desire is that China has been hosting the Asian Games rather frequently. The ministry and IOA came under attack from sports aficionados for not getting their priorities right and wasting money in hosting the 2010 Commonwealth Games. Bidding for 2030 or 2032 will give the ministry and the IOA enough time to prepare and improve the sporting scenario in the country. India hosted the Asian Games in 1982 and the time is right for another.In Asia, we are in the top six-seven. But when it comes to the Olympics, we linger at the bottom. Its not something a country aiming big is proud of. If it is the Olympics that we want to host, we must ensure that the standard of sport improves. A poor haul will render organisational efforts useless. After hosting the Commonwealth Games, the standard had improved. But we were not able to maintain it because our vision was myopic.We were just targeting the Commonwealth Games. This time, we have about 1315 years. If we start planning now and concentrate on the grassroots, we will leave a legacy that will last longer than the Commonwealth Games. For that to happen, the ministry must ensure that truant federations fall in line and start working for the benefit of sportspersons rather than officials. Until that happens, there is no way a successful bidding will lead to a powerful sporting nation."

CBSE's regional office in Chennai, which takes care of Maharashtra along with southern states (excluding Kerala), refused to share state-specific data for comparison.CBSE Delhi HQ has always shared only region specific data, which give a bird's-eye view, but leaves many questions unanswered. The state specific data was sometimes officially, sometimes unofficially, sourced from respective regional offices. There is no reason assigned by CBSE for refusing to share statewise data, and with every regional office lording over a huge geographical area, there seems to be no problem for people running the show to be answerable.A CBSE school principal said, ""While we can access data related to our students, it will be great to see how different states and even cities are performing. What such data does is that it provides us with benchmarks and helps to analyse indicators through which we can perform better."" Schools have often complained that both Chennai regional office and the Delhi HQ are unresponsive to queries.On the other hand, it is no secret that CBSE is short-staffed in many areas. Never having an 'inspection' mandate meant it did not have presence in every state where its affiliated schools are present. The Chennai regional office looks after a humungous geographical area, including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Maharashtra and Goa. With zero staff members outside Chennai, CBSE falls short when it comes to speed in responding.A source in the board told TOI that the IT staff, which computes results data and makes it public, have not left office for the last two days. The source added that in such cases tasks are prioritized and releasing data gets missed out.GIRLS BETTER 2016 MARKPass percentageOverall 82.02Girls 87.50 88.58 (2016)Boys 78.0078.85 (2016)Appeared numbersBoys 5,78,961 5,64,213Girls 4,40,399 4,28,443No re-evaluation this yearThe CBSE will not entertain requests for revaluation, starting this year.

Subsequently, the entire district besides the adjoining regions of Chamarajanagar have received copious rainfall as a result of which farm work is in full swing in south interior Karnataka.While paddy is yet to be taken up for sowing, ragi, jowar, maize, toor, and green gram have been planted and cotton and tobacco have occupied the largest swathe of cultivable land. The authorities have set a target of bringing 3,88,220 hectares (ha) under sowing for khariff season. This includes 2,74,120 ha coming under rain-fed area and 1,14,100 ha under irrigated land.Out of this, 2,04,236 ha of land has already been brought under sowing in rain-fed areas thus achieving almost 75% of the target, while 2,392 ha under irrigated land have been brought under sowing. Nearly 70% of agriculture in Mysuru district takes place under rain-fed conditions, while the irrigated area constitutes only 30% of the total cultivable area. Hence, the pre-monsoon showers are important for farmers to take up tilling and prepare the land for sowing while the monsoon rains provide the requisite moisture during growth stages of the crop.As per statistics maintained by the office of the Joint Director of Agriculture in Mysuru, 46,338 ha of land has been brought under cotton while 68,415 ha of land has been brought under tobacco. The extent of the coverage of other crops are jowar (4,229 ha), ragi (1,213 ha), maize (28,901 ha), and sugarcane (2,192 ha).Officials maintained that there was adequate stock of fertilizers and seeds to enable farmers to complete sowing activity and the authorities have advised farmers to take up sowing of green manure crops and pulses such as horsegram, blackgram, and cowpea in view of the congenial moisture in the soil.The Grameena Krishi Mausam Sewa at Naganahalli has cited the Indian Meteorological Department forecast to indicate that the onset of monsoon may be earlier this year. The weather forecast for Mysuru indicates cloudy weather conditions with moderate rainfall and this is valid for a week. The cumulative rainfall for Mysuru this year is 303.1 mm against a normal of 200 mm."

(Source: PTI) Farmers throw away milk during their strike in Bhopal on Sunday. (Source: PTI)THE FOUR-DAY-LONG agitation by farmers in BJP-ruled Madhya Pradesh, which turned violent over the past two days in some districts, ended on Sunday amid conflicting versions by organisations leading the stir. After its office-bearers met Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), an organisation affiliated to the RSS, said it has suspended the agitation. It announced that the government had accepted most of its demands like buying onions at Rs 8 a kg and paying farmers half their dues at mandis in cash and the remaining through electronic transfer to their bank accounts.We have suspended the agitation but if the government goes back on its promises we may take to the streets again, said BKS leader Shivkant Dixit, seating next to the CM at the Ujjain Circuit House. He said the CM called him up late on Saturday and invited him for talks.He said the government will buy moong dal from farmers at MSP and onions at Rs 8 a kg. Last year, the government had bought onions at Rs 6 a kg. He said vegetable yards will be brought under the purview of the legislation covering agriculture produce marketing yards. Also, crop insurance scheme will be made optional. He announced that cases against farmers in connection with the incidents over the past few days will be withdrawn.However, Bharatiya Kisan Union, a little-known organisation that is believed to be behind the stir, said the agitation will go on. BKU leader Anil Yadav threatened to intensify the stir from Monday. The organisation did not get any call from the CM.President of Kisan Mazdoor Sangh Shivkumar Sharma said the government had cheated farmers by holding talks with an organisation that was nowhere in the picture in the first two days of the stir seeking fair price for their produce and loan waiver.Sharma, a former RSS man who floated a parallel organisation after being expelled from the BKS a few years ago, called the BKS an agent of the government. He said his organisation will continue the agitation till all demands were met. How can an organisation withdraw an agitation that it did not start, he said, referring to the BKS.Over the past three days, groups of farmers turned violent in Dhar, Bioara, Indore, Jhabua, Ujjain, Ratlam, and Mandsaur among other places. At some places they clashed with traders and vegetable vendors and attacked police officials. The police had to open fire at some places to disperse violent mobs.The agitation by the farmers in MP after taking a clue from their counterparts in Maharashtra caused prices of vegetables to soar and resulted in shortage of milk.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

PTI Photo(PTI6_7_2017_000086B)A DAY after five farmers were killed in police firing, tension prevailed in Mandsaur and the adjoining district of Neemuch as protesters defied curfew and indulged in arson and violence on Wednesday. The violence also spread to other districts of the state, with protesters torching vehicles and blocking road and rail traffic in Dewas, Ujjain, Sehore and Barwani. Seeking to cool tempers, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who held a meeting of his Krishi Cabinet on Wednesday, announced more sops for farmers, including a loan settlement scheme for defaulters. The government also announced that a commission would be set up to fix a formula to ensure a fair price for crops by deducting agricultural costs.Chouhan gave orders to immediately constitute a Rs 1000-crore price stabilisation fund. He also announced that tur, urad and moong would be purchased from farmers from June 10 to June 30. Meanwhile, nearly two dozen vehicles were set on fire over the last 24 hours on the stretch between Mandsaur and Pipalia Mandi. All the five farmers who were killed in two separate incidents of firing near the Pipalia Mandi police station on Tuesday were from this area, which has become the epicentre of the protests.While six deaths were reported earlier, district officials said on Wednesday that one death was not related to the protests. The farmers are demanding better prices for their produce and waiver of loans. The road connecting Mandsaur and Neemuch remained out of bounds for most part of the day with protesters torching more vehicles and a warehouse. At Barkhenda Pant village, Mandsaur Collector Swatantra Kumar Singh was heckled by relatives of one of the farmers who died and other villagers.Singh had gone to the spot to ask the protesters to clear the road and take the farmers body for cremation. The protesters demanded immediate action against police officials involved in the firing. Singh and Superintendent of Police O P Tripathi had to beat a hasty retreat after they were heckled. While video footage showed that Singh was hit on the head, he played down the incident and said he was not manhandled. He claimed that anti-social elements had taken over the protests.While the district administration claimed that enough security personnel had been deployed in the area, bike-borne protesters roamed freely on the streets, warning government officials and policemen not to venture beyond a toll booth located between Mandsaur and Pipalia Mandi. While those on motorcycles relayed information about the movement of security personnel, others on foot pelted stones at CRPF, RPF and police personnel, who fired teargas shells to disperse the crowd.We decided to abandon the toll booth after protesters damaged it and looked set to burn the ambulance parked next to it, said a paramedical staff. Why would we not be angry? While the prices of produce continue to crash, the wages of labourers have not reduced. We end up incurring losses. All protesters are genuine farmers their anger has reached a boiling point, said two masked protesters, who refused to identify themselves or their village.Meanwhile, the families of the other four farmers who were killed agreed to carry out their last rites on Wednesday. The Madhya Pradesh Patidar Samaj had claimed on Tuesday that the cremations would not take place until Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan made an appearance. Late on Tuesday, Chouhan increased the compensation from Rs 10 lakh to Rs 1 crore and a job to the next of kin of each dead.The bandh called by the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh (RKMS), a group formed by a former RSS worker, and Congress received mixed response on Wednesday.A senior officer in the Chief Ministers Office said the police and district administration were asked to be patient and lenient towards protesters earlier on Wednesday as the bodies of those killed had to be cremated. That was done for strategic reasons, but the administration has now been told to deal with the situation strictly, he said, adding that the people who torched buses near Sonkutch had been identified.While Chouhan is unlikely to travel to Mandsaur till the situation improves, the district administration is reported to have said that Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who is planning a visit on Thursday, would not be allowed to enter the area. DGP Rishikant Shukla said additional security forces have been rushed to Mandsaur and the situation would be brought under control soon. He said the arson was confined to Mandsaur and Dewas.In Delhi, the Ministry of Home Affairs said it had sent 1,100 anti-riots police personnel to Mandsaur. The Centre has also sought a detailed report on the violence on Tuesday. About 600 personnel of the Rapid Action Force have already reached Mandsaur, said a Home Ministry official, adding that another 500 RAF personnel are being sent.The state human rights commission has also sought a report on the firing. A two-judge bench of the commission will hear the matter on June 23.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

At least five farmers were killed and four others injured in firing by police on farmers, who have been protesting for a week demanding loan waiver and fair price for their produce. (Source: PTI)Backtracking on his earlier claim, Madhya Pradesh Home Minister Bhupendra Singh on Thursday for the first time admitted that the five farmers who were killed in Mandsaur died due to police firing. Death of the five farmers was due to police firing. It has been established in probe. I have said earlier that the farmers may have died in police firing. I have conceded this earlier, various channels have also ran it, Singh said.Singh initially denied claims that the farmers died in police firing. He said that anti-social elements had infiltrated the farmers protest and fired at the crowd.When asked about Rahul Gandhis visit to Mandsaur today, Singh said: Why does Rahul Fandhi want to come here? The government has accepted all the demands of the farmers.The Congress vice-president, along with JDU leader Sharad Yadav, have left for the Mandsaur to visit the families of the farmers killed in the firing. On Wednesday, the Congress and Centre traded charges over the issue. The Centre accused the Congress of politicising the issue, and claimed that there was a conspiracy behind the protests taking a violent turn. Farmers of MP are peace-loving. They do not indulge in violent activities. There is a conspiracy behind this entire incident. Those who do not want peace and prosperity in the state and can not see the BJP government functioning smoothly are behind this incident, Rural Development Minister Narender Singh Tomar said.The Congress charged the BJP-led government at Centre and State of throttling the voice of the farmers. Addressing a news conference in New Delhi, Congress spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi said: The BJP has almost been acting like a curse of death for Indian farmers, literally  not figuratively. Distressed farmers are viewed by heartless BJP virtually as fodder for opening fire upon.The same day protests spread from Mandsaur to other districts in Madhya Pradesh, with protesters indulging in arson and violence. Vehicles were torched, roads and railway tracks were blocked as protests entered the seventh day. Meanwhile, in an effort to cool tempers, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced more sops for the farmers.

593cf0757be9e00e964d44ac,Fields of unrest,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/fields-of-unrest-4695442/,2017-06-08,"There is a clear pattern to the farmer agitations currently on in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The killing of farmers by police in Mandsaur will be protested across the country. Agitations have already started in parts of UP, Haryana and Rajasthan as well, he claimed.Blaming MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan squarely for the violence and the killing of the farmers, Sharma claimed not five but eight farmers to have been killed by Chouhans police. Ourmovement will now also focus on imposition of presidential rule in MP, he added.Sharmas close aide and Patidar community leader Trilok Nath Gothi said most of the farmers killed in Tuesdays police firing"" hail from the community. AK-47 rifles have been used to kill the farmers and it's well known who can use these automatic rifles in MP, said Gothi, even as the State government and the police remained silent over whose bullets killed the farmers and their post mortem reports.The powerful Patidar community, which is already at war with the BJP in Gujarat, played a key role in the saffron party sweeping the 15 districts of west MP in the 2013 State assembly polls and the2014 Lok Sabha polls.With the local body polls round the corner, the ruling BJP could be at the receiving ends of the Patidars who are facing violence over the last 48 hours.Meanwhile, opposition Congress party leaders, including state party president Arun Yadav, leader of opposition in state assembly Ajay Singh Rahul, Rau (Indore) MLA Jeetu Patwari and formerMandsaur MP Meenakshi Natrajan, were stopped at different points on the Mandsaur border, when they were trying to enter to meet the bereaved families and attend the funerals of the five farmers in the violence-hit west MP district.According to key party sources, senior Congress leaders led by party national vice president Rahul Gandhi, Lok Sabha MP from Chhindwara (MP) Kamal Nath, party national general secretary Digvijaya Singh and national general secretary in-charge for MP Mohan Prakash will reach Neemuch and Mandsaur on Thursday, Prakash informed Express.The Congress leaders, likely to be accompanied by JD(U) leader Sharad Yadav, will fly from Delhi to Udaipur in the morning. From Udaipur, they will reach Neemuch and Mandsaur in MP by road.MP govt announces slew of measures to placate agitating farmersJolted by the killing of five farmers in firing on Tuesday and the violence thereafter, besides the apprehension of paying a massive political price for it, the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in MPfinally woke up to the demands of the agitating farmers on Wednesday.Chouhan chaired a meeting of top ministers, where a slew of decisions were taken. Detailing the decisions of the Krishi Cabinet, MP's Minister for Women and Child Development Archana Chitnis said the State government has decided to constitute an MP Krishi Lagat Viparan Aayog (MP State Agricultural Cost Marketing Commission), which will determine the per-hectare production cost of every crop. This would ensure that farmers get the right price for their produce in the market, she said.The cabinet also put its seal on the proposal to establish a Rs 1,000 crore corpus Agriculture Price Stabilisation Fund, besides giving a go-ahead for the Krishi Rin Samadhan Yojana (Agriculture LoanSettlement Scheme). Stopping short of saying the scheme would entail waiver of farmers' loans (one of the two demands of the agitating farmers'), the minister said the modalities of this scheme would be finalised in a day or two.The government also decided to do away with the conventional practice of agricultural produce mandis, paying farmers for their produce by cheques, and instead cleared a system of making payments tofarmers, 50 per cent in cash and 50 per cent via RTGS.Further, the government decided to do away with the practice of disbursing loans to farmers separately for kharif and rabi crops and cleared the proposal to disburse loans annually. Also, the governmentdecided to purchase pulses, including tur, urad and moong, from farmers at minimum support price, starting from June 30.Also, the Krishi Cabinet cleared the decks for launching of a mobile phone-operated app, which would keep farmers up to date with requirements of the market and help them accordingly to plan theircultivation."

The erstwhile Warangal district witnessed sporadic rain with agency areas receiving little more rain than the plains. As against the normal rainfall of 137.2 mm in June, less than 10 % of it was witnessed as the week ended on Thursday.Last year, as against the normal rainfall of 137.2, the district had witnessed 245.8 mm in June, thus recording an excess rainfall of 100 mm. But the JulyAugust was a period of long dry spell.But the loss was compensated as the entire district received double the average of 931.1 mm rain  there was bountiful rain in September followed by deficit rain from October to January 2017.Wait for rainSpeaking to The Hindu , District Agricultural Technology & Transfer (DATT) Centre Director R. Uma Reddy said farmers should start the farming operations only after the district receives at least 60 to 70% of the rainfall of the season. With 60% of rainfall, the soil would get wet as deep as 15 cm and it can withstand a dry spell without posing any danger to the standing crop.The farmers can sow till July 15 while paddy can be sown till July 31. There is no need to hurry, he said.The district has about four lakh farmers with a total area under cultivation being 12 lakh acres. Traditionally, the farmers grow cotton in six lakh acres and paddy in four lakh acres leaving only two lakh acres for other crops.Crop advisoryMr. Uma Reddy advised the farmers not to opt for cotton and paddy unless they have an assured irrigation facility.Growing cotton would be a bad idea in rainfed areas. He warned the farmers against cultivating cotton as there was the threat of attack from pink boll worms that has no solution as yet.The farmers were asked to opt for pulses such as red gram, green gram, black gram and jowar.The officials said it was best to go for red gram which has cent per cent mechanisation and with less labour and more yield, the farmers could reap riches.

He said he will fast indefinitely to mourn the death of five farmers in police firing and hold an open camp at Dussehra Maidan for people to come with their grievances.Facing heat over the shooting of five farmers in Mandsaur , the CM stood his ground and showed no sign of softening his stand on vandals among the agitators. Breaking his silence after two days, Chouhan said: ""From tomorrow, at 11am, I will sit on indefinite fast and appeal to restore peace in the state. I will hold a camp at the BHEL Dussehra Maidan to hear the grievances of the farmers, where anybody can meet and discuss their problem with me.""At the press conference at his residence, he sought to end the protest through talks with farmers' unions, which had initially intended to initiate a discussion but were sidelined after the involvement of Sangh Parivar-backed Kisan Sangh. Chouhan gave an ""open invitation"" to all those who wanted to discuss issues related to farmers. ""I have always been with farmers and made honest efforts to solve their grievances during my 11-and-a-half-year tenure. My aim is public welfare and development. We took several steps in the interest of farmers by waiving their loans, providing relief of Rs 4800 crore during crop loss, reduced farm debt by giving loan at 0% interest and further reducing it to minus 10% so that farmers could avail maximum benefit,"" said the chief minister.He said he would sit in the open and run his government outside the secretariat so that any farmers' body or union can approach him. The CM warned that government will tackle anti-social elements with an iron hand.Appealing for peace, Chouhan said the government has accepted all the demands raised by the farmers, which included minimum support price for onions and pulses. From June 10, the government will procure moong and tuar dal at MSP of Rs 5,050 per quintal and Rs 5,225 per quintal, he said, reiterating that the government has constituted a Rs 1,000 crore ""price stabilisation fund"" to help farmers secure a better price for their crops. An Agricultural Cost and Marketing Commission will be set up state to ensure better prices for farm produce vis-a-vis crop cost, Chouhan said.He took only one question  on whether he would follow the UP government and waive farm debt. Chouhan said the government has prepared a one-time settlement called Agriculture Debt Resolution Scheme to lessen the pressure on loan defaulters.The state Congress called it ""political drama"". ""Chief minister Chouhan has staged another event with an estimated expense of Rs 1 crore. His drama shows that he is trying to evade the main issue and talks with the farmers. It's better he quits the post,"" said Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh."
5b50603d9855b70b4a41a9a7,Fields of unrest,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/fields-of-unrest-4695442/,2017-06-09,"There is a clear pattern to the farmer agitations currently on in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. To start with, they seem to be concentrated in the relatively more prosperous agriculture belts  the stretch from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune to Satara, Sangli and Kolhapur in Western Maharashtra and Neemuch, Mandsaur and Ratlam in MPs Malwa region. Farmers here grow a range of commercial crops. They are also largely from progressive agricultural communities such as Marathas and Patidars. These farmers  unlike their brethren in drought-prone Marathwada, Vidarbha or Bundelkhand, who are largely into subsistence agriculture, and often resort to seasonal migratory employment  have seen good times, particularly through the first decade of this century till about 2013. This was a period of remunerative prices for most crops on the back of a global agri-commodity boom and domestic demand fuelled by rising incomes.The first setback to the above party came towards mid-2014, with the collapse of world commodity prices, leading to both falling exports and rising imports of farm products from the country. The current crisis, however, has to do more with domestic headwinds that may have some link with demonetisation. In virtually every crop marketed since November  whether soyabean, green gram, pigeon-pea and potatoes or tomato, onion, garlic, red chili, fenugreek, grapes and pomegranates  farmers have experienced huge price declines. The government claims this is mainly due to bumper production. But there is also a demand side. Produce trading in India is predominantly cash-based. The body blow this traditional agro-commercial capital has suffered due to demonetisation  and the inability of formal finance to fill the gap  may explain the apparent lack of liquidity in the markets now. With nobody really to buy and stock up, the speculative capital that used to buoy commodity prices has practically ceased to exist. And its farmers who have taken the ultimate hit.This situation is unsustainable, both politically and economically. But the solution cannot lie in farm loan waivers. Indebtedness is only the symptom of the actual disease, which is one of low prices and demand for produce. What the farm sector desperately needs is liquidity, which can come from institutional finance, modern agro-processing and organised retail, both domestic and foreign. While a zero GST rate on most primary farm produce is a welcome move, it needs to be supplemented with the removal of all restrictions on stockholding, domestic movement and exports. There is also a case to impose higher import duties, especially on pulses and edible oils, as a temporary measure. If there can be anti-dumping duties and minimum import prices on steel or float glass, why not for products from the farm  more so, in todays troubled times?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

However, it is believed to have brought cheer to farmers who had prepared their lands for sowing.According to Manjunath, Joint Director of the Agriculture Department, the rains covered over 70% of the district, facilitating the farmers to cultivate various short- and long-term crops.While for some taluks such as Vijayapura and Bagewadi, it was the first rain of the monsoon, Muddebihal, Sindgi and Indi had already received some rain. Farmers in taluks that received one or two showers have started cultivating long-term crops such as toor, cotton and sunflower. And, for taluks that received their first rain, it is ideal to sow short-term crops such as green gram. Later, as a second crop, the farmers can cultivate jowar, Bengal gram and wheat, Mr. Manjunath said. He said traditionally, the sowing area in kharif is around 5.3 lakh hectare. But, last year, the area extended to 5.6 lakh hectare.The officials said since the Meteorology Department had forecast above average rainfall in June, and if that is proven right, then the areas of cultivation could cross five lakh hectares this year, which mainly includes toor.Toor has emerged as the most remunerative crop in the district in the recent past. Thus, this year too, the farmers will cultivate the crop in large areas, Mr. Manjunath said.Last year, toor was cultivated on 3.76 lakh hectare as against the total area of over 5.5 lakh hectare land in the district. This year too, toor will dominate other crops in the district, he said."
5a05dfa79855b76bf13c1857,With love from Hyderabad,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/with-love-from-hyderabad/article18953100.ece,2017-06-10,"This is one of my favourite times of the year. Not because of the promise of rain, but because of the promise of haleem.In some parts of the country, haleem  a superb dish of mashed meat, cracked wheat and a mix of dals  is prepared only during Ramzan. You get it through the year in Delhi, and I do have it at all times, but I always look forward to getting my haleem from Hyderabad, where it is a Ramzan special.Ever since I got to know, a few years ago, that Hyderabads Pista House was couriering haleem to places outside the city during these four weeks, I have been getting my haleem from there.Pista House is a well-known restaurant and bakery in Hyderabad. Though largely known for its sweets and biscuits, its haleem is special.This time, too, I placed my order on an online service for a tub of haleem from Pista House  or I thought I did. Last year, my haleem came in a green tub; this time it was a white bucket. So I looked at it and closely and discovered it was not from Pista House, but from Shah Ghouse, another Hyderabad eatery. I called Pista House and learnt that they werent sending out their haleem this year.But I am not complaining at all about Shah Ghouses haleem. In fact, I thought it was outstanding. The mash was just right  not chewy or stringy, but just thick enough to come up easily on a spoon. I garnished it with fried onions (fried on low heat), slivers of ginger and chopped green chillies. On top of that, I squeezed some lime juice  and it became mouth-wateringly good!I often come across people who ask me how haleem is cooked. So let me give you a basic recipe for the dish (cooked with 500 gm boneless lamb, 1-1/2 cups cracked wheat, 1 tbsp channa dal, 1 tbsp moong dal, 1 tbsp masoor dal  roughly for four people).Rinse and soak the broken wheat and the dals. Let it soak for five hours or so and then drain the water. In a large pot, fry sliced onions in oil or ghee. Add cardamom, cinnamon and clove and fry some more. Add the meat and a pinch of red chilli and turmeric powders. Fry till the oil rises to the top. Now add water and cook till the meat is tender. Once done, mash it well. Now add garam masala, coriander and cumin powders, mint leaves and curd (and a bit of ghee if you wish to) and let it simmer for 10 or 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another pot, boil the dals and the wheat in 10 cups of water, along with salt, peppercorn and turmeric powder. When done, turn off the heat. Add the meat mix to the dal mix. Now mash it really well with a ladle till its nice and mushy. Put this back on the fire, and let it simmer, stirring now and then, till the dal and meat have really mixed well  say, 45 minutes to an hour. Take it off the heat, and serve with the garnishing of your choice.If you dont want to go through the trouble, just order in! I like my Hyderabad haleem for two reasons. One, it is indeed delicious. The other reason is the ease with which I get it. I log on to gaticonnect.com. There is a band right on top, and I click on haleem (ignoring such attractive lures as jewellery and pearls and health and wellness). It takes me to the haleem page, and I place my order. A kilo is for Rs. 799 (its Rs. 599 if you buy it in Hyderabad).There have been occasions when I have got the consignment on the same night, roughly around 10 or 11 p.m. This time it came a day late, but I did get a notice from Gati to say that it had been delayed. The haleem comes well-packaged. You take it out of the container and its ready to be demolished.Just heat it  and eat it."

After three consecutive years of drought, they expect a better crop yield this year.As Eruvaka Pournami (full moon day in Mrigasira) promised bountiful rains and good harvest, farmers briskly began ploughing after offering prayers to the majestic Ongole bulls, as the district received 50% of the monthly average rainfall of 58 mm in two days, with the monsoon setting on time in the first week of June.Sharing the enthusiasm of a group of farmers at K.V.Palem, near Chimakurthy, Environment Minister Sidda Raghava Rao distributed soil health cards and subsidised seeds for them to begin the Kharif crop cultivation on a confident note with the Indian Meteorological Department predicting near normal rains this year.''The situation is conducive for sowing, among other crops, green gram in 4500 hectares , black gram in 5,500 hectares and sesame in 6800 hectares'', said Agriculture Assistant Director G.Ram Prasad. From next month, the farmers can start cultivation of red gram in the district, where Khariff and Rabi cropping seasons mingle. We have positioned 890 quintals of pulse crops including green gram, black gram and green manure crops Mr.Ram Prasad added Having burnt their fingers growing excessive spicy chilli crop last year, farmers are expected to go for cotton in over 58,000 hectares this year. The western parts of the district which received scanty rainfall in the last three years, received good rains in the first 10 days of this month.Pullalacheruvu registered 65 mm rainfall, followed by Chimakurthy, 51mm, J.Pangulur 51 mm, Ongole 49 mm and Yerragondapalem, 47 mm, Chief Planning Officer K.T.Venkaiah said."
5a06443d9855b76bf13c4d5f,Don’t politicise farmers’ issues: Fishing in troubled waters will only be a disservice to MP farmers’ cause,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/dont-politicise-farmers-issues-fishing-in-troubled-waters-will-only-be-a-disservice-to-mp-farmers-cause/,2017-06-10,"Congress is at it again. Back to its old game of fishing in troubled waters and adding fuel to fire. As is its wont, Congress is trying to make political capital out of the unfortunate incident in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur  the death of five people in firing following violent agitation by farmers.It is a matter of deep anguish that the violence led to loss of human lives. While the NDA government at the Centre and BJP are seized of the matter and addressing the concerns of the farmers, the opposition, particularly Congress, is seeking to derive political mileage from the incident. Has Congress any moral right to talk about the plight of farmers after having ruled the country for more than five decades and neglected their welfare for so many years?In fact, the conditions of farmers worsened during the decade-long UPA rule when suicides by farmers increased significantly and agriculture growth rate dipped to less than 2%. All parties must look beyond narrow political gains and support the MP government and Centre in restoring peace and normalcy to the troubled state. Unfortunately, instead of dousing ignited passions, political parties are doing just the opposite.Although there is a clamour for farm loan waiver from various states, it certainly is not a long-term solution as it offers only temporary relief to the farmers. The only solution is to ensure remunerative prices while controlling the prices of inputs. The RBI governor has cautioned the risk of fiscal slippages could increase with the announcements of large farm loan waivers.In contrast to the inadequate attention paid to agriculture and farmers well-being by the UPA regimes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had from day one made it clear that Gaon, Gareeb, Kisan, Mazdoor, Mahila aur Yuva are his governments top priorities. In tune with this vision, several pro-farmer initiatives were launched with the aim to double the farmers income by 2022.The governments biggest ever contribution to crop insurance is being made under the flagship programme of Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, which covers all crops for all seasons. Similarly, another major initiative is the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana, which seeks to provide water to every field with an outlay of Rs 50,000 crore. About 7.1 crore soil health cards of the targeted 14 lakh crore have already been distributed to farmers, while e-NAM seeks to connect all agri-markets to enable farmers to know the remunerative price and sell produce at that rate.Also the MSP for various crops has been increased radically. Steps taken by the government helped in higher production of pulses. MSP for pulses for kharif 2016-17 was hiked. It was increased from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal of arhar, from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,000 per quintal of urad and from Rs 4,850 to Rs 5,250 per quintal of moong. MSP for rabi pulses increased substantially.Providing electricity to all un-electrified villages has been taken up as a major mission, apart from accelerating rural road connectivity for faster transportation of agri-produce by farmers. A huge thrust has been given to farm credit in this years budget by allocating Rs 10 lakh crore. Doordarshan also started an exclusive kisan channel to educate farmers on new technologies and keep them abreast of the latest issues.The Congress demand for the resignation of MP CM Shivraj Chouhan reflects the political bankruptcy of Congress. It would be pertinent here to mention that 24 farmers were killed in police firing at Multai in Betul district in MP in 1998 when Digvijay Singh was CM. Why did he not step down then?In fact, MP now has an extremely farmer-friendly CM in Shivraj Chouhan. Thanks to his focus on agriculture MP witnessed more than 20% growth rate in agriculture in the past few years. Various pro-farmer measures taken by MP government include providing full interest subsidy on farm credit, Rs 4,500 crore subsidy on energy to farmers and about 10-hour uninterrupted power supply to farm sector. Also, there was a phenomenal increase in irrigation potential in that state from 7.5 lakh hectares to 40 lakh hectares. The MP government is also planning to set up a price stabilisation fund to ensure remunerative prices for all crops.It has also undertaken the pioneering project of bringing Narmada water to river basins of Malwa and already linked Narmada with Kshipra river. A network of more than one lakh kilometre of rural roads has been built to enable farmers to quickly reach their produce to agriculture markets. The state is also providing the largest insurance coverage for farmers. Claims worth Rs 4,060 crore for rabi and Rs 4,416 crore for kharif were received.MPs current problem arose due to a glut, a problem of plenty  increased production of crops like cereals, pulses, onions and soyabean and lack of remunerative prices. Currently, the CM has agreed to 11 of the 13 demands put forth by the farmers organisations. He has already announced a compensation of Rs 1 crore each to the kin of those killed in firing and a job to an eligible member from each family.I appeal to farmers not to be misled by self-serving politicians. Addressing various concerns of farmers on a long-term basis needs sustained and coordinated efforts of the Centre and all states. The NDA government is addressing the issue in a completely holistic manner  be it creation of more godowns, cold storage chains, refrigerator vans, value addition through food processing units, universal crop insurance, uninterrupted power supply, affordable and timely credit or access to market information."

We have made provisions for the farmers to get loans at zero interest rates and even to deposit Rs 90,000 over a loan of Rs one lakh for fertilisers and seeds, Chouhan said during his fast at BHELs Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal.We have always stood with the farmers during distressful times. When soyabean crop was destroyed, we distributed compensation amounting to Rs 4,800 crore while Rs 4,400 crore was distributed as insurance. Due to a good yield of onion, we bought it at Rs 6 per kg last year and Rs 8 per kg this year. Toor and moong dal (pulses) are being bought at agreed upon prices, he added.Expressing grief over the escalating farmers agitation, the chief minister said that he is open to discussions with them and is sitting on the ground as he understands their pain.Farmers protests that started in the state on June 1, demanding better prices for their produce and debt relief, turned violent on June 6 when five farmers were killed in police firing in Mandsaur. The violence has spilled over to several other districts, including the Malwa-Nimad area and even reached the state capital. Angry farmers have been blocking roads, vandalising property and setting vehicles on fire.After Chouhan reached Dussehra Maidan, he addressed his Cabinet and other leaders and also held a discussion with them. Chouhan was greeted by the ex-Chief Minister of the state Kailash Joshi, who wished him well. Chouhans wife Sadhna Singh is also accompanying him on the fast.He will also run his government from the venue, an official said. Preparations began at BHEL Dussehra Maidan soon after Chouhan declared he will observe a fast. A temporary residence has been set up, with heavy deployment of forces at the venue.He was accompanied by the Principal Secretary and Secretary. The Chief Minister will hold discussions on different schemes launched by the government, including School Chale Hum, he would also review the Kharif produce, issues related to Hamidia Hospital and will primarily be talking to the farmers, sources in the administration said.The Opposition has slammed Chouhans decision to go on fast. Instead of indulging in gimmicks Chouhan should seriously address the problems of the farmers, a Congress official said.Congress state president Arun Yadav said: This fasting is a farce being played out by Chouhan. He has never considered visiting the families of the dead farmers in Mandsaur and also the houses of the 25 persons who died in a blast at a fireworks factory."

He announced his decision at a press conference on Friday evening.Chouhan was flanked by his ministerial colleagues and BJP leaders. Many party workers too gathered to listen to the chief minister on the occasion. A number of farmers were brought by the party for interacting with the chief minister. Government officials were also present on the occasion.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ajay Singh termed the fast as a Kejriwal drama, which, he alleged, would involve an expenditure of crores of rupees.He was referring to Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal who had gone on an indefinite fast, promising 24-hour power at half the existing rate and up to 20 kilolitres of free water for all when his party comes to power in the national capital.Congress workers in Indore sat on a dharna and prayed for wisdom for the chief minister.Without taking the name of the Congress, Chouhan said he was pained when he heard words like Thaane me aag laga do (Set the police station on fire) or Patthar maro (Pelt stones).The Mandsaur incident is the most unfortunate. I was deeply pained. I will get this inquired into as to who were behind the violence and what was their motive. Those who spread violence during the agitation will not be spared, he warned.Chouhan said it was unfortunate that children are being given stones in their hands. This is painful. Where do they want to the push the state? Where will the state go with such attitude of people? he asked.He said that during the violence, more than 100 police personnel sustained injuries. Of them, six were seriously injured. As many as 197 buses and 127 government vehicles were damaged.Chouhan said that since he assumed his office 11 and a half years back, his first and foremost priority has been welfare of farmers.The irrigation area has been increased from 7.5 lakh hectares in 2003 to 40 lakh hectares now, he said.The rate of interest on loan to farmers has been reduced from 18% to zero percent. Further, it was minus 10% because if a farmer took a loan of Rs 1 lakh, he was supposed to return Rs 90,000 only.Chouhan said if facilities to farmers had grown manifold, the bumper crop led to sharp fall in prices. That was why a Rs 1,000-crore price stabilisation fund was created to allow farmers to get adequate return on their produce.Thousands of tonners of onion has been purchased at Rs 8 per kg by the government. From June 10, tur daal would be purchased at Rs 5,500 per quintal whereas the market rate was Rs 3,400-3,500 per quintal. Similarly, moong and urad would be purchased at Rs 5,225 per quintal across the state, he said."

Only haivan and shaitan can do that. They are criminals I wanted to shake their conscience. send a message of peace and convey that violence will not help. Now I am satisfied.

They said their own are gone but do not spare the guilty. They invited me to their homes. Their gesture moved me so much that I could not sleep, Chouhan said.Among the measures announced for farmers are:* Kisan bazars will be set up in every nagar palika and nagar panchayat to allow farmers to sell their produce directly to customers  this, Chouhan said, will make brokers redundant and allow farmers to get a better price for their produce.* Sale of any produce below the MSP will not be allowed and any violation will be treated as a crime.* Soybean stored by farmers will be bought along with tur, moong and urad till June 30.* Madhya Pradesh will follow the Amul pattern of buying milk from farmers at a much higher rate.* Village knowledge centres will be set up and a Rajya Bhoomi Upyog Paramarsh Seva (state land use advisory service) will be started to give timely advice to farmers on crops.* Agriculture land will not be forcibly acquired for urban schemes.* A price stabilisation corpus of Rs 1,000 crore will be constituted.* A commission that will decide fair price after calculating input cost.* A settlement scheme to bring loan defaulters under the credit net again to enable them to get interest-free loans.Anil Yadav of Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), who claimed to have started the agitation in the state and had been detained earlier, said the government had accepted all their demands and there was no need to be on the streets anymore. A state minister standing behind him on the dais prompted him to say that Madhya Pradesh farmers will not take part in the three-hour blockade of national highways on June 16.Union Ministers Thaawarchand Gehlot and Narendra Tomar and BJP vice-president Kailash Vijayvargiya  they are from Madhya Pradesh  were present when Chouhan ended his fast at the instance of former Chief Minister and party veteran Kailash Joshi.The Chief Minister said several farmer organisations had appealed him to call of the fast and some of them were present on the dais.But Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh (RKMS), an organisation floated by former RSS functionary Shivkumar Sharma, said the agitation was still on because most demands had not been accepted. Those who called off the agitation have no presence or were not agitating, Sharma said, adding that the stir had become national and nearly 60 organisations have already announced a plan.A PTI report from Mandsaur said Madhya Pradesh police arrested  and subsequently released  30 activists, including Medha Patkar, Yogendra Yadav and Swami Agnivesh, in Ratlam, while they were on their way to Mandsaur to meet families of farmers killed in police firing.The activists were stopped by the police at the Dhodhar toll plaza in Ratlam districts Jaora town and detained in the Circuit House there for about 30 minutes. They dispersed after they were released,City SP Deepak Kumar Shukla said.The police told the activists, among them JNU students union president Mohit Kumar Pandey and representatives from farmer outfits, that their visit could disturb peace in Mandsaur, where prohibitory orders under CrPc Section 144 are in place, though curfew was lifted Saturday.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Chandrasekhar Rao, seem to be following the footsteps of Zaheerabad farmers by opting for food crops rather than high water intensive commercial crops.The recent meeting held by Collector P. Venkataram Reddy and Prof. Jayashankar Agriculture University vice-chancellor with farmers gave a clear indication to this move.The Deccan Development Society (DDS), a non government organisation (NGO) based at Pastapur in Jarsangam mandal of Sangareddy district, has been encouraging farmers for the past two decades or so to opt for millet farming.It has been educating them about the risks in going for commercial crops and how it would keep them in debt trap.Go for alternative crops like red gram, maize and Soya which required less water or can be cultivated after rains. If you go for commercial crops like cotton, the investment will be huge and you may incur heavy expenses on fertilizers, pesticides and labour charges . The mental stress on farmers will be huge. The price of cotton may fall if everyone goes for the same crop, said Prof. Praveen Rao while addressing the farmers of both these villages a few days ago.Decreased stressReferring to red gram, maize and soya, Mr Rao said the crops could be sown by using machines and the stress on hiring labourers will be very limited.Stating that these crops including green gram can be cultivated under seed development scheme, Mr Rao said that soil health can also be protected by cultivating these crops.Similar was the statement made by one Narasimhulu, a farmer of Islampur who spoke at a function organised by Deccan Development Society under Naa Vyavasayam  Naa Telangana programme at Jarasangam mandal.We can have food and fodder for cattle if we go for food crops. It will also protect soil health. We cannot go for cotton crop as it will lead to heavy investments, resulting in debts and which in turn will lead to farmerssuicides. Even sugarcane is getting dried up due to water scarcity, opined Narasimhulu."

He started four years back by cultivating pulses over 30 decimal of land and encouraged with the returns, Soren extended it to about one acre during last kharif season.Owner of eight acres of land, Samuel looks forward to cultivate pulses on four acres of land during the ensuing karif season. Since majority of his land holdings is high land and the paddy yield is far less than expectation, he decided to switch over to pulses.Like Samuel, 15 other farmers of the village are cultivating pulses after gradually diverting from paddy. The success story of Samuel and other farmers has led the Agriculture department to chalk out plan to increase pulses production by additional 5,022 tonnes during the ensuing kharif season. Pulses, including arhar, mung, biri, kulthi and other varieties will be cultivated on 35,800 hectares of land with a production target of 21,140 tonnes. The target last season for pulses was 16,118 tonnes.The department also plans to increase the yield during 2017 kharif season at 5.91 quintal per hectare compared to 4.49 quintal per hectare during last kharif season. The department has drawn up a plan to promote diversion from paddy to non-paddy crops through cultivation of pulses in Dhankauda block of the district.The mixed cropping of arhar and groundnut will be promoted in Naktideul block while pulses cultivation will be increased in Bamra block. This apart, bund plantation of arhar will be promoted in the blocks of Maneswar, Rairakhol, Naktideul, Kuchinda and Jamankira.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Sambalpur, Pradosh Kumar Samal said the Government has issued instructions to promote pulses in rice fallow and it is being promoted at ground level.

We will come with our families and cattle and cook food there. The agitation will continue until the government agrees to our demands, BKS state general secretary Kailash Gandolia told reporters here.After two years of drought, the farmers reaped a good harvest this year but the government did not purchase many crops such as groundnut, mustard, and moong dal at MSP. We approached the government but it paid no attention. The attitude of the government towards the farmers is not right, Gandolia added.Gandolia said that this year the mustard production in Rajasthan was 37 lakh tonnes but farmers sustained a loss of 2,600 crore as government did not purchase the oil seed at MSP.In March, we held demonstrations in all the districts after which the government assured that it will begin procuring mustard at MSP from April 1. The government, however, kept delaying the procurement process and as a result many farmers committed suicide. When we told state agriculture minister Prabulal Saini about the crash in prices of garlic during his visit to Kota, he said who had asked us to plant so much garlic, he alleged.Unlike the farmers in some other state, the BKS is not demanding loan waiver.THE BKS demands1. Call a special Assembly session to make suitable changes in policies for benefit of farmers2. Purchase the agriculture produce at MSP3. Purchase of crops below MSP should be made a crime4. Implementation of irrigation projects5. Electricity to those whose applications are pending6. Electricity should be provided at flat rates"

A cooperative bank in the state has sent notices to nearly 3,000 farmers, threatening legal action if they don't clear loan dues.The notices have been sent by the district cooperative bank Hoshangabad to farmers in Hoshangabad and Harda districts, triggering kisan unions to warn of fresh agitation. Sources say bank officials started sending the notices, via the district administration, in March and the process is still on.While insiders say that the bank has warned of legal action against 15,000 farmers over loan defaults worth Rs 500 crore, the general manager of the cooperative bank says the real number is a fifth of that. ""Notices have been given to 3,000 farmers and we have full hope that will get the due payments,"" general manager R B Thakur, told TOI, adding that the bank's demand was around Rs 300 crore and some of it has been recovered from their accounts through money deposited for crop insurance and proceeds from wheat procurement.Thakur said that there are around 1.61 kisan credit card (KCC) holders in the region and the total 'chronic default' is around Rs 80 crore. ""Of the other defaults, we recovered Rs 77 crore from crop insurance and Rs 88.5 crore from wheat procurement,"" said the officer. Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has raised strong objection to the loan recovery proce edings. ""This is not the way to recover loan. Farmers are the sufferers. We will protest strongly,"" said Shiv Mohan Singh, BKS spokesperson, urging the government to chalk out a strategy for easy repayment of loans rather than ""threatening that their farmland would be attached"". Adding to their woes, the electricity department has snapped the power connections of more than 1,000 farmers in the same region due to non-payment of dues.Chouhan said that collectors must ensure farmers get a ""fair price"" of their produce. He also made it clear that there is no limit to purchase of onions and other produce. ""They should also monitor law and order to avoid any untoward incident,"" he said. ""Collectors must procure the entire onion stock being brought by farmers at procurement centres. In view of recent incidents, district officials should keep a watch on law and order and take stern action if needed,"" CM said. In a bid to pacify agitating farmers, the government had ordered purchase of onions from June 7 at 22 procurement centres across the state.The government had also assured that moong and tuar will be procured from farmers from June 10 at minimum support price. He cautioned officials not to sell BT cotton seeds above the rates fixed by the Centre.

He requested the police not to trouble his family and asked asking his kin not to wail over his death. The farmer is survived by his mother, wife and two minor daughters.The state government, meanwhile, dispatched a fact-finding team to the victims village on Monday while district administration sent a separate team led by the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Bhor Singh Yadav in the afternoon.Bank officials informed the district administration team that a loan of Rs 40,000 had been released in the name of victims wife Manorama Devi in 2010-2011.The outstanding amount of the loan had increased to Rs 61,000. Officials, however, said they never put any pressure on the farmer for repayment of the loan, Ranchi deputy commissioner (DC), Manoj Kumar said, adding prima facie it doesnt seem to be a case of due to the loan.He said they are investigating the case in every possible angles such as why family members did not inform police about his death while the police outpost is few metres away from the village.

Tnjab news, india news, latest news, indian express The political-economy of the farm sector over the last few years explains the current crisis. Tnjab news, india news, latest news, indian expressEconomics is like gravity. No matter how hard we try to defy it, it always catches up. Three years into the BJP government, farm economics has caught up. For armchair economists to dismiss farmer distress as politically motivated may be convenient, but we cant ignore the writing on the wall: We have a serious agrarian crisis. In the past three years, average hikes in the Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) for major crops have failed to keep pace with either what was achieved in the previous 10 years or the net inflation levels for these respective years. In the same period, profit margins based on MSP purchases of major crops, according to the governments own data, have collapsed. Finally, the outstanding farm loans have gone up by 55 per cent in the first 30 months of the Modi government.The political-economy of the farm sector over the last few years explains the current crisis. The UPA decade (2004-14) saw stable annual increases in the MSPs: Paddy MSP went up from Rs 590 to Rs 1,400, indicating an annual increase of 13 per cent. Similarly, the average annual hike for wheat in this period was 14 per cent, arhar 22 per cent, moong 23 per cent and cotton 18 per cent.During the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, the BJP promised a better deal for farmers. Most importantly, along with the BJPs manifesto, it was Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself who promised a minimum 50 per cent profit margin on each crop by implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendations. Then, in a disappointing U-turn in February 2015, the Union government filed an affidavit in the Supreme Court terming the implementation of the Swaminathan Report market distorting and unfeasible.Adding insult to injury, there has been a steep decline in the annual MSP hikes since 2014 compared to the UPA years: The average annual increases in MSP for paddy has dipped from 13 per cent to 4 per cent in 2014-17, wheat from 14 to 4 per cent, arhar from 22 to 6 per cent and moong from 23 to 5 per cent. Overall, the average annual MSP hike across major crops has collapsed from an average of 15 per cent in the UPA years to 4 per cent in the three years since 2014. Simply put for the salaried class: Would you prefer a 15 per cent annual salary hike or a 4 per cent one? That too when you were offered a big bonus in 2014 (the Swaminathan bonus!).The increasing cost of cultivation (the government has not passed on the benefits of reduced global oil prices to the farmer) and low MSP hikes have hit the profitability of the farmers hard. In 2010-11, a farmer made a 39 per cent profit on paddy (MSP Rs 950/quintal, production cost of Rs 670). This has fallen to 6.5 per cent and 6.7 per cent in 2015-16 and 2016-17 respectively. The same holds for all the other crops. It cannot be a coincidence that India recorded its highest economic growth in the years 2007-12 when our farmers earned the highest profits.One result has been that the farmer has not been paying back his debt at historical rates. The total outstanding farm loans have ballooned from Rs 8.11 lakh crore in March 2014 to Rs 12.6 lakh crore  a jump of about 55 per cent over a 30-month period. Add the impact of demonetisation to the declining profit margins and growing indebtedness, and you have the recipe for a perfect storm.On its part, facing massive backlash from the farmer, the government has come out with a seven-point agenda to double farmer income by 2022. This target itself is more rhetorical than substantive for two reasons. Firstly, it is less than ambitious  according to the rural income survey, between 2002-03 and 2012-13 the average monthly income per farmer went up from Rs 2,115 to Rs 6,426  incomes have actually tripled in the10-year period. Secondly, it is hardly realistic in the present situation. Doubling farmer income by 2022 would need a 14 per cent agricultural income growth rate for the next five years which seems unachievable now given that 2015-16 growth number was just 1.2 per cent.Finally, a slow-down in investment in our economy resulting in lower growth in sectors such as construction and manufacturing are a double-whammy for the hinterland. These secondary sectors have been the natural sectors for the migration of labour from the primary sector burdened with the increasing fragmentation of landholdings. With industry not in a good shape, and the farm economy in peril, the rural youth are restless. The distress is now boiling over.The present government has two years left in office and we all want the crisis to be resolved at the earliest. The government has few options left, the time has come for it to consider implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendations in full, especially ensuring a minimum 50 per cent profit margin and a loan waiver like the one promised in UP. PR stunts and a helpful media might help in the short-term but economics and gravity cant be defied indefinitely.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Kanagaraj said 56,500 farmers from the district had insured their crops such as paddy, maize, black gram, green gram, groundnut, cotton and sugarcane cultivated on 51,482 hectare under the Crop Insurance Scheme for 2016  2017 and had paid Rs. 3.07 crore as premium.For the current kar season, farmers should pay the insurance premium of Rs. 470 per acre for paddy before July 31 and the deadline for paying the premium for other crops is August 15, he said.However, the farmers complained that those who had insured their crops by properly paying the premium with the designated insurance company were yet to get compensation for the unprecedented crop loss they had suffered.District secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasaayigal Sangam P. Velumayil said the farmers, even after paying the prescribed premium before the deadline, were desperately waiting for the compensation to be paid by the insurance company.The farmers indefinite wait after suffering huge crop loss is really agonising When we raised this issue earlier, the insurance firm and the officials assured us that the compensation would be paid at the earliest. However, the affected agriculturists are yet to get the compensation, Mr. Velumayil said.He also complained that the premium of Rs. 330 per acre for paddy had been increased to Rs. 470. This is due to the governments policy that favours a private firm. Instead, the government itself should implement the insurance scheme so that the farmers will get benefited while paying affordable premium, Mr. Velumayil said.Endorsing his views, farmer S. Kasamuthu and S. T. Shaik Maideen of Communist Party of India charged that the insurance firm was just cheating the farmers by delaying the compensation disbursal.Intervening, Mr. Sandeep assured the farmers that the first phase of compensation disbursal would be completed by June 26.The officials replied that the farmers would get increased compensation as the crop insurance premium had been upwardly revised.A senior official from ICICI Lombard, the insurance firm, Kothandaraman replied that their company, which had completed the compensation disbursal in Salem and Tirupur districts, would commence this exercise in Tirunelveli district from June 20.Even as he was replying, Mr. Kothandaraman swooned. However, he recovered after a few minutes, much to the relief of the officials and farmers.When the farmers urged the Collector to take a survey on the coconut trees withered due to drought, Mr. Sandeep said any decision in this connection could be taken only by the government and hence could not be conducted at the district level.He also assured that the district administration would take appropriate action for sinking borewells or digging open wells if the farmers could provide information on availability of groundwater near the affected areas."

Farmers raised slogans, held demonstrations and blocked the roads and highways in several towns across the State.The BKS has extended support to the ongoing agitation of farmers in different States and raised the demand in Rajasthan for an increase in Minimum Support Price (MSP) based on input costs, convening of a special session of the State Assembly to discuss the difficulties being faced by farmers, and formulation of new agricultural policies.However, the BKS has stopped short of demanding a loan waiver for farmers, which is a major issue of confrontation between farmers' groups and governments in several States. BKS general secretary Kailash Gandolia said farmers were expecting the Rajasthan government to procure crops such as groundnut, mustard and moong at MSP after two years of drought.Flawed policiesThe Communist Party of India (CPI-M)-affiliated All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) organised a huge rally of farmers of the Shekhawati region in Sikar, where its leaders attacked both the Union and State governments and demanded waiver of agricultural loans. AIKS president Amra Ram said the government's flawed policies had harmed farmers who were unable to get even the input costs on their agricultural produce.After the rally, thousands of farmers marched to the District Collectorate and staged a dharna there. CPI(M) leaders Vasudev and Pema Ram were among those who addressed the farmers.In the Bikaner district, the grain mandi s in Lunkaransar, Sridungargarh and Nokha remained closed on the BKS call. Farmers blocked the Jaipur-Bikaner highway for about an hour and left only after the police personnel persuaded them.Addressing a farmers' rally at Itawa in the Kota district, Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot flayed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government for the deteriorating state of agriculturists, which had forced 61 farmers to commit suicide in its rule. He said the BJP had exploited farmers as a vote bank for its political benefit."

PTI Photo Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan consoles family members of a deceased farmer, killed in the recent police firing, at village Lodh in Mandsaur district. PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Therefore, every scheme meant for farmers should reach them to help them recover loss. The Fasal Bima Yojana would help the agrarian sector if officials of the agriculture and related departments worked purposefully, he added.Chetana Patil, Joint Director of Agriculture Department, who spoke about the action taken so far, said that a Bengaluru-based private company had been entrusted to supervise the implementation of Fasal Bima Yojana and officials of the department would coordinate with the company, she added.Dr. Patil said that the last date to deposit premium amount for other kharif crops was July 31 but for paddy the last date would be August 14.Dr. Satish suggested to Dr. Patil that awareness programmes be conducted to help farmers deposit premium amount for green gram, groundnut, cotton, sunflower, maize, sesame, jowar, bajra and other crops under the scheme.He also asked farmers to visit Raitha Sampark Kendras in their respective taluks for any query and also to deposit crop premium amount."

Since there has been good rain so far in many parts of the State, the farming community is also going up for paddy nurseries early, the officials said adding that such activity was only taken up towards mid-July in recent years.Farmers in many parts of Mahbubnagar, Jogulamba-Gadwal, Rangareddy, Sangareddy, Medak, Kamareddy and a few other districts believe that they reap rich harvest if they sow seed of pulses and cash crops such as cotton and soyabean in the first 15 days after the Eruvaka (Mungarau) Pournami, which occurred on June 10 this year.Accordingly, they have taken up the sowing operations in many areas which have received ample precipitation."

The government has also promised relief measures.Farm distressThe sit-in had embarrassed the State government, as the BKS had extended its support to the farmers agitation and flayed the agricultural policies, which it said were creating an intense farm distress. The farmers' body stopped short of demanding a loan waiver, but asked the government to procure more crops such as groundnut, mustard and moong, at MSP after two years of drought.After a marathon meeting which continued till late on Monday night, the State government assured the BKS leaders that a law would be enacted to make the pricing of agricultural produces below MSP in the open market a punishable offence. A committee will study the existing legislations in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat on this aspect.BKS general secretary Kailash Gandolia said the State government had also agreed to have a debate on the farmers' issues during the initial days of the State Assembly's next session. For the electricity bills, farmers were given relaxation to make the payments in six months instead of every two months.With the agitation called by other farmers' groups, including CPI(M)-backed All India Kisan Sabha, still continuing, the Opposition Congress took exception to the State government holding talks only with the BKS.The Congress said there was no positive outcome to the negotiations as neither was a guarantee given for procurement of produce at MSP nor an assurance of loan waiver.Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot said the BJP government had failed to fulfil its promise made in the election manifesto for payment of 50% profit over the input costs in agriculture. He demanded immediate waiver of farmers' loans on the lines of Punjab, where the Congress government has waived loans of small and marginal farmers owning land up to five acres.Insult to injuryThe BJP government has added insult to injury by talking to just a section of farmers... this is not going to provide relief to the entire farmer community, said Mr. Pilot, while declaring his party's support to all genuine demands of farmers.The call for a bandh in the grain mandis across the State was also withdrawn after the sit-in was called off.

(Express photo) A farmer near Jalna in Maharashtra examining his freshly sown Bt cotton field. (Express photo)Bhaskarrao More last year sowed tur (pigeon-pea) and moong (green gram) on four acres and cotton in the rest of his eight-acre holding. In this kharif season, he has already planted seven acres under cotton, leaving a sole acre for moong.I grew more pulses last time only because prices were Rs 9,000-10,000 per quintal. But having got a rate of only Rs 3,500-4,500 for my five quintals of tur and three quintals of moong this February, I have gone back to cotton, notes this farmer from Tupewadi village in Badnapur taluka of Maharashtras Jalna district.The same goes for Raosaheb Vittalrao Gavhane from Hiswan Khurd in Jalna taluka, who, like many farmers here, cultivates pulses as an inter-crop with cotton or soyabean. I usually plant tur in about five rows and cotton in 150 rows every acre. Last years prices led me to raise the tur planting to 10 rows and reduce the cotton rows to 140. But I realised less from my two quintals this time than from one quintal in 2016, he remarks.The story of 2017 kharif so far clearly has been about cottons comeback at the expense of pulses. The Union agriculture ministrys data bear this out: As on June 16, farmers had sown 16.67 lakh hectares (lh) under cotton, as against last years corresponding all-India area of 12.25 lh. This, even as pulses acreage has dipped from 3.63 lh to 2.22 lh.The government declared a minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,050 per quintal for tur, but the farmers who tried to sell to state agencies had to wait for 7-8 days for their crop to be lifted. They were told that there are no bardanas (jute bags) to pack the procured produce. Most farmers couldnt afford the cost of waiting so long and chose to offload to private traders at Rs 4,000 per quintal or below, says Gavhane.The contrast with cotton couldnt have been more. I did not even have to go to the mandi. The traders themselves came to buy the kapas (raw un-ginned cotton) straight from my fields at Rs 5,600 per quintal this February, compared with Rs 4,000 in the previous year, he adds.Cotton is typically a 175-180 day crop, with the first harvest (picking) taking place some 120 days after sowing towards the second week of June. Subsequent pickings  there could be five in all  happen thereafter every 15 days or so. In a normal monsoon year, farmers with access to basic irrigation (stored rainwater conveyed to fields through, say, a three-horsepower motor pump) can harvest around 12 quintals per acre. With drip irrigation, which allows an extra picking, this could go to even 15 quintals.For farmers, the biggest cost is that of picking. At Rs 500 per quintal for 12 quintals, it works out to Rs 6,000 an acre. The second major expense head is pesticides. About six sprays of branded insecticides such as Confidor, Actara and Polo  mainly against sucking pests like thrips, jassids, aphids and whitefly  cost roughly Rs 4,000 per acre, excluding Rs 200 on labour for each round of spraying.This is followed by weeding (four rounds costing Rs 750 each) and inter-culture (five times; a farmer not owning bullocks will have to hire these each time at roughly Rs 600). Then, there is fertiliser. Gavhane applies one 50-kg bag each of 19:19:19 NPK complex fertiliser (currently retailing at Rs 1,120), 10:26:26 (Rs 1,160), di-ammonium phosphate (Rs 1,260), muriate of potash (Rs 580) and urea (Rs 300) on every acre, adding up to Rs 4,420. The least expenditure is on seeds. A packet of 450-gram Bt cotton seeds sells at Rs 750 and at 1.5 packets per acre, that comes to just Rs 1,125.Inclusive of Rs 1,000 for field preparation, my total cultivation cost will be within Rs 25,000 per acre. Even if I get Rs 5,000 per quintal this time on 12 quintals yield, my net return would be Rs 35,000 per acre, explains Gavhane. For farmers like him in Marathwada  or even those from the neighbouring Vidarbha region  the planting choices during the current kharif season essentially reduce to cotton, pulses, soyabean and maize.At the current market prices, pulses arent the most attractive option. Soyabean realisations have also plunged to Rs 2,400-2,500 per quintal from Rs 3,600-3,700 a year ago. But this is a crop with cultivation costs at hardly Rs 10,000 per acre. With average yields of eight quintals per acre, farmers still stand to make money. Moreover, given its short duration of 90-100 days  enabling planting of a succeeding rabi winter crop of wheat, chana (chickpea) or Maldandi jowar (sorghum)  soyabean cannot be written off yet. Cottons real advantage is its relative hardiness. Soyabean can be a washout if it rains heavily during seed setting or harvesting time. Cotton, on the other hand, is picked four-five times. Even if the rains arent too good, the farmer is assured of at least two pickings. If the monsoon turns out good, he may give the plant more water and fertilisers for it to yield an extra picking of 2 quintals, points out Usha Barwale Zehr, Joint Director of Research at Maharashtra Hybrid Seeds Company.Cotton apart, the other hot crop this time could be maize. A poor crop last year, courtesy drought in Peninsular India, has meant that the ruling prices, at Rs 1,550-1,600 per quintal, are above the Centres MSP of Rs 1,425. They may not fall much  one plausible reason being the clampdown on the cattle/buffalo meat trade. That, it is being said, has increased the demand for poultry meat, which also translates into higher feed grain consumption. Like Bt cotton, maize has benefited from technology, with the advent of single-cross hybrids yielding 30 quintals and more per acre over 110-120 days.The agriculture ministry data show an increase in maize area from 5.62 lh to 6.01 lh so far, while the same for soyabean is down from 1.01 lh to 0.45 lh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(File Photo) The National Commission on Farmers did not elaborate on what really constituted weighted average cost of production in its report submitted in October 2006. (File Photo)It is a formula on the lips of every farmer-protester today. But the M S Swaminathan committees widely disseminated recommendation, to fix minimum support prices (MSP) for crops at levels at least 50 per cent more than the weighted average cost of production, remains a holy grail or partial reality at best.The National Commission on Farmers  as the panel headed by the agricultural scientist was called  did not elaborate on what really constituted weighted average cost of production in its report submitted in October 2006. The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), on the other hand, gives three definitions of production costs: A2, A2+FL and C2.A2 costs basically cover all paid-out expenses, both in cash and in kind, incurred by farmers on seeds, fertilisers, chemicals, hired labour, fuel, irrigation, etc. A2+FL cover actual paid-out costs plus an imputed value of unpaid family labour. C2 costs are more comprehensive, accounting for the rentals and interest forgone on owned land and fixed capital assets respectively, on top of A2+FL.The accompanying table gives all-India weighted average A2, A2+FL and C2 production costs for 14 crops, as projected by the CACP for the current 2017-18 kharif season. It also has the corresponding MSPs (inclusive of bonus) for these crops declared by the Narendra Modi government.The announced MSPs, it turns out, are Swaminathan formula-compliant  i.e. providing more than 50 per cent return  with respect to A2 costs for all the 14 crops, barring jowar (sorghum), ragi and sunflower. The average paid-out A2 costs for paddy, for instance, is estimated at Rs 840 per quintal. The MSP of Rs 1,550, then, works out 84.5 per cent more than this cost. However, for jowar, this years MSP of Rs 1,700 per quintal is just 40 per cent above the A2 cost.Moreover, when it comes to A2+FL, the Swaminathan formula of 50 per cent return over cost is satisfied only in three crops: bajra (pearl-millet), arhar (pigeon-pea) and urad (black gram). Its even worse with regard to C2, where the 50 per cent profit recommendation is not met for a single crop. In the case of jowar, ragi, moong (green gram), sunflower, sesamum, nigerseed and cotton, the MSPs dont even cover  leave alone provide a return over  C2 costs.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

After finishing my class 10, I left home and started cooking. I dont have a degree in culinary studies. It is the experience that I have gained from cooking at different places. My career flagged off in Delhi and from there I moved Kolkata and Lucknow.I have been working in Chennai for the past 10 years. I used to work in corporate canteens and then started taking party orders from different hotels in the city. I used to get a lot of calls from guests for weddings when they would want to have authentic Marwari food served at their sons or daughters weddings. I joined the Park Hyatt last year when I came in as a specialist with a team of chefs and for a food promotion.When I was in Delhi, I learnt and started cooking dishes like dal bati churma (a popular Rajasthani dish), ghatte ki sabzi (gram flour dumpling), rajma chawal and other such dishes.Then, when I reached Kolkata, I had to learn to make sweets like payesh, mishti doi, sandesh and chats like chana samosa, dahi puri and so on. When I reached Chennai, I learned South Indian cuisine like idlis, sambar and vadas.While traveling, I learned how to make a lot of cuisines, but my love for cooking Marwari food never changed. I always ensure that I stick to using authentic ingredients while cooking but also considering the needs and tastes of my guests. Sometimes the guests prefer a particular dish with a different ingredient. For instance, in dal bati itself we make two different types: one is the simple dal bati and the other is the masala dal bati.Some guests may want to have a moong dal (green gram) masala bati whereas some prefer it with toor dal (pigeon peas). I make that accordingly, without playing with the authenticity of food.I am proud of my dal bati churma. Apart from that, I also make gatte ki sabzi, gatta koftha, sangri and bedmi puri. I was appreciated for chats like rajasthani dahi vada, aaloo tikka and paapdi chat.All I know is food, food and more food. I am particular about the quality and consistency of the food I cook, and always excited to cook at any time of the day."

Enough water was available in the 1,888 hectares area comprising the three villages  Kadwanchi, Nandapur and Waghrul  since late 1990s.The project has become famous as the Kadwanchi model since it helps grow grapes, a water-intensive crop.Hardly anybody knew of grapes 20 years ago. Now, 95% of farmers in the area cultivate grapes. There used be drought in our villages. After the project was implemented, we never faced water scarcity. Farmers here are lakhpatis now, Chandrakant Kshirsagar, farmer and sarpanch of Kadwanchi village, told IANS during a visit to the village.The 45-year-old farmer says he has been making handsome profit every year by cultivating grapes on his 15-acre semi-arid land, irrespective of rainfall, which was up to 50% less than the normal during the drought years. The farm produce has sustained 355 families in the three villages.The project involved building continuous contour and absorption trenches in the hills and bunding (or earthen embankments) on farm boundaries to recharge ground water and stop soil erosion. Also, check dams were constructed at several spots to store large volumes of water. Later, several small ponds in farms were constructed through a separate government scheme, which boosted the water management programme.Earlier, we could not make effective use of monsoon water since most of it would run off. In addition, it would cause soil erosion, thus reducing nutrition content from soil. If soil is conserved, water will be conserved automatically. Under the watershed project, we took several measures to arrest soil erosion and water to recharge underground water-table, said social activist Vijay Borade, who conceptualised the project.The project was implemented in the three villages by Krishi Vigyan Kendra (KVK) under the Indo-German Watershed Project from 1996 to 2002.Borade, a recipient of Maharashtras Krishi Bhushan award, said their measures paid off. None of the farmers in this area has complained of water scarcity, even during summers. They are cultivating water-intensive crops and getting better remuneration, he added.According to Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA)  a National Research Institute under the Indian Council of Agricultural Research  cultivation of grape increased exponentially after the project was completed.Pandit Wasre, Agriculture Engineer at the Jalna KVK, who was also part of the watershed project, said the region was vulnerable to drought but the farmers now have year-round access to water, allowing them to cultivate their land twice in a year.It has been just 97mm of rainfall in eight days so far and all check dams are full. Also, water can be seen in farms due to bunding. The volume of partial failure of crops has come down significantly due to the project, Wasre said.He said adoption of the cost-effective Kadwanchi model can make the farmers in the Marathwada region self-sufficient in water.Bhagwan Kshirsagar, a grape grower from the area, says he is planing to cultivate export quality grape variety, which would help him fetch more money. Initial investment is a little more. But we are quite confident of returns due to water availability, Kshirsagar said.While the Marathwada region has been in limelight for farmers suicide in the past few years  with 900 farmers killing themselves in 2016  Kshirsagar said farmers from the watershed area never faced financial distress.According to the KVK data, agriculture income from this watershed area was Rs 27 crore in 2012-13 when rainfall was just 29 per cent of the annual average. In 2015-16, the income rose to Rs 42 crore when rainfall was 60 per cent. Before the watershed project, the average yearly income in the villages was Rs 77 lakh.Local farmers said the annual yield of grapes ranges between 12 and 15 tonnes per acre every year, while some managed to get up to 20 tonnes. They also grow cotton, pigeon pea, green gram, sorghum and corn.Now, villagers in the area are planning to cultivate guava, as the government has shown interest in fruit juice production, Borade said.He said the Kadwanchi model is being adopted in nearby areas. The model cannot be exactly same owing to different land use and climatic conditions, but people can take inspiration from this model and develop their own, Borade added."

Farmers in the area on several occasions petitioned local authorities to halt work - an anicut under construction is bound to keep water from reaching fertile fields where farmers have been cultivating moong, guar, bajra and other crops for generations. If there is rain in winter, a crop of either chickpeas or mustard is also sown.On May 29, 2012, Rajasthan High Court , in an order pertaining to the Ramgarh Dam and applicable across the state, said, ""Construction of anicuts should not be permitted unless a proper survey is made to assess rainfall in the area indicating sufficiency of water for the anicuts and overflow."" Villagers say works are being undertaken without consultation or proper planning, in violation of court orders.Over Rs 40 lakh has been sanctioned for work in Bhopa and Pithodai villages, according to a circular from the district collector on March 16. Villagers are concerned that traditional systems that have served well for generations will now be starved of water this monsoon, thanks to the new anicut that is currently under construction.Lands locally called ""khadin"" - extremely fertile and wet lands irrigated by streams in the area that flow after the monsoon, will be disturbed by all the digging. Two khadins in the area have served as fertile fields for about 150 villagers, and the streams that form after the monsoon irrigate about 600 acres here. Farmers fear the anicut will divert water from their fields and any overflow will only go to lands not irrigated or cultivated at present.Over 40 villagers petitioned the district collector on May 23 this year, saying the district receives good rains only once in about five years. Traditionally, the desert region sees just about 165 ml rain annually, and this water is carefully conserved.Hukam Singh, a farmer in Bhopa, told TOI, ""We went as a group of about 40 people to meet the collector and also the Block Development Officer. Only two of us were allowed entry into the office. Each time, we are told our concerns will be taken care of. Work on the anicut has just gone on, despite our pleas and protests.""Over the years, the state irrigation department, working closely with villagers, evolved mechanisms to conserve water. There are two open wells at the endpoint of the flow of the natural stream. Villagers say they were not consulted at the planning stage of the Jal Swavlamban project. Besides, the tender process has occurred in violation of norms - under the rules, a gram sabha must be held and these projects discussed with locals before implementation. ""This is sheer waste of public money,"" said one villager, unwilling to be named.Villagers say any conservation measure should ideally have been planned at the point where the water collects in two open wells, at the end point of the stream. This would then not have disturbed the natural flow of the short-lived stream. Anurag Bhardwaj, commissioner of the watershed development and soil conservation department of the state government, in a letter of June 1, also noticed cracks in the pond under construction here for water conservation. He said the mini-percolation tank's side slopes also needed proper maintenance.District collector Kailash Chand told TOI, ""Yes, I did receive a complaint but all technical parameters are being observed and there will be no problem because of this anicut."""

Mr. Mokashi said that there is no dearth of seeds and fertilizers as the district administration procured 10,000 quintals of seeds and 80,000 tonnes of fertilizers.Of this, around 8,000 quintals of seeds and 50,000 tonnes of fertilizers have already been distributed to the farmers, he added.After the price of the commercial crops increased, there is huge demand for black gram and green gram this year. Whereas the area of red gram cultivation in the district will reduce for the kharif season, he added.This year, procurement centres have distributed 600 quintals of black gram, green gram and soya bean seeds against the average distribution of 150 quintal every year."

Therefore, timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSP) for pulses prior to the sowing season is of great importance, according to a study conducted by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation . ""Announcement on MSP for pulses ideally in June-July can have a significant impact on farmers' choice of crops,"" it said.India produced over 106 million tons of rice and over 95 million tons of wheat in 2013-14. This is about 10 million tons higher than the demand for each of these crops. In the same period, we produced just about 19 million tons of pulses which reduced to 17.5 million tons in 2014-15, although there is annual demand of about 24 million tons of pulses. ""This deficit situation in pulses exists, because there is a much more efficient system for procurement and a lucrative MSP for rice and wheat. India currently has a policy in place for five pulses only - tur, moong, urad, lentil and gram. Further, there is need to ensure that the MSP actually reaches the farmer and is not exploited by middlemen. State governments could explore special schemes for pulses in respective states,"" the study said.Recent analysis by the multi-country LANSA consortium project led by MSSRF showed that as per the National Sample Survey 61st and 68th rounds, only Himachal Pradesh met the daily requirement of 40 grams of pulses.States like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal , did not even meet 50% of the norm set for daily protein intake. In a country, 34 per cent of children are underweight (NFHS-4), pulses are important to address malnutrition.The study further recommends ensuring availability through Public Distribution System and increasing consumption of less popular but more nutritious pulses.""Since pulses need less than one-fifth the water rice requires, they are also water-smart. Getting farmers to grow pulses is important to increase income, reduce water for farming and improve nutritional status. In the current year, we may face a deficit monsoon. So announcing a remunerative MSP for pulses may be the way ahead. It is time to make this announcement now,"" it said."

It feels as if it was yesterday when I had stepped into his house and in his life. The house was not a big like it is today. Time had passed. I have been blessed with the two beautiful sons. In the first year of marriage, it was difficult to adjust to a new culture, new custom. But within a few months, I quietly adjusted to the system in my married home. In fact, I don't know when I became part of the system and when the entire system began to revolve around me. After one year of my marriage, there was Nabakalebar, the biggest festival of the Shree Jagannath culture when the deities are reborn. Every thing was new for me then. I still remember the days when Swain Mohapatra had left along with others in search of the darubrahma. There was no media publicity. Everything was being done in a routine manner. I had not only spotted a teja (a spark) in his face but also found the same in each daitpati during that time. Being the wife of Swain Mohapatra, I have been closely involved in all these things. I started loving his passion to keep more than 100 cows, about 200 parrots and other animals in the House. If you have the love for the Lord, you live for Him only. Then you can easily learn the intricate customs associated with the culture. You would be surprised to know that though I regularly visit the temple, I had never gone with him there even for a single day. During the rath yatra period, we maintain a life of austerity for a month. Whatever name and fame we have got so far is because of His blessings only. When Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee had visited our house in March and blessed my two daughters-in-law, my joy knew no bounds. Tears roll down my cheeks when I notice famous people touching the feet of my husband. It really touches me. Why do they do this? It's not because we are big people - they do it because for their love and devotion for Lord Jagannath. Without Him, we have no value. Our life revolves around Him. I have also heard that if any one does the Brahma parivartan of Lord, their life span is reduced. Such stories give me pain. You cannot delve deep into the mind of a woman, but I silently sit before Him and place all my anxieties with the Lord. Within a few minutes of regaining my composure, I know that the Lord is there to protect me.

Picture by Sarat Kumar Patra Nirupama Das Mohapatra Nirupama Das Mohapatra I have forgotten the year when I got married to Haladar Das Mohapatra. Before my marriage, I was a great devotee of Lord Krishna. My day begins with his name only. After my marriage, when for the first time I saw Lord Jagannath, I felt it was Him only. That's how time flies. I was told that my husband was born after a lot of puja-patha and his mother had conceived him when she was almost 50. His father had passed away when he was only eight. Over the years, he struggled a lot. I have been a witness to that. Now because of His blessings only, we are comfortable. In fact, being the wife of a daitapati we consider ourselves as the sakhee (friend) of the Lord first, then comes husband and the family. I have been blessed with three sons and all of them are now married. I have been lucky that due to the blessings of the Lord, I have got three beautiful daughters-in-law. All of them are inclined to Lord Jagannath culture. I continue to tell them that whatever we have got in our life, it is because of His blessings only. Not only me, but also my daughters-in-law have realised that they have stepped into the house because of His wishes. When I got married, Puri was not the big town it is today. During the month-long rath yatra, we never used to treat guests in our house. It is the same today. Even if my parents came, they were politely told not to enter. In fact, we maintain a life of austerity and our life sustains only on rice, mung dal, green banana and spinach. We also abstain from vegetable that are not allowed inside the temple during rath. Besides, we live on the mahaparsad, coming from the temple. Over the years, I have realised that such restrictions are good for us and help us maintain a disciplined life. My husband is very reserved and a man of principles. He has already led the team of daiatapatis to search darubrahma during Nabakalebar. He is very particular about not breaching any rule or custom. He will tolerate anything, but not compromise on principles. I am happy that my sons, though highly educated, are following in the footsteps of their father. When I notice them going to the temple bare-bodied with just a scarf, I feel really happy and pray to the Lord that the age-old tradition continues.

Just days later, the anicut that was newly constructed under the Jal Swavlamban Abhiyan of the state government near Bhopa village is dry. Farmers in the area, afraid that their crops would be starved of water once the natural stream that forms after rains here is obstructed by the anicut, petitioned the collector and authorities to halt work on this unnecessary project.Farmer Hukam Singh of Bhopa had told TOI that he had joined over 40 others and visited officials to plead that the work stop, so that the fields on which they grow their crops of mung, guar and bajra, are not starved of water. The farmers had even written petitions to the collector.""We fear that the construction will obstruct the flow of water. Our fields are irrigated by rain, we get just about 200 mm of rain annually. The irrigation department worked in our area and we have a water conservation mechanism in place near our village. At the end point of the natural stream, we have two open wells where excess water collects. Despite our resistance, district authorities went ahead with construction of the anicut. We now will not have the rain-fed stream arriving in the fields. And water in the anicut too, after this rain, has not been so promising,"" said Virender Singh , whose fields are in the area.District collector Kailash Chand insists construction has occurred in conformity with all norms. Villagers, however, say no meeting of the gram sabha was held to plan this Rs14 lakh anicut. Villagers did not know of the state government's plans until construction actually began and workers arrived on the scene. ""Once we got to know, we were appalled and we did all we could to prevent this waste of public money for something so detrimental. However, our written petitions and our visits to officials yielded nothing at all,"" says Hukam Singh."

Abhinav Saha Shaqir after reaching home, Friday. Abhinav SahaMohammad Gufran grew accustomed to Shaqirs hand gestures as the day drew on. His best friend of nine years lay still near him, with his eyes shut, and the stab wound next to his ear, throbbing. Gufran poured a little water into Shaqirs mouth and then attempted to pat away his friends pain by slowly massaging his wound. It had been over twelve hours since 23-year-old Shaqir  older brother to 15-year-old Junaid Khan who was stabbed and killed on a Mathura-bound train last week  returned home from the hospital. His brother-in-law had driven him back in his SUV at 2 am on Thursday.The doctors sent him home with a volley of medicines: an antibiotic, a painkiller, a wound cleansing pill, a strong antacid, and a Vitamin D pill  to be taken daily for 10 days. A little after sunrise, almost the whole of Khandawli village came to see Shaqir. A long queue stretched out, with people lining up one after another to wish him well and offer some words of comfort. Praise Allah that you are alive. Wish you a speedy recovery, the village elders said. People came and stood at the entrance to his room to catch a glimpse and then leave, his older sister Rabia told The Indian Express.Shaqir, though, hasnt said a word. Not even to his wife or children. Earlier in the day, his one-year-old child had lunged at her father when she was taken near him but he gestured her away like he had with Gufran: his right hand rising a few inches above the bed and flopping back limply. He has not had anything to eat either, his wife Rubina said. Half a roti with some moong daal, and bits and pieces of cut papaya. Like you would tear off to feed a child.In the large hall across the narrow path outside Shaqirs house, his father Jalaluddin sat surrounded by men on cushioned mattresses, some of whom had travelled from Kosi Kalan near Mathura. Why, if he is Hindustan ka Raja, is he not able to stop these killings? he said, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modis speech in Gujarat the previous day. When demonetisation happened, he (Modi) had said the currency notes would be invalid at a particular time, and they were. Usko kehte hein bolna! he said. Not this!Other men around him began talking in unison: Please dont divide Hindus and Muslims. Please dont divide us chanted an elderly Ali Hassan to no one in particular. Someone showed him a WhatsApp message for the dharna at Jantar Mantar scheduled for Sunday in Junaids honour. I doubt I will attend, said Jalaluddin.

We will now be able to raise seedlings in July itself and complete the harvest before October when the coastal mandals are likely to witness cyclonic storms.Though the ryots had a bumper paddy crop last year thanks to supply of the Godavari waters, they had missed paddy cultivation altogether in the KWD in the previous two years due to poor storage in the reservoirs across the Krishna, including Srisailam and Nagarjunasagar reservoirs, Parchur Agriculture Market Committee Chairman Akkaiah Chowdhary said.Excess rainfallThe situation is conducive for starting kharif crop cultivation with the district receiving 85.7 mm rainfall in June as against the normal rainfall of 58 mm, Agriculture Joint Director J. Muralikrishna said while taking stock of the seasonal condition in the State.Another wet spell of 40 mm rainfall in first week of July will lead to brisk sowing in the district, where the kharif and rabi cropping seasons mingle.Taking advantage of rains during the early phase of the southwest monsoon, the farmers sowed crops in 12,500 acres so far. The crops covered includes cotton (5,500 acres), groundnut (2,200 acres), green gram (1000 acres) and sesame(1,250 acres).With Indian Meteorological Department predicting 98% of normal rainfall this year, the crop coverage is expected to touch the normal 6 lakh acre mark this year, he said.Stating that there was no shortage of quality seeds, he said the department had so far distributed 4,700 quintals of subsidised seeds after raising an indent for 7,540 quintals of seeds.Mr. Muralikrishna exhorted the farmers to take advantage of Rythu Ratham scheme for distribution of 400 tractors to farmers in the district. Each farmer had to pay a deposit of Rs. 10,000 for allotment of tractors which came with a subsidy of Rs. 2 lakh each."

Those belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family were found in large number in both food types  60% in chicken and 88% in moong sprouts. The results are reported in a paper to be published on July 10 in Current Science .The conventional method of studying microorganisms is by culturing. But there is an inherent problem as only a certain percentage of bacteria can be cultured. So we resorted to metagenomic analysis, which is culture-independent, to detect microbes. In this, the total DNA from the sample is isolated. This helped us detect all microbes present. This is the first time metagenomic analysis has been done in these food types in India, says Dr. Archana Rath from the Department of Biotechnology, University of Mumbai, the corresponding author.The microorganisms were then cultured to study antibiotic resistance. Most of the 50-plus different microorganisms for each food type were resistant to one or more of the 13 clinically relevant antibiotics chosen, she says. More than 10 disease-causing pathogens were resistant to 5-12 antibiotics. E. coli and K. pneumoniae were resistant to 12 of the 13 antibiotics. Earlier studies did not find bacteria being resistant to so many antibiotics.High indexThe antibiotic-resistant strains were found to have high antibiotic resistance index of 0.3-0.9. (Antibiotic resistance index is the number of antibiotics that the bacteria are resistant to divided by the total number of antibiotics studied.) The index is very high. It is a reflection of the severity of resistance, says Dr. Rath.There is greater disease risk when antibiotic-resistant bacteria are found in moong sprouts, as they are consumed raw.Though chicken is cooked before eating, cross-contamination is likely when vessels and appliances used for cleaning and cooking are not thoroughly cleaned.Presence of 18% bacteria common to both food types could be a reflection of their ubiquity or cross-contamination. Untreated organic manure from chicken farms applied as manure in fields and the use of contaminated water for irrigation and for cleaning chicken might be responsible, says Onkar A. Naik, from the Department of Biotechnology, University of Mumbai, who was part of the team."

It was estimated that cotton was sown in about one lakh acres and the sowing may touch 1.82 lakh acres in the district.During the last season, farmers got good price for cotton as the crop failed in some parts of Punjab and Pakistan due to pest, and the increased demand in the market.With the hope that the same would be repeated this time, majority of the farmers have opted for cotton.According to Madhavi Latha, Joint Director, Agriculture, paddy is being sown on 15,425 acres and it is stated that only 38% of sowing had taken place so far. Normal area of paddy in kharif is 40,763 acres, while sugarcane is being sown on 10,885 acres aginst the normal of 38,360 acres.It was stated that only 33% of the sowing - counting to 26,310 acres - has taken place so far out of the total normal irrigated crops of 79,123 acres in the kharif season.In dry crops, sowing of red gram on 11,275 acres, green gram on 3,248 acres and black gram on 3,063 acres is taking place.Soyabean is being sown on 12,300 acres out of the normal area of 51,570 acres.

Majority of the farmers opting cotton may not be a good omen. If there is a bumper harvest next year, the demand and price of cotton may come down which in turn will put farmers in debt trap . It would be better if farmers think twice before going for cotton sowing, the official commented."

(Express/Narendra Vaskar) With kharif sowing already at the half-way mark, farmers say the fresh loan may just come too late. (Express/Narendra Vaskar)Even as the Maharashtra government extended the countrys biggest ever loan waiver package to cover an even greater number of farmers by including all overdue crop loans disbursed since 2009, farmers across the state are reporting their inability to access fresh credit.Amid doubts over conditions imposed for eligibility for the loan waiver, and with the cooperative banking network in deep crisis, farmers have been unable to access any institutional credit more than a fortnight after Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis announced that a fresh line of credit worth Rs 10,000 would be made available immediately to all eligible farmers. And with sowing for the kharif season already at the half-way mark, farmers in regions that have witnessed acute agrarian distress over the past three to four years say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 may just come too late.Nivrutti Gangurde of Kotamgaon village in Nashiks Niphad taluka had earlier in the year taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh for his daughters wedding. Unable to raise a fresh crop loan as he was unable to clear previous dues, he had to borrow informally from somebody in the village, at higher rates of interest, for the kharif season. I have been overdue since 2014  none of the banks was ready to sanction any loan. In order to meet the operational expenses for my acre of tomato I had to borrow around Rs 2 lakh from a moneylender this year, he says.For Maharashtras farmers now, there is water but no liquidity In Tuljapur talukas Salgara Devti village in Osmanabad district, farmer and postwoman Archana Bhosale says everyone is being turned away from the local bank. Similarly, in Nandurghat village of Beed, local journalist and farmer Amol Jadhav says those visiting the Maharashtra Gramin Bank branch have been told instructions regarding fresh credit havent arrived yet.Across the state, lead bank managers for agricultural loans say the fresh loan of Rs 10,000 promised by the government cannot be extended in the current circumstances where eligibility criteria have been repeatedly tweaked since the announcement and with no master circular from the Reserve Bank of India to all banks on writing off crop loan accounts that are non-performing assets (NPAs) or bad loans.The government and the RBI will have to clearly state which NPAs are to be written off, only then can fresh credit be offered. And banks have seen next to zero recovery ever since the loan waiver demand began to pick up. With nobody making payments on old loans and with no detailed intimation from the government on how to proceed, local banks actually cannot offer fresh loans to anyone, though there are requests every day, says the lead bank manager in one of Marathwadas districts. The Maharashtra Gramin Bank, a regional rural bank, is the only one to have issued a circular to its branches on the loan waiver and fresh credit, but sources say disbursals have remained very low despite demand.The Gramin Bank services 17 districts, including all of Marathwada where the district central cooperative banks are mostly weak or defunct. Chief Manager for Credit and Refinance K D Joshi says a circular was issued as per the directives of the state government to all 408 branches, but concedes that there is confusion regarding eligibility. The criteria are changing daily. Now all loans disbursed since 2009 that are overdue as of June 30, 2016 are eligible, but the government has not issued a circular about this. Until there is a firm eligibility criterion, some confusion will remain, he told The Indian Express.Other bankers say farmers are also a confused lot, some hoping to have multiple loans in multiple banks written off, others simply unaware of the conditions to be fulfilled before the mortgage record can be wiped clean from their 7/12 land extracts. Meanwhile, the distressed district central cooperative banks inability to service customers has added to the slow pace of farmers accessing fresh credit. The Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) had, by the end of June last year, disbursed over Rs 1,200 crore in crop loans. Once known for its robust financial health, the bank has this year disbursed only Rs 61.41 crore  six per cent of its set target of Rs 1101.05 crore  till now. Chairman Narendra Darade blames the continuing impact of demonetisation for the situation. We do not have cash with us. How are we to disburse money to farmers, he asks.The confusion and consequent glitches in extending fresh credit to farmers eligible for the waiver comes after an already slow crop loan season for Maharashtras banks. By the end of June 2016, of the Rs 37,677.03 crore target for kharif loans, banks had disbursed Rs 20,889.20 crore  a healthy 55 per cent of the target. However, by the middle of June this year, of the targeted Rs 40,547.20 crore, only Rs 9,249.22 crore had been disbursed  barely 23 per cent of the target. On expected lines, district central cooperative banks that disburse around 40 per cent of crop loans have been the worst performers. They have disbursed Rs 5225.94 crore, or 40 per cent of their target of Rs 13108.38 crore. At the end of June 2016, these banks had disbursed Rs 10,451.77 crore of their targeted Rs 13,113.57 crore  80 per cent of the target.Simultaneously, sowing has continued despite the crisis in institutional credit. With healthy water levels in dams and local water bodies, nearly 40 per cent of the kharif sowing is now complete, with over 56 lakh hectares of farm land already sown in anticipation of the promised normal monsoon. At this time last year, only about 13 lakh hectares of farmland had been sown. Villagers say many have turned to private moneylenders in the absence of farm loans from banks. Worse, in some parts of Marathwada, villages actually completed sowing, enthused by the June rainfall, and a dry spell since the end of June has many worried about the likelihood of having to undertake a second sowing, called dubaar perni, a chronic and crippling additional cost for farmers in rainfed and non-irrigated parts.In Dhamangaon village of Ashti taluka, a drought-prone region, for example, a plentiful monsoon in 2016 has ensured theres plenty of water for drinking. But it hasnt rained since the end of June. If it doesnt rain in a week or 10 days, we will have to go in for a second sowing, says deputy sarpanch Dr Syed Bashir. Dhamangaons farmers have sown urad, moong, bajra and cotton and are now concerned about the young crops health at a crucial growth stage.With the weather office predicting a relatively dry July, farmers in Ashti expect they may have to sow a second time. If the promised fresh loans are disbursed now, the money will at least be handy for that, says Dr Syed. If it comes much later, whats the use?Minister of State for Agriculture Sadashiv Khot admitted to receiving complaints about non-disbursal of crop loans from various districts of the state. I will be meeting the chief minister on Friday and ask him to look into the matter. I will also be requesting the district guardian ministers to take weekly meetings with the lead banks and follow up about loan disbursal, he said. Khot signalled that banks who had failed to provide credit on time would face action.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The kendra has been selected for the award in recognition of the integrated efforts undertaken by it to improve farming practices.The kendra, based at Krishnapuram in Kayamkulam, on the premises of the Central Plantation Crops Research Institute (CPCRI), has contributed in a variety of ways to incorporate innovative farming practices, resulting in expansion of area under farming and better harvest.Certain areas were given particular focus with a view to converting fallow land into productive fields apart from implementing farmer-friendly technologies, P.Muralidharan, head of the Alappuzha kendra, said.Technologies under the National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) were implemented in selected farm fields in Muttar grama panchayat. Acidity control of the soil and scientific application of fertilizers and pest management using bio-control agents were among the applied technologies which had helped farmers in reducing the cost of cultivation and improving the yield.Taking up green gram cultivation in fallow land was another successful operation done under the supervision of the kendra.The farmers adopting the innovative methods got an additional profit of Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 10,000 an acre. Innovative methods for poultry farming suited to areas prone to flooding, weed composting and value addition were demonstrated to about 140 farmers at Muttar.An integrated farming model for paddy, coconut, banana, vegetables, dairy, poultry, duck rearing, fisheries and mushroom was conceptualised with appropriate interventions for the Kuttanad area, according to him.The award is to be distributed at a function to be held in New Delhi on July 14."

Against a normal rainfall of 205.6 mm from January to June 24, the district received 91.7 mm rainfall till June 24 this year, resulting in a 55 % deficit. The rain in May helped farmers to prepare their fields for sowing.However, against an average rainfall of 76 mm from June 1 to June 21, the district received 41 mm rainfall which is a 38 % deficit. The department had set a target of 2.35 lakh hectares for kharif sowing but due to scanty rainfall, sowing has taken place in only 34,000 hectares.The target fixed for kharif sowing in the district stands at 2.35 lakh hectares of land and is expected to produce 2.43 lakh tonnes of foodgrains.Paddy, maize, pulses, groundnut, soyabean and hybrid cotton are the major kharif crops grown in the district. Maize occupies a major share of land with 45,200 hectares used for its cultivation followed by soya (36,500 hectares), green gram (35,600 hectares), groundnut (33,200 hectares), paddy (25,445 hectares) and hybrid cotton (24,850 hectares).Anticipating good rainfall, farmers purchased seeds and fertilizers from the Agriculture Department.

The percentage was slightly lower than the previous years which was 36.32 lakh hectares during the same period.The sources said that up to July 9 the State had received a cumulative rainfall of 368 mm against a normal rainfall of 262 mm, from June 1.As many as 151 taluks had received excessive and more than normal rainfall, while 25 taluks received less than normal and deficit rainfall. There was scanty rainfall in only two taluks.Sowing of cereals has been completed in 13.64 lakh hectares against the target of 35.30 lakh hectares this year. The shortfall would be made good during this month and August when sowing and transplantation of paddy would be taken up in the irrigated areas in full swing.Similarly, there was time for sowing maize and ragi and in all probability, it would go past the target of 35.30 lakh hectares fixed for cereals this year.The sources said that sowing of pulses during the kharif season this year has been good and as against the target of 14.33 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in more than 8.25 lakh hectares.It is expected that the area under pulses would exceed the target fixed for this year.The increase in the area under black gram, green gram and red gram this year should send some good news to the State which had been witnessing a steady decline in the production of pulses.As against a target of 5.67 lakh hectares fixed for red gram this year, farmers have completed sowing operations in 2.63 lakh hectares. Sowing of red gram is taken up till the first week of August.However, an area of concern is the falling percentage of oilseeds coverage in the State in the past few years. The trend has continued this year also.As against the target of 17.99 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed only in 7.07 lakh hectares. The shortage is 1.64 lakh hectares than last years coverage during the same period.Among oilseeds, groundnut continues to lose its position as a major oilseed and is being slowly replaced by sunflower.As against 8.37 lakh hectares target fixed for groundnut, sowing has been completed in 2.07 lakh hectares. In the normal course, by this time sowing should have been completed in 4.33 lakh hectares. Last year, sowing was completed in 2.27 lakh hectares. The area under sesamum and castor is also going down sharply.Among the cash crops, including cotton, sugarcane and tobacco, sowing has been completed in 5.04 lakh hectares as against the target of 19,000 hectares. While sowing of cotton has been completed in 1.52 lakh hectares, sugarcane has been completed in 2.70 lakh hectares.Tobacco has been taken up in 81,000 hectares. Among horticulture crops, with an area of 1.76 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in 10,914 hectares."

Maharashtra government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the APMCs to enable them to earn higher profits.The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) to enable them to earn higher profits. The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to usher in sweeping reforms, which would be long-lasting and provide an alternative to the present regulated Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, sources in the ministry of agriculture told The Indian Express.Preliminary reports indicate that present markets cannot cope with the challenges of farmers striving to double their farm production and seek higher remuneration. Reforms that would be discussed in the Monsoon Session of the state legislature commencing from July 24, include deregulation of food grains from the APMC to provide more private and direct markets operating between farmers and consumers. The model suggested would be similar to the reforms in the vegetable and fruit markets where farmers have been provided with freedom to sell their goods outside the APMCs.While the government is not going to intervene in existing the APMC structures, it is trying to provide freedom to farmers to explore larger markets outside to fetch higher returns. According to a cabinet minister, a competitive food grain market on the lines of the vegetables and fruits markets would set the process for generating higher returns for the farmers.While acknowledging that the government would not shed its responsibility of procurement of food grains, the minister said: To begin with, we will bring the legislation to make non-implementation of MSP (Minimum Support Price) by traders a punishable act. Almost three farmers organisations that are in discussion with the government on the MSP have also demanded reforms in the APMCs, which often force farmers to sell crops at lower prices.There is a move to raise the number of vegetable and fruit markets from the present 48 to 100 across 36 districts of Maharashtra. Similarly, a larger network to channel the food grains to private markets in larger quantities is high on the government agenda.Today, the MSP is confined to foods grains and pulses. The list (MSP/quintal) is as follows: paddy (Rs 1470), jowar (Rs 1625), wheat (Rs 1625), maize (Rs 1365), bajra (Rs 1330), gram (Rs 4000), tur (Rs 5050), moong (Rs 5225), udit (Rs 5000), sunflower (Rs 3950), soyabean (Rs 2775), groundnut (Rs 4220), cotton (R 4160), safflower (Rs 3700), masoor (Rs 3900), ragi (Rs 1725), sesam (Rs5000); nigerseed (Rs 3825) and mustard ( Rs 3700). The prices of all the other crops, vegetables and fruits are driven by demand and supply, as per the markets.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

According to the Union Home Ministry, over 15,000 people, including more than 3,000 security personnel, have been killed in the naxal violence in the last 35 years.Long violence has caused irreparable damage to the tribal economy. The tribals make exotic handicrafts, do agriculture, collect hundreds of minor forest products, weave exotic fabrics and do fishing activities. They make utility items from biodegradable materials available in the forest. Over the years, those utility pieces have become art objects with high value addition.Dhokra craft, iron craft, tribal jewellery, wood craft, ragged dolls and bead work etc have demand in domestic and global craft bazaars. The tribal have the skill to make hundreds of utility items from grass, tree leaves, cane and organic fibres. A deeper understanding of the tribal culture and its economy will not only reduce the red menace but make forestry a vibrant economic sector.Tribal living in forest fringed villages collect honey, medicinal plants, bamboo, timber, ivory, fruits, other minor forest products and grow organic food grains. As per the Agriculture Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (Apeda), the country has exported 38,177.08 MT of natural honey worth Rs 705.87 crore in 2015-16. The domestic demand for pure honey is very high due to its various medicinal, nutritional and religious value. Malkangiri tribal of Odisha collect organic tamarind, grow black gram and green gram but sell it to traders and middlemen at a far lower price.Similarly, the tribal of Mayurbhanj district of the state make ropes from Sabai grass, a natural fibre which grows abundantly in the district. The rope is used for various purposes including furniture making. The Rs 400 crore rope trade is controlled by the outside traders. Here a tribal rope maker hardly earns Rs 150 per day.The tribal also make Khalipata (saal leaf plate), grow special kind of organic Tandula (tur dal), collect bamboo and other minor forest products from the forest. Traders and middlemen buy their products at throw away price and sell it at high price. The Dhokra craft of Mayurbhanj is very popular in international craft bazaars for its artistry. As the tribal artisans do not get the profit they deserve they lose interest and skill.Chhattisgarh tribals sing, dance and make exotic handicrafts. The Gaur and Ahirai folk dancers and singers of Chhattisgarh give their performance in foreign countries. Teejan Bai, the noted Pandbani singer and Padma Shri award winner of Chhattisgarh has performed in many countries. Tribal artisans of Bastaar make export quality wood craft, iron craft and dhokra craft which are very popular in handicraft markets. The Jhabua tribal make dolls from rags which are of export quality. Forest always gives them inspiration and raw material.A unique study  Green Accounting for Indian states and Union Territories Project  for the first time estimated the value of our forest at Rs 88,60,259 crore as on 2003. The study reveals the economic values of nutrient loss: nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium and organic matter in the country was Rs 5,024 crore. The decrease in state of timber alone in two years between 2001 and 2003 makes for a wealth depletion of Rs 38,000 crore. There has been no survey to assess the huge loss between 2003 and 2016.Sustainable developmentSustainable forest management could become a means of creating millions of green jobs, thus helping to reduce poverty and improve the environment, said Jan Heino, Assistant Director General of Food and Agriculture Organiations Forestry Department. Indias 89 national parks, 504 wildlife sanctuaries, 14 biospheres and 25 wetlands should be micro managed for sustainable development.Elinor Ostrom, US political scientist who was awarded the 2009 Nobel Memorial Prize in economic governance, said: monitoring of local users holds the key to improve forest conditions. When local users have long-term rights to harvest from the forest, they are more likely to monitor and sanction those who break the rules and better forest conditions.The value of international trade in forest products has increased by almost 50% in the last decade. Here, the government has to make the tribal capable of managing their forest.Foreign tourists happily spend Rs 1 lakh to Rs 2 lakh each to sight wild animals in natural environment. One horned rhino, Asiatic lion, migratory birds, crocodiles, royal Bengal tiger, black buck, lion tailed macaque, snow leopard, Nilgiri tahr, reptiles and a wide range of flora and fauna always attract tourists.Besides wildlife tourism, the tribal sports talent can also be tapped. The worlds best hockey full back Dileep Tirkey, Olympian Michel Kindo, dozens of hockey stars, Dutee Chand, the 100 m national champion sprinter who missed the Rio Olympic qualifying score by 0.01 seconds, Mary Kom, the six-time world amateur boxing champion and the legendary footballer Baichung Bhutia are tribals.The government should evolve a tribal-specific development policy and improve governance which will create sustainable employment opportunities in forestry sector."

Writing off their crop loan will provide more relief than increasing the MSP for paddy. The State Government should accept the BJP demand and announce loan waiver of the farmers, State BJP spokesperson Sajjan Sharma said.Holding the State Government responsible for the plight of farmers who are not getting support price for many of their agricultural produces, Sharma said the Government did not come to the rescue of farmers when there was distress sale of moong. The State announced to procure moong from farmers at `5,250 per quintal but it failed to keep its commitment. The famers had no option but to dispose of their produce at `3,370 per quintal in the open market, he said.Why is the State Government demanding higher MSP for a single item (paddy), when it failed to ensure the same for other agricultural items announced by the Centre, he wondered."

There are fears that if rains are insufficient, 25-30% of the total area under cultivation may have to be resown, said an official from the agriculture department.Officials say Gondia, Amravati, Bhandara, Buldhana, Akola, Washim, Beed are some of the worst-affected districts, which have received barely 50-75% of the average rainfall.Sowing has been completed on nearly 65% of the 139.64 lakh hectares of cultivable area in the state  which adds up to 82 lakh hectares.""There has been an issue with sowing due to the long, dry spell and crops like soyabean, moong, tur, rice and sugarcane will be hit. Cotton which is grown on a large scale in the state will not see a lot of problems as it sustains on the moisture of the soil, but if the dry spell continues then cotton too will be affected,"" said a senior official.Resowing, if required, will increase the grower's input costs on seeds and labour and have a bearing on financial planning for the season ahead.Principal Secretary, Bijay Kumar said field officials are undertaking surveys to ascertain the damage. Relief measures will be undertaken based on their findings. ""We have ample supply of seeds ready. Whenever there is a requirement for resowing, the cost of the seeds are borne by the government. The same policy will be applicable in this case too,"" said Kumar who will himself undertake a statewide tour starting on Thursday.Officials said the state government has sent out advisories to farmers asking them to start sowing only next week and wait for clarity from the Indian Meterological Department.The agri department is also trying to convince farmers to sign up for the state's crop insurance scheme. ""After a good monsoon last year and with prediction of surplus rainfall this year, the tendency to pay premium for the insurance scheme is not there. And if rains fail this year and if they have not signed up for the insurance then they will not get anything,"" said another official."

Not even a single hectare of paddy cultivation has been done as of Thursday, according to statistics available with the Department of Agriculture.Various reasonsThere are several factors that have kept farmers from commencing sowing. They are non-release of water into canals; poor monsoon; Cauvery dispute; and the fear of losing crop, say Agriculture Department officials.Speaking to The Hindu , an official added: We had set a target of sowing paddy at 60,067 hectares during the current season and had stocked 1,000 quintals of seeds.

The additional cost involved for production of certified seeds is more that `500 per quintal.

The corporation is reported to have sold 2.4 lakh quintals of seeds under DBT.With no more demand for seeds, the OSSC is now in a fix how to dispose of the balance stock. The all-in-cost price of certified paddy seeds has been fixed at Rs 2,597 per quintal. The farmers will get a subsidy of Rs 997 per quintal.Under the DBT scheme, farmers have to pay the actual cost of seeds upfront. The subsidy amount will be transferred to the farmers accounts subsequently.Prior to the DBT scheme, the farmers were buying seeds at subsidised rates. As they have to pay the full cost now, farmers facing cash crunch do not wish to buy their entire requirement of seeds from the corporation. Either they use the paddy stock of their own as seed or go for the cheaper varieties available in the market, sources in OSSC said.The low off-take seeds from the corporation which supplied the farm input through Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS) will have a negative impact on the seed replacement rate (SRR) targeted by the State Government, sources added.The SRR in case of paddy has reached nearly 35 per cent prior to the implementation of DBT in 2005-16. It was less than 25 per cent during kharif 2016. We apprehend that the SRR will be below 20 per cent this year, said an officer of Agriculture department.The DBT proved to be a dampener during 2017 Rabi season when farmers purchased only 2000 quintals of certified groundnut seeds from the corporation against its target to sell 30,000 quintals.

Our mind is programmed to rehearse perfect moments, thousands of times. Often, you think of situations from your past, and try to think of ways to make them perfect. Especially arguments, what if you really had the chance to do it? Thats how The Alterant begins.Deepak Karamungikar, author of The Alterant talks about the journey he has embarked on. The story revolves around Jason Hunt, a brilliant PhD candidate in Quantum Physics who has another passion Julia Middlesworth, a Hollywood actress whos past her peak.Originally from Hyderabad, Deepak believes that sentence formation is the greatest of all arts, and theres no joy greater than the one you see in the eyes of someone whos enchanted by your stories. The Alterant is his fourth book. Excerpts:What was an early experience where you learnt that language has power?Growing up, I barely had anyone speaking English with me for purposes other than academics. I learned my English from cricket commentary. Geoffrey Boycott, Tony Greig and Harsha Bhogle were my idols. For him he right sentences at the right time, is almost magic.What do you think makes a good story line?There are two things emotions and surprise. You take any genre comedy, drama, sci-fi, romance or even horror, unless the story evokes emotions in the reader, it is hard to make a lasting impact. Only stories that stir your emotions are remembered. I remember reading Khushwant Singhs stories. After every story, I used to sit quietly and feel the story. Its very important to connect emotionally. Then the element of surprise. I was 11 when I read this book called, No Comebacks by Fredrick Forsyth. That story has the best last line I have ever read in my life. I still feel the punch in my gut. That is why I am a big fan of twists.Give us an insight into your main character. What does he do that makes him different from the rest of the characters?Jason Hunt is a brilliant but an emotional guy. He loves to drink and is passionate about Hollywood actress, Julia Middlesworth. He reveres her. Its not romantic. In spite of never having met her in his life, hes sincere and truthful. His professor loves him and supports him throughout the story. There are times when he has to choose between his mind and heart, he always chooses his heart with no regard to consequences. Jason is borderline idealistic, but physicists cant be idealists. So, theres that dilemma but he does whats right. Hes not greedy.Which was your favourite chapter to write and why?My favorite chapter is the first one. I remember the tension I experienced while I began to write it. Its a sci-fi, time travel novel. Im a nobody. I hadnt studied Physics academically after 10+2. I remember waking up at 4.40 am on the first day in the Virginia winter and just staring at the screen with a cup of tea by my side.All these factors were weighing in heavily as I put my hands on the keyboard. I also had to include what I had left out in the script version. Then suddenly, it began to flow.Is there a specific significance of the book cover?The book cover shows a wormhole, which is a hypothetical connection between widely separated regions of space and time. The story unfolds as Jason traverses through the wormholes."

The farmers took to this unique protest due to steep fall in wholesale prices of their produce, the agitators alleged.We are not getting the right price for our produce and forced to sell it at a throwaway price. Our earnings are not sufficient enough to repay the crop loans because of the distress sale, said Kalandi Nayak, a farmer.The NKS accused the district administration of being apathetic towards the farmer community.District coordinator of NKS Nimai Charan Ray said, We had met Jajpur Collector a month back and apprised him of our plight arising out of the distress sale of groundnut, pulses, coriander, milk and vegetables. We had also submitted a memorandum to the Collector in this regard. However, it yielded no result.Hence, the farmers were forced to hit the streets, he said and added that the agitators have put forth their demand in a peaceful manner.Due to the protests, vehicular traffic along NH-16 was paralysed for about an hour.

(Representational image) In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. (Representational image)Just 18 months ago, Jalna farmer Chandrakant Kshirsagar sold the couple of quintals of tur (pigeon pea) he produces at Rs 8,000 a quintal. This year, after waiting months for prices to rise, he finally sold his produce at Rs 4,000 a quintal, making exactly half last years earnings even as his input costs have grown.Other farmers who sold at Rs 3,200 a quintal had fared so much worse, he reasons, explaining why pulse producers, all habituated to volatility in pulse prices, are still the angriest among Maharashtras farmers this year. Many of them small and marginal farmers especially in Marathwada where Latur and Nanded districts produce tur, urad and moong in large quantities, pulse farmers fully anticipated a bumper crop in 2016-17.An excellent monsoon had followed two consecutive drought years, prices were sky-high last year, and there was a government-induced increase in acreage of pulses. Everybody knew we would have an excellent output. And still, we now have a glut of imports, so much so that the oversupply will not end any time soon, says Rajan Kshirsagar, a farmer and Left leader from Parbhani in Marathwada, a mostly dryland farming region that produces much of Maharashtras approximately 1.5 million tonnes of pulses annually.Current wholesale rates for tur are still approximately Rs 3,700 a quintal. And to add to farmers woes at having to sell way below the MSP of Rs 5,050 a quintal, there are allegations that cartelised traders abused the governments procurement process by selling to government centres at the MSP, at huge profits. Maharashtra is a major pulse-producing state, among the top four.While pulse farming across India is largely unirrigated, the problem is more acute in Maharashtra, where only 8.7 per cent of land under pulses is irrigated, making the 16 per cent share of Maharashtra in Indias pulse production especially vulnerable to monsoon shocks. (In Uttar Pradesh, 35.1 per cent of area under pulses is irrigated).It follows naturally that the plentiful monsoon of 2016-17, and government policy promoting pulse production, saw area under pulses in Maharashtra grow from 20,06,000 hectare in 2015-16 to 25,57,000 hectare  a 28 per cent rise. From 6,11,000 tonnes last year, output ballooned to an estimated 17,51,000 tonnes, a 187 per cent rise.In the current kharif season, having been hit by the price crash, farmers have reduced acreage of tur, with a 25 per cent dip in Maharashtra, according to pulse and commodities traders. But everybody is unanimous that the reduction in acreage will not help tackle the existing oversupply.Maharashtras farmers are sowing less tur because of crashing prices, but supply will not come down so soon. The rains are going to be good, so it is a reasonable assessment that prices will remain depressed, says Dr Dharmakirti Joshi, chief economist at Crisil.Also, price volatility in pulses, a cyclical problem, is neither peculiar to Maharashtra nor unusual. Dr Joshi says the massive volatility in pulse prices has been a constant phenomenon over the last 15 years or so. Every third year there is a price spike and then a crash, and the volatility is directly linked to production. Farmers look at experience of high prices and sow more, so prices fluctuate.Dr Joshi believes a 10 per cent price increase annually is good incentive from farmers perspective, but a mechanism needs to be devised to smoothen prices. Firstly, you have to de-risk agriculture from rains  irrigation is key. Alongside that, better food management can ensure that volatility is kept under control, through buffer stocks and other measures.That import arrivals of pulses continued even as it became apparent that there is a bumper crop locally contributed to the glut. Structural solutions are needed from a long-term perspective, but in the short term, various devices on imports, buffers and so on are needed.Nitin Kalantry, one of Laturs larger pulse traders, says imports from Africa are at about Rs 3,000 to Rs 3,300 a quintal and from Burma at Rs 3,400 a quintal. So prices will definitely not rise dramatically in the near future, he says. In addition, Kalantry says, theres a 1.10 million tonne buffer stock with the government at the all-India level and traders are wondering how and when this will be disposed of. Also, he says farmers continue to hold about 15 per cent of their stocks, hoping prices will rise.Also, while government buyouts themselves will not suffice to tackle the oversupply, many say the procurement process itself should have been better streamlined. Kshirsagar, the Parbhani leader, says there was negligence and poor planning in procurement. First there were only 17 procurement centres, and too few were added later. Then farmers were first told to bring their produce, and they waited there while incurring rent for the vehicles, then they were told to take a token and make deliveries later, he says, adding that thousands of farmers also received delayed payments.MahaFPC, a consortium of Farmer Producer Companies, which demonstrated a procurement intervention in the 2016-17 season in parts of the state with a transparent system for farmers, says there are many policy interventions needed to improve the procurement process. Inadequate warehousing and procurement infrastructure in the producing states, unpreparedness of the state nodal agencies and political interference in procurement operations created mismanagement and failed to stabilise the markets, says Yogesh Thorat, MD of MahaFPC, adding that a huge majority of pulse farmers may have sold below MSP.Thorat adds that while commodity futures markets are in an infancy stage, they may help reduce market risks for pulse farmers despite fears that trading in futures may be highly speculative, without any actual delivery of the commodity. Recently SEBI allowed NCDEX to launch chana futures. Presently these trading platforms are in the hands of middlemen, hence neither farmers nor consumers are benefitted.Farmer Producer Companies are coming forward to participate in these markets for physical delivery of commodities, a good sign, and futures can be a crucial instrument to regulate price trend. All kinds of marketing avenues should be open for better price realisation and price stabilisation in pulses, Thorat says.Tuesday: Sugar, not sweet for farmersFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Farmers have managed to complete a target of 73% of the total targeted area of the Kharif sowing till July 17. As against the target of 162 lakh hectares, 121 lakh hectares have been achieved, according to the statistics of the agriculture department.Officials in the agriculture department said, the farmers have shown keen interest in sowing pulses with 90.9% of the targeted sowing achieved in the pluses category. Urad and Choula have been leading in this category at 154% and 110% exceeding the targeted area of cultivation while moong and moth stood at 85.8% and 80.4%.However, in case of oil seeds, the much road is to be covered. So far, only 66.8% of the target has been achieved. Except ground nut which had achieved 100% target area, the cultivation of sesamum is only 45% while area soybean cultivation also taken a beating this season at 68.4% of the target, said an official.In the category of cereals, Bajra and Maize are leading at 87% and 84 % respectively.As against the target of roughly 63 lakh hectares, 52 lakh hectares has been achieved in cereals cultivation.The farmers have also shown keen interest in cotton which has crossed the targeted at 107%.Officials in the agriculture department are hopeful that with good monsoon rains spread all over the state the target is in all likelihood will be achieved. ""In Rajasthan the sowing season continues till mid-August and we are quite optimistic of achieving target,"" said an official.He said, the farmers have sowed their crops with the weather department prediction of a good monsoon. The success of the crops depends on the continuity of the rain at regular intervals as crops in Rajasthan are at the mercy of rains."
5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

Unable to handle the devotees frenzy during the distribution of the laddu hours before the immersion of the deity on the 11th day, the Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee is contemplating replacing the giant laddu that adorns Ganesh's left palm with a smaller locally made one or one made of Plaster of Paris.""This year, there will be no giant laddu or Maha Prasadam prepared by PVVS Mallikarjuna Rao , owner of Suruchi Laddu based in Tapeswaram in East Godavari district of Andhra Pradesh. If no local donor comes forward for the preparation of a smaller laddu, we will go with one made of PoP,"" Khairatabad Ganesh Utsav Committee organising secretary S Raj Kumar told STOI.From the year 2010, Mallikarjuna Rao has been offering the Khairatabad Ganesha the Maha Prasadam that came to be known as the Tapeswaram Laddu. Until 2009, the organizers used to offer a laddu that was no more than 10 kg. Apparently, the laddumaker from East Godavari had visited the Khairatabad Ganesha in 2009 wherein his daughter wondered as to why should the sweet offering to a giant Ganesha be such a small one. Taken in by her observation, Mallikarjuna approached the organisers and offered to donate a big laddu to the deity from then on. The bonanza for the devotees of the elephant god began in 2010. Beginning with a 500 kg laddu that year, Mallikarjuna Rao increased the quantity to 2,400 kg in 2011 to 6,000 kg in 2015. For the donor, making the laddu was a humungous task and a costly one too. The 6,000 kg laddu needed 2,600 kg of sugar, 1,500 kg of ghee, 1,500 kg of bengal gram, 200 kg of cashewnuts, 200 kg of badam, 30 kg of cardamom and cost him a whopping Rs 18 lakh.But by then, the scramble for a piece of the Maha Prasadam turned into a law and order problem, leading to lathicharge on a few occasions during the distribution of the laddu before the immersion. Devotees would assemble by midnight and stand in queues to have the laddu. Besides, in 2013, incessant rains damaged the laddu leading to it being dumped in Hussainsagar. With both the police and organizers pleading helplessness, Mallikarjuna Rao decided to trim the size of the laddu and donated a 500 kg laddu in 2016.For 2017, the committee is scouting for a city-based sweet maker who would come forward and donate the laddu, though not of the size that Mallikarjuna Rao used to offer. If nothing works out, devotees would have to do with a PoP laddu sitting on the Ganesha's left palm. In any case, from now on, the giant Khairatabad Ganesh would make his annual appearance but the giant laddu has taken the bow."

MoorthyG_MoorthyIt has been a long fight for farmers of these villages to hold on to their farmlands that were earmarked for an industrial estate.The sword of Damocles hangs over the heads of the farmers of about 1,500 acres for the last eight years. Their fear was again triggered last week, when Industries Minister M.C. Sampath announced in the Assembly that people of Usilampatti can make use of the industrial park facility in Sivarakottai for their economic development.He was responding to Usilampatti MLA P. Neethipathi who sought industrial estate in his economically-backward constituency. We are shocked by the Ministers statement on the proposed SIPCOT industrial estate on our farmland, said M. Ramalingam president of District Farmers Welfare Association.The then DMK Government proposed to set up the industrial estate on the farmland in Sivarakottai, Karisalkalampatti and Swamimallampatti under Kalligudi block in 2008.Barren land, this?Is this a barren land? asked an elderly farmer, S. Alagesan. The entire State has seen crop failures for the third consecutive season now. But farming in our rain-fed region has not stopped in this period. After two or three successful harvests of millets and cotton in the last two seasons, even now all the farmers are ready with our lands ploughed to sow the seed in Aadi Pattam (18th day of Tamil month Aadi), he said.Ploughing has given the vast tract of land here a picturesque look with the black cotton soil turning darker. This is in sharp contrast to thousands of acres under Periyar-Vaigai irrigation system left untouched with wild growth, even 45 days after the scheduled irrigation season, said former Joint Director of Agriculture A.J.A. Jeyasingh Gnanadurai.Sivarakottai land is fertile with phosphorous and potash and more suitable for millets and minor millets. The farmers here grow about 18 varieties of crops, including millets, minor millets, pulses and cotton.While paddy farmers under assured irrigation system had lost time, energy and money on failed crops, these farmers are making profit with repeated harvests owing to the practice of inter-cropping and crop rotation. We have a wide range of crop that give yield from 60 days to 180 days  like green gram (60 days), black gram (65 days), Barnyard millet (90 days). Two spells of rain is enough to reap a good yield, said another farmer, K. Chinnasamy (74).The black cotton soil has higher water retention capacity. The moisture content lasts for weeks even after one spell of showers, Mr. Jeyasingh said. None of the farmers have any borewell, well or even electric supply for lift irrigation. That shows how nature has blessed us with a fertile land, Mr. Ramalingam said.Contradicting claimsThe farmers strongly feel that the very proposal of SIPCOT on farmland was flawed and contradicted the governments own claims.After having declared the land barren, the government has spent at least Rs. 4 crore on renovating some 10 ooranis and waterbodies in the proposed industrial unit site. Why should the government develop these ooranis in the secluded places?In 2013-14, the State Agriculture Department had allocated handsome subsidy for raising varagu on 300 acres of land in the these villages. It did not stop there. The government also gave subsidy for setting up a millet processing unit.Besides, a few farmers, including Mr. Alagesan, received subsidy from the Forest Department to raise teak trees on over four acres in Sivarakottai. If it is not fertile, why did the government spend so much on agricultural activities here, Mr. Ramalingam asked.Not only different crops grow here. The thick farms are breeding grounds for wildlife such as deer and wild boars. Their population is so high that the Forest Department has put up a caution board on the National Highway about deer crossing. Wild cats are also found here in large numbers, Mr. Ramalingam said.Besides, thousands of goats, sheep and milch animals are dependent on this land. The government has given free goats to at least 300 beneficiaries in Sivarakottai alone. If the land is taken away for industrial development, it will spell doom for us. Besides, where will the cattle and wild animals go? farmer Adimoolam asked.Millets promotionWith increased awareness among people of benefits of millets to fight diabetes and obesity, the demand for millets has grown. When the government itself was promoting millet cultivation, taking over a large tract of millet-growing land was tantamount to defeating its own agricultural policy, Mr. Jeyasingh said.Mr. Adimoolam, who is also the secretary of a farmers group that runs the processing unit, said that after value addition to millets, income was doubled.Water problemMr. Jeyasingh said the industrial park would not succeed as it envisaged drawing four million litres of water a day (MLD) from Vaigai river. When Vaigai dam is struggling to meet even drinking water needs of the city, how can it reserve 4 MLD for the industrial estate. Then, what will happen to irrigation of double and single crop areas. We will oppose the project not only to save farmlands of Sivarakottai, but also to save farming in Madurai district per se, he added.Now or neverIn the last eight years, the AIADMK has promised twice to restore the farmland to the farmers. But did not keep the promise.Former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, during the 2006 election to the Assembly, promised us that the industrial park proposal will be scrapped. The then MLA M. Muthuramalingam raised the issue in the Assembly. But nothing happened, Mr. Ramalingam said.Then again in 2011, AIADMK candidate R.B. Udhayakumar promised the same.

The Centre has exempted cereals, pulses, atta, maida and besan from the GST , which was rolled out from July 1, claiming that these items would get cheaper by up to 5%; however, noticing no change in the prices of some of these items, the state government in a letter to the directorate of agro marketing and agro foreign trade stated that instead of getting cheaper, these items were being sold on older prices.According to data for the second week of July available with the state government, the prices of all edible items, except a few, have been fallen. Wheat, rice, maze, barley, gram, lentil, moong and urad dal, onion, apple and banana have become cheaper after the GST implementation, it says.Agro marketing director Dhiraj Kumar said, ""It is observed that the prices of 17 agro products have fallen to the tunes of Rs 9 to Rs 374 per quintal after July 1, but there is no visible change in the prices of these items in the retail market. It is very unfortunate that traders are not passing the benefit of GST to the consumers.""Bareilly DM R V Singh, meanwhile, instructed the district supply officer ( DSO ) and deputy director of mandi to hold meetings with stockists and retailers to sensitise them about positive aspects of the GST and convince them to pass the benefit of the new tax regime to the consumers.Meanwhile, ADM (enforcement) S P Singh told TOI, ""DSO and deputy director of mandi have been instructed to check the prices in the retail market and send their reports on Monday."""

My chauffeur Tim had a lovely dog Brady, who insisted on taking the ride with me. We raced on the streets, as Bradys fur gently caressed my cheek. We drove past the Castle of Good Hope (built in the 17th century, it is the best-preserved example of a Dutch East India Company fort), Houses of Parliament and the Companys Garden (created in 1650s by the first European settlers, it is a park and heritage site).Then we headed to Sea Point, Cape Towns most affluent and densely populated suburb. At Camps Bay, another affluent suburb, we took a break to enjoy the scenic ocean vistas as Brady ran and played on the beach sand.Then happened Bo-Kaap. It is the prettiest neighbourhood in Cape Town with houses that are swathed in loveliest colours, standing on romantic cobbled streets from the 18th century. It is neither upmarket nor is it a posh quarter of Cape Town filled with mansions.But it seemed to be the most photogenic place where houses were like colourful birds perched in a row. The Bo-Kaap, formerly known as the Malay Quarter is situated on the slopes of Signal Hill above the city centre. It is the traditional home of Cape Towns Muslim population since the second half of the eighteenth century. The houses are a mixture of Cape Dutch and Cape Georgian architectural styles and this, combined with the Islamic faith, culture and eastern origin of the majority of its inhabitants, give the Bo-Kaap a setting that visitors find both captivating and exotic.Descendants of indentured labour brought by the Dutch from various Asian (mostly Malaysia and Indonesia) and African countries, during the 16th and 17th centuries, these slaves were generally called Cape Malays, though not all of them were of Malaysian origin. When the British took over Cape Town from the Dutch in 1795, the slave trade was abolished. When their slavery ended, they acquired religious freedom and the newly emancipated slaves formed a new community at Bo-Kaap. The founders of this community were the first to bring Islam to South Africa.Intermarriages between slaves from East Indies with those from India, Madagascar, and native African groups created a distinctive Cape Malay culture. It is said that many local women converted to Islam and married Muslim men, as they are teetotallers and made trouble free husbands. People in the Cape Malay community speak mostly Afrikaans and English, with Malay words and phrases thrown in. Bo-Kaaps multifaceted heritage is reflected in its music, dance and food too.Adaptations of traditional foods such as tomato bredie, bobotie, sosaties and koeksisters which are the staples in many South African homes originated from Cape Malay cuisine, which in itself is a fusion of many cuisines.Bo-Kaap Kombuis (Kitchen) is a place everyone recommends for an authentic Cape Malay meal. Their starters reminded me of home: samosas (just like our alu samosas), rolls, dalchies (similar to Indian spinach and moong dal pakoras), and patatawaras (like our batata wada back home). The Indian influence in the main courses too is evident due to generations of widespread intermarriage and union between the two communities.Yusuf Larney runs the joint with his wife Nazli who is a third generation Indian from Gujarat while Yusufs great grandfather came from Ireland. His forefathers married people from the Eastern countries and were integrated into Cape Malay culture. Speaking of Bo-Kaap, he said 90% of the population here is Muslim while the other 10% are Christians, Hindus and Indians. We all live with absolutely no conflict, it is the safest area in the whole of S A. We welcome inter marriages. We respect each other: we believe in sitting across the table and talk to each other first to sort out problems than first go and kill each other.I took a stroll down the road, feasting my eyes on every house. As we walked along, JP threw light on the brightly coloured houses on either side of the street, which, he said, is a recent innovation that celebrates the districts Muslim identity. In earlier days, all the houses of Cape Town were painted white. Then the residents of Bo-Kaap began painting their houses in vivid colours in preparation for the celebration of Eid. Neighbours would often agree on what colours to use so as not to have a clash of shades - in fact, the colours complement each other and act as landmarks as well. But sometimes, to outdo others, some clever residents paint their house a different colour overnight and surprise the neighbours!Of course, the last statement seemed a big joke, his own fiction, like most guides of his ilk. His jokes were often followed by his huge guffaws and gurgling laughter, hinting us to take the cue. JP made our Cape Town visit a huge fun, in fact, as huge as his enormous frame!(The author is a documentary filmmaker and travel writer; she blogs at ijayaprataptravelandbeyond.com)"

When we caught up with Omung and Shkehar, both had lots to share about Agra. While Shekhar revealed his ""family connection"" with the city, a wistful Omung admitted that he misses the old charm of the Taj when it used to be less crowded.Shekhar was nine or ten years old when he first visited the city with his uncle who used to work in a bank here. He shares, ""I remember my uncle, who is now settled in the US, used to go to his office at 9 am sharp. After he would leave, I would take a rickshaw and go to some theatre to watch films. In Patna, where I lived, we were not allowed to watch movies and therefore whenever I came to Agra, I used the opportunity to live my passion - cinema."" Then, Shekhar's sister got married in Agra, and so the second time he came to the city was when he visited his sister's sasural. Shekhar adds, ""Agra is like home. My sister's sasural is here and I had come to visit her many times.""Shekhar Suman (Hemant Kumar/ BCCL)Omung Kumar reminisces the days when he visited Taj with his wife, Vanita , long back. He says, ""It was magical. It was raining the day I came and there was less crowd. We have also seen the Taj in the moonlight. It was so romantic. This is the real beauty of the city which I will also be showing in my film.""Omung Kumar (Hemant Kumar/ BCCL)When asked why he chose Agra for the film's backdrop, Omung tells us, ""We wanted a city in UP as our film's backdrop and Agra was our first choice. We have written the script keeping Agra in mind and all the characters that you will see in the film are a reflection of the city. Sanjay plays an owner of a shoe factory and Shekhar, a tourist guide.""Shekhar is quite excited to play a tourist guide from Agra. He shares, ""I am playing the character of Taj Kumar, a typical Agrawallah-tourist guide. For the role, I interacted with the city guides and tried to incorporate their mannerisms in my character. It is fun to play characters that are so colourful.""The entire crew of the film went gaga over Agra's food. While writer Raaj Shandilya went to Sadar Bazar to try aloo chaat, Omung found bedai worth dying for. He shares, ""The food here is amazing and, of course, bedai is my favourite. Agra is always known for its pethas but it has lots of other dishes that people should explore. I spent more than two months in Agra for Bhoomi. The food and the city have embraced us and we loved it."" Shekhar was delighted with the new flavour of petha he tried. He says, ""One of my cousins brought me a box of petha that has a taste of kewda. It is less sweet than other pethas that I have tried. I loved this new flavour.""Though the actor and director were mesmerized with the beauty of the Taj and the food the city offers, they were a little disheartened with the lack of priority given to the cleanliness of the city. Omung says, ""I feel sad when I see the city, which has the monument of love, so unclean. There is kachra everywhere. I know the administration is trying its bit and with so much of footfall everyday, it is difficult to manage. But more efforts should be made to keep the city clean. I love this city and don't want to show it in a bad light in my film. So before beginning the shoot, we cleaned the place on our own.""Shekhar adds, ""Though the state is developing, what with the expressway and other development projects, but the issue of cleanliness continues to plague Agra.""-- Jyoti.Kanyal@timesgroup.com"

There was no triple bumper crop? So, where did all this dal come from?The state government doesn't procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the embers of the violent farmer agitation in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. When TOI contacted superintendent of land records, Narsinghpur, H L Tiwari, he said that the net sown area of toor dal in Tendukheda was ""around 8,000 hectares this year"". At 15,000MT, the average yield per hectare comes to 1.78MT which is thrice the average yield in the last five years.Information provided to TOI under RTI by the Madhya Pradesh land records department says that the average production of toor dal in the state was 0.32 metric tonne per-hectare in 2010-11. It rose to 0.63 metric tonne/hectare in 2011-12, 0.69 metric tonne/hectare in 2012-13, 0.72 metric tonne/hectare in 2013-14 and fell to 0.65 metric tonne/hectare in 2014-15. If you take the highest production on 8,000 hectares, it would only be around 5,000MT. That's 10,000MT short of what was procured. The same quantity of moong dal was procured from the same tehsil this year, though the yield per hectare is lower than toor and it was sown in less area in the tehsil.Pulses are being procured at Rs 5,000 per quintal from farmers, while the market rate is around Rs 3,500/quintal. The government spent Rs 18 crore in procuring more than 30,000MT of toor and moong from Tendukheda alone.After complaints, the agriculture department set up a probe committee comprising officials from agriculture and the co-operative Markfed. It submitted its probe report to the government on July 29, said sources.Principal secretary agriculture, Rajesh Rajora who ordered the probe said, ""We have received the report and have sent it to the government for further action."" He wouldn't comment on the contents of the report, but sources say it points out several anomalies in procurement."

I saw some such practices during my recent visit to flood-hit areas in south-western Rajasthan.In Dhola village in Pali district, which was submerged by flash floods, the biggest loss in pucca houses and hutments was that of foodgrains. Families stockpile sacks of wheat, moong, gram and barley in the harvesting season for consumption for the rest of the year.Sajna Devi, 50, whose house developed cracks after it was submerged nearly up to its roof, not only lost her savings and household goods but also her store of foodgrains.  Anaaj ra nuksaan ri bharpaai kathin hai. Parivaar re liye kathey se anaaj avego? (It is difficult to compensate the loss of grains. From where will we get foodgrains for our family)? she said with dismay. The storage of grains ensures food security for rural families, while livelihood is taken care of by rearing milch animals. A major setback to the cattle-rearing Raibari community, which has a significant strength in Dhola, was the loss of its cattle wealth. A large number of our goats, sheep and calves were swept away in the torrent. We didnt get enough time to save them, Jhumi Devi, who helps her husband Ram Lal rear the animals, said.A family, whose ramshackle house collapsed in the flash floods, was loading a huge quantity of wet wheat on a tractor trolley to be disposed of. The grains, which had developed sprouts, could not be ground even after being dried.I could witness the flood fury only from a distance as the marooned villages in Jalore and Sirohi districts were inaccessible. People being evacuated and shifted to safe locations had high hopes from the media, but I knew my limitations. I could not report the condition in their villages without cross-checking.The affable Pali Collector I met before touring the region gently conveyed the administrations expectation. I would request you to highlight the immediate relief provided by us. So many rumours are being spread on social media. No need to take note of them, he smiled.While the salutary rescue and relief operations conducted by the Army, Air Force and the National Disaster Response Force will help the flood victims sail through the crisis and get back to their lives after the water recedes, I was appalled to see the horrific condition of cows. Hundreds were washed away. The cow vigilantes, so active elsewhere, were nowhere to be seen!"

Pictures by UB Photos Guwahati, Aug. 1: Theresa Timungpi of Umsoi in central Assam's Karbi Anglong district never thought that the ubiquitous jackfruit could be a bread-earner for her. Timungpi, who is associated with Khandal Ju - a company selling juice, chips and pulp made from jackfruit - now earns between Rs 2,000 and Rs 3,000 every month. Khandal Ju today put up a stall at the second Jackfruit Festival on the Indian Institute of Entrepreneurship (IIE), Guwahati, campus, at Lalmati for better exposure and market linkage. ""We are selling in local markets, but the demand is pretty low. We hope to get market linkage through this festival,"" Timungpi told this correspondent as she sold a packet of chips for Rs 20 and a can of juice for Rs 40. Though jackfruit is abundant and grows naturally in the Northeast, only a few such as Timungpi are doing business in jackfruits and value-added products. ""Jackfruit is the fourth largest-grown fruit in the country after banana, mango and grapes. It is rich in antioxidant fibres and contains anti-diabetic ingredients. There is a huge demand for products from jackfruits such as pulp, raw jackfruit and its seeds in north Indian states and in the UK, the US, Malaysia and parts of Southeast Asian countries. Bangladesh, which shares a border with the Northeast, exports 1 million kg of jackfruits to the UK alone every year,"" Manoj Kumar Das, director of IIE, Guwahati, said. ""We want to attract farmers and entrepreneurs in the Northeast to take up the jackfruit business. Last year, we had trained at least 80 farmers on how to peel a raw jackfruit and make value-added products such as juice, pulp, pickle, jam, jelly among others. This year, around 130 farmers and entrepreneurs are taking part in the training and workshop being held during the festival,"" Hemanta Rabha, a senior project officer of the IIE, Guwahati, said. ""A farmer can earn up to Rs 50,000 from one jackfruit tree in a year. The roasted seeds taste like coffee and can be used as flour. Jackfruit seeds are nutritious too,"" he said. The associate professor of the University of Agriculture Sciences, Bangalore, Shayamalama S, during a technical session with farmers and entrepreneurs, talked about how to preserve and process raw jackfruit. ""There is a huge demand for jackfruit pulp used in making ice cream and cake,"" she said. Entrepreneurs from Kerala who are doing good business in jackfruits shared their success stories with local entrepreneurs in another session. ""An entrepreneur in Kerala sells 50,000 tonnes jackfruits in markets in northern India and our entrepreneurs can also tap the market,"" the officer-on-special duty of the Meghalaya Institute of Entrepreneurship, B.K.

The only reason for this sudden increase is the fear of losing crop to drought, he said.The official said last year not many farmers showed interest in applying for crop insurance hoping that they would get a good monsoon and a better yield. Looking at last years condition, the farmers dont wish to take a chance ... hence, they have voluntarily come forward to apply for the insurance, Mr. Manjunath said. They have applied for insurance at 145 centres opened across the district by the government.He said though the department has been undertaking extensive awareness programmes on crop insurance to make sure that more farmers apply, this year most of them have come forward voluntarily.The insurance covers agriculture crops such as toor, green gram, maize, groundnut, and sunflower.In case of loss owing to a natural calamity such as flood or drought, the farmers can get compensation of up to 90%, which comes as a great relief to farmers, he said. The official hoped that if this awareness continues, then in the coming days, more farmers would apply given the unpredictable and volatile climatic conditions.Meanwhile, the farmers complained that while the 145 centres were cooperative, the banks did not extend the same kind of cooperation."

The administration has ordered a probe.According to sources, 3.58 lakh quintals of moong dal and 29,300 quintals of urad dal have been procured in the entire district for around Rs 197 crore. ""There are around 50 cases in Khirkia tehsil where single farmers, who registered to sell a particular quantity of pulses, have sold the same quantity three or four times. The report was sent to the district collector, who has ordered probe,"" said an official.The procurement rules say that an agreement needs to be signed with farmers, based on the sown area of pulses. In this case, though the agreement was with one farmer, several sold on the same agreement, said the officer.Harda district collector Anay Dwivedi said, ""A probe has been ordered. SDMs and the district food and civil supplies officer have been asked to submit detailed reports that clearly quantify anomalies, if any."" The government's action will be based on the report, he said.Already, the government is grappling with large-scale irregularities in dal procurement in Tendukheda region of Narasingpur district, where the amount of tur and moong procured is thrice the average yield in the last five years. The administration is investigating how 15,000 metric tonne of tur dal was procured in Tendukheda despite the fact the crop was sown in only 8,000 hectares, where even the highest yield would add up to 5000-6000 metric tonnes. Pulses are being procured at Rs 5,000 per quintal from farmers, while the market rate is around Rs 3,500/quintal."

The breach occurred following heavy rains in the villages of Holagundi, Morigeri, Sonna, Uttangi and Talakallu, leading to the flooding of the tank and the subsequent breach.People in nearby villages faced a challenging time as the water entered their villages, flooding hundreds of acres of agriculture land where the maize crop had been sown. The 1,664-hectare tank irrigates 1,400 acres of land. A war of words broke out between the officials and the people, who said the latter had failed to take precautionary steps.Rain lashes GadagModerate rain was reported from Gadag city and other places in the taluk on Monday. It had rained in the taluk on Sunday also.Showers have returned to the district after a lull of three weeks. Farmers now see a ray of hope as crops had started withering away for want of moisture in the atmosphere in the sprouting stage itself. The Met department has forecast rain in the region over the next few days. Farmers have sowed green gram, sunflower and groundnut. They plan to sow chilli and onion in the days to come.Sowing has been completed only on 46.6% of the cultivation area in the district, which has a 115-mm deficit this monsoon. It has received 1.5 mm in August, against the normal of 75.4 mm for the month.Showers have receded in Uttara Kannada district, with reports of rain only in Kumta, Karwar, Mundgod and Siddapura."

For instance, while the targeted area coverage for pulses was 5,420 hectares this year, the area achieved so far is only 125 hectares. Like this year, though Periyar waters could not be released in June-July for kuruvai cultivation last year, a section of farmers, particularly in Vadipatti and Chellampatti blocks, went ahead with sowing, hoping on well irrigation or late rains. However, this time, many did not want to take that risk, an agriculture official said.M. Tirupathi, a farmer from Kulamangalam, pointed out that a large number of farmers, who were dependent on well irrigation, could not go ahead with kuruvai cultivation this year since majority of their wells have run dry owing to the persisting drought that began last year.Concurring with this, K. Dharmalingam, a 67-year-old farmer from Kachirayanpatti near Melur, said that though he and few other farmers tried to sink a well up to 500 feet, the exercise turned out to be futile.Pointing out that his village was in the tail-end of the Periyar-Vaigai irrigation area, he said that it was seven years ago that Kachirayanpatti and nearby areas received water from the irrigation canal. Even in those years when water was released from the dam, it failed to reach our areas, he said.Farmers in our region have begun to think about giving up paddy cultivation altogether since the monsoons have become erratic and we are only incurring losses year after year, he said.Though the administration has also been appealing to farmers to switch over to alternative crops such as millets or pulses, farmers, however, claim that the transition was not easy.P. Krishnan, a 65-year-old farmer from Kallampatti near Kottampatti, said that switching to other crops depended on the nature of soil as well. Moreover, with increasing input costs, non-availability of labour, and uncertainty over monsoons, there is no guarantee that even switching over to alternative crops will be profitable, he said.Echoing his view, N. Ganesan from Tirumangalam, who has sown green gram on four acres of land, said that he was unsure of taking a good yield. The reasonably good amount of rain received in the past one week has given little hope, he said.All is not lostWhile kuruvai has turned out to be a failure overall, officials expressed hope that those who sowed would be able to take a reasonably good yield if the current pattern of Southwest monsoon continued in the coming weeks.The rainfall in January-February and in summer has been abysmally low. Though initial weeks of Southwest monsoon has been a disappointment, the rains in the past one week has raised hope for ample rainfall till September, which will augur well for the samba crop as well, the agriculture official said.Meanwhile, he added that they have also been encouraging the farmers to enrol in the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) scheme as a mitigation measure. In villages that are notified under the scheme for the season, the insurance coverage will be for prevented sowing as well, when the farmers are compensated for not being able to sow. Though the cut-off date for prevented sowing for paddy is over, farmers can make use of the scheme for other crops, he said.Farmers in our region are thinking about giving up paddy cultivation altogether since monsoons have become erratic and we are only incurring losses year after yearK.

In recent interviews, yoga proponent and entrepreneur Baba Ramdev has been calling for boycott of Chinese goods. If we boycott Chinese products, we will rub their nose on the ground, and they will be forced to bend before us, Baba Ramdev has been seen lecturing TV crews.Last October, too, Patanjali Baba had tweeted calls to boycott Chinese goods as retaliation against Chinas opposition to labelling Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Maulana Massood Azhar a global terrorist. The timing, Diwali, raised suspicions that the Ramdev was driven more by his sense to keep China out as a business competitor rather than for patriotic reasons.Largest trading partnerIndias trade with China is huge and is a worry because it has not followed the expected script. Last fiscal, India imported a humungous $61.7 billion worth of goods from China, while our exports to that country were just $9.05 billion, a yawning deficit of $52 billion. China is Indias largest trading partner accounting for 16 per cent of our imports. Those next in line from whom we import are miles behind  the US is at $18.15 billion (5.7 per cent share), the United Arab Emirates $17.4 billion (5.5 per cent) and Saudi Arabia $16.6 billion (5.19 per cent).To put this in perspective trade with Pakistan was a mere $2.67 billion in FY2016 or just 0.41 per cent of Indias global merchandise commerce. India can ignore commercial ties with Pakistan and concentrate on military challenges. With China, trade is too big to be banned at the drop of a hat. There are good economic reasons. Underlying the big trade numbers is the fact that China is a more cost-effective source of advanced information technology and hardware. Anil Ambanis Reliance Communications, for its 4G/broadband programme sources hardware from the Chinese IT giant Huawei. Beyond the jokes of cheap and poor quality Diwali lights, China has become a vital source of telecom and computer instrumentation.Guns and rosesEven as there is sabre-rattling at the borders by the foreign ministries of the two countries, a few days ago, Union Commerce minister Nirmala Sitharaman met with her Chinese counterpart Zhong Shan in Beijing to tackle the trade deficit and demand a level playing field for Indian agro, pharmaceutical and IT products in the Chinese market. In commerce, there is realism! Chinese businesses are known for their aggression and there is need to investigate the dumping of steel, photovoltaic cells and such like (which India is doing) to protect our own industries. But a rollback by banning Chinese goods is no answer.Beyond the haze of jingoism, the fact is that Chinese exports to India are of high value-addition, and cost-effective. So, theres a natural demand for them. Telecom and computer instruments and hardware, entire project plants and drug intermediates are chosen on merit by Indian industry. Sitharaman acknowledged as much when she said: These imports feed the growing demand in India for such goods which China, due to variety of reasons, is able to export to India at competitive prices.There is evidence that India, too, did better when it moved away from traditional exports like iron ore, and cotton and yarn, to more value-added products. According to Chinese customs, Indian exports went up over six per cent in the January-April period with increasing purchases of items such as polished diamonds and other precious stones.ChinaInterestingly, the Indian consumer is smart and has not fallen prey to jingoistic calls of boycott. And, why should he? He has a head on his shoulders and his hands firmly in his pockets. If he gets equivalent quality and good service at half the price, he would be a fool to pay twice as much to a western or Indian retailer. The iPhone 7 Black sells at Rs 76,000 a piece, a Samsung S6 Edge top model is at Rs 52,000, while the Chinese equivalent in the high-end cell phone market  the OnePlus 5  top model is priced at Rs 38,000. We dont want the Chinese fixing and dumping in our market, but let us also not have a bunch of local monopolists erode competition by calls of pseudo nationalism![The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com]"

For instance, in July the cooperative generated Rs 8 lakh revenue by selling grocery items in small 10 rupee packets. This was a huge jump from the Rs 2.50 lakh their business raked in during the month of April, the cooperative authorities said.""We are selling a total of 25 items including Bengal gram, green gram, red gram, poppy, coriander, mustard, cumin, turmeric, Ajowan, fenugreek, garlic, red chilli powder, asafoetida, fried gram dal, hyacinth etc. in small packets. All the packets are only priced at Rs 10. At present, our employees are selling groceries at Woraiyur vegetable market, near Chathiram and Central bus stands, Thayanur shandy on Saturdays and on Sundays in Ponmlai shandy"", said K P Vanathi, joint registrar of Amaravathi Limited.Earlier, these items could be had only from ration shops. But after they were made available in various places where people converge in large numbers, business has increased by leaps and bounds. ""It has been lapped up by those who commute every day. They can buy their daily needs on their way home on a daily basis,"" an official pointed out.The consumer cooperative which mainly concentrates on public distribution system (PDS) also runs two self-service outlets at Kailasapuram and Ponmalai where they sell non-controlled commodities (NCC) like groceries, oil items and cosmetics. A couple of employees of Amaravathi Ltd are entrusted to look after each spot. Their modus operandi is simple: spread these 25 items in any corner of markets or shandy or roadsides, bus stands and people just flock to them.""A majority of our customers are daily wagers. They preferred our stalls as we have small packets as per their requirements with quality assured"", says N Sivakumar, a sales man at the Woraiyur stall. People from middle class and above flock to big malls even to buy a match box or a bunch of curry leaves. However, the poor and daily breadwinners have no option but to seek ordinary 'maligai kadai' (small grocery shops). Targeting these people, Amaravathi has taken the initiative to distribute quality goods with very minimal profit,"" said Vanathi.Amaravathi has its own wholesale units in Manapparai and Lalgudi. From these units the items would be transported to self-service outlets as well as shandy and markets. Normally, grocery items are being sent to government hostels, hospital canteens etc. In order to enhance revenue, she decided to extend sales to other private institutions also. When she approached educational institutions, they readily agreed to buy groceries from Amaravathi. ""Some more institutions have promised to tie up with us. Once it materialises, it would help generate more revenue for the cooperative sector"", she said."

The State governments pro-active step to release water early to Godavari and Krishna deltas to hasten sowing too has not worked to the expected level.While the normal area sown till date (August 9 from June 1) is 24 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed only in 20.21 lakh hectares, which is just 84 % of the area that is normally covered.The primary reason for tardy sowing appears to be deficit rainfall. While a 30% excess rainfall was recorded in June, a 24 % deficit rainfall was recorded in July and a 22 % deficit in August till today. In the arid Rayalaseema region, groundnut crop is suffering from moisture stress.In Kurnool, groundnut and cotton sown in the western mandals and maize and blackgram sown in the eastern mandals is under moisture stress. In Anantapur district, groundnut sown in June is under moisture stress, according to information given to the Agricultural Commissionerate.The sowing of course food grains such as paddy, jowar, bajra, maize, ragi and minor millets is only 87 % of normal, the sowing of pulses like red gram, green gram, black gram and horse gram is better with 105 % of the normal. With water level in most of the reservoirs in the State reaching rock bottom, there is none to be released for irrigation. While the major reservoirs in the State are holding 212.79 tmcft on August 9, there was 368.12 tmcft on the corresponding date last year.Water table plummetsThe groundwater resources position is also bleak in the State with the water table falling to 14 metres. Some groundwater resources are available only in the coastal districts of Srikakulam (12.03 tmcft), Vizianagaram (7.7 tmcft), Visakhapatnam (4.35 tmcft) and Guntur (1.61 tmcft). There were no groundwater resources available in the other districts. Groundwater reserves, which are often the last resort for drinking, have been over used to the extent of 740 tmcft, according to Groundwater Department norms. Anantapur is in the lead by being 215 tmcft in the red, followed by Chittoor district where 145 tmcft had to be replenished to bring back the water table to normal. The groundwater position in some other districts is Kadapa (132.11 tmcft), Prakasam (118.19 tmcft), West Godavari (59.94 tmcft), and Kurnool (59.40 tmcft). Unfortunately, Nellore and East Godavari districts are in the negative when it comes to groundwater but to a lesser extent."
5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

Since the sowing period is already over, need for rain for crops' growth has become urgent, officials from the department said.The officials added that crops have begun to dry in Daund, Baramati, Purandar, and Indapur in Pune district. The situation is no better in almost all blocks in Ahmednagar, south and north Solapur, Paithan, Gangapur as well as the blocks in Beed, Latur , Nanded, Parbhani, among others.In short, the crops in all divisions, except Konkan, have begun to face water stress over the last few days. ""Some places witnessed a total dry spell due to the break in monsoon, and are experiencing severe water stress. As per the weather department forecasts, there might only be sporadic rainfall in some parts till August 15, which might worsen the situation,"" a senior state agriculture department official told TOI.Another official said the recent dry spell may have a major impact on the yield of black and green gram, bringing it down by around 30-40%. ""Meanwhile, soybean and cotton too have been affected. Though some rainfall in the coming week can lessen the damage to an extent,"" he said.The state's sowing has touched the 91% mark, with sowing being done on 135 lakh hectare against the normal of around 149 lakh hectare.""However, there is a need for rain for crops to grow further in several districts in the state. In Amravati, for instance, crop growth in seven blocks has stopped as rainfall here has been sporadic since the beginning of June,"" the official said.In Nagpur, the work of rice transplantation has been moving at a snail's pace due to the lack of rainfall. In Pune division, which has recorded 85.5% sowing since June 1, crops in various blocks in the three districts of Pune, Solapur and Ahmednagar have started drying, the report stated.The situation is similar in some blocks in Satara and Sangli in the Kolhapur division, where crops are succumbing to the recent dry spell.The growth of crops has also halted in 11 blocks in the Aurangabad division, 18 in Latur, 16 in Nagpur, four in Kolhapur and 20 in the Pune division, the report said."

After the initial expectations of a normal rainfall season were dashed, the Department of Agriculture is now busy preparing to deliver on its contingency plan to supply alternate short-term crop seeds to farmers. The season has so far been dismaying.The state has recorded rainfall deficit of about 27 per cent, registering only 404 mm of rainfall as against the average of 551 mm from June 1 to August 10. Of this, only 358 mm of rainfall was recorded from June 1 to July 31, marking a deficit. South-Interior Karnataka has been one of the worst hit areas with a (-)44 per cent departure from the average rainfall.Agriculture Department Director G Y Srinivas pointed out that only 63 per cent of sowing had completed so far with 46.35 lakh hectares (ha) being cultivated against the target of 73 lakh ha. Of this, only 8.53 lakh ha is irrigated while the remaining 37.82 lakh ha is dependent on rainfall.So far, districts like Mysuru and Chamarajanagar have registered only 57 per cent and 43 per cent sowing, respectively. In districts like Yadgir, Kalaburagi, Raichur and Bagalkot, farmers who had sown earlier in June and early July are looking at stunted plants of cereals and pulses in their fields. This will lead to lower yield and also lower prices as such cereals and pulses tend to be of inferior quality.In districts like Chitradurga, farmers have completely removed the millet plants as they were badly damaged due to lack of rain. It has affected pulses more and cereals like maize and bajra are next on the list, Srinivas explained.He also said that the Cauvery basin has been one of the worst affected as the dams storing Cauvery waters have seen the lowest storage in 46 years. As we are looking at conserving water till next May and fulfilling water drinking requirements of people and cattle, we are requesting farmers not to go for water-intensive crops like sugarcane and paddy and instead opt for dry crops like ragi, jowar and maize which require less water, he added.Each year, the department prepares a contingency plan for short-term alternate crops at the district and taluk levels of the Kharif sowing fails to take off. This year, coupled with news of good rain till the end of August, the Department is preparing to supply 1.94 lakh quintals of seeds for this purpose. About 60 per cent of the average rainfall in the state is witnessed before August 15 and but it has fallen woefully short yet again.Also Read: More rainfall expected across Karnataka this weekDirector of Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) Srinivas Reddy said rains are likely to be good until the end of August. Predictions for rain are good for the entire state and hopefully, this will cover sowing gaps. There are some areas where sowing has not been taken up at all. I can say that as far as agricultural purpose is concerned, it is good news for us. But, as far as the inflow into dams is concerned, we are not sure if it is sufficient to make up for the shortfall. We will have to see about that, he said.He has good reason to be wary. For instance, the catchment areas in Cauvery basin received only 56 per cent of rain till last week and has only picked up since. Just a week of good rain and with a little bit of inflow, the government has decided to release Cauvery waters from the four reservoirs purely for drinking water purposes.Women watering the saplings at a field in Hubballi-Dharwad district | D HemanthHUBBALLIOnly 50 pc land cultivatedKumar Mulkipatil, who had cultivated green gram, groundnut and cotton on his 20 acre farm land in Annigeri Hobli has lost all the crop due to scanty rainfall. He had spent about `1.5 lakh on cultivation and his five-member family is now in deep financial crisis.For the last three years, I have been suffering crop loss. Every year I slip into financial trouble. Agriculture is not at all profitable now. I may have to sell some of the land to save my family, says Mulkipatil.With the monsoon season in its last legs, the situation is turning grim for farmers in Hubballi-Dharwad district which has recorded 60 per cent deficit rainfall (June 1 to August 10). The district has received only 67.4 mm of rainfall as against normal of 134.3 mm rainfall for this period. The district has recorded only 58.1 mm rain against a normal of 113.6 mm, a deficit of 49 per cent.As a result, sowing activities have came to halt and only 50 per cent of the cultivable land has been covered under kharif sowing so far. Of the targeted 2.31 lakh hectares, sowing has been completed in 1.24 lakh hectares as of August 10. Last year, at end of June, sowing was completed in 1.78 lakh hectares while the rain deficit was just 20 per cent.This year, maize has been cultivated in 18,000 hectare against a targeted area of 34,621 hectares. Green gram, another major crop, was sown in 8,000 hectares of the targeted 43,284 hectares while groundnut was sown in only 3,145 hectares against a target of 32,215 hectares. Hybrid cotton has been cultivated in 6,608 hectares against a target of 49,217 hectares. Agriculture Department Joint Director Rudreshappa T S said the kharif season has failed completely in Navalgund and Kundagol taluk completely. However, farming activity is good in Kalaghtagi taluk, Alnavar in Dharwad and Chabbi Hobli in Hubballi taluk, he added.SHIVAMOGGAFarmers worried about another drought yearDespite having four reservoirs -- Tunga, Bhadra, Anjanapura and Ambligola -- the district is staring at a drought for the third successive year. Deficit rainfall has led to low water levels of in all the reservoirs.Lakes and tanks which feed agricultural fields in Shikaripura and Sorab taluks are not yet full and farmers are pinning their hopes on good rain in the remainder of the monsoon season.The district has recorded a deficit of 31 per cent rainfall as on August 1, having received 1,000 mm of rainfall against the normal of 1,444 mm.Of the targeted 1,69,000 hectares, cultivation has been taken up in about 1,09,000 hectares. This includes 45,000 hectares of paddy and 6,0000 hectares of maize. Paddy cultivation has come down from 1,07,000 hectares to 45,000 hectare while maize cultivation has increased from 54,000 hectares to 60,000 hectares.J Madhusudhan, Joint Director of agriculture, said farmers still waiting for good rains to sow paddy over the next fifteen days. If there are no good rains by the end of August, then the farmers have to go in for alternative crops like ragi, green gram and black gram which require less water, he said.We will suggest to farmers not to go for paddy or maize cultivation after August. They can think of sorghum (white Bijapur jowar), sunflower and horse gram. Even millets like Sava, Navane too will fetch them decent returns, he said.UDUPIRain deficit, but paddy sowing close to targetThe district has witnessed 16.72 per cent rainfall in the current monsoon season as of July 31 this year. It received 2005 mm rain in the period between June and July, against the normal rainfall of 2,408 mm rain. Despite this, sowing of paddy does not seem to have been affected much.Against a target of 44,000 hectares for this kharif season, paddy seeds were sown in 42,400 hectares as of August 11, according to Chandrashekar, Deputy Director, Agriculture Department. As of July 12, paddy seeds were sown in 23,000 hectares. Later, sowing activity picked up pace and 42,400 hectares are now under paddy cultivation, he said.Farmers engaged in sowing paddy in Kodagu districtKODAGUDelayed start to sowing activityWith deficient rain in the early days of the monsoon season in the prime catchment area of river Cauvery, farming activity had been slow across the district. It picked up pace only in the last few weeks with good rains. As on August 12, the district recorded an average of 1,345.25 mm of rainfall while it was 1,344.11 mm last year in the corresponding period.In 2015, paddy sowing had been completed by the second week of August, while last year, 55 per cent had been completed. This year, sowing has been completed in less than half of the targeted cultivation area.Though coffee is a major crop in the district, paddy is also cultivated. The Agriculture Department has set a target of 30,500 hectares for paddy cultivation against last years 28,090 hectares. As of August 12, only 12,733 hectares of paddy sowing was completed in district .With many farmers turning away from paddy cultivation due to increased cost and less market price, the Agriculture Department had announced a subsidy for mechanised sowing.Farmer Yallalinga of Kere Bhosaga hopes the skies will open up soon and save the standing cropKALABURAGI70 per cent of crop already damagedThe good monsoon rains in June, when the monsoon set in, brought cheer to farmers in Kalaburagi district. But their hopes have been dashed with the no rains over the last one-and-half months. Sitting in his fields and looking skyward hoping for rains, Yallalinga, a farmer from Kere Bhosga village says,  We have been unlucky. Already, the green gram and black gram crops have been damaged completely. If it does not rains in the next 4-5 days, the tur crop will also be damaged.Crops like green gram, black gram, sesame, soya and hyacinth beans have also been seriously affected due to the dry spell. Karabasappa of Kallur village in Jewargi taluk said that with high hopes he cultivated green gram, black gram, red gram and sugarcane. But he now fears he may face heavy crop loss.According to Agriculture Department officials, 93 per cent of kharif cultivation has been completed in Kalaburagi district Farmers have cultivated green gram in 49,000 hectars, black gram in 39,000 hectars, soya beans in five hectares and sesame in 10,000 hectors. Sources say 70 per cent of the cultivated crop has been damaged badly. The executive committee of the Zilla Krashik Samaj , of which the Joint Director of Agriculture Department is also a member, reviewed the situation at a meeting on Thursday and sent a proposal to the government to compensate farmers who have suffered losses due to dry spell.Less rain hasnt hit areca plantations |Rajesh Shetty BallalbaghD-K DISTRICT24 pc rain deficit, but all seems okay hereTraditionally a paddy-growing district, Dakshina Kannada has a total of 38,000 hectares under paddy cultivation. But with monsoon showers being scarce, this year, only 28,000 hectares have been cultivated under the kharif season.This will cut down our kharif window by at least 25 days as most of the low-lying fields have to get their initial showers by first week of June followed by regular monsoon showers from the last week or latest by first week of July. This is the ideal monsoon behaviour for a good kharif crop, says Subramanya Shastry, a Krishi Pandit awardee and farmer from Buntwal taluk. But this time we have 20 per cent lesser rainfall, he pointed outJoint Director of Agriculture Kempe Gowda said, We did have a fair extent of pre-monsoon showers since April. It is wrong to assume that the extent, intensity and duration of the monsoon showers are an indicator of the quality and yield of khariff crop. In paddy-growing areas, if we get showers even in June, it is sufficient.Districts where sowing has been affected due to poor rainfallBengaluru Urban, Bengaluru Rural, Ramanagara, Chikkaballapur, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, Davangere, Ballari, Dharwad, Gadag and Yadgir.Dists where plants have suffered stunted growth due lack of moistureMysuru, Chamarajanagar, Hassan, Mandya, Chitradurga, Davanagere, Tumakaru, Dharwad, Gadag, Vijayapura, Bagalkot, Raichur, Koppal, Ballari, Yadgir, Ramanagara and Bengaluru Rural.Status of minor irrigation tanksOut of total 3,602 minor irrigation tanks in the state, only 2 per cent of them had storage capacity of more than 50 per cent, 39 per cent of the tanks had storage capacity between 30 per cent and 50 per cent and the remaining 58 per cent of the tanks are dry.(With inputs from Prakash Samaga in Udupi, Ramachandra V Gunari in Shivamogga, B Kishan Singh in Hubballi, Coovercolly Indresh in Madikeri & M Raghuram in Mangaluru)"

Farmers across the state have been under a lot of stress due to the prolonged dry spell. However, August has been a very difficult month for the cultivators especially in Marathwada. At the end of July, the toll stood at 531 and it has gone up to 580 in just 15 days.Nearly 200 talukas of the 355 in the state received less than 75% of the total projected rainfall this monsoon, increasing farmer woes and holding out the threat of crop failure.Officials say that by early estimates standing crops on nearly 3 lakh hectares had been affected. The final number may go up as complaints from farmers were pouring in everyday. As of August 14, the talukas that recorded 25% to 50% of the average rainfall numbered 55 and the talukas that received 50% to 75 % of the average rainfall numbered 140. The talukas that received 75% to 100% of the season's average were 104 in number. More than 100% rainfall occurred in 61 talukas.Most of the affected areas are in Marathwada and Vidarbha. Parts of Amravati and Nagpur are one of the worst affected with only 21% to 25% of the total rainfall.Officials from the relief and revenue department said that damage to the crops due to lack of rainfall and faint hopes of revival of the monsoon is the prime reason for the deaths.Kalidas Aapet of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana said that the dry spell is one reason, but one of the main reasons is the lack of adequate price for agricultural produce in the state.""All the promises that the BJP government made before coming to power have all remained on paper,"" said Aapet. ""Farmers in the state have been left to fend for themselves and that is why as the last resort they are hanging themselves,"" said Aapet.Officials said that standing crops like soyabean, moong and tur, which are 100-day crops have not received rainfall for the last 55 days and their cycle is such that they were to be harvested by September-end. Beed has recorded the highest number of deaths this month so far-- 12 deaths, followed by Nanded which recorded 9 deaths and 7 deaths in Parbhani. Water stock in Marathwada dams have also been receding gradually due to the deficient rainfall.Agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar has said the government was alert to the situation and directions had been issued to all collector offices to conduct field surveys after receiving complaints from farmers."

The pond has been geo-tagged for monitoring of its water level.Immediately after the harvest, we will grow mustard and gram as the rabi crops with the help of water stored in the pond for irrigation. Such a crop pattern, one after another, was just out of question earlier, said Harinarain, 50. The rain water stored in the artificial pond touches the level of 3 feet.Structures such as farm ponds, anicuts, bunds, percolation tanks and waterways are being built all over Rajasthan in the second phase of the flagship Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan, which has combined various schemes and brought them under a single platform.It is targeted at conserving rainwater, run-off water, ground water and soil moisture to the maximum.The Watershed Departments Project Manager, Dinesh Kumar, said the farmers in the region were motivated during the campaign to get the ponds constructed in their agricultural fields.Harinarain plans to bring diesel pumps to supply water from the farm pond, built at a cost of Rs.2 lakh, to irrigate the next round of crops.An anicut constructed in the Jharana Khurd village, situated at a distance of 10 km from Bhojpura, has brought a rivulet back to life.Rajendra Bairwa, a local resident who owns 20 bigha land, said the anicut had increased soil moisture and was being used for bathing of the cattle and giving them the drinking water.The total estimated cost of the Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan is pegged at Rs.2,000 crore, while over 94,300 projects have been completed under its first phase.Mr. Kumar said the State government was expecting a bigger contribution from the people during the second phase, as the issue of water scarcity affected all sections of society.As many as 11 government departments have joined hands to execute the works under the Abhiyan.If the greenery witnessed in the Phagi tehsil is any indication, the desert States climate is likely to change in the near future and the rainwater harvesting techniques are set to scale up the crop yields."

It will increase the country's import bills if the sowing does not pick up in next two-three weeks. India, in any case, has to depend on imports to meet its domestic demand for these crops.Latest crop-wise figures, released by the agriculture ministry on Friday, show that the total Kharif sown area as on Friday stand at 976.34 lakh hectares as compared to 984.57 lakh hectares at this time last year - a clear indication that the current crop year (2017-18) may not be as good as 2016-17 in terms of production despite normal monsoon in many parts of the country.Though the total sown area has dipped below last year's corresponding period level for the first time on Friday this monsoon season, sown area under oilseeds has consistently been declining for the past four weeks.Similarly, pulses too has shown declining trend in past two weeks with sown area under pigeon pea (arhar), moong and soyabean declining by 18%, 6% and 9% respectively as compared to their acreage at this time last year. Sown area under oilseeds stand at 157.36 lakh hectares (LH) as compared to 175.10 LH at this time last year - the highest dip in terms of acreage so far this season.Less rainfall means poor storage of water and lower acreage in the Kharif season and also during Rabi (winter crop) sowing operation, beginning October. Less moisture content in soil also affects Rabi crops. If low rainfall phase continues in these areas, its effect will be felt on overall production."

Five people were reported dead in rain-related incidents in the Marathwada region.As many as 172 circles in the Marathwada region reported heavy rainfall (over 65mm), which included several areas in Nanded and Latur which registered over 100mm rainfall, during the 24 hours ending on Sunday morning.The heavy downpour continued with brief gaps in Aurangabad and many other parts of the region till Sunday night. The local met department observatory registered around 35mm rainfall by 6.30pm.Of the five deaths in the region, three were reported from Parbhani district and one each from Nanded and Beed. In Parbhani, two cousins drowned in an overflowing stream while one person died in a wall collapse in Purna taluka of the district. A teenager drowned in a swollen waterway in Nanded city, while a similar drowning was reported from Rakshasbhuvan in Georai taluka of Beed district.All nine talukas of Aurangabad district reported satisfactory showers. While Latur (104.5%) and Nanded (100.86%) had the highest average rainfall in Marathwada, some circles from these districts even reported rainfall in the range of 150mm to 200mm.Agricultural superintendent officer for Aurangabad division S K Divekar said the revival of monsoon would minimize the yield reduction in crops. ""The `mung' crop, which was reaching the harvesting stage, has already been considerably damaged in areas where rainfall was very poor. The fresh showers will give new lease of life to other standing kharif crops such as cotton, tur and maize,"" he said.Nashik city recorded 31.5mm rainfall by 5.30pm on Sunday . The rainfall in the catchment areas of the dams around the city was even heavier, forcing the administration to release water from most days by afternoon. The water level in the Godavari rose but remained under the danger mark by late evening.According to the India Meteorological Department, Nashik and some cities in north Maharashtra including Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar will continue to witness moderate to heavy rains during the next 36 hours.The intensity of the rain fall was low in Kolhapur district, which received an average 3.48mm rainfall. Chandgad taluka got the maximum rainfall at 10mm, followed Gaganbawada at 7.5mm. However, the district is likely to receive heavy rainfall over the next two days.According to available data, Kolhapur had received just 43mm rainfall in August, which is only 9% of the total rainfall received every year on an average."

A long break in rain has heightened prospects of soya crop failure and portends a big trouble for farmers reeling under heavy debt.In past one year, they faced back to back losses, notwithstanding bumper crops of orange and onion. Post-demonetisation, onion was sold for Re 1 before the government stepped in. ""The government woke up too late and started procuring onion at a rate of Rs 8 per kg. By the time the procurement started, thousands of farmers had already sold lakhs of tonnes of onion,"" said farmers in Agar Malwa bitterly.""It should rain soon or the soya crop may damage,"" they said. The district in western MP is known for producing good quality orange, onion and soyabean. Grown over almost 50,000 acres of land, orange crop was hit by demonetisation when traders did not turn up to buy the produce. Availability of onion at dirt cheap rate dealt another blow to growers.Poor rain in the district led to stunted growth of the soya crop. This is happening when many farmers are under debtfrom Rs 1 to Rs3 lakhdepending on the land area under cultivation.A farmer, Roop Narayan is trying hard to save his soya crop. Narayan, who sowed soya between rows of orange plants on 10 bighas of land, says, ""I incurred a loss of Rs 1.5 lakh after spending Rs 3 lakh on onion crop. I had no other option, but to borrow more money from the cooperative societies. I am just praying nothing goes wrong this time.""He said the government should have ""reacted early"" to procure onions from farmers. The decision was taken after more than 15 days, he said. Another farmer Devi Singh could get barely Rs 90,000 by selling onion at Rs 2/ kg. He said the government, which talks a lot about the farmers, should actually do something concrete for them.Jain Singh, another farmer of the region, says, ""We need warehouses for onion and yields like tomato and orange cultivated in the region.""Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen, however, said, "" Onion procurement benefited 99% farmers. The government also procured urad and moong from farmers. We will always be around to help farmers."""

The Wholesale Grain and Seeds Merchants Association has welcomed the step and expressed the confidence that it will increase the prices of the two pulses and thus help farmers. Secretary Pratap Motwani has demanded that the ban on export of these commodities should be lifted, which will further push up prices.Motwani stated in a press release that last year the support price of mung was Rs5,175 per quintal and that of urad was Rs5,000 per quintal. This had prompted farmers to go in for cultivation of these two crops this year. However, this year mung is fetching a price of between Rs3,500 and Rs3,800 per quintal in agricultural markets while urad prices were in the range of Rs 4,000-4,200 per quintal.The government had increased support price for the two pulses this year by Rs400 per quintal. For mung it is Rs5,575 while for urad it is Rs5,400. The government purchased its share of pulses and then imposed a 10% import duty. However, this did not push up prices. Now, the centre has completely banned import of the two pulses, which is a welcome step, said Motwani."

In celebrating Him, the Hindus of the state touch base with an ancient fecundity ritual, one that sees them venerate Lord Ganesha with the very produce of nature that He blessed them with. Food, thus, is one of the hallmarks of Ganesh Chaturthi, and is replete with associated fertility symbolisms.In the prelude to the festival, Lord Ganesha's parentsLord Shiva and Goddess Parvatiare worshipped a day before. Folklore paints a picture of Parvati pregnant with Lord Ganesha, yet another allusion to fertility. ""In Goa, the day is referred to as tay and involves womenfolk observing a fast. In Hindu priest and other such households, the hartalika puja is perfomed,"" noted Goan folklorist Jayanti Naik, says.Intriguing food symbolisms are seen right from this day. To begin with, the fasting diet includes only fruits and milk. Naik says the women eat nothing that is cultivated with a plough. ""This is the tradition pan-India,"" she adds, while explaining that the plough is perceived to be a symbol of masculinity.Lord Ganesha is born on the following day, called chavat, marking the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi. ""The birth of the benevolent god marks the most important day of the celebrations,"" says artist and culture enthusiast Naguesh Sardesai. And, understandably, food is cooked in plenty.Goddess Parvati or Gauri, who symbolises the Mother Goddess, is given a special nourishing diet to satisfy her 'duvalle' or cravings. It comprises varan, a preparation from at least five leafy vegetables, and moni patolleo. While patolleo are elongated rice dumplings of sorts with a sweet filling, those offered to Gauri have no filling and are therefore called moni.""The food offered to Parvati is bland,"" says Naguesh, adding that salt is added only to the food offered to Lord Mahadev and Lord Ganesha.The rest of the cuisine covers a plethora of Ganesha's favourites, including moongache gathi, khatkhate, ambadayache uddad methi, etc. ""Sweet dishes comprise stuffed patolleo, modakswhich may be fashioned from stuffings of chunna (coconut and jaggery) or punna (chana dal and jaggery)and neureos,"" says publisher and food writer Sapna Sardesai. A payasam is also prepared. ""To the payasam, five grains of tender rice grains taken from new sheaves, are added,"" Sardesai explains.""The tender grains are significant of the new harvest,"" says Naik, adding that this offering of the first sheaves is a thanksgiving for God's bounty. Explaining the fertility symbolism behind the neureos, Naik says, ""Neureos form the female symbol, which is why no matter how many are prepared, it is compulsory to prepare at least one modakthe male symbol.""The following day, pancham, which concludes one-and-a-half days of festivities and sees a majority of Goan Hindu households immersing their respective idols, has a greater variety of preparations in addition to those prepared on the main day. Only the leafy vegetable preparation is excluded.""In addition to gravy prepations like moongache gathi (prepared from sprouted moong) and ros, dry vegetarian dishes are also cooked on this day. For instance, bhendyachi bhaji is made from the local, seven-ridged ladyfingers and ghosalyachi bhaji is made from ridge gourd. A green chilli or bitter gourd raita is also prepared. Deep-fried potato kaapa and ambadayache uddad methi, a tangy gravy made from hogplums, more or less completes the spread,"" says Sardesai.Both Naik and Sardesai make special mention of heet a local version of idlis made in a casing of jackfruit leaves. ""While it is common belief that idlis are a south Indian preparation, Goa has always had its version of it,"" Naik says. Traditionally, heet is dipped in coconut milk sweetened with jaggery before it is consumed.In the evening, after the concluding puja, or uttar puja, is held, two large laddoos of lhayo (puffed rice) are made with jaggery, roasted chana dal, cashew nuts and coconut. One laddoo is offered to Lord Ganesha as a send-off food, and the other to the person who takes the idol for immersion. The puffed rice is, once again, a symbol of prosperity.Thus, the entire celebration, right from the decoration to the food, pays glowing tribute to Nature's abundance and diversity."

The recent rain has also helped the revival of crops such as maize, green gram, black gram, and groundnut.Though some farmers had to remove the withering toor crop at the initial stage itself, officials of the Agriculture Department believe such incidents were minimal. Such farmers have the choice of cultivating contingency crops such as jowar and Bengal gram to cover their losses. We have received reports of some farmers removing the crop as they were turning dry in the absence of rains, but such cases were sporadic. Such farmers still have time to cultivate other crops, which many have already started doing, said Manjunath, joint director, Agriculture Department.He said this year, the department had set a target of 4.3 lakh hectares land. Sowing has been completed on over 95% of the target.Toor covers 2.67 lakh hectares, making it the largest crop this season, followed by maize (44,000 hectares).The official, however, said that this year, the targeted area and sowing area have reduced from the previous year. Last year, the targeted area was 5.69 lakh hectares, while toor alone was sown on 3.74 lakh hectares.Mr. Manjunath also said that with farmers not receiving a good bargain on toor last year, many are going for green gram in the hope that it will provide better returns. Last year, an acre of toor gave an yield of between 5 and 8 quintals, the official said.He said farmers are hoping for a similar output this year also, apart from a good price in the market."

Kanagaraj said Rs. 5.33 crore had been paid towards crop loss compensation to 6,589 farmers including 2,582 paddy farmers from 110 revenue villages through nationalised banks and Primary Agriculture Cooperative Banks and the balance Rs. 1.20 crore would be paid shortly. A proposal had been forwarded to the government for giving Rs. 39 lakh as compensation to 691 farmers whose coconut, mango, sapota, lemon trees had withered due to drought.Officials attached to the Department of Statistics have been asked to estimate the quantum of loss suffered by farmers who had cultivated maize, black gram, green gram. The farmers will get compensation within 45 days from the date of submission of the report, he said.But farmers expressed displeasure over the inordinate delay in giving compensation for crop loss and compensation under crop insurance.Were not ready to accept the assurance given by the insurance company. What were the company and the Statistics Department officials doing all these days? While the insurance company should have disbursed the compensation and officials should have completed the survey. But you are informing that it will take another two months or so. This is quite unacceptable, farmers S.T. Shaik Maideen of Vadakarai and others said.Collector Sandeep Nanduri said that the entire exercise would be expedited.When farmers alleged that the police were harassing them while taking silt or clay from dry water bodies for agricultural purposes and demanding bribe to get nod from revenue and mining department officials, the Collector assured that he would speak to the Superintendent of Police to sort out the issue.When some farmers complained that arrears to be paid by sugar factory for the sugarcane supplied were accumulating, an official representing the factory replied that 87% of the arrears had been settled. The rest 13% will be paid in the next 10 days, he said.But farmers said the official, who had no powers to give such assurance, should not be allowed to attend the farmers grievance meet. Instead, ask the factorys chairman to attend our meeting so that he can understand our problem.Mr. Sandeep told the official that there should be no more delay in settling arrears.The arrears should be paid along with interest within 10 days. If not, your chairman will have to come here, he said.After a few farmers complained that officials were not giving proper reply to their queries, Mr. Sandeep told the officials that every department, on getting queries from farmers, should reply to the farmer concerned. Moreover, an action taken report on farmers queries should be tabled in the subsequent meeting, the Collector said."

Venkatesh, who presided over the grievance day meeting here on Thursday, to expedite disbursal of insurance benefits to farmers who had insured their crops like green gram and black gram during 2015-16 and 2016-17.The Collector replied that said efforts were on to extend insurance benefits to eligible farmers.K.P. Perumal, a farmer from Thoothukudi, said the government had been asking farmers to insure their crops and insist on payment of premium but neither the government nor the insurance company bothered to extend insurance benefits to the affected farmers. It was unfortunate that some cooperative societies had been advertising in newspapers that jewels pledged by farmers for crop loans would be auctioned if they did not repay the loans in time. Despite the Supreme Courts ruling that drought-hit farmers should not be compelled to repay crop loans, cooperative societies were harassing them. A group of persons belonging to Groundwater Protection Movement raised the issue of illegal drawing of groundwater in parts of the district and sought action to check such activity. M. Krishnamurthy, a member of the movement, said while farmers were struggling to get water for cultivation, groundwater was being drawn by tanker lorries to cater to the needs of industries. No action was taken to check such activities though the issue was taken to the notice of the district administration. The Collector said that action had indeed been taken and he would not allow such issues to happen again.Tamilmani, a farmer from Kurumbur, said several tender coconut trees had withered in the wake of drought but relief was given to tender coconut farmers of Udangudi taluk only, but not to farmers of other taluks.Joint Director of Agriculture M.S.N. Selvaraj, Sub-Collector Deepak Jacob and officials from Public Works Department were present."

This was informed by Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the agriculture university, SN Pasupalak on Thursday.Addressing a gathering on the occasion of 56th Foundation Day of the institution, the VC said NRSC will provide farmers under OUAT exact information on farm land status and water availability besides, conducive weather condition to help them plan agriculture works and water resource management.This apart, the Centre would train young scientists from different disciplines of the university for follow up satellite data for integrated use of geospatial tools with crop models and in-situ observation network for timely crop production forecast, drought assessment and monitoring.Addressing the gathering, Governor and Chancellor of Universities SC Jamir said, agriculture has largely been seen as a development sector, for managing poverty, not for creating wealth. For agriculture to move away from being seen as just a billion mouths to feed, it must start modernising agriculture, from farm to the table and with supporting agro-industrial development, he said. Jamir also inaugurated a rooftop solar plant of 815 kw and a water harvesting system on the OUAT premises.Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout stressed upon using indigenous seed varieties and technologies for development of a sustainable agriculture system.Pasupalak informed that OUAT will soon set up Atal Incubation Centre to foster budding agri-entrepreneurs in the field of agriculture and allied areas and steps have also been initiated to establish community radio stations in each of the 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) of OUAT to disseminate real time information within 1,015 km radius. Besides, efforts are on to develop cold and weed resistance pulse varieties and the State Government has sanctioned `2.25 crore for research in this regard. Under the project, five different pulses including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvesting is completed. The university has also decided to increase number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts.On the occasion, the KVK at Gajapati was awarded as the best KVK and Laxmipriya Pradhan of KVK-Keonjhar was felicitated as the best extension scientist."

And while it is true that his festival, Ganesh Chaturthi, evolved as a metaphor for the abundance reaped from the land during the monsoon, today it is also a joyous occasion for families to bond over food and sweets.In talking about the culinary spread associated with the Chaturthi , two sweets - the modak and nevri - merit special mention. For one, they are traditionally not prepared during any other Hindu festival, and two, they have their unique mythological links. Of course, to say that nevreo are not prepared on other occasions is no longer completely true, for with improved economics people, nowadays, mark other festivals with nevreo, too.Modaks and nevreo are principally stuffed sweets and share common fillings, covers and methods of cooking, differing only in their shapes.The modak can be defined as a round dumpling with a tapered top, or, as writer and mythologist Devdutt Pattanaik writes in his book '99 Thoughts on Ganesha', ""It looks like a bag of money, similar to one carried by Kuber, treasurer of the gods."" Pattanaik adds that the sweet filling is to remind man that wealth has to bring happiness.Noted Goan folk researcher Jayanti Naik , points to the similarity in shape between the modak and a tufted coconut, which is a ritualistic male symbol.The reason why the modak is prepared only during Chaturthi is well-known. It is a great favourite of the elephant-headed god and it is compulsory to offer him as many as 21.While the nevri has a simple, half-moon shape, why it is synonymous with the festival is open to discussion.Naik alludes to the semi-circular shape of the sweet as being representative of the 'garbh' or womb, a subtle reference to the undertones of fertility rituals associated with the festival. ""Therefore, no matter how many nevreo you make at Chaturthi, you have to make at least one modak,"" she adds.Folklore researcher Pandurang Phaldesai says, ""Sweet preparations symbolise all that is good and prosperous, and what better way to celebrate than by fashioning sweets out of the indigenous ecological produce of the land?"" Which in this case comprises rice, wheat, coconut, jaggery, and a variety of grains.But, whether it is the nevri or the modak, the fillings reflect an amazing variety. To begin with, the ingredients used to make the shell will determine if the sweet will be steamed or fried. Rice makes for the former variety, while wheat is used for the latter. In an interesting twist, sometimes the covering is made from sweet potato.Coming to the ingredients, Prabha Pradeep Rege of Ponda , who prepares nevreos and modaks on pre-order basis for festivals, says, ""There is the principle base, sweetener and fillers that enhance taste. The favourite sweetener is jaggery, though sugar may also be used. The choice for the base can range from coconut (fresh and dry) to flour of various grams, and from evaporated milk solids (khava) to wheat flour. There is even a spicy variety, but it is not offered to god.""So if someone offers you a 'chunnache' nevri or modak you should know the stuffing comprises coconut and jaggery.

Can it help farmers to get bank loans, timely and correct insurance claims, may be even ensure a good MSP (minimum support price) for their crop?A handful of space entrepreneurs, aged around 30 or less, worked on it and created a map-based digital framework or dashboard over the last 18 months to show that it can.Abhishek Raju, SatSure Ltd.s directorAsia, and Prateep Basu, chief operating officer, who founded the company, say that by marrying satellite imagery-based information with ground data, they hope to improve the livelihood of farmers without directly working with them.By reducing the risks associated with Indias weather-based farming, their solution, they say, should make it easier for the farmer to earn more; and get agricultural credit and insurance and its settlement at the right time. In the bargain, the government spends less on insurance premium doles; and agriculture insurance companies make less payouts. And it can work as a scientific basis for fixing MSPs.Collating dataStarting in early 2016, a bunch from SatSure worked their home Internet over six months to pull data from Indian and European satellites and old imageries from the U.S. Landsat. They keyed in latitudes and longitudes of little known places across the country to stack them up with local socio-economic data. To this they added mandi-level commodity prices down to a piece of land, potential prices, and historical rates.SatSure, with its bases in London, Switzerland, and data centres in Dubai, now has a humungous 1.5 petabytes of data, says Mr. Basu. We are easily the first in India to do satellite data integration on a Hadoop-based system and large area analytics.Last year, they began their pilot over a total of 250 hectares in Andhra Pradeshs Srikakulam district. They randomly chose different crops grown on farmlands measuring 20 to 30 acres each. Different mixes of fertilizer and water were tried out. At the end of the 2016 seasons  the summer kharif and the winter rabi  they could predict crop yields that were 85 to 90% accurate. It is an ongoing work and this has been now fine-tuned to 95%. Conventional or manual estimates are said to be less than 80%, they say.Forecasting crop yieldsHow does an accurate forecast of crop yields help the farmer or anyone else? Mr. Raju points out that not just the farmer but every stakeholder needs to know in advance the fate of the crop sown: the bank that lends him money for seeds and materials; the government that pays crop insurance premiums and announces MSPs; and the insurance agency that must pay the farmer if his crop fails.In July, the Comptroller and Auditor General picked holes in the implementation of agricultural insurance scheme during 201116 and pointed out delays in settling 84.5 lakh claims amounting to Rs. 14,000 crore. It said farmers did not get the full benefit of the Rs. 36,000 crore-plus that the Union and State governments had given out towards crop insurance premium subsidies.SatSures Google Earth-like navigable online dashboard will be customised and offered to users such as district collectors or deputy commissioners, decision makers, crop insurance companies, banks, and large single farmers.The dashboard, they explain, becomes the decision makers tool for interpreting yields assessed a month ahead of harvest, crop health, acreage, and planning the commodity logistics. Next, we will be working with insurance agencies on how many and where to do crop cutting experiments, how banks can use the data to give credit worthiness scores to farmers.Mr. Raju notes that the new Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana wants agencies to use technologies such as satellite remote sensing, ICT, and mobile phones to read risks and settle farmers claims quickly.Today, the two say, next-gen children of farmers are aware, use smartphones and understand modern solutions to their problems.Apart from its Andhra Pradesh activity and working with private farms in Kolar and Mandya in Karnataka, SatSure is partnering a crop insurance project in Gujarat and also in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra."

We are historically wired to perceive the rich as oppressors and the poor as noble but wronged. We worship Shiva, whos the embodiment of austerity and renunciation. We revere Guru Nanak, who abhorred ostentatious display of religiosity and preferred the serenade of nature at the invisible altar of God over prayers performed in ornate temples with silver salvers and gold-decked deities. We claim to have descended from sages who proclaimed gnana (knowledge) was the only wealth that man should desire.And yet, we spend all our life struggling to get rich and, to help us along in our mission, flee from God to godmen. Even as we espouse the virtues of asceticism and simplicity, we abase ourselves at the feet of people who have nothing to do with those values. We turn a blind eye to our so-called spiritual guides cavalcade of fancy cars and shady business deals. We ignore tales of his opulent lifestyle and rumours of devious deeds behind closed doors. We explain away his humungous wealth as the generosity of his grateful devotees.We dont study if his conduct is in accord with his preaching. We overlook the fact that he demands our reverence even as he tells us to erase our egos. And when hes exposed for fraud or worse, we attribute it to a conspiracy by his enemies. We dont question whether the charges are genuine or not. Given the nature of faith, our unquestioning belief in our godman is perhaps understandable. What is incomprehensible is our reluctance to question our own motive for worshipping at his altar. After all, he didnt force us to go to him.We went there impressed by the stories of the miracles hes wrought, the empire hes built, and the VIPs who march to his tunes. Perhaps we went out of curiosity, but we stayed because of desperation or greed.Because however much we con ourselves, its not our spiritual journey that were there to enhance. Its a child we want, or a promotion at work.Sometimes, our motives are more sinister. We want to wreak damage on a colleague or a former spouse. Most of the time, were there for help with the deepest of our fearsthe fear of the future. We comfort ourselves with the thought that the godman will save us from any calamity that the unseen future might bring. The man hears us out, promises us a fix and we are hooked. We shut our ears to any possibility of doubt.We know, in our heart of hearts, that we alone are responsible for what we have done and what we will face in the future. The waves of life are bound to throw us this way and that. Its up to us to use our mind, body and spirit to stay on top. For strength, perhaps, we can fall back on the ways of our forefathers, and their emphasis on dhyana, or meditation.Dhyana means not anticipating or expecting anything. It is not an activity. It is waiting. Prayer means youre trying to talk to God. Meditation means youre waiting, willing to listen to him. Not your godman, but your God. Please appreciate the difference."

On April 13, 2016, the government set up a committee under Ashok Dalwai, then additional secretary in the Union ministry of agriculture, to prepare a report on DFI.In his Independence Day speech, the prime minister referred to farmers 12 times. He talked about several achievements in agriculture  providing soil health cards to nine crore farmers and the enhanced crop insurance scheme. He also mentioned that 99 projects under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayi Yojana will be completed by 2019, FDI in food processing will be encouraged, supply of inputs to farmers will be ensured and they will be assisted in marketing their produce. The PM concluded by saying, Together we will build such an India where the farmers can sleep without worry. In 2022, they will earn double of what they earn today.The first time the PM had shared his dream of doubling farmers income (DFI) was at a kisan rally in Bareilly on February 28, 2016. A day later, the finance minister talked about this goal in his budget speech. Thereafter, this goal attracted the attention of policymakers, economists and most importantly, farmers. Initially, it was not clear if the government intended to double the real income of farmers or their nominal income. It is now evident that the governments aim is to double the real income  recent reports of the Committee on Doubling Farmers Income spell out this goal.On April 13, 2016, the government set up a committee under Ashok Dalwai, then additional secretary in the Union ministry of agriculture, to prepare a report on DFI. The committee seems to have prepared a 14 volume report of which four volumes  718 pages in all  have been uploaded on the ministrys website as of August 14. The 14 volumes could have more than 2,000 pages in all, and more than 300 recommendations. It would be quite a test for the PM to read the entire report and make sense of it in order to initiate policy action. The report has information, which can be very useful for a Ph.D student, but it also has several inconsistencies that leave the reader confused, reminding one of Albert Einsteins famous quote If you cant explain it simply, you dont understand it well enough.The report pertains to three areas  productivity gains, reduction in cost of cultivation, and remunerative prices. Strategic framework has four concerns  sustainable agri-production, monetisation of farmers produce, re-strengthening extension services, and recognising agriculture as an enterprise. The report also uses an econometric model to work out the investment needed in agriculture, irrigation, rural roads, rural energy and rural development to attain 10.41 per cent annual growth in real incomes for DFI by 2022-23 over the base of 2015-16. The point to be noted is that farmers real incomes have increased by only 3.5 per cent per annum during 2002-03 to 2012-13.So, DFI means three times higher effort and resources. That means a humungous additional investment of about Rs 6,40,000 crore at 2011-12 prices. And this does not include investments in agri-logistics, cold chains, etc. Eighty per cent of this investment has to come from the government. The investments in and for agriculture need to rise by 22 per cent per annum in real terms if the dream of DFI is to be realised.So, DFI means three times higher effort and resources.

The investments in and for agriculture need to rise by 22 per cent per annum in real terms if the dream of DFI is to be realised.But the report is totally silent on how, and from where, these resources will be generated. In a climate of loan waivers, subsidies, and welfare programmes (see Graph 1) that dominate the budget, the likely reality is that investments are going to shrink further.But even if one makes the assumption that this humongous investment will somehow be made, there are two questions that beg for answers. How much will agri-production increase as a result of this investment? Where will that increased production be absorbed? We have seen that when production increases somewhat significantly, prices crash  this year in several states, prices of onions, potatoes, pulses and oilseeds crashed when production increased. If domestic consumption cant absorb increased outputs, can we export competitively in global markets? The report does not answer any of these fundamental questions. Instead, we have a laundry list of hundreds of recommendations, ranging from implementation of the Agriculture Produce and Livestock Marketing, (Promotion and Facilitation) Act to e-NAM to negotiable warehouse system to price deficiency payments to re-organising KVKs and setting up a secretariat for DFI.The report does not answer any of these fundamental questions. Instead, we have a laundry list of hundreds of recommendations, ranging from implementation of the Agriculture Produce and Livestock Marketing, (Promotion and Facilitation) Act to e-NAM to negotiable warehouse system to price deficiency payments to re-organising KVKs and setting up a secretariat for DFI.Does it then mean that DFI will remain a pipe dream by 2022? Most likely, though not necessarily. In order to take this dream closer to reality, one may look at the Chinese experience during 1978-84, when the country doubled farmers real incomes in six years and reduced poverty by half (India took 18 years, from 1993 to 2011, to cut poverty by half). China focused primarily on incentives for farmers by moving from the commune system to the household responsibility system in land, and ensured higher prices for farmers. Chinese prices for farmers are way above that in India. To cite one example, Chinas MSP for wheat in 2014-15 was $ 385 per tonne against Indias $ 226 per tonne. Similar differences exist for other crops (see Graph 2). This was on top of $ 22 billion of input subsidies.The upshot of this example is that India needs to focus on incentives for farmers. Unfortunately, our policy is biased in favour of the consumers and that inadvertently makes it anti-farmer. The Narendra Modi government can address that issue by using an income policy to protect the poor, and free up prices for farmers, allow private trade to stock and operate freely and have unhindered exports. India can, then, raise farmers incomes significantly, if not double them by 2022.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

As a result, the vast cultivation area of the premium Sona Masuri rice brand here has remained unsown.The water crisis, affecting around 20 lakh farmers and labourers in the command area, is likely to trigger a migration. There are also fears it could lead to a serious shortage of this high-quality rice in the market.Consumers in Karnataka, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and other parts of the country, as well as those in Singapore, Dubai and Sri Lanka, are likely to be hit as the rice variety grown in the Tungabhadra belt is of high quality and is sought after.At present, the reservoir has 57 tmcft of water, against its capacity of 133 tmcft. This includes 32 tmcft of slit accumulated over the past 50 years. Considering the evaporation losses, drinking water requirements, and the share of undivided Andhra Pradesh, hardly 35 tmcft of water will be left in the reservoir for the States irrigation. Given the poor inflow, the reservoir cannot meet the demand of 80 tmcft for taking up paddy cultivation on around 6 lakh acres spread over three districts  Ballari, Koppal and Raichur.Water releaseAccording to sources in the Department of Water Resources, water will be released into the canals in the first week of September for farmers to cultivate rabi crops such as chickpea, green gram, sunflower and sorghum, which require relatively less water. The Tungabhadra Irrigation Consultative Committee (TICC) is scheduled to meet in Bengaluru on Tuesday to finalise the schedule and amount of water to be released from the reservoir.In 2016-17, which witnessed the lowest inflow, water was provided with difficulty for kharif crops. Paddy growers then managed to scrape through before the closure of canals, but cotton and chilli growers suffered Going by that experience and the reduced inflow to the dam in August, farmers are not taking any risks. Meanwhile, the TICC has been very cautious in releasing water into the canals as top priority is being given to overcoming the looming drinking water crisis.Furthermore, farmers who have grown paddy plants for the purpose of selling them to other farmers for transplantation are feeling the heat as their saplings are growing old in nursery beds with no buyers."

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Aug. 27: The Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) will promote and support production of nutrition-rich crops in seven districts to check problem of malnutrition in the state. ""Malnutrition rate is high among kids and health status of women in our state is also poor. We have selected seven districts that are most affected where we would promote cultivation of nutrition-rich crop varieties such as green crops, pulses, millets, leafy vegetables and so on,"" said vice-chancellor Surendra Nath Pasupalak told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the OUAT foundation day event. The seven districts identified are Boudh, Kandhamal, Koraput, Rayagada, Gajapati, Nuapada and Jajpur. The varsity has partnered with voluntary organisations, which will monitor the improvement in health indicators after one year. According to sources, 34 per cent of the total children below five years age in the state are underweight. The varsity has also decided to expand its research across the state. The research will be done in districts to provide quality seeds of pulses, paddy, maize and wheat to the farmers. ""The aim is to double the farmers' income in the state by 2022,"" said Pasupalak. The varsity is working on developing cold and weed resistance pulse varieties. Under the project, five varieties, including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans, will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest is done. ""By doing the dual crop of both paddy and pulses, the farmers' income will be increased substantially,"" he said. The government has sanctioned Rs 2.25 crore for research on developing new varieties of pulses. The OUAT has decided to increase the number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts where the varsity will provide technological inputs and support to the farmers to grow quality pulses seeds. The varsity will buy these seeds to distribute among farmers. ""We are also working on developing a high-yield variety of aromatic rice with the use of genomics,"" he said."

However, from June-end, there was a pause with scanty rainfall in some pockets.After a prolonged dry spell from June to mid-August, the district received 113 mm of rainfall as against normal rainfall of 146 mm in the last week of August.The rainfall recorded by Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Centre (KSNDMC) shows that farmers in 29 of the 32 hoblis in Kalaburagi district have deficit rain up to 57% , while three hoblis including Afzalpur, Aland and Madana hipparaga received 114 mm, 152 mm and 159mm against the normal rainfall of 104mm, 142mm and 137 mm respectively.Buoyed by early monsoon this year, most farmers have switched over to short-duration crops. Black gram has been sown in 41,974 hectares against the targeted area of 25,000 hectares and similarly the area of green gram also increased to 53,874 hectares against the targeted area of 35,100 hectares.Till the end of July, farmers had completed sowing red gram in more than 3.22 lakh hectares of land, and owing to the good rain in August and revival of sowing in a few pockets of the districts, the sowing of red gram is expected to be completed in at least 3.65 lakh hectares this year.State president of the Karnataka Pranta Raitha Sangha Maruti Manpade said that rain recorded during the end of August would only help the long-term crops such as red gram and jowar.Around 40% of the short-duration standing crop withered due to want of water during July. Though farmers somehow managed to save their crop, the incessant rain that lashed for the last one week has affected harvesting, Mr. Manpade said.He added that because of an unusual long gap in rains even red gram crop is showing stunted growth.Veerabharappa Patil, a farmer from Sindagi village on the outskirts of Kalaburagi had sown green gram in two acres of land but he had suffered losses due to lack of rain, however the marginal farmer said that he depends on vegetable crops cultivated on four acres of land.Similarly, the harvesting of green gram and black gram cultivated in 6 acres of land by Mallikarjun Kalshetty in Chittapur taluk came to halt due to rains as farmer fear further damage to their already spoiled crop."

A complaint against the hotel managers and staff has been filed by eight people of North-Eastern origin residing in the city. Members of North-eastern diaspora, who took the victim to the hospital, claim that Paukanmung was assaulted for just questioning the manager. Paukanmung had questioned why he was fined for smoking a cigarette, resulting in the assault, they claimed. The hotels representative, however, stated that Paukanmung was assaulted by his friend -- also a staffer at the hotel -- and both were in an inebriated condition. A case has also been filed by the hotel accusing Paukanmung of assaulting the operations manager Loknath.As per the complaint, on Sunday night, the victim, who is part of the cleaning staff, was accused by other staffers of molesting a female operations manager and they later assaulted him. Due to the injuries, he was unable to work on Monday.On Monday night, when Paukanmug went to the hotel to have his dinner, he was again beaten by about five staffers around 9 pm, led by Operations Manager Loknath and Branch Manager Sameer, the complaint says. Cricket stumps were reportedly used to beat him. The managers then threatened other staffers hailing from the North-East not to inform anyone about the incident.Caroline Touthang, a representative of the North-Eastern diaspora in Bengaluru, was alerted about the incident and reached Jayanagar police station at 2 am on Tuesday with about 25 more people, all of North-Eastern origin. Touthang said they were allowed to see the victim at 3.30 am in a building next to Hotel Empire. They first took him to Garden City Hospital and then to Hosmat Hospital.Touthang claimed that the assault was a case of racial discrimination. She added, Eight other employees of the hotel from North East did not go to work on Tuesday, and no one from the hotel called them to check.Rini Ralte, a member of the Facebook group Northeast Solidarity, has stated in a post, He got 3 main injuries-one at his mouth, teeth, his left hand and the other was in his left ankle where he could not even stand and the pain was severe (sic). Raltes post also claims that Mung wasnt under the influence of alcohol during the time of the incident.Firdos Khan, the administrative head of Empire Hotels, dismissed the allegations of assault. He said Paukanmung and his friend were in a very inebriated condition and quarrelled among themselves as well as with other staff members. When our operations manager went to resolve the issue, the two assaulted him. They were uncontrollable. We then filed a complaint with the police.A police official said at least three people, including Loknath and Inam, a waiter, had been arrested and others were being identified. The official said a counter-case had also been filed by Loknath against Paukanmung, stating that he had been assaulted by Paukanmung. The case is under investigation.

Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession. More than just pleasing peoples taste buds, its about winning their hearts.Machha BesaraIngredientsFish: Rohu or cat fishOnion: 1 big, slicedTomatoes: 2, dicedPotatoes: 1 sliced (optional)Mustard seeds: 50 gm soaked in water for 2-3 hrsGarlic: 3 clovesGinger: 1 inchRed chilli powder: 1 tspTurmeric powder: 1/2 tspSalt to tasteWater: 1.5 cupsOil: around 10 tbspDried mango (Ambula),Curd (1/4 cup)Coriander leavesOnions: 2, chopped1 tbsp cumin-coriander powder1 tsp turmeric powder1 tsp garam masala2-3 bay leaves3-4 tbsp mustard oil1 tsp panch phutana (mix of cumin+mustard+nigella+saunf+fenugreek seeds)MethodGrind mustard seeds, ginger and garlic together to a fine paste.Wash the fish and marinate for 10 mins with 1/2 tsp chilli, pinch of turmeric and pinch of salt.In a frying pan on medium heat, put 3 tbsp of oil and fry the fish until brown on each side.

According to sources, a total of 3.58 lakh quintals of moong dal and 29,300 quintals of urad dal were procured for around Rs 197 crore in the entire district. It has come to light that in Khirkia tehsil, more than 50 farmers sold 'moong' twice or thrice at the same mandi and a probe was ordered by the district administration.The procurement rules say that an agreement needs to be signed with farmers, based on the sown area of pulses. In this case, though the agreement was with just one farmer, many sold moong and urad on the same agreement, say sources.""It has been found in the probe that in five mandis of the district, a total of 796 farmers are those who have sold 'moong' more than once. Moong worth Rs 8.61 crore was procured from these farmers in multiple buys. Similarly in one 'mandi' it has been found that 82 farmers sold urad more than once. Urad worth Rs 77 lakh was purchased from these farmers through multiple buys. We have the documents and the report will be sent to government for further action,"" Harda collector Anay Dwivedi told TOI.An official in the know of things said that this is a clear-cut fraud, and it shows that the pulses of traders were purchased in the name of farmers. These figures only constitute a minor part of the total scam because there is no government record of the total area of cultivation of 'moong' when the purchase started and it is herculean task for the administration to verify whether the farmer who had sold, had actually cultivated 'moong' or not, said the official."
5a1095ed9855b76bf13d90fd,A meal in the name of lord Anant,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/a-meal-in-the-name-of-lord-anant/articleshow/60346863.cms,2017-09-03,"PANAJI: The close of Ganesh Chaturthi (10 days later) heralds another religious festival - Anant Chaturdashi. Celebrated in honour of Lord Vishnu, it is another occasion for friends and family to share a traditional meal.Taking this tradition to even greater lengths, the landmark 350-year-old Mhamai Kamat house near the old secretariat, Panaji, throws open its doors to over a 1,000 visitors, of every faith.More popularly known as the 'Kongyachem Fest' (for the presence of a unique right-sided conch decorated with precious ornaments in the house), people throng to 'Casa de Camotims Mhamai' not only to witness newborn children being offered in a 'pudve' as thanksgiving to God at the matoli, but to indulge in a traditional 'Mahanaivedya' Saraswat meal on that day, which falls on September 5 this year.""Though the house is over three centuries-old, the Mhamai Kamats have been celebrating Anant Chaturdashi for just 150 years. The Mhamai Kamats consist of 10 families, which are spread out, but congregate here for this festival. During the Portuguese era, the Portuguese governor would always visit us on this day. Previously, invites would go out to people, but in the last 10 years we have stopped issuing printed invites. Instead we put a small advertisement in the paper,"" says ex-director of archives and archeology S K Mhamai.Meals, which are prepared from over 14 traditional vegetables, ranging from 'khatkhatem' to 'moongagatti' and the sweet 'payasam', are cooked by chefs brought all the way from Karnataka. ""These are mostly Saraswat cooks known to us. Meals are cooked in separate, large, copper utensils, maintained by us especially for religious functions, on wood fire. On this day, additional 'chulas' are set up in the spacious family kitchen to prepare meals for the large crowd. One important aspect of preparation is that no onion or garlic (which we consider non-vegetarian) is added to the food. It is a pure Saraswat preparation. Also, as a matter of tradition, we do not take any outside donations of food or otherwise,"" says Mhamai.To prepare for the big day, women of the family, including a large group of maids, clean and dice the vegetables. Cooking commences at noon. Every preparation is then offered to the deity as 'naivedya'.In a deviation from regular practice, on Anant Chaturdashi, no lunch is served to the public at the Mhamai Kamat house. Rather, a large spread is prepared for the evening. For the first batch of people who arrive at around 5pm, servings are on traditional banana leaves on the floor. After this initial serving, a buffet is laid out. Stainless steel plates are specially rented for the occasion.""The house is packed to capacity and queues stretch right outside as well. But no one is ever turned back without a meal. Our door is never locked,"" says Mhamai. ""The cooks are constantly replenishing the food. From the richest to the poorest, everybody partakes of a meal. Serving generally goes on till 12 midnight.""The buffet is a recent development in the last four years due to the paucity of space and helping hands. The most interesting aspect of this occasion is that not only people of different faiths enjoy a meal with us, but they come from as far as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune. Throughout the night there are 'bhajans' and prayers offered till 'utar' puja the next day.""Close to the heritage precincts in Mala , the ancestral Mahale house has been observing a similar tradition for over 80 years. ""We have thousands of visitors,"" says Raghuvir Mahale. ""We start at 6am, when people bring offerings of milk, fruit and the like, and puja commences at 8am. Lunch is generally served in a buffet at around 1.30pm or so and goes on till 3-4pm. With the exception of the 'bhats', who are served on traditional banana leaves on the floor in front of the deity, the others eat at the buffet under a pandal outside the house. This is also an occasion to cook traditional vegetables like 'aluchi bhaji' which is a rarity these days.""We, however, do not cook mushroom as it is sometimes considered non-vegetarian. We also do not use onion or garlic in our cooking,"" says Mahale, who believes that such occasions are an opportunity for members of the various faiths that visit to witness the unique tradition of Anant Chaturdashi at both these houses."

The agriculture department has recommended suspension of nine officials of Narsinghpur district in the wake of irregularities in moong and tur procurement.Oders have been issued to file an FIR against the accused after investigations in the ghost procurement. Talking to TOI, principal secretary of agriculture department, Rajesh Rajora, said, ""A recommendation to suspend nine officials, including the district marketing officer, and manager of mandi samiti, has been sent to the state government. We have also asked Markfed to provide us with a copy of the verification report of farmers who have sold more than 30 quintals of pulses.""Managing director of Markfed, Dhyaneshwar Patil, has issued fresh instructions to all district officials to register FIRs in case of any fraudulent procurement. ""The Harda collector has been asked to withhold payments made to people who have sold dal multiple times. He has been asked to probe the issue and register an FIR against the accused. Similar instructions have also been given to all district officials to register FIRs in case of any irregularity,"" he said.On Sunday, TOI had reported how an RTI reply showed that the amount of moong procured in the aftermath of the violent farmer agitation is more than the entire quantity produced in the last five years and nearly 300% of this year's produce. The state government spent Rs 1,200 crore on procuring 2.42 lakh metric tonne moong but the maths didn't add up  the total of five years of moong crop is 2.41 lakh metric tonne. What's more, only around 40% of farmers who sold over 30 quintals of moong each were verified as moong growers. TOI had reported an exclusive on how three times as much dal was procured in Tendukheda tehsil of Narsingpur district, and the same trend was seen in Harda."
5b2e7f569855b72640115f40,Support the village teacher,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/631622/support-village-teacher.html,2017-09-07,"Between March and July, I visited around 30 primary schools in Yadgir district of north-east Karnataka, spread across three visits of four days each. While a scorching sun was my companion in March, it rained through the week I was there in July and fields of paddy and hesaru bele (green gram), swayed in the monsoon breeze. The Krishna canal is the lifeline for some areas of Yadgir, thanks to which it is better off than some of the other districts in the region.Each of these visits followed the same pattern. Every day, I would visit three schools in some of Karnatakas most disadvantaged villages. The lower primary schools were invariably run by two teachers (there were single teacher schools, too). The upper primary schools had better infrastructure but not all had adequate teachers.At the end of each day, as I transcribed from my handwritten notes, I had to relive the time I spent in the school, the conversations with the teacher and the children. I marvelled at the indomitable spirit of the teachers and my notes seemed to take a life of their own.None of the teachers I met have a great academic record. In India, people with very good scholastic achievements do not opt for the teaching profession. The teachers may be ordinarily endowed, but in the schools that the government has established in virtually every village of the country, it is this ordinary school teacher who is the sentinel. When one considers the context and challenges of their work, the several difficulties that they face every day, one realises that the ordinary school teacher is doing extraordinary work.We do not see the majority of teachers travel long distances by the only bus available to reach the village school in time. We do not see the lady teacher spend nearly 10% of her salary on autorickshaw rides because the village is miles from the main road. We do not recognise her agility as she runs from one classroom to another to manage classes 1, 2 and 3 while children of classes 4 and 5 are provided tasks that can be attempted by them without supervision.We forget that many children come to school on empty stomachs and go back to homes where there is not a single reading material. Nor do we realise that the report card prepared by the teacher for the parents perusal is acknowledged with a barely literate scrawl. We do not realise that for many teachers, visiting the homes of the children to ensure parents send them to school is a part of their routine  not prescribed in their service rules but an unspoken covenant among village school teachers of India.I met teachers who, after their school hours, voluntarily attended forums that have been formed to discuss academic and pedagogic issues. I met teachers who willingly spent money from their own resources to procure teaching and learning materials or to accompany their children to the district headquarters for scholastic and sports competitions. I met teachers who spend from their pocket to prepare the children for admission to Morarji Residential Schools. Some had acquired further educational qualifications through correspondence courses.What I saw every day of my visit was the uphill lonely battle waged by the government school teacher. It need not be so; the teachers need not struggle in solitary desolation if the system  represented by their supervisors  could be empathetic, instead of being apathetic. These teachers desperately need more colleagues to manage the school so that the teaching and attention to childrens learning can be better. Instead, they have to plead long and hard for an extra teacher.Finally, when a guest teacher is provided, it is as though the administration has done them a personal favour. In most villages, the head-teachers have to constantly get disparate community elements to come together and make common cause for their school.Bogged down by pressureAre the functionaries in a position to help the head-teachers in these stressful situations? Good schools are often the result of a dynamic head-teachers leadership. When that leader is transferred and a less effective person steps in, does the supervisor guide and enable the new person to ensure that the school quality does not slip? I could go on.The cold fact is that most functionaries are unable to perform these critical tasks as they themselves are subject to various pulls and pressures. The hierarchical system and ever-present political pressures suffocate even the sincere, talented and well-meaning functionaries and deflect them from their prime objective of providing the best support to teachers and schools.In saying this, one does not forget that there are exemplary functionaries, who have the courage to resist all such pressures and focus on their primary tasks. I have had occasion to write of the splendid Block Education Officers of Kudligi, Hagaribommanahalli and other blocks. Sadly, they are exceptions.But let me end on a note of hope, based on a development that happened in late July. First came the news on 17 July that 251 education officials had been transferred in Karnataka, with one newspaper saying that the move was an attempt to eliminate corruption Sure enough, there were strong representations from various powerful quarters to withdraw the order.But on July 26 came confirmation that the move was indeed being implemented. It was an announcement that would have brought cheer to every conscientious teacher and education functionary in Karnataka. The functionaries, one believes, would be empowered by this determined move to resist the inevitable pulls and pressures and focus their efforts on supporting their schools.Finally, while this story may be about heroic teachers and the apathy in the system, it is also about how bold, progressive initiatives can be implemented when there is alignment at multiple levels of the system, including the top bureaucracy and the relevant political levels.(The writer is Chief Operating Officer, Azim Premji University)"

As per G.O. 16 issued in 2000, it is mandatory to obtain a degree from a college recognised by the ICAR.Addressing a press conference at the Secretariat on Wednesday, Agriculture Minister Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy said the government cancelled the G.O. following requests from the student community.Following this, students from 11 agriculture colleges in the State agreed to drop the strike plan. The G.O. 16 would be in vogue as usual, the Minister said.Kharif operationsReferring to kharif sowing, the Minister said that groundnut farmers could not take up agricultural operations in 4 lakh hectares as there were no rains in time.The government, as an alternative, provided 1.50 lakh quintals of horsegram, green gram, black gram, and pearl millet seeds with 100% subsidy to the farmers.While the average cultivation was 33.38 lakh hectares in the State, the farmers had taken up operations in 31.26 lakh hectares. The government so far issued 54 lakh soil testing cards to the farmers, he said.Mr. Chandramohan Reddy said that as many as 2,000 farmers incurred loss due to mistake of the bankers in Pulivendula. The government would take steps to extend the rythu upasamanam scheme to them. As many as 11,000 tractors would be distributed among the farmers under the rythu ratham scheme before this month-end. The government planned to distribute the tractors next year also, he said.Pawan thanks CMMeanwhile, Jana Sena Party (JSP) president and actor Pawan Kalyan thanked Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu and Mr. Chandramohan Reddy for cancelling the G.O. 64 and described it as a great relief for the students.He tweeted that it had been a long-pending issue and called upon the students to stand by the farmers who were in a state of desolation. The students of Acharya N.G. Ranga Agricultural University (ANGRAU) had been alleging that while the Agriculture Department was recruiting graduates who did not study in colleges accredited by the ICAR, the impugned G.O. sought to regularise the anomaly. The students recently met Mr. Kalyan and sought his support."

5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."

""The department has not listened to our complaints for the past 17 years. So far the department has provided employment to 197 people who are the kin of the deceased employees, while 40 are denied employment citing a government order, dated January 11, 1999, which prohibits the department from employing them,"" said a statement made by the association. Speaking to reporters at the Manipur Press Club here today, the president of the employees' association, S. Samungou said, ""Some are given suitable employment while some are not. This is not acceptable. The 1999 order says if there is superannuation or termination of services of the employees the post should be abolished. But it does not mention that employment cannot be provided under die-in-harness scheme. The PHE department should properly understand what the 1999 order says."" ""Those who are demanding employment under the scheme were among those employees who were regularised in 1999. Why is the department providing employment to only a few?"" asked Samongou. ""The department requires 3,550 employees. However there are only 2,379 employees in the department. The government should recommend the employment of the required manpower as per the Essential Service Maintenance Act, 1984,"" Samungou added. Samungou also pointed out that there is no safe drinking water in the state. He said the Melakhong Maril water supply is providing contaminated water. ""Water which is drained out from the paddy fields is pumped into in the storage tank. One can imagine the presence of insecticides, pesticides and chemical fertilisers that are used in paddy fields, and the water that is drained out from such fields is used as drinking water,"" Samungou said. He said one could see leaked water supply at many places. ""This is another failure of the department and is a sign of having less manpower in the department,"" Samungou added. He said water supply is maintained by the village committees. ""How can the village committee work for water supply? It can be done only by the officials of the department. If there is shortage of staff the department should recruit the kin of the deceased employees,"" Samungou said."
5a10fbb29855b76bf13db57c,From forest to runway,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/from-forest-to-runway/article19674546.ece,2017-09-13,"For centuries, the forests have fed the ancestors of weavers Gorre Shankaraiah (48) and his elder brother Gorre Bapu (56). Until recently, members of the family (which resides in Mahadevpur, Telangana), would head to the Kawal forest (in Adilabad) to pick discarded cocoons fallen on the forest floor.Now, the Gorre brothers source the raw material from societies who mostly buy them from Kolam tribals. Though covered with twigs and dirt, the tribals keen eyes spot the oblong, beige cocoons with an exit hole  the moths have taken flight.Unlike regular pure silk, where live cocoons are boiled to extract pure tussar, Madhepur gicha tussar is made with double spun strands from empty cocoons, which are then stuck together to create strong silk yarn. The resulting material has a slubby texture and a natural sheen.The silk routeCut to Lakm Fashion Week Winter/Festive 2017 last month. For Hyderabad-based designer Divya Reddys collection, Sage, actor and showstopper Taapsee Pannu wore a floor-length, long-sleeved, intricately embellished pure Madhepur pink tussar jacket over a sheer embroidered piece and a pair of gicha trousers.Reddy was introduced to this tussar almost 16 years ago, when she wore her mother Vanaja Reddy Sallas sari. It was beige with a black border. This tussar is an any-weather fabric; it keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summer, says the 32-year-old.Reddys love for handloom grew under Sallas tutelage (who worked with weavers to design saris for personal use), and she started working with Madhepur tussar in 2016. For the LFW Spring Summer line this year, she also experimented with konda patti (wild mountain cotton), sourced from the jungles of Adilabad.Reddy returned home just to work with the Gorre brothers, who had resisted quitting the trade and migrating. Once a village of 40 looms, it had been reduced to nought as they had no finances to source cocoons, weave and wait for money to come in. So they had started gathering cocoons for sale.Today, after tying up with Reddy, you can hear the clackling of 25 looms in the village. Many weavers have turned farm hands, helping raise jowar , chilli and moong . But their hands are meant to weave, just like our ancestors did. The right pricing and government support is all we need, says Shankaraiah.Natural huesMeanwhile, Reddy says a few belts of untouched forests still exist in Telangana. Care is taken to ensure that only whats on the floor is collected, says the designer, who has also tied up with 25 families in the area to raise konda patti cotton on arid land. Its advantageous because it has been weathered by the sun and rain. It doesnt need treatment and lasts longer,  she adds.Usually, both the cotton and silk are used in their natural shades  beige for silk and off-white for cotton. Of late, weve worked to create natural dyes using vegetables, fruits, seeds, barks, medicinal herbs, and even a blue-coloured root, she says. But Shankaraiah loves the natural colour of tussar best. It has a shine that you have to see to believe, he shares.People powerThe designer, who has seen people specifically asking for Madhepur tussar and konda patti cotton, says the goal is to make them popular enough to get at least 500 cotton farmers and weavers to resume the work and sustain it, whether or not a designer backs them.She has found support from the Telangana Government in her attempt to aid reverse migration. But the biggest boost, she states, is when weavers see their creations on the ramp. When Shankaraiah saw what Taapsee wore, he said if they could get support, he would get all his cousins back to weaving, she says.Reddy is now working on a dailywear collection for Design One, to be held in Mumbai on September 21 and 22. In the Rs. 8,000 to Rs. 25,000 range, will feature both Madhepur tussar andkonda patticotton, she concludes.Details: divya@divyareddydesign.inMadhepur tussar is an any-weather fabric; it keeps you warm in the winter and cool in the summerdivya reddy"

He said the standing rate for compensation is Rs13,500 per hectare in the irrigated land for such crops as paddy, maize and vegetables and Rs6,800 per hectare for crops like arhar, urad, mung and madua sowed on non-irrigated land. Besides, the compensation of Rs18,000 per hectare is payable for yearly cash crops like mango, guava, lychee, bananas and sugar cane.

It will be paid to the farmers concerned through direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode,"" Sudhir said.The minister also said the state government has prepared a project for the reclamation and transformation of agriculture land that had been destroyed by sand deposits on them, mainly in Supaul and Araria districts during the 2008 Kosi flood disaster. The floods had otherwise hit four other districts. On the agriculture land in the core Supaul and Araria districts, four to six feet of sand deposits had been caused by the flood that occurred due to breach in eastern Kosi efflux bund in 2008.""The purpose of the project is to remove the sand deposits and reclaim the land concerned for agriculture purposes,"" Prem said, adding that the agriculture department has prepared the project with World Bank aid worth Rs306 crore. He also said the floods this year caused similar problems in Kishanganj and Purnia districts. The agriculture department will send a team of officials to study the depth and extent of sand deposits in the two districts. ""The project will be implemented in the four districts of Supaul, Araria, Kishanganj and Purnia,"" he said.The minister said the floods this year damaged crops in 8.10 lakh hectares of land.

Sen, who has been with the RSS-BJP parivar since the age of seven, and his mother Monika greeted Shah with a fairly elaborate vegetarian Bengali spread. Shah  who had lunch sitting cross-legged on the floor  had gobindobhog rice, ruti, shukto and moong dal among others. It was a dream come true. This is the happiest and the proudest moment of my life, said Sen.Picture by Sanat Kumar SinhaCalcutta, Sept. 13: An interactive session with BJP president Amit Shah convened by the Merchants' Chamber of Commerce & Industry and scheduled to take place this afternoon was called off amid questions on reasons for the cancellation. Leaders of the state unit of the BJP started talking about the possibility of the event's cancellation from yesterday afternoon, while the official communication was sent out last evening. ""Amitji had to go to Delhi urgently because of something urgent, something unforeseen. That is why the chamber event had to be cancelled,"" said state general secretary Sayantan Basu. Even as the party claimed that the meeting was cancelled because of Shah's engagements in Delhi, several theories regarding the cancellation of the meeting floated in the business circles in Calcutta. ""The BJP president was unhappy that prominent industrialists in Bengal wouldn't attend today's session and that's why it was cancelled,"" said the head of a leading chamber in the city. According to him, the profile of the audience came up for discussion on Monday evening, when Shah was checking the programmes he was supposed to attend on the final day of his trip to Bengal. ""Shah wanted to know who all would attend the programme. He was told that the bigger names belonged to bigger chambers,"" he added. Sources said Shah was ""displeased"" when he learnt that even a senior office-bearer of the MCC was also out of town. Sources said although the MCC had invited prominent captains of industry in Calcutta, many of them opted out fearing a backlash from the state government. ""Apparently, some senior government officials had started enquiring about who all would be attending the meeting and that resulted in some pressing the panic button,"" said a source. Besides, sources said state BJP president Dilip Ghosh had originally convinced Shah to attend the session and the anti-Ghosh lobby in the state unit advised the national president to give it a miss because the big guns of Calcutta Inc. would be absent. Although the session was called off, not everyone got the message in time. At least one industrialist found out about the cancellation when he reached the venue, a five-star hotel in central Calcutta, today. Demand for passes were high for today's session, especially from the small and medium business segments. While the BJP has traditionally been regarded as a party that has a huge support base among people from the world of business and industry, in Bengal, the most prominent businessmen have stood with Mamata Banerjee and the ruling Trinamul Congress. ""We could not have afforded a meeting between our national president and people who did not fit the profile parameters. That is why the meeting was cancelled,"" said a state BJP functionary. Shah had, on August 13, 2015, participated in an event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce here, although many movers and shakers from the city had been absent. Last night, after the cancellation of the meeting was made public, the BJP tried to arrange at least 10 prominent business faces from the city to meet Shah this morning. Accordingly, at least four industrialists visited Shah at the Calcutta Port Trust guesthouse between 11am and midday. Those who met him included Mahendra Jalan and his son Mayank of Keventer Agro, Gaurav Swarup of Paharpur Cooling Towers and Sajjan Bhajanka of Century Plyboards."

The government made the waiver announcement late on Wednesday night after reaching an agreement with farmers who had been agitating since September 1.As per the agreement, farm loans up to Rs 50,000 would be written off, putting an additional burden of about Rs 20,000 crore on the Vasundhara Raje government. The loan waiver announced by UP chief minister Yogi Aditya Nath and his Maharashtra counterpart, Devendra Fadnavis, had cost the two state governments Rs 36,000 crore and Rs 34,000 crore, respectively.""On farmers' demand to waive loans up to Rs 50,000, a high-level technical committee would be constituted to study procedures adopted by different states, like UP, Maharashtra, Punjab, Kerala,"" state agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini said. The committee would submit its report in a month. Kisan Mahasabha , an affiliate of the CPM which led the farmer protests in 14 districts of the state, including Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Bikaner, announced on Thursday that it had withdrawn the agitation.Besides a full loan waiver, the other demands of farmers included minimum support price for crops, lifting the ban on cattle trade and protection for cattle traders, finding a solution to the menace of abandoned animals, free electricity for agriculture and pension for farmers.Saini said a ministerial committee would meet on Saturday and decide on the demand that the minimum age for sale of calves be reduced from four years to two years. He said the government has also issued notification for a bonus of Rs 200 for four crops  soybean, groundnut, moong and urad  besides agreeing to the demand for increasing the minimum support price.However, there is confusion over some demands. While Kisan Mahasabha president and former CPM MLA Amra Ram claimed the government had agreed for a kisan pension scheme of Rs 2,000 to farmers who were more than 60 years old, government sources said there was no such agreement."

He directed the agriculture department to bridge this gap. He also asked the department to create organic corridors on both banks of the Ganga to promote vegetable cultivation without the use of inorganic fertilisers. Farmers in Bihar need altogether 15 lakh quintals or 15 crore kg of seeds to sow different crops across the year. But seed production in the state is currently limited to 5 lakh quintals or 5 crore kg. This leaves them at the mercy of private companies that sell seeds at exorbitant prices and unscrupulous retailers who pass off poor quality seeds to them. ""The huge gap should be bridged by strengthening the Bihar State Seed Corporation (BSSC), establishing modern processing units and improving the quality of seeds processed by BSSC so that farmers prefer to buy them,"" Nitish said. ""Expert help should be taken as soon as possible for this."" He also directed agriculture department officials to arrange for storage of seeds in controlled temperature and moisture so that they remain safe for two or more years. Nitish was speaking while watching a detailed presentation of the agriculture road map for 2017-18 to 2021-22 at a closed-door meeting at which senior ministers and officials were present. The road map is in the last stages of preparation, and suggestions given at today's meeting will be incorporated in it. The chief minister pointed out to officials that moong (a legume variety mostly eaten as daal) is produced in large quantities in the Kosi division comprising of Supaul, Madhepura, Saharsa districts and asked them to give priority to moong under Mukhyamantri Tivra Beej Vistar Yojana - a seed extension plan, attach these districts and ensure seed production of this variety of legumes. Nitish had given Bihar its first agriculture road map in 2008, which was for around four years, ending in 2012. A second one, 2012-2017, replaced the road map and the one ""under preparation"" now will be the third one for the state. Famous agriculture scientist and former agricultural adviser to the chief minister, Mangla Rai, suggested making a ""vehicle-based"" plan for seed replacement in the hinterland. Under this plan, vehicles will roam across villages providing better seeds to the farmers. Talking about organic corridors along the Ganga, agriculture department principal secretary Sudhir Kumar told The Telegraph: ""Organic corridors will be created on both banks of the Ganga from Patna to Bhagalpur. We will include vegetable producing villages under them and leave out grain-producing ones. The state government will do the organic certification of the farming and products."" Sudhir said the chief minister will launch the ""organic corridor"" scheme in October-end. At the meeting, Nitish asked the agriculture department to attach the ""centre of excellence for vegetables"" at Chandi in Nalanda district with the horticulture college at Noorsarai. Similarly, he gave directions to attach the ""centre of excellence for fruits"" established at Desri in Vaishali district with the nearest Krishi Vigyan Kendra. He said that agriculture, urban development and housing, water resources and minor water resources departments should coordinate to use treated sewage water for irrigation. Officials said the chief minister directed them to formulate plans to promote cultivation of makhana (fox nut) in Darbhanga, parval (pointed gourd) in Patna and betel leaves in Nalanda, and promote the farming of local varieties of papaya, banana and guava. He also asked them to make computerised arrangements to show market rate of agriculture products to farmers, and also formulate policies to encourage manufacturing of farm implement within the state."

The market price of moong (green gram) is Rs 3500-to-4000 per quintal against the MSP of Rs 5575.I sold around 8 quintals of urad at the mandi today at Rs 3601 per quintal, said Prahlad Bairwa (40), a farmer of Rajgarh village in Kota district. I have suffered a loss of around Rs 1800 per quintal since MSP of urad is around Rs 5400 per quintal.Basanti Lal, another farmer, said he sold moong at Rs 4000 per quintal, though the MSP is Rs 5575 (including Rs 200 bonus per quintal).The harvest of urad and moong has begun and the pulses have started arriving in the mandi; the harvest will reach it peak within a fortnight.According to Bhamashahmandi figures available in the last fortnight, urad was sold between Rs 3311 and Rs 4700 per quintal, and moong between Rs 3525 and Rs 4300.Earlier this year, the state government did not buy mustard crop and farmers faced losses; now there is no government purchase of pulses, and farmers are losing around Rs 1500-to-2000 per quintal, said Dashrath Kumar, general secretary of the Hadauti Kisan Union.Government should start purchase of pulses immediately to save farmers from losses; when harvest will reach its peak, a large number of farmers will face losses.Urad is grown more in the kharif season than moong; urad was sown in around 3.20 lakh hectares in Hadauti region, and moong in 35000 hectares.Kota MP Om Birla met union minister of state for agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and union minister of state for food, civil supplies and commerce CR Chaudhary on Tuesday, demanding government purchase of pulses.There is a high production of urad and moong pulses, so low prices will result in losses for farmers; government purchase of these pulses on MSP should start soon, he said.Birla said the union ministers told him that they have received the Rajasthan governments proposal to start purchasing pulses within 10 days.The Hadauti Kisan Union threatened to launch an agitation if the government does not start pursing pulses in 10 days."
5a1482f39855b76bf13e50e6,Secrets out: caste and polarisation,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170921/jsp/nation/story_174283.jsp,2017-09-21,"Chandan Mitra New Delhi, Sept. 20: Former BJP MP and national executive member Chandan Mitra has described his party's quest to expand in the east, particularly in Bengal, as a ""humungous task"" - casting doubts on chief Amit Shah's dream of capturing power from panchayat to Parliament and crediting the party's recent wins to caste and religion. Mitra, sidelined in the current dispensation, has described Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee and Odisha's Naveen Patnaik as ""powerful regional leaders"" and said the BJP had its ""task cut out"" in the two crucial eastern states. The comments appeared in an article on the edit page of the newspaper Hindustan Times today. ""As it forays east in its quest to make India Opposition-free, the BJP faces formidable obstacles in two states - Bengal and Odisha. Of course it (the BJP) has not broken into some southern states either, but the challenge is bigger in the east on account of powerful regional leaders like Mamata Banerjee and Naveen Patnaik, whose popularity shows no signs of waning dramatically even if fraying at the edges,"" Mitra says in the article. Mitra, editor of The Pioneer newspaper, explains why he thinks it would be a ""humungous task"". The BJP's ""caste-based winning formula"" for north India will not work in the east, he says, because caste is not a decisive electoral factor in this region. Mitra appears to suggest that the Uttar Pradesh elections this year were won on caste. In Bengal the party has a ""huge disadvantage"" because Muslims account for 27 per cent to 31 per cent of the population and appear firmly behind Mamata, he argues. ""Her excessive appeasement of the minorities may periodically antagonise urban Hindus, but that does not seem enough to galvanise the majority community fully behind the BJP.... Thus the battle to gain acceptance in the Bengali mindset, particularly among the bhadralok, is a humungous task for the BJP.,"" Mitra writes. While the situation might be similar to that in Assam a few years ago, he says, the difference is that in the Northeast state ""communal polarisation increased sharply"" just before and after the 2014 general election, ""enabling"" the BJP to capture power. ""Bengali society has resisted communal polarisation so far,"" he stresses. Party leaders refused to officially react to Mitra's comments but, off the record, said the former Rajya Sabha MP could be venting his displeasure with the current regime. They said Mitra should have refrained from commenting in the way he has done at a time party boss Shah was working on how to capture power in the two eastern states. At the party's Bhubaneswar national executive earlier this year, Shah had given a call to ensure that the lotus bloomed from panchayatto Parliament. Mitra has cited the example of the 2014 Lok Sabha elections to show how Mamata and her Odisha counterpart, Naveen, withstood the Narendra Modi wave to buttress his argument that the two chief ministers were formidable leaders. ""In the barely 18 months that remain for the 2019 Lok Sabha election (in Odisha, Assembly polls will be held simultaneously), the BJP has its task cut out. But it is not an easy one,"" he says. He feels the BJP ""requires a credible leadership and a popular face, acceptable to the bhadralok in particular"". That is something, he says, the BJP ""would have to accomplish in the little time left before the next round of polls"". Mitra concludes by saying that the ""conquest"" of Bengal was ""crucial to the BJP's ambition to decisively win the 2019 Lok Sabha election""."
5a147ec59855b76bf13e4d79,Respect women is the message of Bathukamma,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/hyderabad/2017/sep/22/respect-women-is-the-message-of-bathukamma-1661265.html,2017-09-22,"HYDERABAD: Her phone buzzed incessantly as she jotted down to-do list on one hand and instructed her assistants on the other. All this, while addressing us on Bathukamma, a floral festival of Telangana nativity and its significance. Her hot green tea in a grey ceramic mug was getting cold but not her energy levels. Kavitha Kalvakuntla, Member of Parliament from Nizamabad district and founder of Telangana Jagruthi is a proof why women are called true multitaskers.Humming her favourite Bathukamma song, she says that this colourful festival is close to her heart and singing those songs during the festival is her favourite part of the nine-day long festival. Unlike every year where 12 Bathukamma songs get released, this year they released 60 songs by 12 artistes.Just like how dialect changes every 100 kilometres, songs too vary in every part of Telangana. Reflecting the soul of every area of Telanganas folklore is the list of songs released this year. Usually, the priest performs the rituals and others just worship. This is a folk festival, where everyone knows the song, participates and adds his or her own version to it, which becomes an extension of the festival. Keeping this in mind, we focused on the songs, besides the other needful arrangements, she informs.Generally in Telangana, people are more inclined towards Lord Shiva and Goddess. The songs are also based on them. It is close to our hearts because it is a semi-religious festival. There is no restriction and limitations, she shares while adding why the almost faded festival needed a revival. Kavitha says she is cool with Bathukamma song being remixed and played at parties. Caste issues or discrimination was not the reason for the destruction of this festival. The influence of globalisation and Andhra rule made Bathukamma take a back-step. Thanks to Telangana movement, the festival regained its glory, she rejoices.The way poetry was used during French Revolution, Kavitha used this folklore festival Bathukamma during Telangana separate state revolution. There were many revolutions in the world that failed because culture was not made a part of it. When I started Telangana Jagruthi in 2006, I started to work with Telangana rural women, who were not sanctioned loans by the banks. I realised we should pick up a point that would rally thousands of women into the movement. I was looking for a thread that could connect all the women.Taking inspiration from Bal Gangadhar Tilak, I programmed Bathukamma. Women taking up Bathukamma communicated that they were fighting for a separate state. Bathukamma and Bonalu became symbols of protest and not just festivals. Today, it is a celebration, she beams. We made Bonalu our state festival and our financial commitment is with it, she adds smiling.Last year, Kavitha travelled to nine countries to promote the importance of this floral festival but this year, she confines herself to attending Bathukamma events in Hyderabad.Going down the memory lane, Kavitha says she has fond recollection of celebrating the festival in her village along with her grandmother. Every year, we used to be off to the village for nine days. Wed enjoy watching the festival and even took part in the activities until my grandmother was alive, she smiles and also adds that the vacuum her her grandmother left was filled through the floral festivities.Kavitha was going viral not just on vernacular media but also on national media during Rakshabandhan for promoting the idea of gifting helmets to brothers. Speaking about the idea, Kavitha says, It was not my idea. I just promoted it as I liked it. A kid called Vamsi made a video saying, if sisters gift helmets to brothers, they will think twice to take it off or forget to wear it. I wanted to launch this on my brothers birthday, so I waited for it. It was a surprise for him too. I am glad, it made a difference on a national level, she laughs.Would she like to attach a cause to Bathukamma too? Pat comes the reply, There are already plenty of causes attached to Bathukamma. Teamwork, unity, protection of water bodies, protection of the environment, and of course enjoying every moment of life. The intrinsic message is being sensitive and respectful towards women and it begins at home. Women empowerment starts at home, enlightens the first women MP from Telangana.Africans are the oldest being on the planet. They danced around a centrally placed force. It could be fire or flowers. The same thing applies Bathukamma. They sing and dance in the circular motion around the force called  Shakthi. The format of the festival shows that it is an age-old festival, although we cannot determine the day it started, she shares while speaking about the history of Bathukamma. It is a and nice and fun festival yaar! she says. How does she see the role of men in the festival? Their role is in bringing the flowers and carrying it when it gets heavy and helping the same throw in the lake if the shore of the lake is slippery or broken. I dont have many Bathukamma memories with Ram anna (KTR). Earlier, holidays were given during Sankranthi and not during Dussera. I used to take leave and go with my parents but he used to study in a hostel and wouldnt make it to the festival often, the sister shares.Talking about the special food prepared during the festival, she says the home-grown items like corn, moong dal is prepared. In the folk culture, people treat God as one among of them. According to them, God eats what we do and does what we do. Thus the food consumed by us is offered to the God too. Malidha Muddalu, made of roti and jaggery is the special dish prepared during Bathukamma.On the ninth day, they offer saddhannam. It is nine varieties of rice items like curd rice etc because it can sustain for long. The significance is, we are sending the goddess back, so we are giving her food that doesnt perish immediately, she explains passionately also adding that her personal favourite is makka garalu (corn vadas).Her vision for Bathukamma is to make it popular like Onam or any other state festival. When people think of Kerala, they think of Onam. I want to live the day when people associate Telangana with Bathukamma, she concludes."

I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"
5a1484889855b76bf13e521d,Cattle and cash curbs stoke farm revolt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170925/jsp/nation/story_174909.jsp,2017-09-25,"Cattle graze on a field off the Sikar-Jaipur highway Sikar, Sept. 24: A 13-day agitation by Rajasthan's farmers, joined by about 100 disc jockeys with sound systems blaring, has forced the Vasundhara Raje government to agree to loan waivers up to Rs 50,000 and payment of the full minimum support price. Some 15,000 farmers had gathered at a mandi in Sikar town, 115km from Jaipur, on September 1 and by the time the government buckled on September 13 night, their strength had grown to nearly one lakh, according to spearhead All India Kisan Sabha. On September 9, the Sikar district DJs' association sent a cavalcade of over 100 sound system-fitted cars to join the protests. ""We too come from farming families, which too are burdened with loans,"" explained Babulal, a DJ who performs at weddings and other celebrations. While the mainstay of the movement was Sikar, where the Kisan Sabha has a strong base, the organisation with less than 4 lakh members in the state managed to mobilise support in 13 other districts too. Traders observed a day's strike in Sikar in support of the farmers and provided the agitators with food and water. Vasundhara Raje ""The trader who sells farm equipment is burdened with the goods and services tax. He knows that if the farmer is unable to sell his crop, he cannot buy the trader's products,"" said Navrang Lal, a trader from neighbouring Neemrana. Amra Ram, the All India Kisan Sabha national president and a four-time ex-legislator from the CPM, admits that the farmers have merely won the first round. ""A farmer has to first fight to get his demands accepted, and a second time to have them implemented. We are ready,"" he said in his chamber at ""Comrade Bhavan"", the district CPM headquarters in Sikar. A series of central government decisions over the past one year - from demonetisation to cattle sale curbs and the goods and services tax - had left farmers and allied traders reeling. Several decisions of the state's BJP government compounded the problems. Rajasthan, the only state with a full-fledged ministry dedicated to cows, imposed a 10 per surcharge on stamp duty on non-judicial instruments this year to raise money to protect cows. But the farmers say they have had enough of cow protection - it's they themselves who need protection now. Since the central government banned animal markets from transacting cattle sales for slaughter, farmers have been burdened with unproductive cows they can't sell - or have to sell locally at throwaway prices. Barbed fences, or makeshift barriers made of branches tied together to stave off old stray cattle, are common sights now across crop fields in Rajasthan. ""This isn't all. The government has laid down that a calf cannot be separated from its mother for the first six months of its life,"" said Ram Partap Bagariya, resident of Rashidpura near Sikar. ""We need the milk - for our families and to sell to customers. How'd we survive without the milk?"" Another problem, the farmers say, was that the state government did not pay the promised minimum support price for their crops. ""Across the border in Madhya Pradesh, farmers were selling onions at Rs 8 a kg while in Rajasthan they got half the price. Nor did the government procure mustard. We suffered heavy losses,"" said Dhani Ram of Reengus. Rajasthan produces 11 per cent of India's pulses, second only to Madhya Pradesh, but this year the growers faced ruin. While they invested Rs 13,000 per hectare of chickpea, the crop sold at Rs 4,800 a hectare. For green gram, the investment was Rs 9,000 per hectare and sold at Rs 3,000. ""Last year, 15 to 20 trucks carried barley from our mandi every day. This year, we have barely seen 4 to 5 truckloads a day,"" said Sandeep Agarwal, secretary of the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Sikar where the farmers had assembled for 13 days. ""In the case of mustard, the number of trucks has fallen from 30 to 3."" The state government has agreed to pay the minimum support price from October 1 while a task force will work out the details of the loan waiver after studying similar schemes in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab. The report will be submitted in a month's time. In June, Punjab had announced loan waivers of up to Rs 4 lakh for marginal farmers and Rs 2 lakh for small farmers, with the package expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 10,000 crore. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have announced waivers up to Rs 1 lakh, with the expected bills being Rs 36,359 crore and Rs 30,500 crore, respectively. Implementation has been riddled with controversy, though. This newspaper reported earlier this month how the Uttar Pradesh government had waived sums as low as Rs 27 and Rs 42 on loans of Rs 18,000 and Rs Rs 1 lakh. Amra Ram has his fingers crossed. ""In Maharashtra, farmers with pucca houses have been left out of the waiver scheme. Let's see what the government here comes up with,"" he said. The Kisan Sabha chief has a theory why the Rajasthan agitation succeeded at a time farmers from Tamil Nadu have been intermittently squatting at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar for months, waiting to be heard. ""Delhi is not bothered with what's happening thousands of kilometres away in the southern states. People from these states can't come to Delhi in large numbers,"" he said. ""But when a mass mobilisation happens anywhere in the Hindi belt, everyone takes notice."""

Harish Rao explained that unfavourable weather conditions during the kharif season, particularly during the seed formation stage of the crop, reduced the size of the grain. As a result, the produce was consisting of small-size and immature grains including the shrivelled and damaged ones.Thanking the Union Minister for approving procurement of 13,750 tonnes of green gram under MSP operations in Telangana Mr. Harish Rao stated that Markfed had opened 12 purchase centres for procurement of green gram on behalf of Nafed.However, the centres could procure only 482.34 quintals till September 23 as the produce being brought to the centres by the farmers was not conforming to quality parameters fixed by the Nafed.Although farmers were getting most of their green gram produce to the purchase centres the stocks were being rejected by the Nafed officials. The Marketing Minister has requested the Union Agriculture Minister to relax the quality parameters of green gram for procurement by increasing the admixture from 3% to 6%, damaged grains from 3% to 9%, slightly damaged grains from 4% to 7%, immature and shrivelled grains from 3% to 8% and weevil-affected grains from 4% to 6%.Officials stated that they could ask Markfed to open remaining 15 green gram purchase centres as planned only if the quality specifications were relaxed.Rejection of the stocks being brought to the already opened centres was discouraging the farmers to take their produce to procurement centres, it is said.Separately, Agriculture Production Commissioner C. Parthasarathi, also wrote to Joint Secretary in the Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Ashish Kumar Bhutani requesting relaxation of quality norms for procurement of green gram citing unfavourable weather conditions, particularly the long dry spell during the crucial stages of crop including grain formation."

It makes four 'advance estimates' in the course of the year.This is expected to hit rural incomes in some areas, although the government said the harvest of 134.67 million tonnes, estimated with the help of inputs from states and other sources, would still be 5 per cent higher than the five-year average of 128.24 million tonnes.""The country has adequate stock of foodgrain. So on food security front, there is nothing to worry about. But farmers in rain-fed areas may be hard-hit and their income might go down if prices don't recover,"" said former agriculture secretary Siraj Hussain.He said lower production may hit rural economy and buying capacity of farmers. ""The government has to ensure farmer gets minimum support price for pulses, soyabean and cotton . Also, a stable trading regime needs to be ensured for commodity prices to recover.""Experts said food prices are likely to remain steady. This year's monsoon is about 5 per cent below average, but some parts of the country were flooded while others were relatively dry, hurting kharif output.However, the recent surge in rainfall will help the winter-sown, or rabi, crop because of good soil moisture and more water in reservoirs.Production of rice, the main kharif crop, is estimated to be 94.48 million tonnes, or 1.98 per cent less than the previous year. There was a small drop in paddy acreage, to 37.68 million hectares from 38.18 million hectares a year earlier, on account of deficient rains in a number of districts in Chhattisgarh , Telangana, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka.""Rice is one commodity in which we have been self-sufficient since 1991-92,"" grain analyst Tejinder Narang said. ""There are unlikely to be a spike in prices. In winter, planting of rice will take place in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which can make up the deficit.""Output of kharif pulses such as tur, moong and urad is estimated at 8.71million tonnes against 9.42 million tonnes last year. The ministry cited a shift by farmers to more remunerative crops like sugarcane and cotton for this 7.5 per cent fall in production.Lokesh Goenka, managing director of U Goenka Sons that trades in agriculture commodities, said this would have no major impact on prices in the short run. Area under pulses this season was 14.12 million hectares, 3.47 per cent less than last year.Production of oilseeds such as groundnut, soyabean and castorseed is estimated to decrease by 7.68 per cent over the previous year to 20.68 million tonnes, with farmers shifting to urad, sugarcane and cotton on expectation of higher profitability, the government said.Solvent Extractors' Association of India president Atul Chaturvedi said the Indian farmer was losing interest in the oilseed crop as it was not remunerative compared with others.Sugarcane production is estimated at 337.69 million tonnes, higher by 30.97 million tonnes than the last year. Area under sugarcane has increased by 9.4 per cent .According to Abinash Verma, director-general of Indian Sugar Mills Association, ""The government's estimates are very similar to ISMA's which was 340-345 million tonnes. ""Despite an 18.68 per cent increase in area coverage this season, lower productivity of cotton has resulted in reduced estimated production of 32.27 million bales (of 170 kg each) as compared to 33.09 million bales in 2016-17, said the ministry."

It is their beliefs and customs which are mainly responsible for the contentedness among them, especially among the aboriginal Raj Gond and Kolam tribes.The Pen da Dasra or Dev ka Dasara or the Dasara of the Gods celebrated by Raj Gonds, this year it was on September 25, at the remote Jangubai cave temple, provides an insight into their life, which is by and large tension free. The festival is a thanksgiving event to Goddess Jangubai and other gods like Persa Pen or Bada Dev for the harvested crop.PilgrimageThe Adivasis toil in farms for about six months and the remaining period is spent in pilgrimages to important temples. The latter period is also of festivities which ends with the marriage season between March and May.As part of the agriculture operations, the tribals people seek blessings of the goddess before sowing in the month of May and the Pen da Dasra is usually held five days before the Dasara festival when some of the crops would have been harvested. Before sowing however, the farmers do not seek bumper harvest and riches but restrict themselves to seeking blessings for their well being.Cave templeWe can consume the harvest only after we offer a portion of each of the variety to our gods, revealed Salam Sham Rao, who led his family to the thanksgiving event at the cave temple located in the forest near Maharajguda in Kota-Parandoli gram panchayat of Kerameri mandal in Kumram Bheem Asifabad district.Thousands of Raj Gonds gather at the picturesque location for offering nivodh or naivedyam made of local variety of sesame, red rice or vanjin, green gram and black gram. We cook items like the garkang with green gram in the sesame oil that we ourselves produce, added Sham Raos wife Dhurpatabai.All the peasant families who arrived at the venue of the festival offered prayers to the over dozen gods at the place before crossing the small stream to reach the cave temple. Every devotee family offered chicken or lamb as sacrifice to Goddess Jangubai and later feasted together."

Finally, he abandoned paddy cultivation, but for a good reason. With failures teaching him lessons, Kalaiselvan, instead of relying on paddy crop to make ends meet, cultivated more than eight varieties of crops by adhering to mixed cropping system. To his surprise, it has fetched him an eight-fold surge in net income which includes meeting the food requirements of his family.A graduate in BSc (Physics) and an organic by profession for more than half-a-decade, Kalaiselvan has been cultivating paddy on seven acres supported by an open well for irrigation. But the young farmer failed to get lucrative returns. Realising that the mono-cropping system of paddy cultivation has become increasingly risky due to failing monsoons, he decided to change the cultivation pattern in early 2017 by experimenting with mixed cropping system.""I took less than an acre of my land to experiment mixed cropping cultivation. Groundnut was taken as the major crop inter-cropped with pulses like red gram, cowpea, and mung dal in the field. Small onion (shallot) was also cultivated on the irrigation bunds. To avoid cattle from feeding on the cultivated pulses, sesame crop was grown around the standing crops to act as fence since cattle would not consume the crop owing to its sticky nature,"" Kalaiselvan told TOI.A couple of months after the attempt, he found that the weed growth was suppressed in the mixed cropping system due to multiple cultivation occupying more space, thus resulting in the reduction of farm labour required for weeding. As Kalaiselvan found available space to cultivate other crops, he introduced cotton too. ""In mono cropping system, only paddy can be harvested for the family and other food items had to be sourced from outside. On the other hand, the mixed cropping system contributed food products such as pulses, small onions and oil extracted from groundnut and sesame for the family needs,"" Kalaiselvan adds.Besides the financial gain, the problem with pest was also said to be contained in mixed cropping system. ""In mixed cropping, if one crop fails, the loss can be compensated with other crops. But such assurance and risk reduction component are missing in the mono-cropping system,"" K Suresh Kanna, deputy director of Kudumbam , an organisation promoting organic farming, said. With this success, Kalaiselvan said that he has been planning to extend some more areas to mixed cropping method and also attract more farmers to it."

The ministerial sub-group included home minister Gulab Chand Kataria , water resources minister Ram Pratap, cooperatives minister Ajay Singh and revenue minister Amra Ram.The agriculture minister said state government would begin purchase of green gram (moong) and black gram (urad) at minimum support price (MSP) as soon as it gets the nod from the Centre. Saini even spoke to union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh on phone about the issue.Saini said a committee would be formed to ensure better implementation of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana in the state. The committee would study the scheme's pros and cons and make suggestions to the state government to execute in a better way.State's 25 Krishi Mandi have been connected with Rashtriya Krishi Bazaar, while the remaining Mandis have been linked with Rajasthan Integrated Mandi Management System, said Saini.

This decision will be implemented immediately as green and black gram (moong and urad dal) and cotton will be available next week.The government has also decided to check the real-time production of gram by farmers to ensure traders dont seel the produce in the name of farmers.The state had procured as much as 25 lakh quintal tur by paying more than Rs1,200 crore at Rs5,050 a quintal as minimum support price (MSP) earlier this year. It was later revealed that many traders had bought the stock from farmers at much cheaper rates than the MSP. The government has registered criminal cases against them.READ: Indian agriculture lacks a vision. Why this is a bigger problem than floods and droughtsThis experience made the state make the process more transparent. In a meeting on Sunday, the state decided that payment of the procured produce will be credited in farmers bank accounts within three days. Also, mobile applications may be launched to make the procurement process easy.Instead of investigating the cases of misappropriation for the recovery of losses later, it is always better to take precautions to avoid them. By making Aadhaar linkage mandatory, we will ensure that the benefits go to eligible farmers. The records of famers landholdings will help us establish the maximum production of grams by any farmer. We are also planning to make the payment within 3 days of procurement so that farmers are not motivated to sell the produce to the traders for quick money, Bijay Kumar, principal secretary, agriculture department, told HT.The state expects the production of green and black gram to be about 5 lakh quintal in the ongoing kharif season. The MSP for green gram is Rs5,575 a quintal and for black gram is Rs5,400 a quintal against the market price of Rs4,400 a quintal. As many as 85 procurement centres will be opened in 17 districts.Weeding out the unscrupulous elements is a welcome step, but state government should try to keep the market rate of the purchase in check by restricting the import of the pulses from other countries, said Vijay Jawandhia, a farm activist from Vidarbha."

They have the best chingri maach. Also, the kosha mangsho at Bhosale Nagar is to die for!'During Pujo, besides festive pleasantries, we can bet that the next most important topic of discussion among Bengalis is what one can eat and where - such is their love for food! Be that as it may, the real charm, however, lies in the simple 'bhog' (an offering to Ma Durga) served during the festival.Close to lunch hours, it's common to see people partaking in the meal on sal leaf or dona plates as dada-boudis and elderly kaku-kakimas attend to them. An honest celebration of community, we couldn't think someone better than 68-year-old Moni Das to tell us more about this divine meal.We meet Moni, the head cook of Pune Kali Bari (one of the city's oldest pujas), in a makeshift mandap beside the pandal. Sporting a checked gamccha, he oversees his team that readies the day's bhog . They stir enormous steel patilas of food, as myriad aromas arise and engulf us. ""We've been cooking since 5 am,"" he tells us. While Moni captains the ship, he has 15 men assisting him, and an additional 10 men packing food parcels for visitors who won't be eating at Pune Kali Bari.Having used over 40 kilos of paneer, 40 kilos of peas, 50 kilos of potatoes, 200 kilos of rice and about 200 litres of milk, Moni assures us that the food will be more than sufficient. ""10 people can have a kilo of bhog'er khichuri. Going by that estimation, we cook according to the day and its expected footfall. Ashtami and Navami see maximum attendance. That's when we cook for 3000-plus people,"" Moni adds. Clearly, catering for so many has become second nature for him, given that he has been cooking for Pune Kali Bari since 1979.The quintessential meal is a simple one, merely representing a lavish Bengali meal for everyone to partake in. Moni tells us that the line-up usually comprises, but isn't restricted to, flavoursome bhog'er khichuri (prepared from special Gobindobhog rice, moong dal and vegetables; except onions and garlic), labra (Bengali-style mixed vegetable), a sweet-tangy date and tomato chutney, beguni (a fried brinjal savoury) followed by payesh (rich Bengali rice kheer). On Saptami, Pune Kali Bari served devotees a Bengali-style pulao, chana dal, aloo-mattar-paneer, chutney and payesh. Today's menu will be the aforementioned standard one.Moni says, ""Panch phoron (five-spice masala) is most important for preparing khichuri, labra and chutney. If it is prepared here, the flavours don't match up to what you get in Bengal. Hence we source the masala and Gobindobhog rice from Kolkata."" Another key element is the bhaja masala gudi (dry-roasted and ground masala) that's added to the khichuri along with ghee before serving.Besides Durga Puja, Moni is busy during other pujas at Pune Kali Bari, namely amavasya puja, Annapurna puja, Saraswati Puja, Laxmi Puja and Kali Puja, to name some. Besides seeking Durga's blessings, he is also reason why many love visiting  to tuck into the familiar, homely meal they look forward to. Rest assured, when you visit today, the taste and flavour will be just like what you relished last year.According to consulting Indologist Urmi Chanda-Vaz , socially, Durga Puja in its present form was started in the early 16th century by Bengal's rajas and zamindars. ""They instituted the festival in their palatial homes as a show of authority or autonomy against the British. Gradually, it became an opportunity to flaunt wealth and social status. They would organise grand feasts and committed acts of charity. The grander the feast, the more the social prestige,"" she says.But the gastronomic excesses are also justified with an emotional narrative. Rina Pradhan, a member of Anandam Association, explains, ""We liken Ma Durga's visit to the arrival of a married daughter to her parent's house. Her spending these five days with us brings immense happiness. She is thus pampered with the most delectable traditional food in the form of bhog."" According to Urmi, the offerings in West Bengal are mostly vegetarian, but the East of Bengal (now Bangladesh) offer the goddess non-vegetarian fare, including meat and fish.'Bhog' means an offering to the goddess. Once she has ritually 'eaten' it, it becomes prasad. And it is this prasad that people eat. It's a misnomer when people say they are going to eat bhog.

A nearly 40% dip in the production of pulses is expected in comparison to last year. Ministry officials said the uneven distribution of rain and dry spells in the farming belt of Vidarbha and Marathwada during the monsoon was to blame.An agricultural department official told TOI that the production dip in the state this year can be attributed to the erratic monsoon in Vidarbha which has been deficient by 23% so far this year.""The paddy transplantation has not been completed till now. It will translate to a nearly 30% dip in paddy production from this region. Moong or split green gram and urad or split black gram may witness a 35% drop in production due to the deficient monsoon in the region. Estimates show that soybean production may also dip by 25%,"" the official said.Vidarbha has a 25% contribution of split green gram and split black gram to the total production of these pulses in the state, while its soybean contribution is 30%.There has been a conspicuous productivity dip in the state as per the latest estimate. For instance, food-grain productivity last year was 1,642 kg per hectare which may dip by 21% this fiscal to 1,301kg per hectare.According to MAHA Farmers Producer Company Ltd (MAHAFPC), close to 75% of the state's production of pulses is concentrated in Marathwada and Vidarbha. ""This kharif season, production of foodgrain and pulses is likely to witness a significant dip because of two reasons, the delayed monsoon arrival in these parts as well as prolonged dry spells followed by heavy spells of rain,"" Amit Naphade, director, MAHAFPC, said.Split green gram and split black gram grown this kharif season have already started trickling into the wholesale markets, split red gram will hit the markets in January .Naphade said heavy rain in the last month also affected the quality of pulses from these regions, which means that much of pulses' stocks may fail to meet the quality specification of the minimum support price.""It is likely to affect the farmers adversely,"" he added."

5a1547219855b76bf13ecd72,Rally seeks exclusion of tribal villages,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171004/jsp/northeast/story_176034.jsp,2017-10-04,"The protest rally at Boko in Kamrup district on Tuesday. Telegraph picture Borjhar, Oct. 3: Several indigenous organisations of Assam took out a rally at Boko town, 60km west of Guwahati, in Kamrup district today demanding exclusion of 378 villages under the tribal belt and block area from the proposed Assam State Capital Region. The rally was held under the aegis of the Rabha Hasong Joint Movement Committee, a common platform for 34 organisations. Not all of them were present at the meet but they supported the cause. Several other organisations representing other indigenous communities of Assam also supported the cause. Addressing the rally, All Assam Students' Union chief adviser Samujjal Kumar Bhattacharjya urged the government to ensure that the land rights of indigenous people are protected while planning the state capital region. ""We have seen how indigenous people lost their land when the state capital was shifted from Shillong to Guwahati in 1972. We are not against development projects but tribal belts and blocks and land rights of indigenous people must be protected while taking up any expansion plan,"" he said. The Assembly had on September 15 passed the Assam State Capital Region Development Authority Bill, 2017, which provides for setting up of a regional development authority to prepare a plan for rapid development of state capital region on the lines of the National Capital Region. Kamrup (metro), Kamrup, Nalbari, Darrang and Morigaon districts, fully or partly, will be a part of the plan. The tribal belts and block areas which are proposed to come under the plan are from Boko, Chhaygaon and Palashbari revenue circles in Kamrup district in lower Assam. Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council chief Tankeswar Rabha said the move was against indigenous people and that the state government should have consulted organisations representing indigenous people before going ahead with the plan. The clamour for protection of land rights of indigenous people has grown following submission of the interim report of the government-constituted Hari Shankar Brahma Committee for Protection of Land Rights of Indigenous People of Assam. The 17-page report submitted to Dispur on July 22 articulates peoples' concerns about encroachment of tribal belts and blocks by suspected illegal migrants from Bangladesh. All Rabha Students' Union president Ramen Singh Rabha alleged that by bringing state capital region to the fore, the government wanted to divert the demand for inclusion of Rabha Hasong Autonomous Council area under the Sixth Schedule. ""Instead of including 378 villages in the proposed state capital region, the government should include Rabha Hasong area in the Sixth Schedule. This will strengthen us more. We will never allow the government to acquire our land for the proposed development project,"" he said. Tribal Sangha president Aditya Khaklari opposed the move saying that corporate groups would take away lands once the act comes into force. All Tiwa Students' Union president Dipen Morsang, Karbi Students' Union president Mahanta Timung, All Assam Gorkha Students' Union president Prem Tamang, Anusuchit Chatra Santha general secretary Nityananda Das, All Koch Rajbongshi Students' Union general secretary Troilakya Roy, All Assam Bengali Youths Students' Federation president Deepak Dey and Garo Students' Union president Thengsak Momin, among others, attended the rally.

5a1736869855b76bf13eff63,Why granite scam report needs to explain colossal numbers,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/tracking-indian-communities/why-granite-scam-report-needs-to-explain-colossal-numbers/,2017-10-09,"Its been more than five years since granite mining, slicing and polishing machines fell silent in Madurai district, and several thousand families of workers began worrying about their daily bread.A May 19, 2012 report prepared by then district collector U Sagayam, an iconic anti-corruption crusader, indicated rampant mining rule violations, resulting in a loss of Rs16,000 crore to the government exchequer. If that report raised eyebrows, eyes popped out when Sagayam later quantified the loss as Rs1.1 lakh crore, after the Madras high court handpicked him as legal commissioner and asked him to probe the issue.A lot happened during the period  factories were sealed, residences were raided, arrests were made, licences were cancelled and mining was stopped. Sagayams nearly 1,000-page report had explosive content and even suspected human sacrifice by quarry operators. The high court impleaded at least half-a-dozen government agencies in the case, and held several rounds of hearings.As dust generated by the report settles, a clearer picture of the mining scenario emerges. And, it is not good news for hyper-activists who still cling on to the theory of Rs1.1 lakh crore mining scam, that too in Madurai district alone.Documents of Granite Development Council, Indian Bureau of Mines, Geological Survey of India, industries department and Federation of Indian Granite and Stone Industries, among others, offer a set of data far smaller than the Rs1.1 lakh crore the Sagayam report talked about. While the IAS officer spoke about the loss, these agencies talked of the total value of mined granites at national, state and district levels.For instance, Indias total export of granite for a 17-year period (1996 to 2013) itself was Rs53,374.2 crore, as borne out by records of Export Import Data Bank available with the Union ministry of commerce. Indian Bureau of Mines data shows that Tamil Nadu accounted for 13% of total granite export during the period, and its value was Rs6,808.65 crore. Madurai district accounted for 41.1% of granite mined in TN, and its total value was Rs2,798.43 crore.When the total value of the granite mined in Madurai district between 1996 and 2013 itself was Rs2,798 crore, where is the question of the exchequer losing Rs1.1 lakh crore due to irregularities in mining contracts and practices?Post-Sagayam report, a team headed by Mohandoss, deputy director of geology and mining directorate, submitted a report saying Madurai granite mines offered 90% recovery. All FIRs were filed only on the basis of these findings.But, responding to the Madras high courts directive, the director (geology) and head of the office of the deputy director-general, Geological Survey of India in Chennai filed an affidavit on July 28, 2017 giving a very modest recovery percentage. According to him, the recovery percentage of Madurai white variety of granite is 35-40% in a productive zone. It is as low as 5% in structurally affected areas.It means that even if the rocks are massive and homogenous by nature with a width of around 200m at a stretch, solid exportable granite recovery percentage is a mere 35-40%.No doubt, all forms of mining  river sand, beach sand, granite and blue metal  are dirty to the common mans eyes. But, when a fraud is alleged and the higher judiciary orders neutral audit, overzealousness is anathema to justice. Today, activists and officials have to prove the Rs1.1 lakh crore loss to the exchequer more than violation of licence conditions and other related crimes committed by the mining lobby. A mere contra-report showing loss of a lower value for the government would show the miners as angels.As the dust has settled and the court sets out to hear the case, documents must prove the humungous loss suffered by the exchequer. But, every document submitted by every state and central government agency narrates a different tale which is not music to either Sagayam or anti-mining activists.Sagayams allegations of customs fraud, false export bills, under-invoicing, data base doctoring and doubtful bank statements have not cut much ice with the judiciary so far. For granite export worth Rs1.1 lakh crore is too big to be covered up even if all these agencies had made a joint attempt.Coupled with that is the fact that the factories have been rusting and several thousand families are staring at the closed gates of granite polishing units to reopen. Now, what is hard to prove are not violations of granite mining rules and contract clauses, but the colossal losses as alleged by Sagayam."
5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

Telegraph picture Many Jamshedpureans are cycling for fun or leisure if the swelling register of the city's first group for cyclists formed by Tata Steel management trainees, Steel Cyclos, is any indication. From 40 on August 31, when Steel Cyclos had been launched in the presence of Everesters Bachendri Pal and Premlata Agarwal, the number of members has now risen to 147. ""We think membership will cross 250-plus by this year-end. There are a fair number of women, too,"" enthused Ashish Chaudhary, a manager in Tata Steel and one of the club's core committee members. And, it's not empty numbers either, Chaudhary stressed. ""Our members meet mostly on Sundays. We pedal to many destinations near the steel city, including Jadugora, Gamharia, Dimna, and even Tiring on the Odisha border, some 45km from Jamshedpur. The club started with mostly Tata Steel employees but non-company residents have also shown great interest to join us as it gives them an opportunity to socialise differently, exercise, and most importantly, reduce carbon footprint and go green,"" he said. Senior manager at Tata Steel Adventure Foundation (TSAF) Hemant Gupta, who turned an Everester earlier this year, said he was delighted that something like this was finally happening in the steel city. ""I am an active member of the club's core team and so I'm really happy to see membership grow in leaps and bounds in such a short span,"" Gupta said. ""It proves that many people are keen to be fit, enjoy the outdoors and making new friends and want to reduce air pollution,"" he added. In November, club members are heading to Tumung, a rocky area some 25km from Jamshedpur, with a special cause, Chaudhary said. ""We'll visit a primary school in Tumung to spread awareness on education among school children there. We'll also distribute stationery items like copies, pencils and erasers among them."" Steel Cyclos has a Facebook page for enrolling names. Aspiring members can also visit the TSAF office at the JRD sports complex in Jamshedpur. There no membership fee. ""As they say, the best things in life are free,"" laughed Harjit Singh, an employee of a private firm and a Mango resident who joined Steel Cyclos last week. ""I liked the concept of this club and will ask my friends to join too,"" he added. Adityapur businessman Sumeet Pandey said he loved cycling as a leisure activity.

Environment of these buildings is not conducive for cooking meals for pregnant women. They are either dilapidated or crammed. There are no chairs or tables. Where will we serve food ? We can certainly not make them sit on the ground, said GR Shivashankar, president, Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers Federation. The federation has four associations.At a press meet here on Wednesday, they said they wanted the previous system to continue where pregnant women were given their monthly entitlement of rice, wheat, green gram and jaggery at home. Now, in addition to hot cooked meal, they also have to provide milk, eggs and chikki (a sweet made out of jaggery and groundnut).In some districts they sent cooking oil, salt and groundnuts home too. Now instead of asking us to serve milk they can send milk powder home, send the money required to buy eggs directly to their bank account and also send chikki home, said B Nagarathnamma, general secretary of the federation.Vijayalakshmi, president of the Karnataka State Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Association, said, This job goes against the objectives of the Integrated Child Development Scheme that intends to provide primary education to children. Besides, pregnant women have to walk one km or more to the anganwadi everyday to have food. Anganwadis will be transformed into canteens if this additional burden is given to the workers.On 14th this month, a convention will be held here in the city to explain the same to all stakeholders -- workers associations representatives and government representatives. We want the Matru Poorna Scheem to be rolled back. Among other demands, we want proper buildings and toilets too. We want the government to get statistics on the number of beneficiaries making use of Matru Poorna and do direct benefit transfer if they want to eliminate middlemen. Concept of Take Home Ration should be brought back. If our demands are not met, the workers will protest. We have submitted a memorandum to Minister for Women and Child Development, Shivashankar said.Complaints galoreAnganwadi teachers say they have been reduced to maids with the rollout of Matru Poorna schemeA week after rollout, they say there is no time to teach children and focus on other objectives of ICDSCooking food and washing utensils consume most of their timeToddlers (who are first-born children pf the mothers) accompany pregnant or lactating mothers visiting the anganwadis often asking for food.

He said it is a common phenomena for certain varieties of paddy seeds and the loss is confined to limited number of farmers. The partially damaged crops can be recovered after proper drying.Satpathy said information is being collected about damaged crops and overall crop condition across the district is good. While 2.11 lakh hectares (ha) have been covered under paddy cultivation, non-paddy crops grown in 1,01,555 ha, he added.The Deputy Director said paddy crops on upland are in harvesting stage, while on medium land, it is in milking to grain filing stage and on low land, it is in panicle initiation to milking stages. The total paddy crop output is likely to surpass expectation, he added. Non-paddy crops, including ground nut and pulses like moong and biri are in harvesting stage, while mandia crops have matured.

The water level in our village used to fall below 50 feet. During summer months, most of the wells and the handpumps went dry and we remained dependent on the water tankers for our daily needs, Ahir told this visiting IANS correspondent.Suresh Kumar, another farmer, said that due to lack of adequate water many of the villagers had sold their cattle as they could hardly get green fodder for them. We used to grow only Kharif crop, but now we can produce Rabi crop too, he added.How did a region notorious for scarcity of water become self-sufficient?A combination of a scientific approach and ancient traditional practices have brought about a green cover in hundreds of villages across the region where life had become extremely difficult for farmers.The change came about on the initiative taken by the state government under the Mukhyamantri Jal Swalamban Yojana (MJSA). Under the programme, UN consultant on conservation of water, T. Hanumantha Rao, and the Rajasthan River Basin and Water Resources Planning Authority came together to begin simple practices which brought about a sea change in drought-prone areas.The programme involved digging up trenches or pits about two feet deep, 10 to 15 feet long and one-and-a-half feet wide in the hillocks surrounding the villages. Additionally, several ponds were dug near the villages to conserve water.From the air, these hundreds of trenches look like a neat pattern of unlinked canals. But they have resulted in the water table rising to, in many places, a mere three feet under the surface.Rainwater, which used to flow down from the hillocks into the villages used to wash away, leaving little for later use. But the trenches have ensured that water seeps into the ground in a controlled fashion and remains available throughout the year.Additionally, to bind the soil and conserve water, thousands of saplings of local trees have been planted around the trenches and ponds.From the time the programme started in January 2016, greenery has sprouted everywhere in hundreds of villages, bringing in its wake some prosperity.Theres no water or fodder problem now due to the conservation works in the hillocks, Rakesh Reddy, the MJSA member in the river basin authority, told IANS.He said that earlier, when officials approached farmers to give a portion of their barren land in the hillocks and plain ground for the percolation pits and ponds, they pelted stones at them. But now things have changed. After witnessing the revival of water-flow they approach us (to offer land), he added.This 12th century AD, Kakatiya-era chain-link-tank system was also adopted in Telangana with success. Under the programme, almost 7,500 villages in the state had benefited in two phases, impacting lives of almost ten million people, according to the Chairman of the river basin authority, Sriram Vedire. Over 225,000 water conservation structures have been set up in 20 months since the beginning of the programme.The state government has spent over Rs 3,000 crore in the first two phases of the scheme, Vedire told IANS, adding that the government planned to cover 21,000 villages in four years of the programme.Vedire said that the structures once built are not left alone to fall into disuse but a regular monitoring system has been put in place. Geographic information system (GIS) technology was the backbone to properly implement the programme, he said.Every trench or structure in the programme, he said, is geo-tagged, which allows detailed monitoring by officials throughout the year.According to an assessment, the programme has resulted in additional collection of over 18,000 TCM (thousand cubic metres) of water in two phases.Vedire said that, on an average, the irrigated area in the district increased by 4.64 per cent for Rabi crops while 12.49 per cent increase was noticed in crops which are locally grown, like maize, green gram (moong) or peanuts. Its effect is visible in the productivity as the agricultural output increased by 18 to 25 per cent, he added.Farmers like Kishan Lal Ahir and Suresh Kumar can now hope to participate in the natural bounty, instead of thinking about how to eke out an existence in a bleak world."

The data also shows that the rainfall of 166.23 mm received in September is the highest in the month since 2010.Officials in the district administration and the Department of Agriculture said the significantly high amount of rainfall had resulted in a bountiful harvest of cotton and many varieties of millets and pulses in rain-fed regions.Pointing out that the district had received 406.69 mm of rainfall in the past four months from the southwest monsoon, an official from the district administration said it was almost the same as the normal rainfall of 406.9 mm expected during northeast monsoon, which is the major rainfall season for Madurai district.Paddy cultivation has remained abysmally low this year since water could not be released from Vaigai dam for kuruvai cultivation. Only a small section of farmers in rain-fed regions and those dependent on well irrigation went for paddy. However, it looks like a bumper harvest this year for certain varieties of millets and pulses, a senior official from the Department of Agriculture said. He highlighted that the district had already exceeded its targeted area in pulses, particularly red gram and green gram, and cotton for the current year.M. Ramalingam, a farmer from the rain-fed Sivarakkottai area near Tirumangalam, said the place was looking heavenly with abundant yield of a variety of pulses and millets.Last year, since the rainfall was low, we managed to get only one yield. This year, some of the farmers in the region have already taken two or three yields of pulses, he said.A.N.M. Tirupathi, a farmer from Kulamangalam, however, expressed concern that cultivation of paddy, the major crop for the district, was yet to take off. The rainfall in our district has helped in filling some tanks. But without release of water in Periyar irrigation system, this water will be of no use for samba cultivation of paddy, he said.Acknowledging that water must have been released from Vaigai dam by now for samba cultivation, a senior official from the Department of Agriculture expressed hope that there would be adequate water for release at least by the first week of November. There were years in the past when water was released as late as the second week of November and farmers still managed a good harvest, he said."

But this year, the trend has reversed and prices of kharif crops, mainly pulses, oilseeds, and cereals are seen below the MSP. Government has set parameters of 12 per cent moisture content for the procurement of these pulses and at present the produce being brought to the market has moisture content levels of 14-16 per cent, resulting in lower rates,"" said Vijay Niwal from Yavatmal.""In the biggest of the APMC market yards of Vidarbha like Malkapur and Khamgaon the traders have put up boards to not to bring Urad with moisture to the markets. The government has released orders to start procurement centres for Soybean by October 18. However, the system doesn't seem to be prepared to start the centres at the ground level,"" said Samadhan Kanhar from Buldana.""Farmers, who are need of money before the festival begins next week are not ready to wait for the government run centres to start operating. Around 20 per cent of farmers who had sold Tur at such centres last year have not yet to get the money and that is the reason why they are not ready to wait in hope of MSP,"" he said.Sudhir Chobhe, who is Ahmednagar district president of Shetkari Sanghatana, said that the farmers get MSP only if they are ready to lodge complaints against the traders. ""I had lodged a complaint last time when I was offered only Rs 1100 for Sorghum instead of Rs 1400. So, when I went to sell my Soybene last week I got Rs 4400. Some were even offered Rs 4800. But, many farmers from nearby Parner have complained that they had to sell Soybene at the rate of Rs 3800 when the MSP is 4500,"" he said.Sudhir Bindu from Parbhani heads the Marathwada unit of the Shetkari Sanghatana. He said that the yield of Moong and Urad are particularly low this year. Yet they are unable to get proper rates. ""Generally yield of Moong is around 6 quintals per acre. However, it is just around 4 quintles this year. Yet the rates have fallen in place of Rs 5400 we are getting only around Rs 4000 for Moong,"" he said.""The cotton is likely to come to the market from Monday. But, that too is unlikely to get a rate of more than Rs 4000,"" he added.The MSP announced by the central government for Soybene is Rs 3050, Tur is Rs 5450, Moong is Rs 5575 and for Ured is Rs 5400.Stay up to date on all the latest Nation news with The New Indian Express App. Download now"

Farmers in state have already suffered successive droughts since 2015, and more rains could result in huge losses for them. Experts feel there will be a surge in post-harvest diseases if such moist conditions persist throughout October. Dr N Nagaraj, Professor of Plant Pathology, University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) told Express that if it rains heavily during October, farmers tend to harvest their crops early.Due to such showers, it becomes a problem for farmers to dry and store the produce. As a result, post-harvest diseases such as formation of moulds will increase and hurt revenues of the farmer, he said. Quoting the example of an experimental plot of UAS, he said that the plot of land that used to give 200 kg of harvest might provide a maximum harvest of 140 kg of vegetables this year. Perishable crops like tomato are affected by diseases such as Phytophthora Late Blight. Other crops such as papaya, chillies and vegetables will be affected due to spell of rains, he said.Crops such as moong bean, maize, jowar and ragi too are not exempt from the consequences of such weather. Paddy is among the few crops that will not be affected much, he said. However, rains effect ragi, when earheads are growing in the plants. If water stands in the ragi form, the earheads will sprout, leading to loss for farmers, he said. Shivkumar Naiklal, scientist at Karnataka State Natural Disaster Monitoring Cell said that overcast conditions also effect crops which are about to flower. He said that 99% of the State had adequate moisture in soil, after two years of moisture stress due to drought."

By then, the AIADMK expects to set its house in order.However, Mr. Maitreyan said any decision on this has to be taken by the Prime Minister, BJP president Amit Shah, AIADMK party coordinator O.

The average rainfall between June and September of the current financial year stood at 310.31 mm, the highest for the said period during the last one decade. The average rainfall was a mere 70.57 mm for the period during the corresponding period last year.According to Joint Director of Agriculture Mohamed Iqbal, good rain during June- September hold significance since it is the sowing period.Crop-wise analysis indicated that the acreage of cholam this kharif season touched 28,900 hectares, as against 3,277 ha last season. Pulses such as black gram were raised over 2,239 ha (144 ha last season) and green gram 1,547 ha (118 ha last season). Maize cultivation area went up to 13,800 ha (1,055 ha last year)."

Around 40% of this land area is for millets thanks to TNs mission to promote sustainable dry land agriculture.While sorghum is favoured in the western belt, Perambalur, Ariyalur, Dindigul and Virudhunagar are growing corn. Ragi is popular in Krishnagiri and Dharmapuri and kuthiraivali (barnyard millet) is taking root in Madurai, Sivaganga and Theni.The increase in acreage comes after the initial failure of rainfall in June and July. There is a demand for millets as it requires less water and fertilizers and yet fetches a good price. Better awareness among farmers, who would otherwise keep the land barren for want of water, distribution of certified seeds and better post-harvest technologies have become impetus for growing alternative crops.For instance, in Namakkals Elachipalayam block, A Sumathi, a farmer, halved her four acre plot to grow minor millets this year, after successful ventures of her neighbours. The growing demand for millet-based food products in health-conscious urban markets has also increased the momentum for the sector. Today, 14 millet-based restaurants are making waves in Coimbatore. Millet cultivation has been taken up in areas like Arupukkottai, Srivilliputhur and Kovilpatti, traditionally known for paddy. In Ramanathapuram and Madurai, we have got requests for seeds of millets and pulses to cover 1,000 hectares, said K Ramasamy, vice-chancellor of TN Agriculture University.Cultivation of major crops like corn, ragi and sorghum has seen a dramatic rise. Other millets such as thinai, varagu, samai and kudiraivali are slowly picking up. After years of paddy and wheat, there are a number of farmer groups collectively working on millet cultivation. Thanks to growing awareness about its nutritional value, machines for dehulling millets (removal of husk) are gaining popularity, said M Palanisamy of Rainfed Farming Development Programme, Dhan Foundation, which is associated with TNAU and McGill University, Canada.The green revolution had made people dependent on rice and wheat. But now we need crops that are nutritional, but do not require much water and is climate-change resistant. Millets suits the bill as it grows in rough terrain found in most parts of the state, said Vikram Sankaranarayanan of SanLak Agro Industries.Cultivation of pulses too shot up this season with 2.3 lakh hectares being brought under dry land farming. Red, black and green gram have become the most sought-after pulses. The high cultivation of pulses is also due to launch of dry land agriculture mission with 200 clusters formed this year. Each cluster consists of dry lands aggregating to an area of 1,000 hectares. To help these areas, 291 water harvesting structures including ponds and check dams have been built, besides financial assistance. Around 400 more clusters will be identified soon, said a senior government official."

Traders take Telangana cotton farmers for a ride,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2017/oct/26/what-msp-traders-take-telangana-cotton-farmers-for-a-ride-1683358.html,2017-10-26,"HYDERABAD: Despite the Centre and State governments tall claims of being pro-farmers, they are unable to ensure that Minimum Support Prices (MSP) promised by them are provided to farmers. Cotton farmers in northern Telangana are having a tough time getting sufficient compensation for their produce.Though the Cotton Corporation of India (CCI) has fixed the MSP at Rs 4,320 per quintal, traders are paying anywhere between Rs 1,500 and Rs 3,500 depending upon the quality of cotton.Traders blame it on poor quality of produce, thanks to unseasonal rains that destroyed large areas of cotton crop in the region.Enumamula market yard, the second-largest in Asia, is usually packed with cotton bags around this time of the year. However, when Express visited the yard on Monday, only a few thousand bags had arrived. Farmers, who lost most of their crop to rains, brought the remaining damaged cotton to market hoping to recover at least a part of what they invested.They are bringing wet, blackish cotton, claimed a trader. We cannot pay them much for this. We will have a tough time scouting for people who would buy such low quality cotton.Farmers claim their produce isnt that bad and traders were taking advantage of situation. My cotton is slightly above the prescribed natural moisture content percentage fixed by CCI. But traders are not ready to accept that fact, says T Ramesh of Arepally village in Warangal Urban mandal. They are paying us just Rs 2,500 per quintal. This is even lesser than what we invested.Money spent to cultivate cotton has drastically increased, as input costs and labour charges have risen four fold. This has made it harder for farmers who are now making losses. Earlier, farmers had demanded that CCI increase moisture content percentrage from 8-12 pc to 20 pc.Its not just cotton, even grain farmers claim they do not get MSP. Farmers in Warangal cultivated 24,000 acres of green gram this sowing season. However, the produce is being sold for as less as Rs 3000-Rs 4000 per quintal when the MSP is Rs 5,575 per quintal. We have invested Rs 10,000 per acre but got only 2 quintal yield. Adding to it, traders are offering lesser than the MSP, said K Narasaiah.The Telangana State Co-Operative Marketing Federation  Markfed  has setup one procurement centre in the market yard here, but has purchased only 50 quintals this season. Farmers are now pleading the state to ensure purchase of their produce at MSP.The CCI is also not buying cotton with moisture content over permissible limits. This would be a huge loss for us, explained a CCI official. Farmers, officials claimed, prefer selling their produce to traders than government agencies.For CCI or Markfed to procure their produce, they have to produce their pass book and Aadhaar details. They have to wait 15-20 days for the money. Its only when they do not get the MSP from traders that they come to us, said a Markfed official.Experts say MSP is a misleading concept as traders never buy produce at fixed rates. It varies depending on market price on a given day. Farmers lack resources to store their goods and wait for prices to increase. As a result, farmers who have taken loans are selling their produce at throwaway prices.Release insurance amount to farmersAgriculture secretary C Parthasarathi requested insurance companies to see that crop insurance amount is released to farmers, immediately. At a meeting with representatives of insurance companies at Secretariat on Wednesday, Parthasarthi wanted them to release crop insurance claim amounts for Kharif season and transfer the money into the accounts of individual farmers. For this, the bankers wanted some more time.Increase permissible moisture content: FarmersCotton farmers led by Congress and Rythu Sangam leaders on Wednesday protested in front of market yard demanding that government increase moisture content criterion in cotton from existing 8 to 12 pc to 20 pc. Ryots said natural moisture percentage in cotton was 16 and it was difficult for them to bring it down to eight. TPCC general secretary G Sujatha launched hunger strike demanding government increase moisture content criterion to 12 per cent."

The government has appointed an 11-member committee to look into the matter, he informed the assembly.Replying to queries during Question Hour, Saini said that the government was committed for the welfare of farmers, who comprise 75 per cent of the states population.Various farmer organisations have submitted memorandum to the state government on 57-points including complete loan waiver. To find a fair solution, an 11-member high power committee has been formed on the directions of chief minister Vasundhara Raje, he said.Saini said that the committee would submit a report after studying the loan waiver announced by other states. A team has also been sent to Karnataka for the study. Suitable action would be taken based on the committees report.The minister said that government was working in the direction of the loan waiver for farmers but no decision in haste will be taken. We want to present a good example in the country and the work in this direction is going on, he said.The minister said the government has already waived off mandi fee of Rs 100 crore on purchase of crops on minimum support price (MSP).He also informed the House that government has already implemented 85 per cent MS Swaminathan Commissions recommendations.In his question, independent MLA Nandkishore Maharia asked a clear reply from the minster whether the government will waive farmers loan or not.Noisy scenes were witnessed when the government deputy chief whip Madan Rathore objected to Maharia when the latter referring to BJPs election manifesto said that the party had promised to declare minimum support price (MSP) of all crops. Rathore said that the BJP did not promise to declare the MSP of all crops.Saini said the MSP was decided by the Government of India based on agriculture cost and value commission for food grain that are consumed throughout the country, have long shelf life and are associated with food security. He said said all state governments purchase crops such as wheat, moong, urad, soybean etc on MSP and Price Support Scheme (PSS).He said, moong and bajra crops have been included within the ambit of MSP. Letters were written to Government of India on October 14, 2014, April 22, 2015 and July 4, 2017 requesting it to include other crops such as henna, chaula, gwar, jeera, coriander, garlic, isabgol, gwarpatha (aloevera), arandi (castor) within MSPs ambit, he added."

The website will incorporate separate sections for uzhavar sandhai (farmers markets), infrastructure monitoring system (godowns etc), farmer producer organisation, supply chain management, eNAM (National Agricultural Marketing) etc.Besides, a comprehensive mobile app where farmers can get information about rain status, storage in reservoirs with past data, flagship schemes including micro irrigation, mission on sustainable dryland agriculture, infrastructure management system, collective farming, area coverage, etc. now used by officials will be updated and made available to the farmers by the end of December.At present, sale of fertilisers is taken care of by around 9,400 private dealers, primary cooperative credit societies. Perhaps, this is the first of its kind in the entire country since we have captured all the block-wise fertiliser dealer details and they are uploading the fertiliser stock position about urea, DAP, MOP, SSP and urea complex. Right now, this app called Agri Stock Monitoring System is used by officials which will be available to farmers soon, an official source said.The app to be released to check seed availability would cover 8,400 seed dealers. Block-wise availability of seeds like black gram, cholam, green gram, paddy etc. can be known from this app. This will give information on how much seed stock is available and also whether certified seed, foundation seed, foundation seed I or II is available with a particular dealer so that the farmer need not waste time.Agri Reporting System (ARS) is another app at present used by around 4,000 officials of the Agriculture department. Information through this app would be incorporated in a comprehensive app being developed.Storage level in all reservoirs in Tamil Nadu and in Krishnaraja Sagar dam in Karnataka including full capacity, current year storage and the last year storage in the same period, inflow and outflow would be provided in the app.Farmers want to know whether crop cutting experiment, which is the basic test for claiming crop loss is completed in their areas. Through this ARS app, the farmer could know whether he is eligible for crop loss in case of some adversities.At present, there are 277 regulated markets and the main objective of this is to avoid mediators and to get the farmers a fair price for their produce. The website to be launched in December first week will give information about the commodities coming to each and every regulated market so that the farmer can decide to which market he can move his produce where he can get a better price, an official said.If a farmer registers his name and place once to know the rates of commodities in particular regulated market, every morning he will get SMSes. The farmer can decide whether he can move his commodities today or tomorrow or whenever, the officials said, and added that the map showing the location of the regulated market and the distance from where the farmer is located can also be known so that he can move the commodities to the nearest place."

Borewells too have dried up. Three months ago, he sowed seeds of korale (browntop millets). I have invested hardly Rs. 2,000 to grow korale. The yield is expected to be around 4 quintals worth about Rs. 12,000, he said.As it was the first time he chose to cultivate millets, he limited it to only one acre. The millet is rich in fibre and many growers keep a major portion of it for personal consumption. When this correspondent visited Mr. Jayannas farm on Friday, Korale Raghu of Sira taluk, who is known for cultivation of korale millet in Tumakuru district, was interacting with local farmers on the importance of millets. Korale cultivation is cost effective. With minimum investment, farmers can register maximum returns, he said. He grows korale millet on 17 acres of land.Earlier, G.V. Raghu, project director of Organisation for Resource Development and Environment Rejuvenation, said: Farmers in the hobli were cultivating potato and maize. Owing to long-time mono-crop cultivation, the yield had come down. Now, hundreds of farmers have grown ragi and they are happy with the yield. His NGO has been engaged in educating farmers on the importance of millet cultivation. Similarly, many have grown foxtail millet, little millet and green gram.V.G. Bhat, District Development Manager (NABARD). said: With the view of holistic development, the bank is encouraging cultivation of minor millets in parts of drought-prone taluks. The bank is happy with the response from the farmers. The bank has spent over Rs. 9 lakh for starting farmer-producer organisations, besides expenses on training, providing seeds and fertilizers."

After the recent low-pressure induced rains, farmers were worried about crop damage. Sources said this kharif season, the sub-division has covered 17,827 hectares (ha) under non-paddy crops, while rest 49,553 ha have been covered under paddy and cereal crops, including raagi, maize, jowar and small millets.Bonai District Agriculture Officer (DAO) P H Kerketta said despite weak and erratic monsoon, both paddy and non-paddy crops in Bonai, Lahunipara, Gurundia and Koida blocks are in good shape. Usually non-paddy crops require less soil moisture and sowing is done late. Similarly, pulses like moong, arhar, biri and cow-pea cultivated in different phases are in flowering, fruiting to harvesting stages, while oil seeds crops, including sesame, are in flowering to fruiting stage and groundnut crops sown early have reached harvesting stage, he added.Kerketta said about 15-20 per cent of paddy crops cultivated early on upland have been harvested, while harvesting of standing paddy crops on medium land would start shortly and on low-land, it would continue till December end. He said due to water-logging following recent low-pressure induced rainfall, negligible portion of ready to harvest paddy crops with no dormancy genetic feature had developed sprouting. But, overall crop condition is very good in the sub-division, he said.Meanwhile, in the transition time to rabi crop season, farmers, after harvesting paddy crops, have readied to sow non-paddy crops on the same farm fields to utilise the residual soil moisture. Sowing of mustard, field-pea and red grams for rabi season would continue till middle of November as after that residual soil moisture may be lost, he added. The agriculture officer, however, informed that cultivation areas for rabi season has not been finalised as different irrigation authorities are yet to prepare programmes.Similarly, vegetable crops cultivated in different phases of the kharif season have also shown good yields."

MMTC has been asked to float tenders. Sources said government agencies have stock of more than 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong dal and these need to be sold off quickly since the shelf life is less in comparison to arhar.""The agency will find if moong can be exported to countries, which have more NRIs.Hardly people from any other origin consume moong dal. Only Nafed has already procured fresh tranche of 40,000 moong dal. We are also taking a number of steps to dispose off arhar, which is in huge quantity,"" said an official.The government has identified government agencies including IRCTC, defence forces, central paramilitary forces and Safal to together lift about one lakh tonnes in a year. Moreover, plans for disposal of another 10 lakh tonnes through government agencies, open market sale and providing the lentils at subsidised rates to states have been planned. The government has also allowed export of arhar and urad.The issue of crashing pulses prices due to bumper supply and also import of cheap yellow peas (matar dal) came up before a group of ministers, which met on Wednesday evening. ""There was almost an unanimity among all those present in the meeting that import duty on yellow peas should be increased substantially. A decision is likely soon,"" said an official.The group also suggested agencies allow export of masur and other pulses so that farmers get a good price."

This weekend, a celebrity chef will promote the brand by cooking up 800 kg of khichdi in a single pan at India Gate, in an attempt for a Guinness Book record. His weighty creation will be distributed to diplomats, to sit uneasily on their kitchen counters alongside the tagliatelle and the sashimi or whatever, according to nationality. In British diplomatic kitchens, it could also go eye to eye with its estranged relation, kedgeree, a colonial breakfast dish chiefly featuring smoked haddock, often eaten cold, thereby transgressing three khichdi taboos.But when was the last time you went in search of a nice khichdi? It is the Brand India food only by government diktat. Had the choice been left to the masses, biryani (mutton, chicken or veg with lurid pink sauce, according to taste) would have won hands down. Like khichdi, biryani has a nationwide footprint. The clincher is that one clearly recalls when one last went looking for a biryani, and firmly resolves to do it again. As soon as possible.But then, even commentators with deep experience of biryani have spoken up for khichdi. In the 14th century, Ibn Batuta wrote of a kishri made of rice and moong dal. The Mughals were not averse to it, either, and Abul Fazl recorded seven variations on the theme. The dish is politically salad bowl-like, in the sense that every region has its own variant, from the khichuri of West Bengal to the pongal of Tamil Nadu. But the question that is engaging the nation is, now that the government has backed khichdi, will it be mandatory to eat it standing up?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

For the past three decades, she has been helping foreign tourists acquaint themselves with traditional cuisines of India.And the meals prepared and served at her house in a true Indian manner always leave foreigners satisfied and with everlasting memories. Hema welcomes foreigners with a garland and tilak. Before they depart, she gives them tamboola as a gift. She uses only plantain leaves to serve the meals. She takes every possible care to ensure that foreigners enjoy fresh food and warm hospitality.Hema also teaches foreigners how to eat food without using spoons and chopsticks. She describes in detail various kinds of ingredients used for preparing the meals and their health benefits. A detailed menu card helps foreigners get familiar with the name of traditional South Indian delicacies. Often, she is seen taking the foreigners to markets to introduce them to local vegetables and spices. The right amount of spices is necessary for a healthy food, she always tells her guests.In our country, we do not use so much of spices and flavours. The South Indian food we had here was very delicious and exotic. The flavours blended so well and the taste was just incredible.

When asked to share the recipe for the same, she said: First cut the ash gourd to small cubes and put them to boil in a vessel. Then grind green chillies, cumin, coconut, coriander leaves, chana dal and moong dal. Once the ash gourd is soft, add the masala and boil. Later, add curd and cook for one boil.

Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Minister of State for Food Processing Sadhvi Niranjan, and yoga guru Baba Ramdev stir the 918-kg concoction.A DRONE camera buzzed around, as did a relentless dragonfly, as 125 kg rice, 45 kg moong dal, 20 kg vegetables, 6.5 kg salt, many kilograms of jowar and bajra, and dollops of desi ghee, went into catapulting the humble khichdi to reluctant stardom at the government-organised World Food India 2017 here on Saturday.In the process, as a proud Minister for Food Processing Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Minister of State for Food Processing Sadhvi Niranjan, and yoga guru Baba Ramdev beamed, the 918-kg concoction also felled a Guinness World record.This is Indias gift to the rest of the world, declared Baba Ramdev, who stirred the mixture with an oar-like ladle, along with the two ministers, as the team of 30 chefs led by Sanjeev Kapoor watched. Ramdev had earlier announced on Twitter he would be at hand to temper the khichdi with his Patanjali ghee. Swasthya ka naya mantra: Bharat ki Khichdi (The new trick to health: Indias khichdi). This is also PM Narendra Modis favourite dish Maybe one day we will celebrate World Khichdi Day like we now celebrate World Yoga Day, he said.We will now pack it in insulated containers and Akshay Patra Foundation and Food Relief will take it across the city to feed the needy, said Kapoor, adding he was very happy with the outcome. He said that the recipe, created by him and his team, had undergone many trials over the last two months  from a watery version to one with jowar and bajra.About all that went into the Saturday mix, chef Akshay Nayyar said, We designed the vessel 25 days ago, had to measure the volume to attempt something big make sure logistics were in place. Its a steam-charged vessel powered by a boiler because India Gate is a no-fire zone. We began by soaking the rice and chopping the veggies at 3 am.The last touch was added on Saturday at 1 pm, with the sprinkling of curry leaves.But the job was not done. A crane was then brought in to lift the cone-like vessel holding the khichdi, and over a delicate 20-minute process ensuring nothing was spilled, placed on a weighing machine. When the scales showed 918 kg, minus the vessel weight, smiles broke out all around. The minimum requirement to create a world record was 500 kg. The category: the largest serving of beans and rice.Guinness World Records Project Manager Paulina Sapinska, on stand by following an invitation from Kapoor and the Ministry of Food Processing Industries, said, We are still waiting for a few pieces of evidence. For the time being, I am happy to announce that this (khichdi) wins the Guinness World title.It was Sapinskas second trip to India within a week to witness a record.Also at hand watching was Denmark Food Minister Esben Lunde Larsen, apart from executives of several corporations. We can renew our own kitchen with your culinary traditions, starting with khichdi, Larsen promised.The three-day event, being organised along with industry body CII and featuring traditional food from more than 20 states, was inaugurated by PM Modi on Friday.Badal, who has been fighting off some steam over reports that khichdi was being promoted as Brand India Food, on Saturday said, The beauty of khichdi is that everyone has eaten it. To rope in the rest, the government plans to popularise the dish and recipe through its foreign missions.The few members of the public at the event though werent too convinced.

Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor.On Saturday, when chef Sanjeev Kapoor answered Union Food Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badals call to position the khichdi as gourmet fare, he was performing a feat that many khansamas in Mughal kitchens were required to accomplish for their livelihoods. The 17th-century text, Khulasat-i-Makulat u Mashrubat notes how the one-pot rice and lentil dish had to be adapted for fine dining. Fry garlic, onion rings, cinnamon and cumin. Remove the mixture from the fire and set it aside. Fry mung dal in ghee. Add rice and mix well. Add the spice mixture along with ginger and hot water. Finally add ghee and slow cook to finish, describes a recipe in the cookbook written during Aurangzebs time. The sixth Mughal Emperor was so fond of the dish that he gave it his name  Alamgiri khichdi.There is food that marks opulence and indulgence and there are dishes that denote simplicity. Despite its association with royalty, the khichdi remained a quintessentially unostentatious fare. In the 16th and 17th century, writes food historian Lizzie Collingham, the staple food of the rural peasants and also of the urban artisans and labourers was khichdi. Every region had a variation on the recipe, according to which grain they grew. Thus millet sometimes replaced the rice or chickpeas were used instead of lentils.Historically, in much of the world, kingly kitchens set the standards of high-class cooking. The khichdi too wasnt impervious to social differentiation. But despite the embellishments by the royal chefs, it was its simplicity that made the khichdi the favourite of Mughal emperors. Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor. Akbar  unlike Aurangzeb in almost every other manner  was an even more frugal eater than his great-grandson. Abul Fazl, his minister and biographer, notes that the emperor would fast on certain days, avoid eating flesh and usually eat khichdi.For Akbars son, Jahangir, the dish was almost therapeutic in his long-battles against alcoholism. It is not devoid of flavour and it suited me well. I ordered that on days of abstinence when I partake of dishes not made of flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichdi, the fourth Mughal emperor wrote in his memoir, The Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri.The food historian Colleen Taylor Sen writes that Jahangir had acquired the love for the dish during his campaigns in Gujarat. A food that is particular to the people of Gujarat is the bajra khichdi, a mixture of split peas and millet boiled together, Jahangir writes in The Tuzuk. His chefs though had to devise a more spectacular version, lazeezan  lamb, nuts and saffron were combined with rice and moong dal  when the emperor was in a mood to indulge.In modern times, Michelin-starred chefs have tried to tread the path of their predecessors in kitchens of Mughal emperors. There is a Black Olive Khichdi served with Rosemary Chilli Tikka and Chilli Pipette. There is a broccoli khichdi and a lobster khichdi. And there is a version that has almost 50 ingredients. But some dishes seem at odds with restaurants. They evoke the warmth of homes, aromas of kitchens and the fraternity of shared meals. The decorum of fine dining might not have any place for the unhinged licking of fingers after a meal of khichdi and brinjal fritters  or fried fish.It remains to be seen if the food ministrys enterprise turns the one-pot rice and lentil dish into the countrys culinary brand. But the dish may still hold its own in restaurants. After all, people eat less regularly at homes today. However, there is very little chance that the modern-day eater seeking comfort food will enjoy her rice and lentil meal like the 17th-century soldiers who the French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier found making khichdi more luxurious by dipping their fingers in bowls of melted ghee as they ate.kaushik.dasgupta@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

On the cards is a direct fight between the Congress and the ruling BJP in the Chitrakoot Assembly constituency scheduled for Thursday. The counting would take place on November 12.The BJP has fielded Shankarlal Tripathi while the Congress has pitted Neelandhu Chaturvedi. The seat fell vacant after the death of Congress legislator Prem Singh.In a clear sign of how important the by-poll is, both parties have commissioned top leaders to lead the charge.Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is camping for three days in the constituency seen as a Congress stronghold. ""Your mama will fulfil the promise. Moong at Rs 1,455 per quintal, moongfali Rs 780 per quintal. Tell me from your heart, can any Chief Minister do this? People said we will be ruined and nothing will be left but I said Lord Ram will help us,"" he said in his pitch to a crowd of farmers and their families.The Congress's Jyotiraditya Scindia, frontrunner for the party's Chief Ministerial candidate, is using the Ram Mandir issue to attack the BJP. Senior leader Kamal Nath is targeting alleged corruption and bad administration. Mr Nath reiterated his support for Jyotiraditya Scindia and said ""I'll support anyone, I want youth to get employment, farmers should be happy.""Chitrakoot is also crucial for Congress's Ajay Singh - the leader of the opposition. Prem Singh, the Congress MLA whose death necessitated the poll, was his father Arjun Singh's loyalist. Voters in Chitrakoot are from three main castes Brahmin, Thakur and Kurmi. The Congress and BJP both have pitched Brahmin candidates to try and tap the 40 per cent Brahmin votes."

Photo: MintNew Delhi: With major crop prices plunging below minimum support prices (MSPs), farmers are likely to lose an estimated Rs35,968 crore in earnings for the kharif season, a coalition of farmers organizations said on Thursday.In the two weeks to 7 November, farmers have incurred a loss of Rs6,283 crore, having sold crops at lower than their support price, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a coalition of over 180 farmer unions, said.The AIKSCC numbers on loss to farm incomes were arrived at after a comparison of average wholesale prices in mandis (regulated farmer markets) and MSPs announced by the centre. The analysis was done for seven major kharif (summer) cropspaddy, maize, bajra, soybean, groundnut, cotton and uradby taking into account market arrivals and a weighted average of modal prices in major growing states.After four droughts, farmers have been hit by three successive seasons of low crop prices, the coalition said in a statement. The estimates, it added, are conservative as the actual prices at which farmers are selling their produce are often lower than official wholesale prices.The coalition also said, citing data published by the agriculture ministry, that for several crops the government-fixed MSPs are lower than the cost of production as calculated by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. These include crops like jowar where the support price is 19% lower than the cost of production and pulses like moong for which the MSP is 2% lower than the production cost.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised before the 2014 general election that MSPs will be fixed at 50% above the cost of production. However, of the 14 kharif crops, the MSPs of seven have been fixed lower than the (C2 or comprehensive) cost of production, the coalition said. Assuming an MSP at 50% over costs, farmers will lose an estimated Rs2 trillion going by current mandi prices, the coalition said.The government has set a target to double farmer incomes (by 2022), but even after successive years of normal rains their losses are mounting, said Yogendra Yadav, a farmers leader and a member of the coalition. Our estimate does not take into account losses suffered by growers of horticulture crops like potatoes and onion for which there are no MSPs but farmers are selling at a loss, Yadav added.Analysts agreed with the farmers analysis.The actual losses to farmers may be a little lower on account of government procurement of crops like paddy, but overall the analysis is fair, said Himanshu, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, and a Mint columnist. There is little doubt that crop prices are plunging and that is due to a serious demand deflation in the economy.The coalition also unveiled a social media campaign. AIKSCC which has been at the forefront of farmer agitations across several states, also announced a farmers protest in Delhi on 20 November with demands for remunerative prices and loan waivers."

The pilot project covers the entire state.At Agar-Malwa mandi farmers beat up some employees and traders some time back agitated over forming of an alleged cartel by traders to bring down the prices. There were reports of protests from farmers at several other mandis too including Bhopal compelling chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan to monitor the scheme on his own and preponing the payment to the farmers for sale of their produce up to October 31.Sitaram Kurmi, the farmer who allegedly made an attempt to end his life told media persons in Damoh he was offered about Rs 1300 par quintal for his Urad crop. He was reeling under a debt of more than Rs 1.5 lakh.Principal secretary Agriculture Rajesh Rajora said Rs 248.30 crore would be disbursed among 1.55 lakh farmers registered under the scheme for sale of their produce amounting to 509619 metric tonnes between October 16 and October 30, 2017.He admitted that the payment was being preponed in view of confusion prevailing among farmers on payment issue. As per the scheme the farmers were to be given the amount after sale of their produce was over for kharif crop in December.Rajora said in several states these crops were being bought by the respective government under MSP but the fact remained that they had capped upper limit up to a marginal percentage of the produce.Like, he added, in Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Telangana only about 3 lakh metric tonnes of soybean was purchased whereas the produce in these states put together stood at about 50 lakh metric tonnes. Whereas in Madhya Pradesh soybean arrival in mandis was expected more than 30 lakh metric tonnes under Bhavantar scheme.Rajora claimed several states including Maharashtra had shown interest in implementing the scheme. The Central government too was taking feedback from Madhya Pradesh at regular intervals so that the scheme could be implemented well across the country.Madhya Pradesh State Agriculture Marketing Board managing director Faiz Ahmad Kidwai said it was wrong to say that rates at mandis had fallen due to Bhavantar scheme.National general secretary Rashtriya Kisan Majdoor Sangh Ravidutt Singh said, The farmers in the state think they are going to get the difference amount between the MSP rate and the rate on which they sell their produce. They are hardly aware of model rate. The traders are also misleading them by purchasing the produce at very low price and saying to the farmers that the difference amount will be paid to them by the government under Bhavantar scheme."

Moreover, the country imported about 5 million tonnes pulses last fiscal, leading to huge availability in the domestic market and a price crash.The government is expecting bumper output even this year and it is also sitting on 1.8 million tonnes of buffer stock.The annual domestic demand is around 24 million tonnes.""The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA) has given its approval for removal of prohibition on export of all types of pulses to ensure that farmers have greater choice in marketing their produce and in getting better remuneration for their produce,"" an official statement said.The decision comes two months after the government lifted ban on export of tur, urad and moong dal, although shipments of these varieties were allowed only through permission from agriculture export promotion body APEDA. Exports of organic pulses and kabuli chana is permitted in a limited quantity.Briefing media, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, ""Opening of exports of all types of pulses will help the farmers dispose of their products at remunerative prices and encourage them to expand the area of sowing"".The CCEA empowered the committee headed by food secretary to review the export and import policy on pulses and consider measures such as quantitative restrictions, prior registration and changes in import duties depending on domestic production and demand, local and international prices and global trade volumes, he said.Export of pulses will provide an alternative market for the surplus production of pulses, he said, adding that it will also help the country and its exporters regain markets.""It is expected that pulses production will be sustained in the country and our import dependence on pulses will come down substantially,"" the statement said.The decision to remove export curbs will lead to integration with global supply chain, helping farmers adopt good agricultural practices and achieve better productivity.The government said it has taken a number of steps to sustain high pulses production and procured 20 lakh tonnes of pulses directly from the farmers by ensuring minimum support price or market rates, whichever is higher.Welcoming the move, India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) Chairman Pravin Dongre said it will correct price distortions, offer support to pulses selling below MSP (minimum support price) and revitalise the milling industry.""We believe this step will improve the returns to farmers and potentially open up greater investments in the sector,"" he added. Recently, the government had imposed quantitative restrictions on some of the pulses to check cheaper imports.For the year 2017-18, the government has fixed a target of 22.90 million tonnes of pulses production."

Photo: MintNew Delhi: Ahead of the crucial Gujarat assembly elections, the centre last week raised import duties on a range of edible oils, in a bid to support growers who are bearing losses due to plunging domestic prices.On 17 November, India, the largest importer of edible oils globally, raised import duties on crude palm oil from 15% to 30% and that of refined soybean oil from 25% to 40%. While the duty on crude soybean oil was raised from 17.5% to 30%, import duty on refined soybean oil was raised from 20% to 35%.The hike in import duties on edible oil is the highest in a decadein a bid to encourage farmers at homeand comes ahead of the Gujarat assembly elections in December. For the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), retaining Gujarat, which it has ruled for over two decades, is crucial as results in the state can set the mood for the general elections in 2019.Gujarat is a major producer of groundnut contributing about 40% to Indias total production of the oilseed.In September, the Gujarat government had announced it will procure groundnuts at Rs4,500 per quintal as local prices plunged to Rs3,000 per quintal. In October, the state government also announced a bonus of Rs500 per quintal on public procurement of cotton, over and above the centres announcement of minimum support price (MSP) of Rs4,020 per quintal.The hike in import tax is also likely to benefit growers of soybean and the largest producing state of Madhya Pradesh, where assembly elections are likely by the end of next year.Beyond the hike in import duty on pulses, the government has also freed up exports of all varieties of pulses as a surge in domestic supply pulled down prices way below the MSPs announced by the government.Free export of pulses will provide an alternative market for farmers at remunerative prices and help exporters regain markets, the centre said on 16 November, following cabinet approval to allow exports. Earlier in November, the government also hiked the import duty on yellow peas to 50% to support domestic growers of pulses like chana, urad and moong beans.Do these duty revisions signal a policy shift to help farmers at the cost of higher prices for consumers?Of late there is a shift from consumer centric policies to keep (food) inflation low which caused significant farm distress in the past two years, said Ashok Gulati, agriculture chair professor at Delhi-based Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.This also signifies that at a political level BJP has realised that the reality is far from what they promised farmers... with prices of pulses and oilseed at historical lows compared to support prices they are hoping that the reversal in trade policies will help them in elections, Gulati added."

Turns out, about 56,000 quintals (56 lakh kg) of wheat has been left to rot in various warehouses across the state over the last couple of years.Just to give you an idea of what that means: According to National Sample Survey 2011-12, an average rural Indian consumes about 4.3 kg of wheat in a month. This means, the grain being wasted now could feed at least 13 lakh individuals for a month.The huge pile of rotting wheat in almost all districts has caught the government off-guard, and it is now clueless, not only on how to ascertain quality, but also on how best it can dispose of the rotting wheat.An estimation by thehas revealed that 55,999 quintal of wheat is rotting away in the departments warehouses. The department has sought reports from all districts on the quality of wheat and whether it is fit for human consumption after being stored for so long.The department has also ordered a high-level inquiry to find out why such a huge pile up of wheat was not brought to the governments notice earlier.Sources in the Food and Civil Supplies Department told Bangalore Mirror that the government had initially announced that it would give 3 kg rice per person along with 2 kg wheat. During that time, it was receiving about 2.5 lakh metric tonnes of wheat from the Centre for distribution under the Public Distribution System (), annually.As the government chose to distribute 5 kg rice undersubsequently, which has now been increased to 7 kg per person, the distribution of wheat was completely stopped, resulting in the huge pile-up, a senior official from the department said.Food and Civil Supplies Minister UT Khader told Bangalore Mirror they are finding ways to dispose of this huge quantity of wheat. Considering our supply of 2.5 lakh tonnes, the present pile up of about 56,000 quintal is only a small amount. We are trying our best to clear the stock. First, we will verify whether it is fit for human consumption. All the districts have been ordered to get their stock tested at the food laboratories for quality. Once we get the quality reports, we will decide whether it can be distributed to people or used to feed animals, Khader said.Officials of the department explained to Bangalore Mirror that regular fumigation was taken up at these warehouses to prevent degradation of the grains.Generally, the food grains are stored in a scientific manner and the floor is covered with fine quality tarpaulin. If the district administration has failed to ensure these measures, then there are chances that the food grains are spoilt. We will conduct quality tests for wheat that was stored for a long time. If the results are negative, it will be given to animals. If the tests declare it unfit even for animals, then we may have to dispose it of in some other manner, an official attached with a warehouse insaid.So, though the government is clearing all its stock of salt, ragi, sugar, palm oil and green gram, only in the case of wheat, it has chosen to await the quality report from various district centres."

As per reports, the department has planned to grow different crops including paddy, pulses, oilseeds, vegetable and condiments over 67,650 hectares (ha) of land during 2017-2018 rabi season. Crops over 67,064 ha were grown during 2016-2017.

There is crop loss due to heavy infestation of Brown Plant Hopper (BPH) in paddy crop during kharif season. A special drive will be undertaken to create awareness among farmers for control of BPH in irrigated area where rabi paddy will be grown, he added."

Some other candidates too used innovative ways to bribe voters but the brazenness with which Dhinakaran went about it was mind-boggling.All this happened under the nose of the EC, which had taken unprecedented steps to reduce malpractices, including transferring out the entire rank and file of police and revenue departments. And for the first time ever, as many as five observers were deployed in a constituency. Yet, mysterious power cuts at night, token distribution for redeeming on a later date and interesting catchphrases like Prayed to the Lord? ensured the goodies reached the targeted voters.This time around, the EC has imposed tougher norms. It has already restricted door-to-door campaigning to daytime since allurements are often delivered after sundown. At night, paramilitary forces would comb the lanes and bylanes, so people carrying wads of money at night in RK Nagar better watch out. Transactions through tokens too have been banned till the by-election is over.However, with the law of supply and demand at work, candidates will still look for innovative ways to reward voters who see elections as payback time. So, besides educating voters on the value of the vote, it is for the EC to put the fear of god in the wrongdoers. Also, it ought to stay neutral, act upon all complaints in the shortest possible time and deliver exemplary punishment to the offenders. That alone will make it a free and fair by-election and ensure parties treat the EC with the dignity it deserves."

However, payment has been delayed citing funds crunch though the State Government has created a corpus fund of `100 crore to help out the farmers. Farmers in many parts of the State are waiting to get their dues for the last seven months.Sources, however, maintained that OSSC has withdrawn only ` 60 crore so far from the fund. Though the State Government stood guarantee for `40 crore loan, OSSC authorities have so far not taken the loan. This has led to fund crunch in the corporation resulting in unnecessary delay in payment of dues to the farmers.Farmers alleged that they are supposed to get the first instalment of the dues while supplying the seeds and the rest within one month of the seeds clearing the testing process. Delay in receiving the payment has hampered their preparation for the rabi crop, they added.Meanwhile, though the State Government had asked district Collectors to submit reports on crop loss due to untimely rains in the second week of November, it is yet to receive reports from all the districts. The Government had announced that farmers will be paid compensation within seven days of receiving the reports."

Consequently, the affected families have been moved to a church, a marriage hall and a school in the village.Whenever the flow in Tamirabharani is abundant, the water would enter the sea through six estuary points. As the flow had dwindled a lot due to poor rainfall over the past two years, sand had got accumulated in five points and only one point was free for the water to enter the sea. Since the river was in spate, the existing single estuary point was not sufficient to drain the water into the sea. So, the water entered our hamlet, say the villagers, who have urged the officials to remove the sand accumulated in the other five points.After the gale and rain caused serious sea erosion in their hamlet, the fishermen of Periyathaazhai have urged the district administration to extend the existing groyne by another 700 metres.The match industry in Kovilpatti has suffered a huge loss as the downpour had hit production. Owners of various units have been unable to fulfil their commitment. Finished goods worth several crores could not be sent in lorries to northern States.After a gap of two years, the Eppothumventran reservoir, in which 120 million cubic feet water can be stored, is overflowing thanks to good rainfall in Kayathar, Kadambur, Maniyaachi and Kazhugumalai areas. As the reservoir has sufficient storage, farmers of Eppothumventran, Kaattunaickenpatti, Aathanur and nearby areas can carry out farming operations on 837.78 hectares.At the same time, the rain has affected crops such as maize, cotton, black gram, green gram, onion and chilly cultivated at Keezha Vilaaththikulam, Kamalapuram, Zamin Karisalkulam, Sivagnanapuram, Jakkammalpuram, Marthandampatti, T.

JhaNew Delhi: Rahul Gandhi on Tuesday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had nothing new to offer as he was only talking about ""the Congress and me"" at his Gujarat election rallies instead of responding to critical questions of governance and future of the people.""Yesterday (Monday), I saw Modiji's speech. Modiji talked about the Congress party and me. In over 60 per cent of the speech...he said the Congress is this, Congress is that...this election is not about the Congress or the BJP. The election is just about the future of the people of Gujarat. Modiji did not talk about what he plans to do for your future,"" Rahul told a rally in Anjar.Congress leaders expressed shock at the Prime Minister's decision to attack their party over internal democracy and one Shehzad Poonawalla, who wanted to contest against Rahul for the party president's post. They said Modi's reliance on Poonawalla, a non-entity in the Congress, only showed his desperation amid lurking trouble in Gujarat.At one rally, Modi asked people whether India was now being hailed in US, Germany, Japan, Britain or not. He has been repeatedly telling people Jawaharlal Nehru was anti-Gujarat, how Sardar Patel was ignored, that the Congress created hurdles to Gujarat's development since Independence and stories about Indira Gandhi's alleged enmity with Morarji Desai.The BJP has also raised questions about Rahul's temple visits, prompting the Congress to ask if the BJP now controls personal faith. Rahul said: ""I am asking questions about development and governance everyday but Modiji is not answering. He will rather talk about the past. He will talk about the Congress but not about your future.""On Monday, the Congress vice-president had asked about rising prices of essential commodities, with some items dearer by over 70 per cent, while also raising questions about women's safety.At Tuesday's rally, Rahul slammed the so-called ""Gujarat model"". ""You told me things that are different from what the BJP said. The Gujarat model was only the Modi model of development - for the benefit of a few corporate houses. Every section of the society is now agitated. This is why Modiji only talks about the Congress party and not the real concerns of the people.""Rahul described the Congress manifesto released on Monday as ""the voice of the people of Gujarat"" and said ""we can give you a golden future"".""We will form the government in Gujarat and take decisions only after listening to you. The Congress chief minister will not take decisions like note-bandi and Gabbar Singh Tax,"" he said, alluding to GST.Rahul pointed out that Modi boasts about his anti-corruption crusade but remains silent on specific questions like the Rafale deal and allegations against Jay Shah, BJP president Amit Shah's son. ""Truth cannot remain hidden forever.""Realising Modi had a better rapport with the people as he was a Gujarati himself, Rahul tried to tug at emotions.""My sister (Priyanka) came to my house yesterday. She said everything in your kitchen is Gujarati - Khakra, achaar, moongfali (groundnut)... You have spoiled my habit. I am gaining weight.""Rahul had to cancel three of his four rallies on Tuesday because of bad weather. His programmes for Wednesday and Thursday have also been cancelled because of cyclone Ockhi.

More than five months on, no FIR has been registered.A group of farmers are sitting on dharna for the past one month demanding a CBI inquiry into pulse scam in Narsinghpur. There has been no action on their demand. So far.In reply to a question in the recently concluded winter session of MP Assembly, agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen has replied on December 4 that, In case of 116 people who sold 4493.36 quintals of moong and 189 people who had sold 6233.23 quintals of tuar, it could not be verified whether they are farmers.This approximately 10,500 quintals of moong and tuar is worth Rs 7 crore.The state government doesnt procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the temper of farmers who staged violent protests across state in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. However, this quantity was far more than the the total average yield of the pulses that were sown in the tehsil.Subsequently, a probe was ordered into the case. While these procurements were made in June last year, the investigations are not over yet. A total of four probe committees have probe the issue till now and the fifth was constituted a couple of days ago at local administration level.District collector Narsinghpur, Abhay Verma said, I have constituted a team to probe and verify the credentials of the farmers who could not be verified till now. And will be getting the report within a week.The procurement agency appointed in this case by state government was Markfed. When contacted, managing director of the Markfed, Dhyaneshwar B Patil told TOI, The inquiry is going on and payments of the genuine farmers have been made, only the payment of those who are suspected or who could not be verified till now has been withheld. Instructions have also been given to take strict action against the erring officials and samiti people and it is going on, managing director of Markfed, Patil said."

Now, the CVC guideline says you cannot negotiate with anyone other than the lowest bidder. So, if you have identified the lowest bidder, you can negotiate with them. But how do you negotiate with someone and then prove that was the lowest, he said, after releasing a book related to surgical strikes.Parrikar said Antonys strange noting had ensured that the file just went around in circles. It was going around like an LP stuck in a particular groove and the same sentence is repeated time and again. For two-and-a-half years, the file was going around in circles. We broke the circle by deciding to approach it differently for the defence of the country, he said.Dismissing Congress criticism of him and for trying to make Rafale deal a poll issue for the Gujarat elections, Parrikar said: I realised that these people dont know anything about defence. A fighter aircraft is not only an aircraft. The aircraft is probably the smaller part of the total cost. The real cost comes in special equipment. In India, we discuss fighter aircraft purchases like we discuss tur dal or moong dal prices.Defence has an important role to play in foreign diplomacy and is an important component of any governments relations with international community, he said.Hard power and soft power played through diplomacy can gain momentum only if the hard power is very strong. I am proud to be a part of the team which was part of the surgical team in eastern and western boarders of India, he said.Giving a glimpse into the surgical strikes preparations, he said it was planned with mobile phones switched off and kept at least 20m away so that there were no leaks.I am very proud to say that I must have had between Uri attack and the actual (surgical) strike, something like 18-19 meetings, which included number of Army top brass and also the officials of defence ministries, but nothing leaked out. Even flying some officers to foreign capital make on-the-spot purchases was not leaked, he said.Recalling what his mother told him, Parrikar said: My mother used to tell me this proverb: When you enter a jungle to hunt for a rabbit, you should be prepared for a lion."

The issue has generated a debate whether farmers of both the states should continue to cultivate paddy to contribute to the national foodgrain buffer stock or diversify into other crops and conserve their vital natural resources like water and soil.The Union government had started a programme Bringing Green Revolution in East India (BGREI) in 2010-11 to increase the output of foodgrains, especially paddy in seven eastern states to raise their agricultural output and reduce their dependence on the Centre to feed their population. As paddy output in these provinces goes up in coming years, the Centre may not procure rice from Punjab and Haryana, which could trigger a crisis in both states, if they dont adopt alternative crops and create a marketing system for farmers to sell their produce.While this could harm the interest of Punjab and Haryana farmers in the shortterm, it also could enable them to shift to other crops and allied sector activities like horticulture, dairying and agro-forestry to name a few to augment their incomes and learn ways to market their produce efficiently.Leading farm scientists and agri-economists have been suggesting the area under paddy cultivation in the region must be reduced. Speaking about reducing the area under paddy in Punjab, former vice-chancellor of Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Professor Kirpal Singh Aulakh , said, It is long overdue. I think it is a great opportunity to move to other crops as Punjab was never a paddy-growing state. It all started with the Green Revolution as paddy replaced crops like maize, groundnut and pulses. Today nearly 60% of Punjabs total geographical area is under paddy cultivation during kharif season, which is not a healthy trend. It is time to curtail rice cultivation as it is depleting groundwater of Punjab and also poses a threat to environment with the practice of stubble burning.He said to wean farmers away from water-guzzling paddy and, hence, stop the practice of stubble burning, they should be given an assurance of fair price for their other kharif crops like maize, urad (black gram) and moong (green gram). If farmers get the same return from maize or vegetables or pulses, there is no reason why they could not move away from paddy, said Prof Aulakh.Former professor of economics at PAU, Prof P S Rangi , who served as the marketing consultant in the Punjab State Farmers Commission (PSFC), said continuous cultivation of paddy was playing havoc with the environment and natural resources of Punjab. The sooner the farmers shift from paddy to other crops the better. However, they must be provided with the infrastructure to switch to other crops or allied activities so that their returns dont drop by moving away from paddy. For instance, cold chains are the need of the hour for supporting fruits and vegetable growers as these perishable commodities. This can enable farmers to get much higher returns than conventional crops like wheat and paddy, he observed."

The Opposition indicated it will corner the government on issues including farm loan waivers.S. SudarshanA day before the winter session of the Legislative Assembly, the Congress and NCP on Sunday criticised the BJP-led State government for failing to implement the farm loan waiver scheme, and for not addressing issues of cotton farmers.Congress leader and Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Legislative Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said, The government has made several mistakes in implementing the loan waiver scheme. The figures are wrong and the company processing the data has also made several mistakes. The loan waiver announcement was made in June; till today, there is no data to show how many farmers have actually received waivers. He also said the government hasnt addressed the troubles of farmers who lost their soyabean crop, and those of cotton farmers whose crop is under attack by pink bollworms.Senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar demanded a district- and Assembly constituency-wise list of farmers whose loans have been waived. Without this list, Im not going to believe that this government has implemented the scheme.Last week, the State government claimed to have waived outstanding loans of 9.43 lakh farmers, and paid Rs. 5,141 crore to the banks. Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil had said the process of waiving loans and extending benefits to those repaying them regularly will be completed in two weeks.Dhananjay Munde, LoP in the Legislative Council, said, The government pats its own back for the loan waiver scheme, but many farmers have committed suicide since June. Dnyaneshwar Misal, a farmer who ended his life recently, had written to Ministers about his plight. When nobody responded, he finally ended his life.Mr. Munde demanded a compensation of Rs. 25,000 per acre be given to cotton farmers, and said he had personally written to the CM when Central government institutes had issued a warning for pink bollworms. The figures for the purchase of produce including foodgrains, soyabean and moong are discouraging. The government-run procurement centres have purchased 2.16 lakh quintals of soyabean of the 357 lakh quintal produced in the State. Similarly, of the 14 lakh quintal udid produced, only two lakh quintal has been purchased. Of the 13 lakh quintal of moong , only 39,000 kg has been bought so far. This will not help farmers in any way.Mr. Vikhe-Patil accused the government of being authoritarian, claiming it has decided to not share information with the Opposition. The government has constituted a committee comprising three senior secretaries to provide recommendations for information sought by MLAs through RTI. This is an unethical control of information, and the government shouldnt be doing so.Crime on the riseReferring to data from the National Crime and Records Bureau (NCRB), Mr. Vikhe-Patil said, Maharashtra is reporting higher number of killings and farmer suicides, and its cyber crime rate is second-highest in the country. This government arrests leaders like Yashwant Sinha, while a notorious criminal of Nagpur, Munna Yadav, is free and safe. He also alleged Mr. Yadav is close to Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, and claimed that if the police intend to arrest him, they could check the CMs phone.Without this list [of beneficiary farmers], Im not going to believe that this government has implemented the [loan waiver] schemeAjit PawarSenior NCP leader"

As usual, they boycotted the customary tea party organized by the chief minister.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis says one thing and the cooperation minister says the opposite. Who are we supposed to believe? The truth must come out. We will present whatever information we get in the house, said Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil, leader of opposition in state assembly on Sunday while addressing the customary press conference.Dhananjay Munde, leader of opposition in legislative council, said that NCP had taken out a protest rally in Vidarbha and the rallyists had not met a single farmer who had got loan waiver. The government has kept the loan waiver conditions so tough that very few people are eligible, he added.Vikhe-Patil further said that loan waiver scheme was even otherwise a failure as 1,500 farmers had committed suicide after it was announced on June 24. Dnyaneshwar Misar, a farmer from Washim district, recently committed suicide after two state government ministers Sadabhau Khot and Rajkumar Badole refused to extend any help to him, he added.The Congress leader stressed that government should not have gone for online submission of forms for loan waiver. In spite of online process, there were cases of bogus certificates. The secretary of information technology department was sent on forced leave and then transferred for his mismanagement. This shows that the decision was wrong, he further said.Munde claimed that cotton growers of the state had suffered a loss of Rs30,000 crore due to boll worm attack. We will demand a relief of Rs25,000 per acre for them. Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR) had warned the government about boll worm attack last year. I too had written a letter to the chief minister. However, no action was taken and the cotton growers suffered, he said.The NCP leader further said that government had started purchasing various crops only because of the winter session. Till December 7, out of 357 lakh quintal soyabean only 2 lakh quintal had been purchased. Only 2 lakh of the total 14 lakh quintal urad had been purchased and only 39,000 quintal of moong out of the total 13 lakh quintal produced has been purchased, he added.Former deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar charged that the BJP-Shiv Sena government had made the state bankrupt. The debt burden has increased to Rs4.5 lakh crore. Now they have imposed a 30% cut on all expenses and are going to sack 30% of the workforce, he said. State Congress chief Ashok Chavan and state NCP chief Sunil Tatkare were also present in the press conference."
5b27f0839855b720524c2acf,'Regressive' tag on condom ad curfew,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/regressive-tag-on-condom-ad-curfew-193190?ref=india-new-stry,2017-12-13,"Anita JoshuaNew Delhi: The information and broadcasting ministry could undo decades of progress on sexual and reproductive health by banning condom ads on TV between 6am and 10pm and such restrictions are futile in an age when children have unfettered access to the Internet, many feel.While the National Commission for the Protection of Child Rights welcomed the move, as did many others, the critics appeared to have the upper hand in the chatter on social media.The critics saw the decision as not just regressive but also a setback to years of efforts of public health professionals and activists to de-stigmatise condoms and make conversations about safe sex less awkward.Ironically, the advisory, issued on Monday, coincided with the release of the first national study of the incidence of abortion and unintended pregnancy in India.The study showed that 15.6 million abortions were performed in India in 2015. As many as 81 per cent of these were drug-induced, indicating early termination which is largely considered as unplanned pregnancy.Among the first to fire a salvo was former information and broadcasting minister Manish Tewari. ""Not allowing condom Ads 6AM to 10PM is silly. If ASCI (Advertising Standards Council of India)/MIB unhappy with A provocative Ad they should have banned it but to presume that Contraception is a nightly necessity smacks of Victorian Prudery that MOCKS the humungous population control challenge,"" the Congress leader tweeted.Many activists, particularly those working for the control of HIV/AIDS, said the advisory would push back the discourse on safe sex by at least 20 years.V. Sam Prasad, country programme director of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, said this was a return to the pre-Nirodh advertisement age on Doordarshan. Nirodh was the first condom brand produced in India and Doordarshan used to air its ad.Former Union minister Milind Deora pointed out that India aired condom ads on national TV back in the 1980s and 1990s too. ""Ads were sensuous, provocative and educative, encouraging consenting adults to use protection. In 2017, condom ads are banned. Are we moving forward or backward?"" he tweeted.While the ministry cited the perceived titillation in condom ads as the reason for limiting its airtime to the late night hours on the assumption that children do not watch TV at that time, many questioned the logic since films and other personal products also use the same marketing strategy.""There are enough studies to show that Indian children these days are making their 'sexual debut' at the age of 13-14. The condom ads on TV are tame compared to what they access on the Internet,"" Prasad said.Poonam Muttreja, executive director of the Population Foundation of India, found it curious that when the health ministry was pushing contraceptive use with specific focus on spacing methods for family planning, the information and broadcasting ministry was ""poised to undo decades of progress on sexual and reproductive health"".""What we need is a more sensitive approach without compromising on information and advocating for sexual and reproductive choice. If ads are a way to create the demand for safe sex and family planning, then we need to ensure that it is not stifled by restrictions. Like in the film industry, we can grade ads by content and slot their telecast accordingly instead of removing all ads,"" Muttreja said."

Of them, 12,805 ended lives due to continuous crop failure, mounting debts and recovery drive launched by the creditors, including banks.The governments reply came in response to a query by leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil , deputy opposition leader Vijay Wadettiwar, Saoner MLA Sunil Kedar, Buldhana MLA Harshwardhan Sapkal, Arvi MLA Amar Kale and others.Relief and rehabilitation minister Chandrakant (Dada) Patil said the government would be granting Rs1 lakh compensation to the families of farmers who ended their lives. Citing a GR of October 05, 2010, he said the children of such farmers were accorded priority in government jobs, not coming under the Maharashtra Public Service Commission (MPSC).Earlier, the members asked whether over 50,000 farmers took the extreme step since the start of millennium due to crop failure and ever mounting debts. They also sought answers on a number of farmer suicides in Marathwada.Patil, in his reply, stated that from January to August 15, about 580 farmers in Marathwada committed suicide, whereas in Beed district, about 115 ended their lives.The legislators earlier claimed that due to incessant rains in August, the standing crops of cotton, soyabean, sorghum, and moong were severally damaged. Crops spread over 5.71 lakh hectares were destroyed, which led to farmers going into distress and ending their lives. But the minister categorically denied it stating those were not only reasons."

The aroma and taste of these ethnic food items are unique. These traditional cuisines, tasty and nutritious, have remained unexplored. Most people in the cities do not know about the value and flavour of these dishes and I am sure our customers will love them, said Ankit Khachi, executive chef of Trident Hotel, Bhubaneswar.Exotic preparations such as kanti, a sweet dish made of black gram cakes coated with sugar syrup, lauki ka paratha and lauki pitha (rice-based flatbread flavoured with bottle gourd), mischi ka saag (a kind of spinach), pani kakharu (water gourd) halwa, muga kakara (moong dal cakes) and mansa pitha (chicken and rice flatbread cooked between sal leaves), bamboo shoot pickle and cakes made of mohua flower were the biggest hits among the chefs. People are becoming more and more health conscious, and eating traditional food is becoming popular nowadays. Most of the items displayed here are slowly getting lost.We would love to introduce some of them in our Odia food restaurant, said Bijay Parida , chef, Mayfair Convention . More than 80 varieties of ethnic food were displayed at the exhibition by people of different communities residing in and around Sukinda. Among these were 30 varieties of traditional cakes, 10 types of rice, 25 curries, and 35 dishes using roots and tubers. The aim behind organizing the food festival is to encourage conservation and promotion of ethnic and tribal foods. This is part of a series of initiatives we have been taking to contribute to the National Biodiversity Target of 2020, said R R Satapathy, general manager, SCM.The festival also provided an opportunity to the tribal women to showcase their traditional culinary skills. Most of the dishes are not cooked these days due to changing lifestyles and the unavailability of many ingredients. If these dishes are included in the menus of big hotels, people can taste them and the items will become popular again, said Baijayanti Murmu of Bhelutangar village in Dhenkanal district."

And then there are songs of food. Of how much ghee you should pour into a dish, or the elaborate buffet of sweet and savoury dishes that were given to Shiva and Parvati to celebrate their union.And it is food that comes to the fore in the workshops and panel discussion being hosted by Rakesh Raghunathan this week to celebrate the December season of food and music. The TV show host and culinary enthusiast, who curates food tours through his company, Puliyogare Travels, plans to recite poems and stories that talk about the connect between food and Margazhi.In the songs of Andal that are sung during the Margazhi season, in terms of food, there is one that stands out for me, says Raghunathan. It talks about how one must put lots of ghee, till your fist or elbow is submerged in it, into the food you are preparing, says Raghunathan, who adds that there is mention of dishes like akkara adisal or sweet pongal in classical songs of yore.In another talk at Amethyst, Raghunathan will be in discussion with singer Sudha Raghunathan on her foodmusic connect. On a personal note, I am always singing or humming tunes when I cook because I find that it keeps me calm as well as keeps up the tempo in the kitchen, she says, adding that there are several songs that are themed on food. The song Bhojanam seyya vaarungal, for instance, is traditionally sung at weddings, she adds.Pradeep Chakravarthy , a behaviourist who conducts heritage tours, says references to food can be found in dancedramas dating to the Maratha period. There were two dance-dramas Shiva Pallaki Prabandham and Vishnu Pallaki Prabandham  that were performed during the reign of Shahaji, one of the Maratha rulers of Thanjavur. They speak of the food served to Shiva and Parvati. The songs describe dishes such as moru kozhambu (gravy made of buttermilk), curd rice and Pongal, and the meal ends with water from the Ganges and vethala pak (betel leaves), says Chakravarthy.In the 9th century, Periyalvar, says Chakravarthy, one of the 12 Alvar saints of south India, mentions the sweet kummayam, one of Krishnas favourite dishes made of rice, green gram, cows ghee, curd, banana and sugar in the verses of Divya Prabhandam.Art is inspired by food and vice-versa, says Raghunathan. And what better time to explore this than the Margazhi season."

Meet 30-year-old Subrat Padhan of Lalmuni village under Baham gram panchayat in Jujumura block who left his studies to make agriculture a lucrative career option.Subrat was pursuing Plus Three Arts when he decided to join his ageing 69-year-old father Banmali Padhan in 2013. Prior to joining of his son, Banmali was cultivating paddy on 10 acres of land till 1999. He started vegetable farming in 2000 and cultivated brinjal on one acre. He cultivated brinjal till 2012 and was making a profit of Rs 50,000 per annum. However, farming took a lucrative turn for Banmali after Subrat joined him. Apart from cultivation of paddy and vegetables, the father-son duo now grows fruits too.Subrat dug up a deep borewell with an investment of Rs 20,000, a subsidised loan which he availed under Government scheme.After getting sufficient water for cultivation from the borewell, he started cultivation of pointed gourd (potal) over one acre of land and banana over one and a half acres in 2013. Currently, the father and son duo earn a profit of about Rs 1 lakh per annum from potal and about Rs 1.5 lakh from banana cultivation.Meanwhile, after being informed that mango cultivation offers good return, Subrat has planted different a variety of mango plants including Amrapali and Neelam over 2.4 acres of land in 2014-15 with support from National Horticulture Mission (NHM). He said they are likely to reap a good harvest from the mango orchard during the coming summer season.Apart from mango, Banmali and Subrat also cultivate pulses like mung, mustard for oil and other vegetables for own consumption. Altogether, the father and son duo earned a profit of about Rs 3 lakh per annum including a profit of Rs 50,000 from paddy cultivation on eight acres. The income will substantially increase after production of mango, Subrat said and added that they face no difficulty in selling their produce as good number of traders visit their village.I am not interested in any job. I am both happy and proud of taking up farming as a profession, Subrat said."

Their in-form batting line-up suffered a collapse. Chasing 198 for a place in the final, R Vinay Kumar's men were reeling at 111/7 when bad light stopped fourth day's play of their Ranji Trophy semifinal against Vidarbha.The nerves of playing their first ever semifinal were evident in Vidarbha on the opening day of the contest. But as the game has progressed, the underdogs have grown in confidence and have embraced a fearless approach. As the fifth and final day beckons, they stand just three wickets away from scripting history.The last ""recognised"" batting pair of Vinay (19) and Shreyas Gopal (1) are in the middle, and needing 87 to win, Karnataka know they have a humungous task in their hand. Had Wasim Jaffer not dropped a sitter at slips to give Shreyas a reprieve, Vidarbha would have been in a much stronger position.A gutsy half-century from Aditya Sarwate (55, 92b, 5x4, 1x6) and a splendid bowling from the trio of Rajneesh Gurbani (4/35), Siddesh Neral (2/37) and Umesh Yadav (1/32) fashioned Vidarbha's comeback. Resuming the day from 195/4, with a lead of 79 runs, Vidarbha were in trouble when they lost four quick wickets. However, Sarwate stitched two crucial partnerships  38 runs with Umesh (13) and 30 with number 11 Gurbani (7)  to take his side to a good total of 313 all out.Facing a tricky target, Karnataka required a good start but the Vidarbha speedsters were up for the challenge. The young Gurbani, who is turning out to be the hero for Vidarbha this season, was lethal. He backed his five-wicket haul in the first innings with an effort of 4/35. The 24-year-old procured great movement and was tough to handle for the batsmen. Getting the ball to pitch on middle and off, Gurbani did the basics right and scalped the three important wickets of Karun Nair (30), C M Gautam (24) and Stuart Binny (0). That Gurbani was supported by the disciplined bowling from Neral and Umesh further strengthened Vidarbha's chances.After they lost Mayank Agarwal early, Karnataka went into a shell and that mounted pressure on them. D Nischal looked edgy throughout the stay. Following a 44-ball seven stay, the right-hander threw away his wicket playing an expansive drive. A 41-run stand between Gautam and Nair was broken by Gurbani which triggered the collapse.Players from both sides seemed unhappy with the decisions made by the on field umpires and the theme continued on the fourth day as well. Samarth was shocked after being given out leg before wicket and showed his bat before taking a long walk to the dressing room. Gautam pointed towards his pads after he was adjudged caught behind to a ball that gave the impression of not having made any contact with the bat. Earlier in the day, Aditya Sarwate was disappointed when he was ruled leg-before wicket. Incidentally, all the decisions were made by Pashschim Pathak.In the morning, Binny gave Karnataka the breakthrough with the first ball of his spell when he had Akshay Wadkar caught at first slip. It was a quality bowling from Binny and he bagged another wicket in the first ball of his next over. Ganesh Satish (81, 168b, 10x4), the man who initiated Vidarbha's fight, fell to a tame pull short. But Karnataka let the Vidarbha tail wag long and it proved costly."

Candles will be lit by the fishermen who have survived the cyclone fury. In the capital city, the vigil will be held at Sanghumugham beach at 6pm on Monday. Meanwhile, the chief ministers office confirmed that there will be no official celebrations in the state, yet stray incidents of celebrations at beaches for tourism promotion by district tourism promotion council ( DTPC ) may be held.A central team is expected to visit Kerala on Tuesday to assess the damage caused by Ockhi as the state has requested for additional disaster relief. There will be no government-led official Christmas celebrations this year. Minor celebrations to attract tourists will be conducted by DTPC. Though DTPC forms part of the government, such celebrations cannot be ruled out. The state government plans to offer a package to the 212 Ockhi-affected fishermen families identified in the state during the Christmas-New Year eve. It includes distribution of rice and other provisions and Rs 10,000 per family, officials attached to the CMs office said. In addition, Manaveeyam street cultural collective ( MSCC ), an independent organization, plans to distribute rice and green gram to the Ockhi-affected families in a mobile van on Sunday and Monday as part of their Snehasparsham project to support Ockhi-affected people. It has been planned to distribute 1,000kg rice and green gram.The vehicle starting from Manaveeyam Road will cover Vizhinjam, Kottappuram and Adimalathura areas, MSCC secretary K G Suraj said. National fish workers forum general secretary T Peter said that the state government should stop all Christmas celebrations using government funds. We have sought the state government to stop spending government money for official Christmas celebration along the beaches when the fishermen are grieving. Instead, the state should set aside that fund for Ockhi disaster relief, he said. Kerala independent fish workers federation secretary Anto Eliyas too urged the state not to conduct any official Christmas celebration. They have also sought the state to strengthen the search operations as over 90 fishermen are still missing. Officials at Kerala state disaster management authority (KSDMA) said that the central team led by disaster management division (home affairs) additional secretary Bipin Mallick will make an inspection visit on Tuesday for statutory assessment of the disaster.The central team visit is based on the memorandum submitted by Kerala to the Centre for additional disaster relief assistance of Rs 422 crore as part of national disaster relief funds (NDRF). This is in addition to the Rs 7,000-crore Ockhi relief package submitted by Kerala to the Centre, the KSDMA official said. Meanwhile, KSDMA, Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services and Indian meteorological department have alerted fishermen to be cautious while venturing into the sea due to high waves and strong winds.High waves in the range of 3 to 3.1metres (above 10 feet) are forecast from 5.30pm on Saturday to 11.30pm on Tuesday along Kerala coast. They have also warned of strong winds from the north easterly and easterly direction in the range of 45-55 kmph along Kerala coast."

And it did the city a lot of good. Of course it brought with it the much-need international visibility and perked up its promising startup sector with a booster shot of probable investments; but that wasnt what GES will be remembered for, for many years to come. At least not among the ordinary Hyderabadi janata who despite being kept miles away from the epicenter of all the action, was only too glad that the mega event had travelled to mana sheher. And why wouldnt they. After all it was courtesy GES and its VVIP invitee Ivanka Trump that they found some respite from acrobatically maneuvering through potholed roads that had been rudely stripped off its wafer-thin tar clothes, since the time monsoon unleashed itself on the land of Nizams. And if that wasnt joyous enough, they even found their otherwise concrete jungles sporting bursts of green as the civic authorities went out of their way to beautify medians of arterial roads with humungous flower pots. So what if the sight of a majority of them  painted in deadly shades of pink and yellow -- was jarring and repulsive. At least they broke the monotony, right? It spent Rs 44 crore or more on this beautification drive, which also included clearing the streets of beggars!While given the gravity of the meet, one would have imagined that the deliberations between leading entrepreneurs, industry bigwigs and state heads  unfolding at the event -- would grab the most eyeballs, it wasnt quite the case. Instead, the labels that Trump wore (see pics on left) and the touristy rides she took to Golconda Fort and Falaknuma Palace drew more traction. And though the verdict on her specially-designed attires remained divided, the city certainly swooned over the advisor to the US President, when she dug into a plate of kebabs/biryani at table 101 or laid bare her admiration for the historic fort. There was Miss World Manushi Chhillar too who added the star quotient with her brief appearance, and the while looking her glamorous best. That she also spoke eloquently, was a bonus!The five-day World Telugu Conference (WTC) in December provided a sociocultural, literary, and political boost to the state government. While Telangana state succeeded in producing archaeological, historical and cultural evidences to prove that Telangana is the birth place of Telugu language, CM K Chandrasekhar Rao had emerged as the master linguist reciting with ease the most difficult of Telugu compositions. KCRs daughter and Nizamabad MP K Kavitha donned the role of an epigraphist with her well-researched presentation on the origin of Telugu alphabet and literature. IT minister KT Rama Rao, too, glittered during the Tollywood show attended by several top Telugu film personalities.WTC was a meticulously planned literary and cultural event that had brought to the fore several hitherto unknown facets of Telangana. Many departments worked over time gathering every bit of scientific evidence to prove the contention of the TRS government that the birth place of Telugu alphabet, prose and poetry was Telangana. Its long been contested that coastal Andhra is the birth place of proto-Telugu, the mother of modern Telugu language. Epigraphical, archaeological and historical data were produced at various sessions of the WTC in support of the evidence.About 10 years and over Rs 15,000 crore later, the Metro Rail finally chugged into Hyderabad late 2017, with Modiji on board its maiden run. Predictably, the Hyderabadi populace that had almost submitted to its fate of being a metro-less metropolis, thanks to a series of crises around finances, logistics, improbable deadlines and design of the rapid transit system, was only too excited to ultimately see their dream being realised. Result: within hours the footfall on these coaches touched one lakh! And as news about its swanky air-conditioned interiors and stylish technology-driven features spread, the 30-km ride from Nagole to Miyapur, became the new weekend outing for scores of families in town whose recreational options were limited to the movies and neighbourhood parks, up until then. But as weeks passed by, complains too started to surface  about the overly restricted speed (of 33 kmph), the cap on coaches (only three for now), the lack of enough toilets and severely scarce parking space.Though Hyderabadis are willing to dismiss all of it as mere teething problems, they are certainly hoping that the babus and netas finally wake up and take note of their minor miseries. They are also hoping that the Ameerpet-Hi Tec City stretch, which is expected to up and running by June 2018, is delivered on time without any further ado. Is someone listening?After a one-and-half year wait, fans finally got the know why Kattappa killed Baahubali! For the film fraternity, SS Rajamoulis mega offering was about being hit by a cinematic giant that was never heard, seen or even dared to have been made before. No surprises then that the moolah came gushing into the directors coffers soon after its April release (Rs 500 crore? Rs 1,500 crore? Your guess is as good as ours).The concept, cinematography, storyline, special effects and even performances were equally appreciated. The wait is now on to see what Rajamouli has up his sleeves next."
5aeb32e59855b73f522c7c61,The Rann of the Agariyas,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-rann-of-the-agariyas/article22336615.ece,2017-12-31,"The Agariyas start arriving by October, when the monsoon leaves behind the Little Rann of Kutch as a mud desert. They keep coming till April to mine salt in this 5,000-sq. km marsh in the west of Gujarat, the State which produces roughly three-fourths of the salt that India consumes. Thakarshi Bababhai Sankhalpura, 55, of the nomadic tribe says they arrive from places such as Banaskantha, Patan, Surendranagar, Rajkot, Morbi, Amreli and Kutch. The Agariya families now number 12,000 to 15,000 in Gujarat.With temperatures ranging from five to 50 degrees Celsius, high wind velocity and high soil salinity, the Little Rann of Kutch is an ideal place to mine salt. Using traditional knowledge, the Agariyas divine a salt-rich area and then dig a hole to draw out the saline water and channel it to a bed that becomes the salt pan. From 6 a.m., they start work, using diesel pumps for 18 hours to draw water and maintain the water level of the pan. Then they drop a type of grass in the water to help crystallisation. After a week or so, expert workers like Thakarshi Bababhai use a wooden implement, called dantalo in Kutchi, to comb the water for two hours each in the morning and afternoon so that the salt does not harden into slabs. Small and medium factories buy salt from the Agariyas. As the summer peaks and the temperatures soar to above 50 degrees Celsius, they stop work and leave.The tribe derives its name from the word agar, meaning salt farms. Their staple food is bajri no rotlo (millet roti) and mag ni dal (green whole moong), washed down with buttermilk. Conditions in the desert are harsh without electricity and water. Home to a rare breed of wild ass and visiting flamingos, the desert has been designated a wildlife sanctuary by the Gujarat government. Voluntary organisations such as the Agariya Heet Rakshaks Manch strive to protect the interests of these workers. Harinesh Pandiya of the organisation says it helps out with solar panels for power supply and facilities such as Internet vans for the Agariyas to stay connected with the outside world."
