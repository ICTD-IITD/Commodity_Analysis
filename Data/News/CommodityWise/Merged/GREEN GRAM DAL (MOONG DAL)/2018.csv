The second most important agrarian festival of the region after Nuakhai, Puspuni holds a special significance for the agriculture-dominated belt.While Nuakhai is celebrated after flowering of kharif paddy crop, Puspuni is observed after its harvest. The annual festival is observed on Pausa Purnima (full moon day in Odia month of Pausa).It provides the much-needed break to the farmers after their hard work on the field ends. It also marks the end of work contract between landowners and agricultural labourers. The festival doesnt involve worshipping of deities. Its more about merry making with special emphasis being laid on food.Residents prepared special traditional dishes, pancakes, kakara, manda, arisha, ras bara, mung bara and malpua and other non-vegetarian dishes at their homes.As per the tradition, children moved around the city singing popular songs like Chhera Chhera and collected rice, vegetables or money from the locals to organise feast. The activity has been introduced since ages to bridge the generation gap between old women and youngsters.In rural areas, residents participate in cultural programmes and kabaddi and football matches. However, in the urban areas, the celebrations are restricted to Bhetghat (get togethers).In Bargarh, the festival is celebrated a day later to mark the killing of demon King Kansa during Dhanu Yatra."

""That would be a humungous problem.""Unlike in 2011, the US no longer has an air base in Kyrgyzstan, which had been the main transit point for American military personnel and cargo in and out of Afghanistan but was abandoned amid a price row in 2014 with the Obama administration.Additionally, Washington's fraught relations with Russia could make flying over Central Asian states less reliable, with Moscow able to exert influence on its smaller neighbors.After more than a decade of simmering US anger at Islamabad's links with the Afghan Taliban and the Haqqani network -- a Taliban affiliate -- the Trump administration is trying to draw a line in the sand.Fair said almost all US deaths from the Taliban in Afghanistan can be attributed to the Pakistanis.""They literally take our money with one hand and they give it to the Taliban with the other,"" she said.""You cannot fight a war and win when the country you are dependent upon for logistical supplies is undermining your efforts there.""A US defense official told AFP that the military already has plenty of options to keep its troops well supplied, and could fill gaps by chartering commercial air delivery planes.""The question is, if it were to happen, how long would it last?"" the official said.Weeks or months would probably be ""something that we could deal with through temporary solutions and wouldn't matter so terribly much."" But a longer-term embargo would require the US to find more practical solutions, and these would come with a high price tag, the official added."

Uttam Kumar Reddy said that Congress would abide by it and implement it in letter and spirit.Salient features of the declaration include constitution of a market intervention fund with Rs. 5,000 crores every year, waiving Rs. 2 lakh of every farmers loan and payment of premium for crop insurance by government.In addition, it also said that the party would ensure payment of Rs. 2,000 MSP per quintal of paddy, maize, jowar and bajra. MSP of Rs. 6,000 for cotton, Rs. 7,000 for green gram, red gram and blackgram and Rs. 5,000 for groundnut and sunflower would be provided.While chilli and turmeric would yield an MSP of Rs. 10,000, red jowar would be supported by at least Rs. 3,500, the declaration says. Accusing the TRS Government of neglecting agriculture during its 40 month rule, Mr. Reddy said that farmers were steeped in debts due to the absence of remunerative price in the market and the burden of principal and interest. TRS leadership, which promised to waive Rs. 1 lakh loan in a single attempt, failed to keep its assurance, he pointed out.Consequently over 3,500 farmers have committed suicide in the State during the TRS regime. When 7 lakh farmers paid premium under crop insurance scheme, not a single farmer saw the insurance amount, said Mr. Reddy, while promising that the Congress would bring about an effective law to rein in companies that were selling spurious seeds.Former Assembly Speaker K.R. Suresh Reddy described the Armoor Declaration as historic and unique. AICC secretary Madhu Yaskhi Goud accused MP K. Kavitha of lying about establishment of a turmeric board, when the Centre had taken a decision to close 48 boards."
5aeaad2c9855b7179ad6d61e,Opinion: India Inc Hopes For Rationalisation Of Corporate Tax,http://profit.ndtv.com/news/opinion/article-opinion-india-inc-hopes-for-rationalisation-of-corporate-tax-1798177,2018-01-10,"As the Union Budget 2018 is the last full budget before the 2019 general elections, expectations about significant reforms on the economic and tax policy front are abound. With several actions and announcements, the government has made it clear that it is on a mission to transform its litigious image into ushering in a non-adversarial tax regime that offers certainty and consistency to the stakeholders. This article discusses some of the important expectations to achieve these objectives.Currently, there are several profit-linked deductions to incentivise participation in certain businesses. However, availing such deductions invariably leads to long-drawn litigations. These can be more effectively replaced by 'investment-linked' deductions. This would serve the dual purpose: firstly, to boost capital formation and employment generation, and secondly, to give an impetus to the government's Make in India initiative.Given India's massive need for infrastructure development and the consequent humungous appetite for capital to meet the funding needs of this sector, the infrastructure sector should be excluded from 'thin capitalisation rules'. These rules limit the deduction for interest expense on borrowed capital in certain circumstances.The law provides tax neutral conversion of a company into an LLP provided the converting company's turnover is less than Rs 60 lakh or assets do not exceed Rs 5 crore in any of the three years preceding such conversion. Given the scale of operations at which Indian businesses now operate, these limits are too small, even for small and medium sized companies. Such conditions are also discriminatory. The LLP form of doing business was simply not available and hence businesses had no option but to set up as companies. Putting a limit of this nature discriminates them against new businesses which can be set up as LLPs and can have large asset base and/or turnover, without being penalised. LLP is a simpler business form which accords the benefit of limiting the liabilities for business risks. Post-conversion, the LLP continues in business in India and any disposal of its assets would necessarily be subject to Indian taxes. Thus, this conversion would not be prejudicial to the Indian revenue. It may simply have a condition that the same people who are beneficial shareholders in the company should continue to be members in the LLP. The monetary limit for tax neutral conversion seems dated and less business-friendly provision.An urgent need is to overhaul dividend distribution tax (DDT) payable by a company at the rate of 20.36 per cent while distributing dividends, in addition to the corporate tax payable by the company on its income. One of the objectives of DDT was to plug the loophole of tax being escaped in the hands of shareholders. While the objective is totally justified, DDT may not be the answer. DDT being payable by the company leads to a significant tax burden on those shareholders whose income falls below the taxable limits - senior citizens, retired people, pooling vehicles etc. would be the worst affected by this tax. DDT on dividend distributed to foreign investor results in the foreign investor suffering higher tax incidence in India since such investor is unlikely to get credit for DDT paid by the Indian company. This leads to lower returns on their investment as DDT becomes a sunk cost. This reduces the attractiveness of foreign equity investments in India and leads to resorting to artificial structuring and avoidable litigation. Another fall out of DDT is the denial of tax deduction for interest to parent company on borrowings to invest in their ventures in separate entities, since the dividend income is exempt in their hands. It would be far more efficient to replace DDT with Dividend Withholding Tax across the board so that the recipient shareholders are able to claim credit for such a tax based on their income levels. Such a measure will go a long way in encouraging the much-needed long term foreign direct investment in India.Budget 2018 is expected to bring some clarity on pertaining to distress asset resolution: (i) exempt the levy of Minimum Alternate Tax on notional income due to write off of debt, pursuant to approved resolution plan under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC); (ii) some relaxation from 'fair market value' based taxation for distress sale in secondary share transfers, and (iii) availability of set off of brought forward losses to the company despite change in more than 51% shareholding. This will ensure the success of IBC which is the need of the day in view of the huge NPAs and mobilise the flow of funds back into the economy.The current government must be lauded for adopting the stakeholder consultation approach in almost every aspect of policy formulation. It is equally important that the policy actions percolate down at grassroot levels and tax administration becomes more tax payer friendly. Rationalisation of tax laws as discussed here will not only help the government achieve this, but will also have two more benefits: increasing tax compliance and bringing down the corporate tax rates to match international standards.

A visit by this correspondent to several such shops located in the city showed consumers going back disappointed as the salesmen claimed the allocation of provisions was yet to be done.The government made an announcement 10 days ago that the Pongal gift packets containing one kg of raw rice, half a kg of green gram, 250 gm of jaggery, 25 gm of cashew and 10 gm of cardamom would be available to all cardholders ahead of the festival.However, several hiccups and differences of opinion between the Lieutenant Governor and the government created obstacles in the implementation of the scheme in a timely manner.On Pongal eve, Welfare Minister M. Kandasamy told reporters that the supplies would be reaching the PDS outlets in a couple of days.Consumers, particularly senior citizens, were seen visiting fair price shops only to learn that the provisions were yet to be delivered.How can the government delay the supply of gift packets? If they are not able to supply the gifts, they should not have made promises. We are tired of visiting the shops every day, S. Kasturi, a cardholder, said.Hasty announcementA fair price shop owner in Boulevard said the government had come out with the announcement hastily without finalising the procurement order. With the delay in arrival of stock at the fair price shops, we are now facing the wrath of consumers, he said.Another salesman at a fair price shop in Mudaliarpet said the government had supplied jaggery alone while the other items were yet to be delivered.We cannot deliver the provisions in instalments to the cardholders. Planning was not done properly and it is still not known when all the five items would be available, he said."

The business is brisk as hundreds of people have arrived at venue in buses, SUVs, cars, motorcycles and taxis.There is renewed hope among people of the region after four years of wait. This time I am sure that the refinery will materialize as Modi ji is coming for the (foundation stone laying) ceremony, Udairam, a 65-year-old farmer from Deroi, a village about 45 km away from Pachpadra, said.Sunil Bishnoi, a smalltime trader from Balhotra, sets up his kiosk on a tractor at Pachpadra on Tuesday. He did a good business selling bottled water, ibce cream and snacks to people who had gathered for the function that was addressed by Prime Minister narendra Modi. (HT Photo)Udairam and his friends have hired an SUV to reach the venue. I am not happy with madam (chief minister) as she has not done much to address the problems of the farmers, but we will vote for Modi next time, he said when asked whether he was happy that the state BJP government has revived the refinery project.Farmers in the region are unhappy as they have been able to sell only a portion of the moong crop at fair price.So what hopes he has from the refinery once it becomes operational? The youth of our village will get employment. The refinery will change the face of the region, he said.At a hotel, about 3 km from the venue, a group is animatedly discussing the impact of the upcoming HPCL refinery. Most of them having invested in property in and around Pachpadra, the site of the proposed refinery in Barmer district, the stakes are high.The property prices have soared more than 10 times ever since the government announced the project four years ago, Punaram Nagana, a hotel owner said.However, the token system, in which people bought property at exorbitant rates by giving some money upfront, has ruined many. With project facing delays, many people could not resell the land and forfeited the token money, he said.In March 2013, the then Congress-led Rajasthan government had signed an agreement with HPCL for setting up a 9-million-tonne refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Thar desert near the oil discovery made by Cairn India. After coming to power the same year, the Vasundhara Raje government put the project on hold citing an unfavourable deal and undue financial burden.In April 2017, Raje government signed a fresh MoU with HPCL for setting up the refinery.In the past decade, Barmers rural economy has been transformed by two big energy projects  Cairn Energys Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya oilfields and a 1,080 MW thermal power plant operated by a subsidiary of JSW Energy.The projects led to a spurt in ancillary industries and entrepreneurship, with residents investing in hotels and transport fleets. The real estate bubble created tremendous liquidity in the surrounding villages that, until recently, bartered goods in times of drought.With another mega project with an investment of more than 43,000 crore about to take off, there is hope of another economic boom.Meanwhile, some villagers are asked to put away the black jackets and sweaters by the security personnel who dont want anyone protesting against Modis visit to wave any black cloth at the Prime Minister."

With just two months to go for the season to be over, the monsoon seem to have lets them down.While there was a 40% deficit in rainfall during the first three months of the monsoon (October to December), the crisis deepened with a 98% deficit of rainfall in the winter period (January), according to the Meteorology Department. Farmers began sowing crops in the second week of October and the season will end in the beginning of March.Crop has been sown in 19.49 lakh hectares till date this season. While paddy is still in the transplantation stage, jowar, bajra and ragi crops are in the vegetative stage, maize crop is in the vegetative to tasseling stage. Red gram, green gram, black gram, horsegram, groundnut and sesamum crops are in the vegetative to flowering stage and Bengal gram crop is in the flowering to pod formation stage.Paddy has been already sown in 5,44,311 hectares.

The participation has gone up enormously, said Sushanto Ghosh, president of Rajdanga Club, which organised the festival.CHOCOLATE HEAVENChocolate lovers were seen crowding one of the most happening shops of the fair, which was selling chocolate patisapta. Children love chocolate. So, we have tried to combine the taste of the new generation with the choice of the old generation.

I am not happy with madam (chief minister) as she has not done much to address the problems of the farmers, but we will vote for Modi next time, he said when asked whether he was happy that the state BJP government has revived the refinery project.Farmers in the region are unhappy as they have been able to sell only a portion of the moong crop at fair price.So what hopes he has from the refinery once it becomes operational? The youth of our village will get employment. The refinery will change the face of the region, he said.At a hotel, about 3 km from the venue, a group is animatedly discussing the impact of the upcoming HPCL refinery. Most of them having invested in property in and around Pachpadra, the site of the proposed refinery in Barmer district, the stakes are high.The property prices have soared more than 10 times ever since the government announced the project four years ago, Punaram Nagana, a hotel owner said.However, the token system, in which people bought property at exorbitant rates by giving some money upfront, has ruined many. With project facing delays, many people could not resell the land and forfeited the token money, he said.In March 2013, the then Congress-led Rajasthan government had signed an agreement with HPCL for setting up a 9-million-tonne refinery-cum-petrochemical complex in Thar desert near the oil discovery made by Cairn India. After coming to power the same year, the Vasundhara Raje government put the project on hold citing an unfavourable deal and undue financial burden.In April 2017, Raje government signed a fresh MoU with HPCL for setting up the refinery.In the past decade, Barmers rural economy has been transformed by two big energy projects  Cairn Energys Mangala, Bhagyam and Aishwariya oilfields and a 1,080 MW thermal power plant operated by a subsidiary of JSW Energy.The projects led to a spurt in ancillary industries and entrepreneurship, with residents investing in hotels and transport fleets. The real estate bubble created tremendous liquidity in the surrounding villages that, until recently, bartered goods in times of drought.With another mega project with an investment of more than 43,000 crore about to take off, there is hope of another economic boom.Meanwhile, some villagers are asked to put away the black jackets and sweaters by the security personnel who dont want anyone protesting against Modis visit to wave any black cloth at the Prime Minister."

The International Trade Fair's display of a variety of millets at numerous stalls was impressive according to Hosangadi.The fair began on Friday at the Palace Grounds.While enquiring about a particular millet at a counter, he said,""This is huge. There are several things that I do not know about.""I have a 20-acre land which grows onion, chilli, groundnut and green gram, said Subash.He said that 60% of farmers from his village, Belavanaki, do not use fertilisers.""These farmers need to be educated that with the use of fertilisers, the yield is increased and the soil quality is sustained,"" he said. Hosangadi added that the international millet festival has presented new opportunities to farmers like him.The fair inaugurated by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on Friday, witnessed over 300 stalls of millets, traditional grains and organics among others from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Meghalaya, Uttarakhand, Haryana, and Chhattisgarh.A group of women farmers from four villages in Vikarabad, 70 km from Hyderabad exhibited a certain variety of millets. Among their other products, the safflower oil was a major source of attraction.""We have not seen anything like this before,"" said Shobha Rani, one of the women farmers.While speaking about the group of women, Anil Kumar, a member of a team which supports small communities like the women's said that it is always better to empower women through farming as the money goes directly to them.He added that if the money is with the men, they might spend it on drinking, while the women are far more responsible.The fair also witnessed international delegates and buyers from a range of countries including USA, Germany, Switzerland, UAE, South Korea, Uganda, China and Malaysia among others.""I think India needs to grow in the field of marketing. There needs to be a fair price so that the farmers benefit out of it,"" said, Zhou Zejiang, president, IFOAM, Organics International-Asia (Global organisation for organics).In his inaugural speech, the chief minister said: ""It is important for us to raise awareness and promote millets as they have a high nutritional value and easy to cultivate. We are a dry agriculture state and over the last 17 years only three years were drought free."""

While offering Rs. 1,660 per quintal for fine paddy varieties, the State Government would give Rs. 1,600 per quintal for other varieties.To save the farmers from private buyers, the district administration had decided to open 44 direct procurement centres across the district and would offer minimum support price.Crop insurance amount of Rs. 7.15 crore has been credited in the accounts of 8,462 farmers and Rs. 47.35 crore paid for 19,712 black gram farmers. Since 2015, the State Government had paid Rs. 62.40 crore in the accounts of 41,630 farmers towards crop insurance, drought and Cyclone Ockhi relief to the tune of Rs. 16.37 lakh.In 2016  2017 under the Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme, Rs. 24.49 crore has been paid to 8,527 maize farmers and Rs. 7.52 crore to green gram farmers.When farmer Karuppasamy of Melaneelithanallur charged that the Animal Husbandry Departments failure to ensure adequate stocks of medicines in the veterinary dispensary in their area led to the mysterious death of 60 goats in December last, the Collector ordered the officials concerned to conduct a probe and submit a report in this connection.Mr. Sandeep also ordered the Revenue Divisional Officer, Tenkasi, P. Rajendran to inspect Royagiri tank where a farmer had cultivated banana inside the water body. If the complaints being raised by the farmers are found to be true, remove the encroachments and initiate action against the encroachers, the Collector ordered.Invasion of wild animals into farms and the consequent crop damage rocked the meet once again. The farmers, who raised this serious issue, said the solar electric fence erected at Papanasam was defunct since 1997. Im battling for the re-erection of solar electric fence at this spot that witnesses rampant wild animal invasion everyday, for the past 19 months. Invading elephants, wild boars, sambar deer etc. have damaged my crops including 200 coconuts. However, forest officials, who are adamantly refusing to re-erect solar electric fence at Papanasam, say that they can give compensation only for 36 uprooted coconut trees. The Collector should instruct the forest officials concerned in this connection, farmer Subramanian said.The Collector asked the forest department personnel participating in the meeting to look into the matter.Since most of the water bodies in Sivagiri, Sankarankovil, Vannikonenthal and Thiruvenkatam areas are bone dry now, the Collector asked the officials to inspect these areas and scrutinize the applications, if any, seeking crop loss compensation.Farmer P. Perumbadaiyar wanted to know the reason behind involving private insurance company in crop insurance and urged the Collector to rope in a public sector undertaking in this sector as being done in neighbouring Thoothukudi district, the Collector said he would recommend it to the State Government.Sub-Collector, Cheranmahadevi, P. Akash, District Revenue Officer P. Muthuramalingam, Joint Director of Agriculture L. Perumal and others were present."

That line perhaps is the key to the entire narrative of the film, which often leaves you wondering, whether what just happened was in the real world, or in the realm of fantasy.Siby is a non-achiever for the society around him, and he is desperate to make amends.When we meet him, he is running behind one fraudulent scheme after another, to earn some quick buck. From trying to sell an emerald which is still not in his possession, to a sly attempt at selling a Vellimoonga to planning a business deal around an elephant and even a plan to steal some government funds by importing cycles from China, he jumps from one failed plan to the next, even before he knew it has failed.The fantasy elements start playing out even in these earlier lighter moments, with a funny and creepy moment involving the elephants mahout. These elements appear more often in the latter parts, when the action shifts to the forest, where Siby gets caught in his grandest scheme yet  to dig out the gold abandoned in the forests during Tipus era. Like, the appearance of spotted deer outside the forest cottages window, and the helpers reference to the Mareechan myth, or the needless song sequences involving Sameera (Mamta Mohandas).In his third outing as a director, Venu had quite some expectations resting on him, owing to the brilliant Munnariyippu (2014). The writing in Carbon does not touch those levels. Somewhere, the balance between not revealing too much and appearing incoherent, gets tilted to the wrong side.Through these phases, it is yet another blazing performance from Fahadh Faasil that keeps the film afloat. You are kept guessing as to which of the sequences happen in his head, and which happens for real. And, he pulls it off commendably. Some of the other characters, especially Sameeras, appear pretty sketchy, while those of Sphadikam George and Chetan Jayalal, are refreshing. The initial novelty of the exquisitely-shot jungle sequences wears off after a point.The big reveal in the climax can be sensed from a distance, yet, it appears a tad too underwhelming, when it is actually executed on screen. Carbon is enjoyable in parts, but it could have been much more.S.R. Praveen"

Venkatesh during the grievance redressal meeting here on Wednesday. They were released later.They decried delay in disbursal of crop insurance benefits for the year 2016-17.Soon after Joint Director of Agriculture M.S.N. Selvaraj read out the targeted crop cultivation area, availability of certified seeds, fertilizers, schemes for agriculture development and 24.96 % deficit rainfall, the hall turned a pandemonium.The farmers said that the district administration had already assured that the crop insurance benefits would be provided to them before Pongal festival but in vain. They created a flutter when the insurance company official asked them to wait for one more month to disburse the benefits.Meanwhile, a group of farmers carried newspapers of a Tamil daily which reported that the insurance company was reluctant to extend benefits as there were malpractices carried out by some in the name of farmers to avail insurance benefits, and sought an explanation from agriculture officials. The officials denied any such thing.While farmers of Tirunelveli district had received crop insurance benefits, the farmers of Thoothukudi district were yet to get such benefits, they deplored.K.P. Perumal, a farmer from Thoothukudi, said village administrative officers should be held responsible for a wrongful survey of crop field and hence real beneficiaries could not avail insurance benefits.Hence, he urged the Collector to keenly monitor the situation to avoid problems. The Collector said efforts were on to receive the crop insurance benefits at the earliest and every farmer eligible would get it and said action would be taken against any erring official.Krishnamurthy, a farmer from Ettayapuram, said black gram and green gram on some acres suffered yellow disease attack and timely disbursal of crop insurance benefits would be useful for them.Tamilmani from Kurumbur demanded direct paddy procurement centre and a check-dam in Kadambakulam."
5b2d700f9855b723c6f46195,It is not about ‘Padmaavat’ alone,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/it-is-not-about-padmaavat-alone-5043127/,2018-01-29,"The reality is that India has a Censor Board that masquerades as a Certification Process. (Representational Image) The reality is that India has a Censor Board that masquerades as a Certification Process. (Representational Image)After long drawn and protracted attrition Padmaavat without the I was finally released on January 25, 2018, a day before Indias 69th Republic day. On this day in 1950, India, of course, adopted its Constitution that declared it to be a Sovereign, Democratic Republic.At the heart of that sacrament lies the golden triangle of Rights  Article 14 that provides Right to Equality, Article 19 that pledges Fundamental Freedoms, especially the Right to Freedom of Speech and Expression and Article 21 that provides Right to Life and Liberty. Read together this sacred compact represents the essence of We the People, that constitute the great Indian Republic.Out of this golden triangle of Rights it is Article 19 (1) (a), Freedom of Speech and Expression that is most repeatedly subject to assault and battery. In a country where there are more opinions than people, more egos than ergo and more prickliness than patience, manufactured outrage is the first emotion that manifests itself. Since creativity involves not treading the beaten path, books, films, paintings and other works of art become easy prey of hypocritical rage and the quest of self appointed protectors of morality for their two moments under the sun.In the case of Padmaavat, despite the Supreme Court emphatically weighing in, the hooliganism, anarchy and downright lumpenism that were let loose on the streets especially in BJP-ruled states represented a completely new nadir. One can only wonder whether these Senas could have gone so far without the tacit support of the BJP Central and state governments who chose to run with the hare and hunt with the hound. Was there an agenda beyond opposing the release of Padmaavat at play?However this unfortunate and tragic soap opera in which even school children were not spared should once again focus attention on both Article 19 of the Constitution and the whole paradigm of how we certify (read censor) films for the purposes of screening.Article 19 (1) (a) guarantees the freedom of speech and expression to all citizens. The right is however caveated by Article 19 (2) that allows the state to impose reasonable restrictions on the exercise of this right. The certification of films is governed by the Cinematographic Act of 1952 and the Cinematographic (Certification) Rules 1983 rules made under it. Since the scope of constraints under Article 19 (2) of the Constitution are almost infinite they have been engrafted virtually in-toto in Section 5 (B) of the Cinematographic Act.This section entitled Principles for Guidance in Certifying Films virtually gives the Censor Board unbridled powers to refuse certification, impose arbitrary cuts, grant certificates ranging from U (Universal viewing) to S (for Specialized presentation). All this and more is done almost on a daily basis in the name of protecting the sovereignty and integrity of India, security of the state, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency, morality, defamation, contempt of court or even the obtuse incitement of an offence.The power to certify a film is exclusively vested in the Central government, under Article 246 (entry 60) in the Union list of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution. However state governments routinely misuse their law and order powers and state laws promulgated under Entry 33 of the State list also in the Seventh Schedule to ban films that have been granted certification by the CBFC.Under Rule 21 of the Film Certification Rules, a producer or his nominee applies for the certification of a Film. It has to be then vetted within 21 days. This rule is routinely violated for big banners and influential producers ostensibly in the name of stopping piracy. The film is then referred to an examining committee drawn from people on the Advisory Panel attached to every regional Centre.The examining committee then recommends as to how a film should be certified. If the producer or the Chairperson of the CBFC is unsatisfied with the examining committees decision, it is then referred to a revising committee. If the producer is still not happy with the decision of the revising committee he /she can appeal to the Film Certification Appellate Tribunal (FCAT) and then a writ lies to the High Court followed by a Special Leave Petition to the Supreme Court.The fundamental point being that wide, arbitrary and almost draconian powers that are exercised by the CBFC, can drive even a conservative filmmaker around the bend. Considering that huge financial investments are in play and the interest meter is ticking, time is off the essence, which means the producer becomes a mere puppet in the hands of the Board. That is the reason why allegations of corruption, malfeasance are the staple of the grist mills. Moreover a command performance to deny certification at the behest of the Central government is the easiest one-person act to perform.If a film maker is able to navigate his/her way through this byzantine maze, state governments can always stop a film from being screened, on the spurious premise of a law and order situation as happened in the case of Vishwaroopam in Tamil Nadu, Sada Haq in Punjab and myriad other films along the way.My experience as a former Information and Broadcasting Minister, with the functioning or rather the malfunctioning of the CBFC convinced me that this institution should be abolished. I tried hard to find a trigger to demolish this architecture. The opportunity came when the government of Tamil Nadu banned the Kamal Haasan starrer Vishwaroopam. Oral instructions were issued to District Collectors to halt the advance booking of the movie, as it would ostensibly hurt the sentiments of a particular community.Despite my repeated public entreaties that this move was wholly illegal the state government refused to budge. It was quite clear that there was a stand- off. While the state government was hell bent on using its law and order powers to curb and circumscribe artistic freedoms, the larger question to my mind was that if every state government started adopting this route, where would it leave the Cinematograph Act?More importantly, would film-makers be compelled to run from state secretariat to state secretariat, hat in hand, to get their films exhibited after spending humungous sums of money to produce the movie and then obtaining all the requisite clearances as required by the law? The entire issue went far beyond just the ban of a particular movie.On February 4, 2013, while the Vishwaroopam controversy was raging I constituted a committee consisting of some of the most eminent and knowledgeable people of the subject at hand. The committee among others consisted of Mukul Mudgal, retired chief justice, High Court of Punjab and Haryana, Lalit Bhasin, chairperson, FCAT, Sharmila Tagore, former chairperson, CBFC, and Javed Akhtar, then an MP, with the mandate to review the functioning of CBFC.The committee, after consultations with stakeholders, and after touring the length and breadth of the country submitted its report on October 9, 2013. Since the committee, in addition to people from the creative arts, had lawyers on it too, they even drew up a Model Cinematograph bill.When the committee came to submit its report, the first question I asked them was have you recommended the scrapping of this whole silly censorship process masquerading as certification? The Chairperson Justice Mudgul responded with a smile saying we did not know that you wanted that. I responded by saying it would have been wholly inappropriate of me to impose my subjective desires over your objective consideration.The point I have repeatedly made over the years is if television can be beamed into peoples bedrooms 24X7 regulated by only a Programme Code and an Advertising code, why have a censorship mechanism just for films? This belongs to another time and place in history. Unlike TV, that a person maybe involuntarily compelled to watch, in the case of a film you actually go to a theatre and buy a ticket to watch a movie. There is no coercion involved in the process.The NDA/ BJP government chose to cold-shoulder the Mudgal Committee Report and appointed another committee under eminent filmmaker Shyam Benegal to reinvent the wheel. Given the reactionary ethos of this government, the committee was at best a tactic to divert flak the government was then receiving from the creative community over the spectre of intolerance that found expression in the Award Wapsi movement. Its recommendations have since been gathering dust.The reality is that India has a Censor Board that masquerades as a Certification Process. Till the time the Cinematographic Act is not repealed and state governments are not proscribed from banning films, books and other works of art by providing constitutional safeguards what happened to Padmaavat will become more the rule than the exception.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5b2d702c9855b723c6f461a7,From Plate to Plough: How to help the farmer,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-to-help-the-farmer-telangana-input-support-scheme-5042721/,2018-01-29,"With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive) With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. (Archive)Farm distress is likely to be one of the major focal points of the upcoming Union Budget. Agri-GDP growth has fallen to around 2 per cent per annum in the first four years of the Modi government; the real incomes of farmers have fallen as well. The growth in the agriculture sector is much below the Centres target and the government does not seem to be on course to double farmers incomes by 2022. With assembly elections in 10 states due later this year, the states going to the polls are making attempts to woo farmers. While some have announced loan waivers, others are trying to fix farmers woes emanating from tumbling farm prices. Here, we focus on two pilot projects to see if they can be scaled-up at the all India level.The first is the Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), essentially a price deficiency payment (PDP) scheme, being undertaken by the government of Madhya Pradesh. BBY applies to eight kharif crops  soybean, maize, urad, tur, moong, groundnut, til, ramtil. The Haryana government has announced a somewhat similar scheme for four vegetables  potatoes, onions, tomatoes and cauliflower. The second pilot scheme we talk about is underway in Telangana, where the government gives all farmers an investment support for their working capital needs.Under the BBY, farmers have to first register on a portal. Their sown area is verified by government officials. They are then asked to bring their produce to mandis at a time fixed by the state government. Based on average productivity of a crop in the district and area cultivated by the farmer, the quantity of each produce that is eligible for deficiency payment is also determined by the government. Farmers receive the difference between average sale price (ASP) and MSP directly into their bank accounts. The scheme seems interesting as it provides an alternative to physical procurement of commodities at minimum support prices (MSPs). The ASP is calculated as the simple average of the weighted modal prices of the relevant crops in the regulated mandis of Madhya Pradesh and two adjoining states. The price information is drawn from the Centres agmarknet.gov.in portal.For kharif 2017-18, so far, data related to five crops (soybean, maize, groundnut, urad and moong) has been finalised for price deficiency payment. The market prices of til and ramtil are higher than the MSP and therefore they do not qualify for price deficiency payment. The tur season will start from February.The graph shows the key results of BBY for October-December, 2017. It is interesting to note that only 32 per cent of urad production in Madhya Pradesh got the yojanas benefit despite the fact that ASP of urad was 42 per cent below its MSP. In other words, 68 per cent of urad production was sold at prices below MSP, without any compensation under BBY. In the case of soybean, the states prime kharif crop, the percentage of production benefiting from this scheme is even lower  only 18.5 per cent, despite its ASP being 12 per cent below the MSP. And for maize, groundnut and moong, the coverage is even poorer (see graph).Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much? Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana: Who gained and how much?The Madhya Pradesh government claims to have paid about Rs 1,900 crore as compensation to farmers for these five crops. But that pertains to only those farmers registered on its portal. A larger proportion of farmers are not registered on the portal and they have been selling their produce at huge losses. These farmers have not received any compensation. In fact, those not registered under BBY have to suffer bigger losses because traders are suppressing the market. We have calculated their loss by multiplying the production not covered under BBY with the price difference between MSP and ASP. The actual prices in Madhya Pradesh are even lower than the ASP, which is the average of modal prices of three states. The total loss for these five crops comes to Rs 6,534 crore. So, if the scheme was fully successful and covered entire production, the Madhya Pradesh governments revenue outgo would be Rs 8,434 crore, and not Rs 1,900 crore. This would be more than 90 per cent of the states total budget for agriculture. In sum, BBY is not inclusive, covers less than 25 per cent of the farmers loss, involves too much micro-management by government officials and is prone to market manipulation.Haryanas scheme for four vegetables is even worse as the presumed MSP (Rs 400 per quintal for potatoes and tomatoes and Rs 500 per quintal for onions and cauliflower) does not even cover the full cost of production as estimated by the Union Ministry of Agriculture and the National Horticulture Board for these crops.In contrast to these programmes is the government of Telanganas input support scheme. Announced in the second week of January, the schemes objective is to relieve farmers from taking loans from moneylenders by giving them Rs 4,000 per acre for the kharif and rabi seasons. It is envisaged that the farmer will use this money for purchase of inputs ranging from seeds to fertilisers to machinery and hired labour. The area eligible for investment support is 14.21 million acre  the governments annual bill for the project, thus, comes to around Rs 5,685 crore.The Telangana model does not require the farmer to register his cultivated area and crops. The farmer is free to grow a crop of his choice and sell it anytime in a mandi of his choice. This model is crop-neutral, more equitable, more transparent, and gives farmers the freedom to choose. Incidentally, China has a similar scheme: It gives aggregate input subsidy support on a per acre basis. The scheme does not distort markets and is worth following. Will the Union Budget make such a bold move to redress farmers woes?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana led by Raju Shetti had parted ways with the BJP on demand of MSP. MSP was also the main plank at Opposition rallies  as also Maratha protests for reservation and farmers unrest  in the state.The decision to extend the MSP to all kharif cropsis truly historic. It would be a step towards economic empowerment of farmers and higher growth in rural economy, which would have a positive impact on the overall Gross State Domestic Product, Fadnavis said while talking to the media. The state had earlier said legislation would be brought in to make non-complaince to MSP a punishable offence.At present, MSP is confined to select farm produce such as paddy (Rs 1,470), jowar (Rs 1,625), wheat (Rs 1,625), maize (Rs 1,365), bajra (Rs 1,330), gram (Rs 4,000), tur (Rs 5,050), moong (Rs 5,225), sunflower (Rs 3,950), soybean (Rs 2,775), groundnut (Rs 4,220), cotton (Rs 4,160), masoor (Rs 3,900), ragi (Rs 1,725), sesame (Rs 5,000), niger seed (Rs 3,825) and mustard (Rs 3,700).The state government has already implemented the reforms in the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) to facilitate farmers to sell their goods in the open market. But it was confronted with two major challenges related to MSP and higher institutional credit.Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said: MSP was our long-standing demand. But unless it is implemented and brings benefits to farmers, it would prove futile.Raju Shetti said: The government must ensure that MSP is not misused by traders at the cost of farmers. It must serve the small and poor farmers.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

On the strength of their yields from the land, the four women joined hands with Aswathy, another Kudumbasree member, to set up a micro-enterprise that produces organic fertilizers, pesticides, and compost.Despite initial hiccups, it has been good going for the JLG, so much so that they have returned an initial bank loan of Rs. 2 lakh, and been given a fresh loan for the same amount. We have had no losses, though all the cultivation is done organically, Ms. Sathi says.Besides 70 cents of land owned by Ms. Sathi, they have taken land on lease too to grow crops. Though part of Kudumbasree for four years, Ms. Sathi has been cultivating crops for only a year-and-a half. We enquired with the panchayat authorities, and were told about starting the JLG. I teamed up with other like-minded women. My husband and family members too help. Today, what we grow meets most of our needs. We also sell our produce at the weekly market in Malayinkeezhu and at Kudumbasree festivals and the like.Motivation. Not everyone is cooperative, especially when it comes to sharing water. Then there are people who are dismissive of women doing something like this. The support given by panchayat president Chandran Nair and Krishi Bhavan official Chithra motivates us.The women have also been feted for their work. We have received awards from the Kudumbasree State and district mission, the panchayat, and the Krishi Bhavan, besides an incentive from the district mission.Ms. Sathi and the others have now sown lentils such as green gram and black gram.Asked whether their success has spurred other womens groups to take up farming, Ms. Sathi says there have not been many.Samruddhi, which means prosperity, has proved that a return to agriculture is possible. All that is required is a will."

(Sarfaraz Alam)The finance minister (FM) has made a smart move by announcing in the Union budget speech that the government has already fulfilled its election promise of giving minimum support prices (MSPs) of at least 50 per cent higher than their costs in rabi crops, and this principle will be followed with other crops too. But this statement has also created a smokescreen and, perhaps, blinded the Opposition temporarily with a tear gas shell. We look at it closely to gauge what it means for farmers.The whole issue boils down to what was the cost considered in the BJPs election manifesto in 2014. For those who are not familiar with the exercise of MSP recommendations, there are several cost concepts that the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP) considers while recommending MSPs of 23 crops. There are the costs the farmer actually pays out of his/her pocket for buying various inputs ranging from seeds to fertilisers to pesticides to hired labour to hired machinery or even leased-in land, which are all put under the cost A2 concept. However, in agriculture, farmers also use a lot of family labour and if their cost is imputed and added to cost A2, that concept is called cost A2+FL. But then there is also a comprehensive cost (cost C2), which includes not only imputed costs of family labour but also the imputed rent of owned land and imputed interest on owned capital. It is 50 per cent margin over C2 which has been at the centre of the farmers demand, and also the M S Swaminathan Commissions recommendation. But what the FM seems to have suggested in his budget speech when he said the government has already given at least 50 per cent margin in rabi crops, is that they have covered cost A2, or maybe cost A2+FL, as MSPs are still lower than cost C2.But it bothers those who have ploughed the fields for long when this 50 per cent margin of MSP over cost A2+FL is being touted as a big game-changing decision which no other government in the past could undertake. That is simply not true. Even in the last year of the UPA government, in 2013-14, the MSPs for all rabi crops were way above 50 per cent over cost A2+FL. For example, in wheat, the margin was 106 per cent and in rapeseed-mustard 133 per cent. For the current year of the NDA government, the margins are 112 per cent for wheat and only 88 per cent for rapeseed-mustard (see Figure 1). And this has been more or less the same for more than 10 years. So, the current government has done nothing earth-shaking in this regard.What was this election promise of 50 per cent margin over cost about when margins were already far higher in rabi crops in 2013-14? Certainly, it was not cost A2+FL. it was cost C2, though this was never spelt out in detail. However, like the previous government, which rejected the Swaminathan Commissions recommendation on this issue, and rightly so, this government too found that it was impractical to give 50 per cent margin over cost C2 in all crops. This would have required massive increases in MSPs (for example, paddy MSP would have to go up by 46 per cent; cotton by 52 per cent and so on; see Figure-2). But the government was in a fix about honouring its election promise. So it simply changed the reference cost from C2 to A2+FL without uttering a word about it. It may be noted that cost C2 is normally 35-40 per cent higher than cost A2+FL. So, by lowering the reference cost drastically, the government could claim that it has fulfilled its election promise in case of rabi crops and can do so for kharif crops soon. This is a smart sleight of hand. But saying that it is a game-changer and will be a major step towards doubling farmers incomes is going overboard and may soon boomerang if the Opposition is smart enough to see the issue through.Although the current proposed increase would still need an upward revision in MSP, of say paddy by about 11 per cent, cotton by 18 per cent, moong by 20 per cent and hybrid jowar by 41 per cent etc, the real question is whether this would reduce farmers woes given that less than 10 per cent of the peasantry has ever benefited from an MSP regime in the past. Does the government plan to go for price deficiency payments (PDP) at an all-India level for 23 crops? The Madhya Pradesh experiment in PDP shows that market prices are prone to manipulation by traders, and can end up helping traders more than farmers.Given that agri-GDP growth has plummeted to just 1.9 per cent in the first four years of the Narendra Modi government compared to 3.8 per cent in the first four years of the UPA-I government, the Modi sarkar seems to be heading towards India shining days of NDA-I  a lot of over-confidence, but with feet of clay in the agri-rural sector. Politically, that may prove costly.It may also be mentioned that cost plus pricing of MSPs, be it cost A2+FL or C2, is fraught with dangers as it totally ignores the demand side. The terms of reference of CACP rightly require it to consider demand-supply, cost of production, price trends in domestic and international markets, terms of trade, inter-crop price parity, etc before recommending the MSP. If the MSP is to be determined just by adding 50 per cent margin over cost A2+FL, better abolish CACP and let any babu in the Department of Economics and Statistics, which estimates the cost of production, fix MSPs.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The move paid off as it not only helped in conservation of GIB but also brought more money to the farmers.According to experts, when farmers use pesticides, GIB loses a major portion of its food  insects, locust, lizard among others  and the bird is forced to look for smaller insects in the grains, resulting in damage to the crops.The experiment to adopt organic farming was so encouraging that the foundation and the farmers have decided to apply for an organic certification with the brand name, Ghorad. The GIB is locally known as Ghorad.Initially, I was a bit reluctant when the Corbett Foundation suggested me to go for organic farming. But, when I saw a group of rosy startlet in an adjacent field feeding on insects, I realized its importance. The foundation also assured to compensate me for any possible loss, said Yakub Jatt, a resident of Kunathiya village in Abdasa taluka.Devesh Gadhvi, deputy director of Kutch Ecological Research Centre and a member of the State Bustard Conservation Committee , said, We realized that 70% of the food for the GIB during the breeding season were the insects in the agriculture fields and the pesticides were killing them. We then persuaded the farmers not to use pesticides and an experiment was undertaken in a small area. The results were very encouraging. The farmers were able to produce around 700kg of moong.With some publicity on social media, the 700kg of moong was sold off in two days and the farmers who were getting around Rs 45 per kg in the open market were able to garner Rs 70 per kg. We still have orders for another 6,000kg. Encouraged by the results, several other farmers join us. This time, we expect around 50-odd farmers to join the initiative, said Gadhvi.According to Gadhvi, 20 other threatened species of birds are found in the area. All these birds feed on insects."

Under NDRF norms, farmers who cultivate crops on non-irrigated land will get compensation of Rs 6,800 per hectare (relief is capped at two hectares). For irrigated land, they are entitled to get compensation of Rs13,500 per hectare, while for horticulture or perennial crops they get Rs18,000 per hectare.More hail and unseasonal rain were reported in six talukas of Amravati division in Vidarbha on Monday and Tuesday, with hailstones the size of lemons raining down.

However, only the coming period will reflect the actual yield from the rabi season, he said.Vilas Shinde, director of Sahyadri Farmer Producer Group , said variation in the weather was one of the reasons for the fall in production of the wheat during the rabi season. Wheat needs cold weather for about 40 days. However, the rainfall in December last year and the recent hail and unseasonal rain events adversely affected wheat production. Production of pulses fell because farmers reduced sowing last year after the low minimum support price offered to them in 2016, he said.Wheat production is estimated to dip from 22 lakh tonne to 12 lakh tonne this fiscal while that of gram may fall by 1 lakh tonne from 19 lakh tonne.Dhaval Shah, director, Jairaj Group , which deals in food commodities in western India, said price of wheat is expected to rise by Rs 2-3 per kg.

Home minister Gulab Chand Kataria said the court order allows rallies and protests in Jaipur only between 12 noon and 4 pm on working days while the farmers intended to stage an indefinite protest in the city.Kataria made the statement in the state assembly while responding to Congress whip Govind Singh Dotasras allegation that the government was denying the right to protest to farmers who were gathering here to press for complete farm loan waiver. The government had announced to waive off farm loans up to Rs 50,000 taken from cooperative banks.The house was told that besides arresting 179 farmers and their leaders in past three days, the police detained around 2000 farmers and 50 vehicles on roads and highways leading to Jaipur from different districts till 11am on Thursday. Protesters were arrested from different parts of Jaipur, Sikar, Jhunjhunu, Churu, Hanumangarh, Sriganganagar, Bikaner, Nagaur and Baran districts, the home minister said.Even as thousands of farmers were protesting on roads across the state, there were just five Congress MLAs (out of 25)Dotasra, Bhanwar Singh Bhati, Mewaram Jain, Ramnarayan and Shakuntla Rawat (she joined late)and around 50 BJP MLAs (out of 159), besides a few others, in the house of 199-members when the peasant issues were being discussed in the assembly on Thursday.Raising the issue during zero hour, Dotasra said the riders put in by the government would restrict loan waiver benefit to less than half the number of affected farmers. Instead of Rs 8000-cr figure given by the government, just Rs 2000-cr would reach the affected farmers, the Congress legislator from Laxmangarh (Sikar) said.Dotasra said the government gave minimum support price (MSP) for just 11% groundnut crop, 34% moong crop, 1% soya-bean crop, while it did not buy bajra and maize at all in 2017-18, adding to hardships of farmers hit by natural calamities. Farmers in the state lost more than Rs 3253-cr in a single year as government did not buy their produce at MSP, the Congress whip said.What did the farmers not give you? They gave you 163 seats in state (2013) and all 25 seats in Lok Sabha (2014). But, unfortunately, such a useless government has come to power that it is sending farmers to jail and lodging fake cases against them, Dotasra said.Countering the Congress whips allegations, cooperatives minister Ajay Singh Kilak presented district-wise figures of farm loans waived under the present government and the previous UPA-II government. In Sikar district, 1,07,452 farmers will get more than Rs 465-cr benefit under our government, while just around Rs 16-cr were waived for 7,188 farmers under the previous UPA-II government, said Kilak."

Revive traditional seeds and millets  has been the farmers motto for the last 10 years to overcome the prevailing water scarcity.S Yoganathan, 43, a resident of Thinnakkonam village near Musiri and managing director of a farmers producers company, has paddy seeds such as Navara, Maappillai Samba, Kichadi Samba, Poongar and Iluppai samba. He has preserved more than 10 varieties of millets including foxtail millet, small millet, finger millet, ragi, sorghum, horsegram, black horse gram, dhal, green gram and mat beans. These are apart from the 60 varieties of vegetable seeds he has in his possession.Millets are one of the oldest food items known to humans and are a source of nutrition in difficult times such as drought or crop failure. It is relatively cheap and easy to grow and can be stored well for years. Since a single seed produces a lot of grains, it is not expensive either. It does not need any extra fertilizer or water to grow well. It is also seldom affected by pests, Yoganathan told TOI.According to him, farmers are giving up hope of cultivating paddy since there was no water in the reservoirs. They had expressed an overwhelming response to take up millets which had been remaining an unutilised option for decades. We have appealed to the government to take necessary steps to distribute millets in fair price shops at least once in three months. The commissioner, Civil Supplies and Consumer Protection Department , has assured us to do the needful, he added.On his part, Yoganathan has been cultivating various crops on three acres of his ancestral land and has at present raised brinjal on 15 cents organically. He uses Panjakavyam, Amirthakaraisal and herbicides without using chemical fertiliser and pesticide.Interestingly, despite raising chemical-free brinjal, he has not fixed a high rate for the produce. As we need not spend much for chemical fertilizer and pesticide, the cost of production has to be relatively low. However, in order to make a fast buck, many farmers sell organic produces at a higher rate. That is why their sales among the general public are less, he added.As part of the farmers efforts to create a common platform to facilitate exchange of seeds as well as traditional and scientific knowledge between the farming and scientific communities, he has been organizing seed festivals where traditional seed varieties are exhibited and exchanged. He has also formed a farmer producer company (FPC) and has been striving hard to take up millet cultivation under 200 acres in Musiri taluk alone. He says that if it succeeds, about 4,000 acres lying unused in and around the area could be brought into the stream for millet cultivation.Yoganathan appealed to farmers to create a farm pond on their land so that not even a drop of water would go waste and flow to other lands. This would immensely help them to water shortage, he added."

Esakimuthu, president of the sangam, in a petition submitted to Collector N. Venkatesh, said the elderly chank divers had no work and no means of income. They had been risking their lives to earn their livelihood during a six month period every year, he said.Several years ago, the chank divers were involved in pearl diving at Thoothukudi coast, which has its own history and tradition.Insurance benefitsMany farmers from Murampan in Ottapidaram taluk demanded disbursal of crop insurance benefits due for 2014-15 and 2016-17.In a petition, they said the farmers insured crops such as black gram, green gram and cotton.Agriculture was the key livelihood activity in this village with around 400 families.Delay condemnedCadre of Communist Party of India (Marxist) staged an agitation in front of the Collectorate condemning delay in allocation of house sites.S. Appakutty, union secretary, who led the agitation, said free house site pattas were already given to 135 persons of Seidunganallur panchayat in Srivaikuntam taluk. But a petition was submitted to the Collector earlier for conducting a survey and allotment of plots to actual beneficiaries.But, no action had been taken to demarcate and clear plots to the beneficiaries. Hence, he demanded the district administration to expedite the process and other formalities to provide plots for them at the earliest.Besides, the cadre submitted a petition to relay damaged portions of roads from Vittilapuram to Muthulankurichi, Vallakulam to Vadakku Karaseri, Vallanadu to Kasilingapuram and Kaliyavoor."

Despite the marginal increase in the area under cultivation to 1.50 crore hectares from 1.49 crore hectares, the overall production declined.Among kharif crops, cereal production dropped by 4%, pulses by 46% and oilseeds by 15% in the current fiscal, as estimated in the report. A big drop in the market prices of tur or pigeon peas during the last kharif season reduced their production by 53%. This also brought down area under cultivation for tur. The production of moong and cash crop soyabean fell by 37% and 15%.The pink bollworm attack on 42.17 lakh hectares of cotton crop brought down the production by 44%.Similarly, the production of rabi crops too fell in 2017-18. The rabi cereals also dropped by 39% ,pulses by 4% and oilseeds by 73%, the survey stated.The negative growth may scuttle the state governments aim to double farmers income by 2022. During the Magnetic Maharashtra summit held in Mumbai two weeks ago, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis said his government wanted to make the state a $1trillion economy by 2025, with a sizable contribution from the agricultural sector. His government talked of achieving a positive growth in 2016-17 from the negative growth during the erstwhile Congress-led government.Finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar said, The growth has dipped in agriculture owing to less rainfall  84.3% of the normal rainfall and 94% the previous year.The survey said 39.47 lakh hectares of land was irrigated till June 30, 2017 compared to 31.37 lakh hectares in 2014-15. The irrigation potential creation reached 49.62%.I think a drop in production of pulses is owing to falling prices, while pest attack hit cotton crop. I am surprised with the contradiction because when production falls, prices go up. More alarming is the absence of a sound mechanism to procure produce at the assured minimum support price, said rural economy expert Milind Murugkar.The Opposition slammed the government over the contraction in the agricultural sector.Leader of opposition in the legislative council Dhananjay Munde said, The state government has been claiming to have spent Rs1.50 lakh crore in the agricultural sector in the last three years. But the obvious question is why it does reflect in the growth.The state disbursed Rs9,709 crore in short-term crop loans in 2017-18 against Rs15,001 crore previous year."
5b16fc5a9855b75cf6a8f687,An enduring rista,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/an-enduring-rista/article23018327.ece,2018-03-10,"A wonderful aroma that wafts in from a floor above our flat every now and then stops me in my tracks. I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

She made a similar plea to allies in a meeting of opposition parties on February 1, and days later told Congress MPs that she would take an initiative to forge opposition unity ahead of elections.""The main issue with BJP is they made huge fantastic promises. But what is being implemented? They sold such a positive picture -- we will give jobs, give you Rs 15 lakh. There is great disappointment. I am confident BJP's achhe din will actually turn into India Shining -- which brought us to power (in 2004),"" she said.Amplifying what appeared a message for potential allies as well party workers, Sonia Gandhi said, ""We are going to come back. We are not going to let them (BJP) come back to power.""Targeting PM Narendra Modi , she argued that the ruling dispensation of resorting to lies to hide uncomfortable reality like unemployment. Sonia Gandhi said Congress was out-marketed by BJP in the 2014 elections and while corruption was an issue, it was exaggerated.She said humungous figures of loss were given by CAG in the 2G spectrum allocation case. I think everyone now realises that it was highly exaggerated. The person in-charge has now been given a cushy job, Gandhi said, in a reference to former CAG Vinod Rai.The Congress leader tore into Modi government alleging that country was being led by a regressive vision with atmosphere of intimidation.Our country, our society, our freedom are now all under systematic and sustained threat. There is rewriting of history, falsifying facts and fanning prejudice and bigotry, she said.She said provocative statements from the ruling camp were designed to intimidate people. Freedom to think, marry according to ones wishes is under attack. Religious tensions are being fuelled, vigilante mobs have been let loose, she charged."

Birendra Singh was accompanied by district agriculture officials and general manager of central warehouse corporation. They visited Bhograi, Jaleswar, Basta and Baliapal where they interacted with farmers associated with pulse cultivation and tried to ascertain the problems they faced.Singh wanted to know whether the farmers had the soil tested before plantation, the seed treatment process and use of fertilisers and pesticides, their weeding methods, yield per hectare and market.Although the farmers said they received help from the department and showed their soil test certificates, they complained about the distress sale of pulses. They alleged that they were forced to sell moong and Bengal gram at Rs 30 to Rs 35 a kg against the Centre's minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 55 a kg last year.They alleged that the lack of marketing facilities such as Markfed - co-operative marketing federations like those in Punjab and Andhra Pradesh - and the Nafed had enabled middlemen to exploit them. ""The farmers mainly raised the issue of distress sale because of the absence of marketing agencies and urged the team to address the issue. They complained that while they were forced to sell their produce for Rs 30-Rs 35 a kg against the central MSP of Rs 55 last year, the price in the open market was between Rs 60 and Rs 70 a kg,"" said assistant agriculture officer, Basta block, Sanjay Rout.""The farmers said that they had reduced the area of cultivation this year because of last year's distress sale,"" he said.

While those from the delta region welcomed the announcement on procurement of cereals, sugarcane farmers have given a thumbs-down to the proposed revenue sharing method. Farmers said that the Rs 250 crore earmarked for constructing check dams was as meagre as the Rs 300 crore set apart for Kudi Maramatthu (maintenance of water channels).Secretary of Thanjavur District Cauvery Farmers Protection Association Swamimalai R Vimalnathan said that there were a number of attractive announcements in the budget. These included Rs 130 crore for dairy development, Rs 1,227.89 crore for animal husbandry and the ultra mega food park under the new food processing policy. However, there was no scheme for small and marginal farmers, he alleged.Finance minister has announced that sugarcane farmers would get their incentive based on revenue sharing method. This system will not work because only mill owners will benefit from the revenue sharing method. The Rs 200 crore incentive for sugarcane cultivation is an eye-wash , he said. Sugar cane farmers have urged the government to do the needful to disburse the Rs 1,460 crore due to them first.If the government started procuring black gram, green gram and dhal, it should not be done through Tamil Nadu Agri Regulated Marketing. Instead, the government should open separate centres at the village level, so that farmers could sell their produces without spending money on transportation, he added.State organizer of the farmers wing of Tamil Manila Congress, Puliyur A Nagarajan, said that when there was no announcement on writing off crop loans, nothing could be done with the allocation of Rs 8,000 crore as loan to needy farmers through co-operatives. The entire farming community was in the clutches of debt, he added.The Tamil Nadu government should first withdraw the case filed in the Supreme Court opposing the order of the Madras high court Madurai bench revoking the crop loan of the farming community in the state, Nagarajan further stated."

The outgo on MSP and MIS was far higher than the previous governments Rs. 358 crore for 10 years, said Agriculture Minister Somireddi Chandramohan Reddy.The Minister was replying to an issue  MSP and market intervention scheme  raised by MLAs Y.Sambasiva Rao, D. Bala Veeranjaneya Swamy and Arimilli Radhakrishna under rule 344 in Assembly on Friday.The Minister said that the government procured maize, jowar, millets, black gram, green gram, red gram, bengal gram, black jaggery and turmeric under the MSP/MIS. The Central government would not declare the MSP for certain cash crops like turmeric, chillies and also products like black jaggery. On case to case basis, sometimes the Central government would sanction MIS but for fixed quantity. It created a lot of unrest among the farming community and avoidable negative publicity to the government. So, the government introduced price support scheme for red chillies and market intervention activity was taken up for onions and tomatoes to help the farmers, he said.The government had procured 5.44 lakh MT of agricultural commodities like maize, jowar and pulses. In addition, 55.57 lakh MT of paddy was procured from 2012-13 to 2016-17. The total paddy purchased under MSP was 39.54 lakh metric tonnes (LMTs). The paddy shifted for custom milling was 39.42 LMT, he said.Centres clarificationUnion Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, in the Budget 2018-19, stated that all notified crops under Kharif marketing season 2018-19 would be fixed at a minimum of 50% above cost of cultivation. It was later clarified that the cost to be considered for this calculation would be actual paid out cost plus value of family labour. So, the potential rise in MSP for paddy (common) would be 8% while it would be 5% for Grade A. The MSP for paddy had increased by 55% at Rs. 1,550 per quintal in 2017-18, he said.The Central government was fixing a lesser MSP than that suggested by the State government. For the year 2017-18, the State government suggested an MSP of Rs. 2,799 per quintal for paddy. The Centre, however, fixed Rs. 1550 for common variety. While Rs. 3,437 MSP was suggested for Grade A variety, the Centre pegged it at Rs. 1,590. The same was the case with other commodities like jowar, bajra, maize, ragi, and pulses, he added."
5b1c70cf9855b74aba67c703,"Serving it smoky, fiery, with bhakri… eateries experiment with misal",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/serving-it-smoky-fiery-with-bhakri-eateries-experiment-with-misal/articleshow/63359912.cms,2018-03-19,"PUNE: The humble misal was a non-judgmental item when it was introduced a century ago as a cheap, filling meal for the less-privileged, labour workforce in Pune. Today, it is a dish that foodlovers dissect ingredient by ingredient. So you have animated debates over the spiciness of the tarri (curry), the pungency of the onions, the appropriateness of pav vis-avis bread slices to accompany the mix, the redundancy or otherwise of pohe and mashed potatoes in the dish, and the battle for taste-wise topper from among Pune, Kolhapur, Nashik and other cities in Maharashtra.The kind of misal served has remained unchanged at the older joints in the city, which probably didnt think a low-cost dish needed innovation. But staying true to form also earned loyalty, as amply seen by the number of regular visitors devouring bowlfuls of green tarri at Punes first misal outlet  the 107-year-old Vaidya Uphar Gruha near the railway reservation office at Raviwar Peth . Vaidya has been serving the green tarri since it set up shop, and stuck to it even after the red variety became more or less the norm in eateries that sprung up later.Now, a newer generation of traditional food entrepreneurs is willing to experiment with the dish, confident that it holds its own against the fare on menus guided by global trends.The simple variation of cooking tarri on a wood-fired chul (stove) instead of on a gas burner draws the clientele to Saurabh Dadarkars Indiano Grill restaurant on Sinhagad road. The chul imparts a smoky flavour to his reddish-black tarri, which is prepared using a home-made masala. He says the masala is commonly used in the misals found in Khed village on the Pune-Nashik highway , which he replicated in his kitchen.After the Khed variety, Dadarkars vote goes equally to the Nashik and Puneri misals. He doesnt fancy the Kolhapur one, saying the spices that go in are a tad overpowering which suppresses the true taste of the dish. His own misal contains matki (moth beans) and chiwda made from dried pohe, sev and farsan. On weekends, he claims to prepare 50 litres of tarri.A smoky misal is also on offer at Alok Thakars Damodar P30 at Bibvewadi. However, instead of cooking on a chul, Thakar puts a burning charcoal in the small clay pot containing the farsan.Asked about the intriguing P30 suffix to his eaterys name, Thakar says it is a tribute to the wholesome food one can savour in three peth areas that have a pincode ending with the number 30  Shaniwar Peth, Shukrawar Peth and Narayan Peth. An interesting sight at his outlet are the plastic water pouches hanging from the ceiling. Each of these have a clean coin within and their glimmer keeps the flies away, Thakar says.At Vimannagar, Misal Ani Barach Kahi (Misal And A Lot More) restaurant offers three types of misals  one of which interestingly has a batata wada dunked in the matki-laced curry. They serve pav with the misal, but also offer bhakris if asked for. Tushar Kale (30), a partner at the restaurant, says two of their misals have matki and one green gram (mug). The only other ingredient in their misals is plain sev. They limit the number of ingredients in the mix to allow the taste of the masala come through in the tarri.Mangesh Kale of Sai Chhaya Misal at Kothrud also believes in tickling the taste buds with his tarri, which is a unique black colour due to the use of a special kala masala. The tarri resembles a dark amti and people have no hesitation drinking an entire bowl.Pankaj Karad, a former hotel management student and a foodie, is armed with a list of all the misal places in Pune. He claims to have eaten in around 90% of them, many times over at some. He also claims to be inching towards a milestone  eating his 1,000th misal at the notoriously fiery Nevale Misal outlet at Chaphekar chowk in Chinchwad.This writer ate the extra spicy version of Nevales misal with Karad (he said it was his 974th misal there since 1996) and our sweat glands soon sprung a leak. The only way to temper the tarri is to pile on it more sev, gathiya and papdi, which incidentally are all homemade. But that would take away from the dish. Karad swears the misal has a sweetish taste at the end. The zesty tarri, fresh farsan and taste rollercoaster are probably what keeps him coming back for more."

Rajasthan is the third largest chana producer in the country; the production this rabi season is expected to be 15.86 lakh tonnes, officials said.After chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced last month one-time crop loan waiver of up to Rs 50,000 for small and marginal farmers, land revenue exemption, and a slew of sops, the state government has taken some follow-up steps.State cooperative minister Ajay Singh Kilak has said sharecroppers will also be allowed to sell mustard and chana at MSP at mandis. A non-judicial contract will have to be made between farm land owner and the tenant farmer to avail of this facility.The land owner will have to furnish relevant documents and the tenant farmer will have to fill a form before he would be able to sell the crop on MSP. The payment will be credited directly to the account.Sources said chief minister has asked the officials concerned to give priority to issues related to agriculture sector and brief her daily about the situation. With the procurement season starting from April, the government does not want a repeat of farmers protests following non-procurement of the produce on MSP.We will be tracking the procurement of the main crops, such as chana, mustard, bajra, and soybean, to ensure that farmers get fair price this season, an official said.While wheat is mostly procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), bajra is consumed locally. Farmers generally get good prices for other rabi crops. Last season, crash in prices of moong and groundnut were a major reason for discontent.Farmers unrest has been simmering across the state for the past one year and a recent march to state assembly by farmers affiliated to All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) was foiled by the police. While opposition parties have tried to corner the government over the issue in the assembly, the government has come out with a slew of measures, including partial farm loan waiver.The state agriculture department is also gearing up to organise Rajasthan global agri meet in Jodhpur division in April. The event is scheduled for April 20-22."
5b1456569855b75db2e6b3e8,Ryots begin to favour pulses over paddy in State’s rice bowl,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/ryots-begin-to-favour-pulses-over-paddy-in-states-rice-bowl/article23297970.ece,2018-03-20,"Lured by the prospect of additional income with little effort, more farmers in Thanjavur district have taken to cultivation of pulses. Consequently, the area under the crop, mostly black gram, has shot up by a phenomenal 10,000 hectare (ha) this year.In Thanjavur district, the normal area under pulses is roughly 25,000 hectare. While in the kharif season (July to October) an estimated 9,200 hectare is brought under pulses, another 15,800 ha is covered with pulses during the rabi months (October to March).This kharif season, the area under pulses was estimated to be 13,323 ha and shot up to 21,871 ha during rabi, bringing a total of 35,194 ha under pulses. This is bound to go up by another 300 ha, as sugarcane growers will plant it as an inter-crop in their fields in the next couple of weeks.The sharp increase of around 10,194 ha under pulses is attributed to two principal factors. The first is the special campaign run by the Department of Agriculture that encouraged farmers to go in for profitable black gram varieties during the kharif season, wherever paddy cultivation could not be taken up due to irrigation restrictions for want of adequate water supply. The second important factor was that the officials encouraged bund cropping on paddy fields and inter-cropping of pulses on sugarcane fields wherever possible, say sources in the Department.The bolster came from Thanjavur, Budalur, Tiruvaiyaru, Orathanad, Pattukkottai, Peravurani and Sethubavachatram blocks that reported increased area overage. Varieties such as ADT 5, Vamban 5 and Vamban 6 are popular among the farmers.Continued water scarcity that prevented us from raising kuruvai for six years on the trot and the failure of the samba during 2015-16 led us to think of viable alternatives without forcing us to lose sight of the traditional paddy cultivation methods. Here, cultivation of pulses as border crop and inter crop came in handy and now farmers have realised the benefits of raising pulses varieties and that explains their growing popularity, said A. Rasappa Udayar of Thirumalai Samudram, a farmer who raised black gram as the major crop.Last samba season, we feared that the long duration paddy crop might get hit and so opted for medium duration crops. That facilitated raising of green gram and black gram either as rice fallow pulses or as border crop. Luckily, the additional revenue from pulses made good to some extent the shortfall in returns from paddy whose prices fell sharply, said another farmer T. Vedamurthy Rajapiriyar of Soorakkottai near Thanjavur.There has been a steady increase in the area under pulses in Thanjavur district in the past four years. During 2014-15, pulses were raised on 23,441 ha, while in 2015-16 the coverage went up to 24,959 ha. In 2016-17, the area further enlarged to 25,848 ha. This year, the officials hope to touch 36,000 hectare."

Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis announced this in the Assembly on Thursday. Farmers owe nearly Rs17,000 crore as outstanding electricity bills to the state government.They have been protesting against this drive for the past one year. This demand, along with waiving of pending power bills, was also raised by their leaders post the Long March protest this month. Some 30,000 farmers had marched from Nashik to Mumbai to raise certain demands before the state government, including the power bill waiver demand. While the government has not waived off the bills, it has halted the drive.The issue was raised by senior NCP leader Ajit Pawar in the Lower House.At present, farmers and gram panchayats in the state have a pending bill of Rs17,000 crore. The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission (MERC) issued a directive for recovery of non-payments of electricity bills, after which the drive began. However, considering the difficulties faced by the farmers, the state government has now decided to postpone the drive. Power connections will not be disconnected for those farmers unable to pay their bills, Fadnavis said.The state government has also decided to pay the electricity bill of gram panchayats, he added.Pawar, while raising the matter, had said it is unfair on part of the government to disconnect the connections. Farmers are not in a position to pay electricity bills owing to the financial crisis they are currently facing. The drive should be stopped immediately, Pawar said.Read more: 30,000 Maharashtra farmers march to Mumbai, plan to block access to state legislature bldgMeanwhile, state marketing minister Subhash Deshmukh on Thursday said the government will purchase 4.5 lakh tonnes of pigeon pea or tur the farmers.

Madasamy of Karunkaadu near Narasinganallur sat on the floor in front of the DRO in protest against the delay in giving compensation for the plantains reportedly destroyed in recent gale.

Rajasthan farmers are facing financial difficulties as they are not getting fair price for their produce  gram, mustard, wheat and garlic.In the last four years, the BJP government in Rajasthan stopped additional bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat, started by the previous Congress government, Gehlot said. Our government in 2012-13 for the first time gave Rs 100 per quintal bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat; for this, a grant of Rs 200 crore was given. In 2013-14, additional bonus of Rs 150 per quintal was given on wheat purchase.There has been a bumper production of gram in Kota division, which the farmers want to sell on support price, Gehlot said. In the absence of adequate arrangements to purchase gram on support price, farmers have to sell gram at Rs 3500 per quintal and mustard at Rs 3600 per quintal. The support price of gram is Rs 4400 and of mustard is Rs 4000.Farmers who sold moong (green gram) on support price are waiting for payment and making rounds of the Rajasthan state cooperative federation and banks, Gehlot alleged.After Maharashtra, Rajasthan produces maximum onion. Farmers are already in debt and fall in prices of onion and garlic has added to their worry. In view of farmers interest, the state government should purchase onion on fair price, Gehlot said."

MahinshaS.MAHINSHAPonnis four-month-old cub, a female, is as rambunctious as any tiger cub. After its initial days in the animal enclosure at the city zoo, this would have been the time for her to frisk around in the open.However, the heat has put paid to any such plans. With the sun beating down relentlessly, the zoo authorities deployed infrared sensing equipment and found that the body heat of the tigers was increasing in the open enclosure. For now, Ponni and the cub have been moved to an appropriate enclosure with shade.Each time seasons change, the zoo authorities gear up to ensure that the animals remain fit and fine, but preparations for the summer are in a different league altogether. From changes in diet to fitting fans near enclosures, all attempts are made to keep the animals in comfort during the stifling heat.Less meatTigers, for instance, are given 1 kg meat less during the hot summer months, while the Himalayan bears get fruit encased in ice to beat the heat. In fact, the quantity of fruit and vegetables purchased goes up during these months, says Zoo superintendent T.V. Anil Kumar.Herbivores and birds are given sprouted green gram, Bengal gram, and cotton seed. Birds are given vitamins, electrolytes, and a mineral mixture too. For comfort, enclosures are made suitable for the animals. Adequate drinking water is ensured. There are tanks too in some enclosures as that of monkeys, hippos, lions, nilgai, jackal, and some birds.Tigers could be sure that their small wading pools have water round the clock, while ostriches have fans so that a pressure cooker effect caused by rising humidity does not cause them harm. Last year, an ostrich had died of this condition. So, we have installed fans to ensure that the birds get cool air, says Zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander. Some other animals too have fans in the enclosure, while reptiles have both fans and air conditioners.Enclosures of rhino, sambar deer, and swamp deer have wallowing areas for the animals to roll about in the mud as protection from the sun.ShowersZoo officials plan to install showers too in the new emu enclosures so that the animals could cool down quick as the mercury climbs.Some animals such as tigers are hosed down with water two to three times a day to bring down body temperatures. In the sambar deer enclosure that is rather bereft of vegetation, there are plans to set up sheds with roofs made of palm leaf fronds and grass so as to provide the animals shade from the harsh sun.The old and the infirm are given special attention during the summer, Dr. Alexander says. Elderly monkeys, for instance, are not allowed in the open in such conditions. They have been shifted to the animal house to prevent health problems, he says.It is not just animals and birds that the zoo officials are concerned about. There are plans to install more drinking water units for the visitors to the zoo in the coming days."

Till now, the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (Nafed) Ltd has procured only 7,403 tonnes or 2.4% of the gram target of 3 lakh tonnes, and 1.9 lakh tonnes or 43% of the 4.5 lakh tonnes tur target.For soyabean, moong dal and urad dal, the procurement period is over. Only 5,434 tonnes or 15% of the moong target of 34,750 tonnes was met, and only 26,283 tonnes or 26% of the soyabean target of 1 lakh tonnes was met. Only in the case of urad dal was the procurement high, meeting 94% of the target.Nafed buys crops at MSP from farmers across the country. The network of MSP centres is managed by the states. Farmers complain that the centres open late, procure little and there are massive payment delays.Officials say the payment delay was caused by lags in operationalising the Centres bank guarantee of Rs 19,000 crore to Nafed for procurement across the country. The state offered a bank guarantee of Rs 200 crore but this has yet to be operationalised, said Nafed officials.By now, the agency has purchased tur worth Rs 1,000 crore in the state. Nafed received Rs 500 crore in central funds for tur farmers in the state on March 26. An additional Rs 100 crore was received on April 5 and will soon be disbursed to farmers, said officials.Nafed officials said procurement had been delayed mainly because of the lack of godown space in the state. After the bumper production of tur last year, Nafed purchased 75 lakh quintals of the pulse, of which only 10 lakh quintals has been sold so far. This is why we have not been able to purchase more of the gram and tur target, a Nafed official said.For soyabean, procurement was low since the MSP at Rs 3,050 per quintal was lower than the market price of around Rs 3,800. Moong dal procurement was low since the quality of the pulse had suffered with unseasonal rains, said officials.Activists say the MSP was meant to be an emergency price for farmers in a situation of price volatility. Now with market prices collapsing, it has become the preferred price.The Centre needs to use export and import policies to protect the domestic market from global price dips, a farm activist, Vijay Jawandhia, said."

(Source: BCCI)Andre Russells devastating knock against Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in Chepauk has taken the Indian Premier League 2018 (IPL) season 11 by storm. Coming into bat at number four, Russell slammed a 36-ball unbeaten 88 which include 11 humungous sixes and just one four. However, despite his best efforts, KKR came up short which left the Jamaican in a sombre mood.Reflecting on his performance, the 29-year-old all-rounder revealed that the one-year ban handed to him last season has helped him regain his confidence and assist him to emerge as a different person.I think the last one year has made me a different person, said Russell. I have learnt how to be humble. I need to make sure that you stay on top of what you are doing as a professional and yet be humble. I just want to ensure that these things dont happen again, he added.Explaining the reason behind his good run of form, he said, I think I am confident. My confidence level is very high. Once you have confidence in whatever sport you play thats all you need, that self-belief. But I think, I am in good condition. I wouldnt say that I am 100 percent fit. I am happy that I am hitting well and bowling with pace. So I know in a few more games, I will be where I want to be, he added.Speaking on KKRs loss, Russell said, Ive played a lot of T20s, and you see that a lot of times, you score 180-190, even 200, and still lose the game, he said.It was a good team effort. (But) Im not going to point fingers and say, this guy didnt bowl well or this guy didnt.

As far as 65-year-old Dhaku Panshekar can recollect, his family and neighbours have always lived out of water stored in barrels waiting outside their home. These barrels are brimmed every morning with water supplied through tankers by mining companies operating in the village.Each family must ensure the barrels suffice till the tanker arrives again the next day. At times, the water is muddy but that is our best bet. We cannot complain, says Panshekar.There is a water pipeline laid through the village. All we get is a monthly water bill and cannot recollect two consecutive days when water has flowed through our taps. For the last 15 days we havent received tap water. The excuse this time is that the pump has broken down, he adds.Its not just in Panshem, where Panshekar hails from, that the families have to depend on tankers. The situation remains the same across the eight wards and for 3,500 inhabitants of Pissurlem.Its been like this for years but now they have reason to fear the worst.As Supreme Court directives have brought mining activities to a halt in Goa, mining companies have agreed to continue the water tanker supply till May 30. Come June, the decades-long water supply pattern will come to an end for the first time, leaving Pissurlem villagers with little hope but to pray to the rain gods for mercy.Similarly, in 2012 when mining activities had stopped, the companies had continued supplying water. They should not stop now, says Kamal Gaude of Shignem ward of Pissurlem.Open cast mining, decades of siltation, and less labourous job opportunities in the mines have left the streams dry, and agricultural land fallow. The last few fields in the village are only sown when the monsoon provides irrigation. As for the few remaining kulghars or plantations that require year-round water supply, a well is dug inside each of the plantations. But digging a well is a gamble in Pissurlemtheres no guarantee of hitting water.We used to once grow kulit, moong, urad, nachni in the village. Now, few fields only grow paddy. If you give the youngsters in the village a plough now, they wouldnt know what to do with it, says Tulshi Shignekar , a farm labourer."

It is noteworthy that collectors verification was fifth probe in the same case. The Markfedthe agency responsible for procurement had refrained from sharing the earlier probe reports under right to information Act citing that an order by state information commissioner to bring Markfed under the ambit of RTI Act is pending with the high court.Earlier TOI had reported that more pulse was procured than it was produced in Tendukheda area of Narsinghpur district. In reply to a question during the winter session of MP Assembly, agriculture minister Gauri Shankar Bisen had said on December 4 that, In case of 116 people who sold 4493.36 quintals of moong and 189 people who had sold 6233.23 quintals of tuar, it could not be verified whether they are farmers. This approximately 10,500 quintals of moong and tuar is worth Rs 7 crore.The state government doesnt procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the frayed tempers of farmers who staged violent protests across state in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. However, this quantity was far more than the total average yield of pulses that were sown in the tehsil. Subsequently, a probe was ordered into the case. A total of four probe committees have probed the issue and the fifth was constituted at local administration level, which found the farmers to be real.Managing director of Markfed, Dhyaneshwar B Patil told TOI, We had informed in the assembly that 300 farmers are yet to be verified but the committee led by collector found each of these as farmers. Data of each farmer was sent to us and thus the payment was made. The committee did not found the sellers guilty but had found the role of some societies dubious and further action was initiated against those societies."

5b1500f89855b76a5f19f3ff,In dialogue with Ranjit Kapoor,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-dialogue-with-ranjit-kapoor/article23579450.ece,2018-04-18,"I write silences as well, exults Ranjit Kapoor in the middle of our free-wheeling conversation. A man of many parts, the eminent theatre personality, who wrote dialogues of some of the path breaking Hindi films rewinds to the time when he was collaborating with Kundan Shah on Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro. Kundan was good at comedy but his writing lacked the emotional depth. I told him as some films need comic relief, this film demands serious relief. Otherwise, it is in danger of being reduced to a sitcom. Oscar Wilde had rightly said that without pathos there cant be any comedy. And Kapoor came up with the idea of Hum Honge Kamyab. It reflected the characters naivety, made them vulnerable and endearing to the audience.A proponent of less is more, Kapoors first break was as a writer-composer for Ashok Ahujas Aadharshila . I told him explicitly that there are big portions in the screenplay that dont demand any background music but that doesnt mean you wont give me credit as composer because it is my call, laughs Kapoor as we settle for a leisurely conversation at The One restaurant in Le Meridien. Somebody who lives to eat, here he wants to keep it simple because of the weather. He insists on chilled lime soda and we bring fish fingers to the table to make a perfect frame.In Delhi for the ongoing META festival where he is part of the jury, the Sangeet Natak Akademi winner says he is not too pleased with the fare on offer at the just concluded 8th Theatre Olympics. The feedback of Theatre Olympics has been disappointing. I feel the plays that were on show didnt reflect whats going on in the country. Recently, he was called for a discussion in Jaipur where he was asked what did audience want. I said in the current environment you dont need to ask the audience. Kapoor says its not too different from the volatile times when he wrote Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro in the early 80s. And thats why I have written the sequel. I had major differences with Kundan on how we should take it forward. Now that he is no more, I have taken upon myself to direct it. Kapoor informs the story will begin in jail where Vinod (Naseeruddin Shah) has been languishing for 34 years. I have yet to break the news to Naseer.Sometimes, he adds, the fear of political dispensation is uncalled for. My political satire Jai Ho Democracy (2015) has been screened on different channels of Doordarshan four times.Romance and simplicityKapoor feels romance and simplicity is going out of creative space. I have always attempted to present complex thoughts in a simple language. When I presented Manohar Shyam Joshis Kuru Kuru Swaha, his wife came up to me and said that this was the first time that she understood what Joshi ji wrote. It was a big compliment. When I stage a play, I dont distribute directors interpretation among the audience or the critics. I had had differences with Raj Kumar Santoshi when he made the climax of Lajja verbose.Talking of romance, one cant forget his writing in Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa. Kapoor remembers how he pushed Kundan Shah to bring veteran lyricist Majrooh Sultanpuri on board for lyrics. Kundan found him too old and I had to make him listen to his songs from Ek Ladki Bheegi Bhagi Si to Papa Kehte Hain for one whole night . Majrooh was not easy to deal with either. He asked Kundan to recite his favourite Majrooh song before narration. Kundan froze for a moment and then came up with Kuchh Din Pahale Ek Taal Men Kamalakunj Ke Andar Rahata Tha, Ek Hans Ka Joda ( Lajwanti ). Finally, Majrooh sahib smiled and see what he gave us. Four of Kabhi Haan Kabhi Naa songs became chartbusters and Ai Kash Ke Hum Hosh Main Aane Na Payein continues to be fresh.As Kapoor was invited to the soirees at Kaifi Azmis house, he had an understanding of Majrooh sahibs mercurial nature. Every original artist is difficult to deal with, he chuckles as he himself belongs to the same category. Once during Hum To Mohabbat Karega, Kundan called me from the recording studio as Majrooh sahib was not ready to accept changes, in a song, suggested by composer Anu Malik. When I enquired, he said that he had used dil at two places while Anu wanted to make it four. He said if that was required he would have done it himself. Ultimately, it was recorded the way he wanted it to be.In sync with diverse charactersFrom Kabhi Haan Kabhi Na to Bandit Queen, Kapoor has written dialogues for a diverse range of characters. It was possible because I spent a lot of time travelling with my fathers Parsi theatre company. People from different regions worked in the company and I observed them closely. A big reason for the success of Bandit Queen was its authentic Bundelkhandi dialect. I spent months with erstwhile dacoit Madho Singh and once called Phoolan Devis brother Shiv Narayan to a Gwalior hotel for tea. I asked him and his friends to converse in front of me for two hours. We paid them for this exercise.The film also introduced cuss words in dialogues. It was required to maintain originality. However, some of the actors got carried away and added to what I had originally written. Shekhar (Kapur) should have stopped them, says Kapoor, who doesnt like to go to the film sets. Being a graduate in direction from National School of Drama, I consider myself a director. It is the film industry that turned me into a writer. The film inspired many among the current crop of filmmakers. They are using it for effect now. When a cuss word makes it to the film poster, it reflects your limitation as a writer, he argues.A teacher of Urdu, his mothers love for languages also helped in shaping Kapoors writing. She was born in Midnapur and after the death of her parents lived in a Muslim family where she learnt Urdu and a bit of Persian. As she was shifted to a Nagpur convent, she was fluent in Marathi as well. Later she learnt Bundelkhandi and Rajasthani while travelling with my father. When we were in Bhopal, she tried to learn Russian. One day while I was shooting for Chintuji , I found my mother talking to my Keralite DOP in Malayali. At 60, I discovered that my mother knew a bit of Malayali as well.In love with mutton dishes, especially qorma and rogan josh that his mother used to prepare, Kapoor is a foodie who loves to go beyond the brand names in search of authentic food in a city. My mother passed on the recipes to my sister who is secretive about them. While I was growing up, my mother used to leave a bit of dough for me to make a chapatti. Later, I realised that it was her way of making me self-sufficient. Be it theatre or cooking, Kapoor says it is all about the hunger you have. Once, I crossed a river in spate with my father and some crew members. And when we reached a small village, the cook tried to prepare moong ki dal over stove. My father was so hungry that he declared the dal without tadka as the best he had in his life. I found it odd but on another occasion when we had semi-cooked khichdi, I realised hunger creates a taste of its own. We kept on saying that it needs more water but before the cook could arrive at the right proportion, we had polished it off.By this time, the delicious conversation makes us hungry as well. So we conclude with a big bite of kulfi.When a cuss word makes it to the film poster, it reflects your limitation as a writer"

While the Tamil Nadu government announced to procure pulses through direct procurement centres (DPCs), farmers are sceptical whether to sell their produce in the open market or to stock them as the government is yet to announce minimum support price (MSP) for the process. Farmers demanded the state government to announce MSP for black gram and wanted it to be fixed at Rs 100 per kg.According to officials from the agriculture department, the area of cultivation of black gram this year is about 9.88 lakh acres and the production is expected to be 2.76 lakh tonne. In Trichy, farmers have cultivated black gram in about 11,300 acres of land, officials said. Harvest is at the peak in Trichy and has just commenced in Thanjavur Two years back, farmers sold a bag of a black gram for Rs 12,000 to Rs 15,000. However, for the last two years they could hardly sell it for Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500, they said.During budget, government announced that it would start procuring cereals like black gram, green gram and dal. However, the state is yet to commence the process, said Ayilai Sivasuriyan, district secretary of Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal Sangam affiliated to CPI.Already the entire farming community lost kuruvai and some of them cultivated samba with the help of available groundwater. They were very hopeful that they would get a good yield in black gram. However, due to severe drought and scarcity of water, that too could not be realised. So, the government should at least help them by immediately commencing the process of procurement, he said.Puliyur A Nagarajan, state organiser of the farmers wing of Tamil Manila Congress, said that very few farmers went for black gram cultivation in Trichy this year. However, farmers could not harvest their produce due to scarcity of water. Around 60% of the crop alone could be reaped in Trichy, he said.As announced by the deputy chief minister and finance minister O Panneerselvam in the assembly during the budget session, the government should start the process of procurement of cereals. Before that minimum support price should be announced and that should be Rs 100 per kg to benefit farmers, he added.Not willing to sell their produce at a loss, many farmers in Thanjavur and Tiruvarur districts have switched over to cotton while others have restricted themselves to minimum acres of land for cultivating black gram."

This was announced by Commissioner-cum-Secretary of Agriculture Department S Garg after a review meeting here on Wednesday.The Secretary also reviewed various farming activities including procurement of pulses and oil seeds like black gram, green gram and groundnut in the district. He also asked the district level agriculture officials to create awareness on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for oil seeds and pulses.As per reports, groundnut has been grown over 14,000 hectares (ha) in eight blocks of the district, while other oil seeds have been cultivated in 51,280 ha.The district agriculture wing has decided to open atleast 21 mandis to procure the cash crops from farmers. Though harvesting of the crops has already started, the procurement will begin from May 25, said District Agriculture Officer Gunanidhi Behera.Meanwhile, farmers have urged the Agriculture department to announce the MSP for oil seeds separately as soon as possible. However, sources said the agriculture department has fixed MSP at `5,575 per quintal for green gram, `5,400 for black gram and `4,450 for groundnut. But groundnut is being sold at `4500 -`5000 in market."

The average expenditure on food consumption per person per month in the State is Rs. 2,156.Although the objective of the study was to assess district-wise consumption of various food items in Telangana and to estimate the expenditure made in the State on food items, the findings of the study are expected to be used by the State government as a comprehensive database for planning crop colonies to match the production of various food items with the demand, broadly based on the consumption patterns recorded as part of the study, a senior official of the Agriculture Department working on the concept of crop colonies said.When asked about the study, PJTSAU Vice-Chancellor V. Praveen Rao told The Hindu that data collection was done by surveying about 6,200 households in the State, including 3,930 of them in rural areas.Different teams of students collected data from 392 villages and 228 urban areas (wards) by following the standard sampling procedure.According to the findings of the study, the average monthly per capita consumption (MPCC) of cereals is 12.6 kg, ranging from 10.53 kg in Mancherial to 17.5 kg in Yadadri-Bhuvanagiri. With rice comprising 77% of the total cereal consumption, the study revealed a huge variation in the consumption of cereals in rural and urban areas with 14.1 kg and 11.46 kg respectively.Similarly, the consumption of pulses in the State is found to be 1.74 kg with Adilabad topping the chart with 2.69 kg, while Suryapet being at the bottom with 1.3 kg.Among the pulses consumed, processed red gram accounts for 41% followed by green gram and black gram with 18% each.The average consumption of spices, mainly comprising dry red chilli, tamarind and ginger, is 636 grams with Bhadradri-Kothagudem having the maximum consumption at 920 grams and minimum of 440 grams in Medak. With 95% of households in the State found to be consuming non-vegetarian food items, the average consumption of meat, fish and egg (MFE) is 1.38 kg.The study states that the consumption of MFE is highest in Jayashankar-Bhupalapally with 1.91 kg and lowest of 1.06 kg in Vikarabad. Similarly, the State has 4.6 litres of average MPCC of milk with Sircilla at the top at 6.27 litres and Adilabad at the bottom with 2.34 litres.Data collection was done by surveying about 6,200 households in the State, including 3,930 of them in rural areas.V.

The average rainfall stood at a healthy 683.63 mm in the district in 2017 calendar year in which majority was received during the months falling under 2017-18 fiscal year. Besides, 2017-18 also saw good amount of water getting released through canal irrigation systems at appropriate periods after the catchment areas falling in Kerala experienced satisfactory monsoon spells, said Joint Director of Agriculture Mohamed Iqbal.The farmers willingness to adopt innovative cultivation technologies accepting the suggestion of agriculture department officials too said to have contributed to expansion in acreage.Crop-wise dataA crop-wise analysis of 2017-18 acreage performance shows that paddy cultivation had gone up to 7,598 ha from a worryingly low 1,765 ha in 2016-17 fiscal year.PulsesSimilarly, area under each of the pulses varieties like black gram, green gram, cow pea, Bengal gram and horse gram had grown, which according to the agriculture department officials, was an encouraging sign to ensure food security."

""I prefer to meet my clients over breakfast so that once I get to office, I can work uninterrupted,"" he says, adding that stepping out for a lunch meeting disrupts the workflow.Breakfast like a king, lunch like a prince and dine like a pauper. Thats what the wise ones said and the worlds just waking up to smell the coffee, as people realise the importance of eating a healthy breakfast. The benefits are numerous  from fuelling your mind and body for a more productive day to being able to battle the bulge.""Power breakfasts are popular as you are more focused in the morning,"" says Vikram Cotah, COO, GRT Hotels and Resorts. But its not just business deals that are struck over breakfast as hotels often set the stage for meetings of a different kind. ""We see a lot of matchmaking. The prospective groom and brides families book a large table while the couple is given a table for two a little distance away,"" says Cotah.At Writers Caf, in Gopalapuram, youngsters looking to spend time before college, older couples strolling by and people with appointments in the locality are their clientele. ""We offer all-day breakfast, and begin serving by 9:15am,"" says Sharadha Dharmaraj, business development manager. ""We get quite a few people from the nearby hospitals, who are waiting to get their tests done or for results to arrive,"" she adds.The ones who cannot step out, opt to order in. ""We have diabetic-friendly food thats also diet- friendly. For instance, we have idlis made of kattuyanam rice, a traditional variety that is suitable for diabetics,"" says Kripa Devi Dharmraj of Lunchbox, adding that they also home deliver millet pongal and green gram dosas. ""We get 200-odd orders and also have a new outlet in Ramanujan IT park for employees on the early shift,"" she adds.School managements, worried that children are coming without breakfast or just a glass of milk, are also roping in their services. ""We provide nutritious food, such as beetroot parathas, "" says Kripa, adding that they have a tie-up with one school and are in talks with three others. ""Working mothers dont have the time to cook elaborate breakfasts so the demand is only going to increase,"" she says.As dietitian Meenakshi Bajaj says, the quality, quantity and timing of the breakfast (around 35% of your total energy needs), improves the day dramatically. ""Eating breakfast improves memory and has a positive impact on behaviour,"" she says. While a healthy breakfast reduces hunger throughout the day, skipping it makes you eat more during other meals, often making wrong food choices. ""It has an impact on your waistline, contributing to metabolic complications, such as abdominal obesity, insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease,"" adds Bajaj.Thats one of the reasons why, according to a Business Insights on Dining Industry 2017 study by American Express, the proportion of total breakfast spending rose in India by 56% in 2016 over 2015. A TOI report says that in Bengaluru, millennials bound for work, joggers and gym-goers are keeping restaurants busy in the mornings. And the situation is not very different in Chennai. ""We have always had a steady stream of people for breakfast since we opened nine years ago,"" says restaurateur Sandesh Reddy of Sandys, which opens for breakfast at 8am. ""I think a lot of it has to do with convenience and the willingness to use breakfast as a way to catch up, which was earlier reserved for lunch or dinner.""With changing palates, Chennaiites are also breaking their fast with not just dosas or idlis but waffles and baked beans. Breakfast buffets also offer more variety without punching a hole in your wallet. ""At our hotels, the spread consists of different cuisines  south Indian, oriental and continental,"" says Cotah. ""We also serve cold pressed juices, low gluten bread, organic micro greens, and salads.""Or, better still, jump start your day with a hearty fare of waffles, pancakes, sausages and eggs  any way you wish."

The dearth of certified seeds comes at a time when the country is looking for an overall increase in soybean acreage.Just before the start of the kharif sowing, concerns are being raised over the availability of certified soybean seeds. With only 30-35 per cent of the available seeds being of the certified nature, farmers and industry experts feel this will have an impact on the productivity of the crop this season.Seeds that grow under the supervision of certification agencies pass through stringent quality tests and are sold in the market as certified seeds. Meanwhile, quality of the seeds that are sold as truthful is only assured by the producer. Farmers, understandably, prefer certified seeds.The dearth of certified seeds comes at a time when the country, at large, is looking for an overall increase in soybean acreage. It is expected that area under the oilseed will increase 10-15 per cent in the kharif season from last years 101.561 lakh hectares. Industry sources said better prices for soybean since October and the pink bollworm attack in cotton crop could be attributed to Maharashtra farmers diverting towards the oilseed. Similarly, growers of urad, moong and maize are expected to go for soybean, too, given the lesser remunerations fetched by other crops. It is estimated that around 10-12 lakh tonnes of soybean is available for sowing purposes.However, only 30-35 per cent of the available seeds are certified. Manoj Agarwal, director of the Maharashtra Oil Extractors Private Limited, said most of the seed companies have shied away from production given the dismal prices fetched by the crop over the last two years. Majority of the seed producers, industry sources said, were located in Madhya Pradesh with hardly any multinational companies (MNC)s in the play.A senior industry official said government policies were affecting the local players. With a paucity of certified seeds, Agarwal said its impact on productivity could be evident in the coming season. Dr M S Gholap, director (inputs) of the Agriculture Department, said Maharashtra would require about 10-12 lakh quintals of soybean seeds. We have ample seed available, he said.Asked about the availability of certified seeds, he said they have sent out instructions for farmers to buy seeds only from notified companies. Around 40-50 per cent of the seeds are produced by either the Maharashtra State Seed Corporation Limited (Mahabeej) or the National Seed Corporation Limited, remaining is cornered by private markets, he added. Truthful seeds are easily traceable and companies can face prosecution in case of seed failure.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5b14cfcd9855b75db2e6f03f,Mango crop affected in Gujarat due to unfavourable weather: Parshottam Rupala,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/mango-crop-affected-in-gujarat-due-to-unfavourable-weather-parshottam-rupala-5165204/,2018-05-06,"Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Parshottam Rupala Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Parshottam RupalaExtreme weather conditions have halved the mango yield in its home districts of Junagadh and Gir-Somnath, according to findings of a survey by the Gujarat government. Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Parshottam Rupala, while speaking at the Farm to Fashion: Indian textile global summit 2018 in Ahmedabad, said that the mango crop in the state had been affected severely by unfavourable weather conditions this season and that the government was assessing potential crop losses.Due to the extreme heat, mango trees have been damaged. There is a very big loss to the mango crop this year. We have got details from some of the farmers. We are doing a survey of it, Rupala said at the three-day event that began Friday in Ahmedabad. His comments have come around two weeks after a survey conducted by the Gujarat government concluded that mango orchards in Saurashtra were likely to produce only 40 to 45 per cent of fruits of the long-term average this year.Gujarat Agriculture Minister Ranchhod Faldu had visited Junagadh on April 5 and he instructed us to conduct a survey to assess the loss of crops, stating that farmers had made representations in this respect. With the help of scientists from Junagadh Agricultural University, we conducted sample survey in Junagadh and Gir Somnath districts. At the end of the survey, we concluded that the crop is 50 to 55 per cent less of the average in Junagadh district and 55 to 60 per cent less in Gir Somnath district, an officer of state horticulture department told The Indian Express on the condition of anonymity.The report was submitted to the state government last month and sources said it was being considered at higher level. Junagadh and Gir Somnath in Saurashtra region are known for the Kesar variety of mango. Farmers have grown mango orchards in more than 8,500 hectare in Junagadh and around 15,500 hectare in Gir Somnath. Overall, Gujarat is the fifth largest producer of mango in the country after Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana. While farmers in Junagadh, Gir Somnath, Amreli, Bhavnagar and Kutch grow aromatic Kesar variety, their counterparts in Valsad, Navsari and Surat districts in south Gujarat mainly grow Alphonso variety. But this horticulture crop is highly weather-sensitive and sudden changes in weather affect the crop adversely.The news comes just a day after the Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Talala, one of the biggest wholesale markets of mango in the state, started auctioning the juicy fruit, marking the formal beginning of the mango season. The APMC, located in Gir Somnath district, recorded the arrival of 14,100 boxes, each containing 10 kg of mangoes, on the inaugural day on Thursday and the average price was around Rs 340 (for a 10-kg box) or around Rs1,700 per quintal. On Friday, the arrivals dropped to 8,350 boxes but the average price remained stable at around Rs 340. The highest price on Friday was Rs 650 and the lowest was Rs 210 for a 10-kg box, officers of the APMC said.Farmers say the crop is poor this year due to unfavourable weather. Skies remained overcast for three consecutive days in the first week of December under the influence of cyclone Ockhi. This affected the crop badly. In those days, mango trees in my orchards had started bearing fruits. But due to sudden change in the weather, the trees shed magdis (mango fruits of the size of green gram). Then again in January, the mercury soared unusually and led to khakhdis (immature mango fruits of the size of areca nut) falling down, Bharat Dobariya, a mango grower in Madhupur village in Talala taluka of Gir Somnath district, said. Dobariya has mango orchards in seven hectares out of his total land holding of nine hectares.Horticulture officers concur with the Dobariya. There was heavy rain in Talala and surrounding areas in October and therefore, flowering on mango trees started late. Then, due to cyclone Ockhi, flowering was affected. At the fruit-bearing stage in early January, there was huge variation in daytime temperature and night temperature. Consequently, trees shed immature fruits. Therefore, the overall production is likely to remain only around 45 per cent of the long-term average, said a horticulture officer in Junagadh.Dobariya said that he was expecting his mango production to remain around 300 quintals against 760 quintals last season. The government does not cover our horticulture crop under any crop insurance scheme. Nor does it declare Minimum Support Price for mangoes. So, we are completely at the mercy of market forces even in bad crop years, added the 36-year-old farmer.Incidentally, the state government had conducted a similar survey in Junagadh and Gir Somnath last year also after farmers complained of their trees bearing less number of fruit. The survey had concluded that the crop had seen an average of 25 to 30 per cent loss. But the mango growers had not received any compensation from the government.Farmers say good prices can salvage the season for them. I have started harvesting mangoes and a box of 10 kg is fetching around Rs 600 these days. This price is better as compared to corresponding period last season, added Dobariya.Junagadh and Gir Somnath together produce around 20 lakh quintals of mangoes every year. However, yields have remained stagnant at around 85 to 95 quintals per hectare. But prices have remained firm over the last few years as significant quantity of the total production is exported mainly to Europe and West Asia. The state had exported 5.32 lakh quintals of mangoes worth Rs 445 crore last year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The notification on extending the ban was issued a couple of days ago.Earlier, the ban was applicable only to unprocessed pulses, like tur whole or moong, chana and peas. The pulses are later processed into edible form, which is known as tur dal or chana dal. Now, the ban has been imposed on processed pulses like tur dal or chana dal also, which will help improve the market rates, said Pratap Motwani , secretary of the association.The move will help hike the rates, which will ultimately help farmers. At present, rates of all pulses were reigning below the minimum support price (MSP). Tur whole (unprocessed form) is being sold at Rs4,150 to 4,250 a quintal as against a MSP of Rs5,400 per quintal. Chana is fetching Rs3,600 a quintal and the MSP stands at Rs4,400, said Motwani.The rates have firmed up by around Rs200 in all the pulses after the order. The government needs to ban futures trading in chana to further help firm up the rates, he said."
5b1b2e629855b76d57037ead,Konkani cinema is feeling the Iffi effect,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/konkani-cinema-is-feeling-the-iffi-effect/articleshow/64130367.cms,2018-05-12,"Back in 2004, there was much controversy when the ministry of information and broadcasting partnered with the government of Goa to relocate the International Film Festival of India ( Iffi ) to the heritage waterfront of Panaji, with a view to permanently anchor the prestigious event in that location. Other cities and states complained, with echoes that still reverberate every year. Many locals also objected that the host was being made to pay for much of the event, but was still given almost no decision-making responsibility for what counts. But the cut that hurt the most came from a daughter-in-law of Goa. The celebrated writer, researcher, casting director and advisor to many film festivals, Uma da Cunha, opposed the move on the grounds that Goa has no cinema culture.Those words stung for a long time, even as many pointed out that neither the seaside playground of Cannes on the French Riviera, or the gritty port city of Busan in South Korea, was known for cinema culture before both developed hugely significant film festivals. It is not that the natives of Goa felt in the least insecure about exposure, or ever yield to anyone in matters of taste and sophistication. Theres also immense pride about the string of exemplars who nourished Hindi films, like the Goan jazzmen who created the Sound of Bollywood (in the words of cultural historian Naresh Fernandes), and the immortal playback singing sisters, Lata Mangeshkar and Asha Bhonsle. But there was, in fact, a lacuna to be acknowledged. Back in 2004, Konkani cinema barely existed at all.Speed up nearly two decades into the 21st century, and those anxieties have been considerably allayed. In the last five years alone, several important Konkani movies have played around the world to win all kinds of awards. Last week, the Goa State Film Festival (GSFF) underlined that success. The top award of best film went to Nilesh Karamunges Mahaprayan (The Last Journey), a technical tour-de-force shot in a single take, tracking a bereaved man and his daughter as they carry the corpse of his wife (and her mother) all the way back to their village, because they cannot afford transport. Nne-year-old Aarya Ghare won best actress for her unforgettable performance.GSFF jury member and long-time South Asia consultant to the Berlin Film Festival, Meenakshi Shedde, says, Konkani cinema grapples with a small state population of 1.4 million, and limited screens per city, and is one of the youngest film industries in India. [But here] the Konkani film industry can emulate the Hong Kong film industry, which has similar challenges: So, it has always drawn stars from many Asian and Western nations, so the films appeal to those markets as well. She pointed to other recent award-winners, Juze has French funding; it was at the Karlovy Vary and Hong Kong film festivals. K Sera Sera also imported talent from outside Goa.Shedde says, The consistent exposure to world class cinema during Iffi since 2004 has kick-started the Konkani film industry. This is a constant refrain amongst the burgeoning crop of young filmmakers and cineastes of the state, that now legitimately and undeniably features a serious appetite for great world cinema, which is most easily apparent at the excellent Thursday screenings for the Cinephiles Film Club organised at Maquinez Palace in Panaji.The seeds first planted at Iffi in 2004 are only starting to bear fruit. As one of Goas brightest young filmmakers, Suyash Naik, writes about his Iffi education that started his very first year at the festival when he binge-watched 42 films, They changed my life. I couldnt be same any more.The writer is a photographer and widely published columnist. Views expressed are personal."

It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."

They allege that permitting a sand quarry at the proposed site would wipe out the fragile groundwater potential in the entire region that boasts of fields where varied crops are being raised even when there is nil flow down the river.The stretch between Grand Anicut and Tiruvaiyaru is remarkably lush with crops such as paddy, banana, vegetables, coconut, turmeric, onion, yam, black gram, green gram and betel vine being grown on thousands of acres. Though Rivers Cauvery, Coleroon and Kudamurutti irrigate the stretch, in the absence of adequate water flow down River Cauvery and its branches for the past six years the region which falls under the old aycut of the Cauvery delta in Thanjavur district depends mostly on sub-surface water.Water is available at depths of 30 feet in our region due to its proximity to Rivers Cauvery and Coleroon not to speak of Kudamurutti. However, that benefit turns into a bane with clay and rocky bottom hindering water availability beneath 30 feet. That water table too is sustained solely by the rivers that act as aquifers to balance the irrigation requirements of our region. Knowing full well our complete reliance on groundwater to irrigate our food and cash crops, the PWD has planned a sand quarry at Bhavanamangalam. A sand quarry, that would cart away all our water bank resources, will spell doom for us farmers and that is why we are vehemently opposing the quarry here, explains T. Balaganesan of Bhavanamangalam, a farmer who has moved the Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court seeking a ban on the planned sand quarry.People from nearby villages such as Koothur, Vittalapuram, Ammayagaram, Vanarangudi, Ombathuveli, Nadupadugai, Chellappanpettai, Pillayarnatham, Vishnampettai and Tirukattupalli are opposing the sand quarry at Bhavanamangalam.River Cauvery at Bhavanamangalam, is a pale comparison of its majestic self at say Musiri where it is more than 1,200 metres wide, with just about 400 metres width. It is a moot question whether there would be the expected quantum of sand in the planned spot.The place where the sand quarry has been proposed is too close to be of safety to a structure supporting pipeline which is part of the combined water supply scheme conveying water to Pudukkottai district and having its source in the Coleroon off Vishnampettai.In fact, the footing foundations of the pillars supporting the bridge structure on which the pipelines are located remain dangerously exposed on the Cauvery river bed.PWD sources concede that this is the first quarry on River Cauvery in this region below Grand Anicut. Sand quarrying plan at the particular spot is obviously ill conceived and the PWD would do well scrap that, in its own interest and in the welfare of the regions people."

Despite losing a couple of early wickets, RCB went on to score a humungous 218/6 in 20 overs. AB de Villiers (69) and Moeen Ali (65) put up a century stand to help the scoreboard surge past 200. Reflecting on his knock and the teams effort with the willow, Moeen Ali said, Definitely going to take that total and back ourselves to defend it. Do or die situation for us, so happy that everyone managed to get a few runs. The best way to play for our team is to play freely and not think too much about anything else. One of lifes great pleasures is to bat with AB, and it was amazing to share a partnership with him.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

(Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh/Representational Image) The scheme is an attempt to open another avenue for the farmer as well as firm up prices in open markets. (Express Photo by Gurmeet Singh/Representational Image)More than 2 lakh farmers in Maharashtra have been left in the lurch as the deadline for the procurement of tur  at the procurement centres run under the guidance of NAFED in the state  ended on May 15. This is the second time the state has failed to meet the deadline and procure 4.47 lakh tonnes (lt)  its target for procurement under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). The state government is hopeful that the Centre will give it another extension to tide over the crisis. But because of its failure to intervene successfully in the agricultural market, many farmers are now stuck with their produce.Whats the procurement scheme?Run by the Union Ministry of Food and Civil Supplies, PSS is a form of market intervention by the central government, to stabilise prices of commodities in wholesale markets. The scheme is activated when prices of agricultural produce such as tur, moong and chana fall below the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP).Under the scheme, the state governments, with the help of NAFED, set up procurement centres where farmers can sell their produce at MSP. The scheme is an attempt to open another avenue for the farmer as well as firm up prices in open markets. Usually, about 30 per cent of the produce is targeted for procurement. This season, the scheme was implemented in the state by the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation and the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation via nearly 180 centres.What are the roadblocks in the process?As per the original schedule, the scheme was going to come to an end on April 18, but as the state faltered in the procurement process, the deadline was extended to May 15. Even with a revised deadline, the state could procure only 3.1 lt of the produce from 2 lakh farmers, leaving over 2 lakh more, who had registered for procurement, in the lurch. This year, state governments in Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh have also started tur procurement under PSS. While the process is underway in Gujarat, it has been completed in the rest of the states. Except Karnataka, most other states have managed to procure greater quantities of tur, reveals data from NAFED.Why does Maharashtra lag behind other states?Officials of both marketing federations and the Directorate of Marketing admit that the state had failed to meet its target due to lack of storage space. As per NAFED guidelines, the produce procured under the PSS programme can be stored only at the godowns of the Central Warehouse Corporation or State Warehouse Corporations. This year, most godowns are still stocked with the tur procured last season.Last year, Maharashtra had seen bumper production of tur, with prices crashing well below the MSP. To help out the farmers and preventing prices from falling further, the state government had purchased a record amount of over 7.7 lt of tur. Most of the procured tur has remained in the godowns as the process of disposal has been slow.It is estimated that while the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation has disposed of some of the tur, about 2.1 lt procured last year remain in the godowns. As tur is a food grain, only godowns that are rain-proof, rodent-proof and have fumigation facilities can be used for storage. The marketing federations, therefore, have a lot of grain that is not being disposed of in time. With monsoons round the corner, authorities are worried about how to keep the stored tur fresh.Officials of NAFED said states that have a better network of godowns as well as better supply chain management for foodgrains perform better in terms of meeting their procurement targets. A similar fate seems to await the procurement process for chana, as the state has procured only 70,000 quintals of the 3 lt target given to it. With the deadline ending on May 29, chana growers might also find themselves in the lurch.How does it affect prices?Throughout the kharif season of 2017, the price of tur in the wholesale market had remained much below the MSP of Rs 5,400 per quintal. At Laturs wholesale market, the average trade price of the commodity was around Rs 4,200-4,500 per quintal, leading to an effective loss of over Rs 1,000 per quintal. It is estimated that the cumulative loss for farmers this season was over Rs 1,060 crore.Farmers are also apprehensive about the prices falling further as NAFED has pulled out of the market. It is estimated that around 3 lt of tur still remains with farmers, who now have to sell it at throwaway prices.Yogesh Thorat, managing director of the MahaFPC, a consortium of farmer producer companies (FPCs), said the state government needed to make alternative storage arrangements. We need to think out of the box and have farmgate level storage structures, which will help farmers dispose of their produce at will, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5b26a9229855b70a272af880,Scent of a lemon,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/scent-of-a-lemon-231659?ref=india-new-stry,2018-05-20,"Paromita SenEXSQUEEZE MOI: The gondhoraj is not full of juice like the acid lime, nor as easy to come by as the kagzi. Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."

Cotton production fell by a steep 39% mainly due to pest attack by the pink bollworm, which devastated the crop across regions.One crop to thrive was the water-guzzling sugarcane, which saw a rise of 34% over the previous year and has contributed to a bumper nationwide production. Kharif is the main agricultural season in Maharashtra , in which three-quarters of farming is done. The states monsoon was 84% of normal last year, but in July 2017 dipped to 72% and in August to 77% of normal. But compared to five-year averages, production of kharif food grains and pulses saw a slight increase of 9% in 2017-18.Crop credit dips 40%, pushing farmers towards loan sharksThe decline in the production of food grains compared to 2016-17 was mainly because of a dry spell and uneven rainfall, additional chief secretary (agriculture) Bijay Kumar has said.In addition, the output of rice was affected by an attack of sucking pests and cotton was impacted by the pink bollworm pest, he said. Farm activists point out that its not just crop production which has declined, but also the prices of farm produce.Prices for most crops are lower than they were last year and farmers are facing larger debts. Crop loans from banks have declined by 40%, so, farmers have had no option but to turn to moneylenders, said activist Vijay Jawandhia . The production of kharif cereals declined by 4% compared to the previous year and oilseeds by 15%, estimates from the state agriculture department show.The production of rice declined by as much as 22% over the previous year. In 2016-17, the state saw a bumper production of tur dal, pushing up pulse production figures.In 2017-18, tur production in the kharif season declined by 49% and moong production by 37% compared to the previous year. Within kharif oilseeds, soya bean production dipped by 15% and groundnut by 11%. Sesamum (sesame is the best-known member of the genus) declined by 48%.In the rabi season (winter crop), cereal production saw a 30% decline in 2017-18 compared to the previous year, while the production of pulses dropped by 10%, estimates show. The state has seen a dramatic rise in sugarcane production, reaching a historic record of over 107 lakh tons.Nationally too, the country has seen a major rise in sugar production. But this has depressed prices and led to sugar mills not being able to clear farmers dues."

Seeds of the Goa Dhan varieties of paddy and wilt-resistant brinjal will be distributed among farmers this monsoon besides the annual drill of giving out vegetable and pulses seeds.In April last year, TOI had reported about the salt-tolerant rice varieties Goa Dhan I and Goa Dhan II developed by the ICAR-Central Coastal Agricultural Research Institute (CCARI), Old Goa. The institute also came up with a new variety of brinjal  262-4 brinjal  that has been scientifically developed to grow without being susceptible to bacterial wilt.We are preparing to try out the new paddy varieties which have been approved by the ICAR-CCARI, Old Goa. The agriculture sub-officers will initiate these varieties. We will be trying out the wilt-resistant 262-4 brinjal once the ICAR-CCARI releases it, said agriculture director Nelson Figueiredo The agriculture department will also be giving out 300 to 350 tonnes of paddy seeds to farmers for the kharif season. Roughly, 1.7 lakh tonnes of paddy are harvested in Goa per year. Vegetable seeds have already been ordered by the department as well.About one tonne of each seed of monsoon vegetables such as lady finger, cucumber, rich gourd, bottle gourd and radish will be distributed among farmers. Six tonnes of groundnut seeds and a tonne of chilli seeds will also be given to them. Pulses of various kinds have also been ordered; half a tonne of the same will be disbursed.In addition to the new paddy and brinjal varieties, the department is also looking at experimenting with a new moong variant. Though the regular moong varieties grow well in Goan soil and climate, we want bolder seeds that have greater marketability and a bigger grain size, Figueiredo said adding that the pulse may see a path for germination in the next season."

Bhatt passed away at his residence on Wednesday morning. In accordance with his last wish, his body was donated for medical research, his family members said. Dignitaries including Gujarat chief minister Vijay Rupani offered condolences and large group of literati reached his residence in Kankaria to pay homage.Mona Bhatt, Bhatts daughter, said that he had been unwell since December 2017 with kidney-related problems. The demise of my mother Nalini on January 29 this year left him in deep grief and shock, she said. Ever since her death, papa had gone into seclusion. Over the past few weeks, he had refused to eat and to take phone calls.Bhatt was born in 1938 at Nandol village near Dehgam in Gandhinagar district. He worked as a tax consultant while continuing his passion for writing. He was the president of the Gujarati Sahitya Parishad from 1996 to 1997. He had authored over 45 books that cover humour, satire, biography, and literary criticism. He also compiled works of fellow Gujarati writers. Bhatt also wrote in Hindi. Some of his best known works include Idam Tritiyam, Naro Va Kunjro Va, Vinod ni Najare, Shreshth Hasyarachanao. Bhatt was the recipient of Kumar Chandrak in 1976, Ranjitram Suvarna Chandrak in 1989, and Ramanlal Nilkanth Hasya Paritoshik and Jyotindra Dave Hasya Paritoshik in 2016.Rupani expressed his grief over Bhatts demise saying that Bhatt will be remembered for his satire-laced writings. His death has left a vacuum in the Gujarati literary world, he said. Sitanshu Yashaschandra, the president of the parishad, said that the literary academy was deeply saddened by Bhatts demise. He said that the academy would organize a meeting in his remembrance.Bhagyesh Jha , the former chairman of the Gujarat Sahitya Akademi, remembered the humourist as a close friend. I used to talk to him every morning for the past three-and-a-half years. Each morning, we sat in his verandah and had bhajiyas, said Jha. His spontaneity and humour were unparalleled. Once while in the US, I had called him to ask where I could find his book, Moongi Naar meaning silent wife. He responded by saying, You wont find a moongi naar in the entire universe or even in a book.Ratilal Borisagar, a fellow humourist, said that he had known Bhatt since 1975. His humility was something that I adored deeply. In the world of Gujarati literary humourists, his name would perhaps follow the likes of Jyotindra Dave and Bakul Tripathi, he said. This is because he never shadowed someone elses style of writing and developed his own style."

Encouraged by the popularity of athletes like badminton champions Saina Nehwal and PV Sindhu, producers and directors are pinning their hopes on biopics that depict the real life struggles and success of women athletes in India.Viacom18 Motion Pictures has acquired rights for a biopic on Mithali Raj, captain of the Indian womens ODI cricket team and one of the greatest batswomen in the game. Actor-producer Sonu Sood is gearing up to produce a film on badminton star PV Sindhu, who is the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal. Paralympic champion Deepa Maliks story will be brought to screen by Farhan Akhtar and Ritesh Sidhwanis Excel Entertainment. Sony Pictures International Productions has bought the rights for cricketer Jhulan Goswamis biopic.Amol Guptes film on badminton champion Nehwal is expected to begin shooting later this year and stars Shraddha Kapoor as Nehwal. It will make sports more popular and inspire more kids to play badminton. I am sure the kind of hard-work Shraddha is putting in, she will give 100% and it will come out well, said Nehwal.Producer Bhushan Kumar wasnt very sure about making a film on badminton, forget a female sports star. What changed his mind was Nehwals popularity. I did a mini survey of sorts in my office with youngsters, said Kumar. It came as a surprise to me that everyone was absolutely clued in about Saina and her on-court exploits. Then I was confident that a film should be made on her life.Kapoor, who has been working hard at her badminton moves, said, It is a huge responsibility on all of us to make sure we do a thorough job of presenting Saina on the big screen. It is a daunting and challenging job.In a male-dominated industry that hesitates to back films with solo female leads, biopics like the one on Nehwal are a welcome change. Theres reason to hope they will find success at the box office too. Mary Kom, starring Priyanka Chopra, was a hit in 2014 and boasts of a lifetime collection of Rs64 crore. One of the most successful Bollywood films of all time is Dangal, which may have had Aamir Khan in a key role, but was about wrestler-sisters Geeta and Babita Phogats journey. Its earnings are more than Rs380 crore.Female sports stars should be lauded and celebrated equally, said Omung Kumar, who directed Mary Kom. The great thing is that films are being made on male as well as female sporting icons. While a few will work, others wont. But ultimately, they are all inspiring stories."

How Mary Kom, Hindi cinema's first female-oriented biopic, was conceived is a story that must be told. ""Nothing worth having comes easy"" was painted on a beam on the roof of the artistically-overloaded office of Omung Kumar, director of Mary Kom. An actor by intention, an artist by natural inclination, a television show host by profession and one of the most successful art directors of the film, television and theatre industries, Omung found his ultimate calling in filmmaking a few years ago...After considering and rejecting the stories of many women, including Princess Diana, Jhansi Ki Rani and Durga, Omung was at his wits' end when Saiwyn (Quadras, writer) suggested, ""How about Mary Kom?""""I said, ' Suna toh hai (I've heard of her), but why would I want to make a film on boxing?'"" he smiled at his navet. It was Saiwyn who urged him to at least read her story and when he did, Omung was bowled over...The first step was to sign her. ""My wife, Saiwyn and I took a flight to Manipur, met Mary Kom, sat with her for fifteen minutes, and when I said, 'We want to make a film on you,' she laughed, 'Why would you want to make a film on me? Are you mad or something?' We signed her, we paid her and we had two years to make it.""We came back and started writing it. Just when the script was ready, the Olympics happened (apart from being an Olympics boxer, Mary Kom also won a bronze at the Summer Olympics). Suddenly everybody woke up to Mary Kom and started asking, who's got the film rights to her story? Many producers started showing an interest in it. At that time, I was making the sets for Shireen Farhad Ki Toh Nikal Padi for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's sister Bela. I was in his office when he asked me what I was doing and I told him I was making a film but it wasn't his kind of film. At that time, his Rowdy Rathore (a commercial potboiler with a macho hero that did extremely well) had just been released. But when he came to the lift to see me off, Sanjay asked me again, 'Tell me, what is it?' I told him that it was on Mary Kom and he said, 'Send it to me, let me read it.' I sent it and he said, 'I'll take ten days to read it.' But much after ten days, there was no word from him. Other producers were making enquiries about it, so I told Sanjay that and he said, 'How can you give it to anyone else? I'm producing it.'""... The next call to make was, who would play Mary Kom?""First, it was about building muscles which was very difficult for a female,"" Omung enumerated. ""Second, it was about learning to box. Competence in acting was a far thought at that time. To play Mary Kom, the actress had to be fit, learn boxing and build muscle. Paan Singh Tomar had to only run, Milkha had to only run. Chalo, you had to be fit and build your body to play Milkha or Paan Singh. But as Mary Kom, maar khaana hai (you have to take blows), you have to take hard punches. You have to think of a technique you've never done before.""Priyanka was on the shortlist,"" he said, ""and I told Sanjay that I wanted her for it. Priyanka was the one actress whose dedication would be unrivalled. So a meeting was fixed by Sandeep Singh (former CEO, Bhansali Productions, now Omung's partner in film production).""But there was a twist in the tale and a serious one at that. Something had happened and Priyanka and Sanjay Leela Bhansali were not on talking terms.Before Mary Kom took off, Bhansali had begun filming the large and lavish Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela (2013), a film that had originally been planned with Ranveer Singh and Kareena Kapoor in the lead. But at the last minute, Kareena had walked out of it, leaving Bhansali in a dilemma. With his set erected and a shooting schedule all planned and ready, who could he get to step in and play the lead opposite Ranveer? He had to finalise an alternate heroine double quick. He turned to Priyanka Chopra and even though she knew she was a replace-ment, she agreed to do Ram-Leela. However, just before filming started, Bhansali did an unbelievable switch and brought Deepika in as the heroine.His CEO, Sandeep Singh, talked about it... ""It was her desire to work with Bhansali and I believe that to this day, no film has fully tapped her talent. Anyway, shooting started with Deepika. PC was understandably no longer on talking terms with us.""And Omung wanted Priyanka as Mary Kom. ""To her credit, she called me over,"" Sandeep breathed with relief. ""To her credit again, she gave importance to the subject and not to what had happened in the past.""...Bhansali had a more elaborate way of describing how Priyanka agreed to come into Mary Kom the film, after the unpleasantness of Ram-Leela, and topped it with Ram Chahe Leela, the item song into which she infused rustic sensuality.""When creative people get together, it's important they realise that what they're creating is more important than you or me,"" Sanjay wove his words intricately...""Then came Mary Kom and I realised that this was a film she should do and must do but (given the strained circumstances) whether she would or not..."" he shrugged. ""But she also understood that this was a separate film, an independent idea, not linked with the other film.""...If she transcended the common human reaction to a hurt which would have been to switch off and not entertain Bhansali's new offer, it was because, ""She doesn't let go of opportunities,"" remarked Bhansali...With Bhansali as producer and Priyanka Chopra in the lead, Omung couldn't have asked for a better debut. But when Priyanka was announced as Mary Kom, there was censure from some quarters.""I got a lot of flak for not casting someone from the North East as Mary Kom,"" Omung nodded. ""But I wanted the movie to have legs; I wanted the movie to go everywhere. That's why I wanted a star. Sanjay Leela Bhansali is a big producer but I was new, I needed a big actress to bank on.""The training and arrangements were detailed, complex and torturous at all times.""Full vigorous training went on for three months,"" he filed the details. ""Dedicated gymming, body building, eating bhar bhar ke (heartily). Priyanka was doing other films also, so it was difficult for her to build muscle and hide it while shooting for the others. We went to Goa and did a workshop and narrations. She took the trainer with her. Finally, we began to see the build, the forearms, the muscles emerging. She would post videos and tell me, see my wings.""In the midst of all this, tragedy struck. Mary Kom was on the verge of starting when Dr Ashok Chopra fell seriously ill. A week before they began shooting, he passed away.""We had to stall the film just a bit,"" remembered Omung, her director. ""But in about a week's time, she was ready to get back to work. She wanted to. Mary Kom was the film she started after her dad passed away.""But in the tragic loss of her father, in the final fifteen days when she had sat by his bedside, she'd lost the muscle she'd built with such tenacity. ""She simply said, karenge, we'll do it, and she built it all over again,"" added Omung.Apart from also ensuring that a double was available for Priyanka's practice shots, her back shots and so on, there was the additional tension of having real boxers in the film. They added authenticity to the shots but they also packed a real wallop and it was Priyanka who had to take their punches.Those punches spelt trouble and it happened one day when Priyanka had a little boil on her forehead.""I was at the monitor and I couldn't see her being hit,"" Omung detailed the incident. ""Here I was saying, 'Hit her, I can't see the punch, it looks like you're ducking.' There she was saying, ' Yeh really maar rahen hain, they're really hitting me.' When I kept saying, 'I can't see the punch,' the boxer landed fatak, one solid punch on her forehead and the boil just burst open; it oozed, and we had to stop shooting. Her mother was around, so she put some patti (bandage) on her forehead and took care of it. But Priyanka kept shooting. It was hurting her but she kept shooting.""Two sticky problems when telling the story of a real flesh-and-blood person turned out to be Mary Kom's hair and her eyes.""The film had a lot of changes in her hair,"" Omung laughed as he remembered. ""At first her hair was haphazard like in her childhood. She was moody, so after she began training, one day Mary Kom just went and shaved her head. When her hair grew back, small bits sprouted at first. We had a full progression chart for just her hair - in which year what her hair looked like. While shooting, we had to keep referring to the chart and go back and forth. Poori picture mein baal ka bahut panga tha (Right through the film, her hair posed a huge challenge). In some scenes, where we required real short hair, we gave Priyanka a scarf to hide her hair which was longer than required. Fortunately for us, Mary Kom wears scarves in real life.""What also posed a problem was that Priyanka didn't have the typical North-Eastern eyes...That was when Omung's talent as an extremely gifted artist (he paints too) came to the rescue. He revealed that two years before the film took off, when they were still working on the script, he had sketched the whole storyboard...""Mary Kom doesn't have freckles. But I had sketched her with freckles and a fringe. I gave that look to Priyanka and it worked... Priyanka loved the freckles so much, she'd go home with it...What made the assignment tougher for Priyanka was that the film was not shot at one stretch.""She got busy with other films. She was shooting for Gunday then and her director there used to curse me, saying, 'What have you guys done to my heroine? She's got muscles and now I have to hide her beauty, hide those muscles under long sleeves.' Even that sexy dance in Ram-Leela happened in between the shooting of Mary Kom. It was six to eight months before she could shoot with us again.""And so it happened again - by the time she reported for the next shoot, the assiduously built muscles had disappeared and the whole process had to start again.Excerpted from Priyanka Chopra: The Dark Horse by Bharathi S.

The stipulated area for growing paddy will be decreased from 2.15 lakh hectares last year to 2.08 lakh hectares this year, Deputy Director, Agriculture, Manoj Kumar Behera said.As part of the agriculture strategy for Kharif-2018, the administration will boost the cultivation of pulses, like mung, biri and arahar, by increasing farming land from 43,323 hectares to 48,755 hectares, he said.Similarly, the space for oilseeds such as groundnut, till and caster will be increased from 23,599 hectares last year to 24,915 hectares this year, the deputy director stated. The farmers would get remunerative prices if they switch over from traditional paddy to cash crops, he added.The district officials will also focus on increasing productivity this season.The administration plans to improve paddy yield from 2,413 kg per hectares last year to 4,254 kg per hectares this year, another official said. Paddy crop was largely damaged due to pest attack and unseasonal rain last year, resulting in slump in productivity.The Odisha State Seeds Corporation (OSSC) has decided to introduce two new varieties of paddy this year in the district.

Anshul, who has his own start-up, makes sure that his work doesnt come in the way of his passion for fitness , and has a disciplined workout routine despite a packed schedule. I started running around four years ago and participated in my first half-marathon in 2014 and after a few months, I attempted a couple of more half and full marathons, before taking up cycling. I started with leisure cycling by travelling from one city to another. I applied for the Ironman last year and started learning swimming as it requires a 4km swim, says Anshul, who completed Ironman Malaysia last year.Talking about the challenges he faced while practicing for the challenge, Anshul says, I am very new to swimming, so that was the toughest part. After completing Ironman, I decided to give Ultraman a try. The Ironman challenge helped me overcome my fear of open-water swim. I never swam for more than 3.8km, so swimming was a big challenge. A lot of people told me not to apply. I had just four months to prepare for the Australia event, but I told myself, Lets give it a try, and just went with my gut feeling.He adds, In mid-February, I started training at Talkatora Stadium. I divided my week into four days of heavy swimming, one day of cycling and two days of running. I tried to find coaches, but they were all for beginners. So I would watch videos on YouTube and trained myself in swimming. Finally, I could complete 10km of swimming in four hours. For someone who had become a trained swimmer by watching online videos, it was a big boost for my morale. I used to run two full marathons every month during my prep time. Every weekend, I would participate in either a marathon or a brevet. I also took part in an ultra-run of 74km from Dehradun to Dhanaulti. The idea was to run short distances of my own. I normally tried to participate in one event or the other.As Anshul is new to swimming, it was the toughest part for himAnshul had a disciplined diet that helped him stay focused on his goal. Your diet makes a lot of difference whenever you are participating in such competitions. My day began with having dry-fruits  almonds, figs and dates. After that, I had sprouts like moong, kala chana and soyabean. Steamed veggies like broccoli and beetroot were also a part of my diet, apart from coconut and lime water. The idea was to have 10 small portions between waking up and 1pm. After that, I had my usual lunch.Biking is one of the rounds in Ultraman, and getting used to the triathlon bike required a lot of practice, says Anshul. A triathlon bike has aerobars, so one has to ride it differently, and that requires a lot of practice. I used to go to the Noida Expressway regularly to practice riding a triathlon bike.Anshul is trying his luck in millennium run for sub-3 full marathons (running a marathon under three hours) and go for the La Ultra Run (333 kms) in Ladakh . No Indian has ever been able to complete the 333km run in Ladakh and I want to be the first Indian to do that. This year, I will go for the sub-3 full marathons, and next year for the La Ultra run, he says.-Priyanka Narula"

All India Dal Mills Association has urged government to roll back the tax to promote regional dal mill sector.MP Dal Mill Association (Indore) president Suresh Agrawal said, We are losing business because dal processed in Gujarat, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh and other states are much economical. They do not levy mandi tax on out station purchase of raw pulses.Agarwal said that dal mills have to pay Rs 11,000 as mandi tax on a truckload of 100 quintals pulses.Locally manufactured pulses are expensive by Rs 2 to Rs 3 per quintal in comparison to dal produced in other states.Dal mills of Indore bring chickpeas, green gram, black gram and red gram from neighbouring states such as Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Karnataka and Maharashtra. Dal processors said processed pulses from other states have captured the local market.Agrawal said, We have given a memorandum to chief minister to abolish the mandi tax on purchase of raw pulses from other states.According to MP Dal Mill Association, local dal mills have cut down production of processed pulses by about 50 per cent since the operative cost was huge as against the input.Dal mills purchase raw pulses from market and then process it into dal of various grades. After processing 60 per cent comes out as dal, while 25 per cent goes as cattle feed and the rest is wasted, experts said.There are 175 dal mills in Indore while the state is the leading producer of pulses in the country with a share of 35-40 per cent."

Barring Raichur, all other districts of the state have received good pre-monsoon rainfall. In fact, South Karnataka has received above normal rainfall, he said.Attributing the heavy pre-monsoon showers to multiple weather systems formed in the Bay of Bengal and Arabian Sea, Reddy said, The high winds pushed rainy clouds towards the state from both sides, and we witnessed good pre-monsoon rainfall.Senior farm superintendent at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Naganahalli P Prakash believes that the pre-monsoon showers will have a positive impact on agricultural production. Farmers can tart sowing crops such as urad dal, moong dal, etc. Good rainfall in the pre-monsoon season means that farmers can start preparations for the monsoon season quickly, he said.Indian Meteorological Department, Bengaluru centre, estimates that South Karnataka region received 45% more rainfall, compared to normal between May 17 and 23."

(Express Photo by Deepak Daware) Farmers sell their harvest at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi at Amravati, Maharashtra. (Express Photo by Deepak Daware)When in mid-December, Anand Pawar decided to register the standing tur (pigeon-pea) on 10 out of his 50-acre holding with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federations purchase centre at Latur, he was quite hopeful of realising the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,450 per quintal for the soon-to-be-harvested crop. At the time of registration, this farmer from Harangul Khurd village of Latur taluka was even promised he would soon receive an SMS, specifying the date and time for him to proceed to make the sale at the centre.The SMS never came and, more than five months later, Pawar is still stuck with the 65 quintals of tur he harvested in mid-January. And he deeply regrets not having sold his crop then at the prevailing market rate of Rs 4,200-4,250 per quintal. Tur is currently trading in the Latur market yard at Rs 3,550-3,600 per quintal. Why promise something you did not intend to deliver? What option do I have other than sell at todays going price? I need the money for my next crop, with the monsoon rains just 2-3 weeks away, says Pawar, whose sole consolation is from the soyabean on his balance 40 acres. While it also sold initially below the MSP of Rs 3,050 per quintal  at Rs 2,550-2,600 in November and Rs 2,800-2,900 in December  prices rose significantly thereafter. Pawar could fetch Rs 3,800-3,900 per quintal for his last lot of soyabean sold in early-April.Pawar is a relatively better-off farmer, who was able to make some money by not selling his entire soyabean crop during the peak marketing season of November-December. But 2017-18 has been an unmitigated disaster even for him, when it comes to pulses. For growers of tur, urad (black gram), moong (green gram), chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil), this is a year they would simply not want to remember.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?The curse of low realisations for farmers  ironically, in a crop where India has been perpetually import-dependent  comes despite government agencies undertaking record procurement during the last two years. In the 2015-16 crop year (July-June), a mere 1.19 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses were procured under the Price Stabilisation Fund set up by the Narendra Modi government: 50,422.53 tonnes during kharif and 69,049.08 tonnes in the rabi marketing season. In 2016-17, procurement by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium rose over 13 times to 15.62 lt. That included 14.74 lt of kharif pulses (11.66 lt tur, 2.20 lt moong and 0.89 lt urad) and 0.87 lt of rabi pulses (0.60 lt chana and 0.27 lt masur).In the current year, procurement, which is ongoing, is set to further double. NAFED, the only government agency now procuring under the so-called Price Support Scheme (PSS), has till now bought 14.59 lt of chana, 8.58 lt of tur, 2.95 lt of moong, 2.03 lt of urad and 1.36 lt of masoor. That adds up to around 29.50 lt. The final figure could well cross 30 lt  unprecedented as far as pulses go.But unlike for wheat and paddy  for which there are established systems that have stood the test of time  the actual process of procurement has been far from smooth in the case of pulses. Under PSS, the MSP-based procurement is done by state marketing federations that are sub-agents of NAFED. In states such as Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, farmers wanting to sell are required to register themselves first at the procurement centres of their areas. As part of this process, they have to mention the area planted under a particular crop, while providing proof of land ownership (copy of 7/12 revenue extract) and also their Aadhaar identification and bank account numbers. Once registration happens, the farmers are supposed to get an SMS intimation of the date for bringing their produce, the idea being to avoid overcrowding at the procurement centres. Payments, too, are to be credited directly into their bank accounts within 48 hours of the sale taking place.However, things havent quite worked that way on the ground.ALSO READ | Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous statesIn MP, farmers have had to wait in long queues at the mandis for selling their chana and masur at the governments MSPs. There have even been reports of a couple of farmers dying after standing for hours in the searing summer heat. The situation has been rendered worse by the shortage of weighing machines and porters, especially in the smaller mandis. Notwithstanding all this, government agencies, as on May 22, had managed to procure 9.10 lt of chana from MP (worth Rs 4,003.96 crore at the MSP of Rs 4,400 per quintal) and another 2.67 lt (Rs 1,174.99 crore) from Rajasthan. The agencies also bought 1.34 lt of masur from MP, whose MSP value was Rs 571.23 crore. Both MP and Rajasthan are, incidentally, headed for state assembly polls in November-December this year.In Maharashtra, many farmers registered their crop at government purchase centres, but could not sell a single quintal at the MSP. Pawar sought to sell, apart from his 65 quintals of tur, also 25 quintals of chana grown on five acres this rabi season. I went to the centre on Monday to make a final enquiry on whether at least my chana would be procured. But the officials could not give any definite date. How does this government really expect our incomes to double?, he asks sarcastically.Government agencies procured 4.01 lt of tur from Maharashtra is the 2016-17 kharif marketing season. This time, they purchased another 3.25 lt, worth Rs 1,770.84 crore at the MSP, but farmers havent received even half of this amount so far (when they were supposed to get paid within 48 hours). The reason for it is that the procured produce has not been moved from the centres to the designated godowns. NAFED will not realise the payments without that. But the produce cannot be moved, as there is no space in the godowns, which are full with the unsold tur and chana of last year, admits a Maharashtra government official.With the new planting season about to start, NAFED is desperately issuing tenders for offloading its inventories. Total unsold stocks of pulses in government godowns, from two years of record procurement, are estimated at more than 40 lt. These stocks  on top of continuing imports  will exert further pressure on prices when the next crop arrives from September. The only thing that can prevent such an eventuality is drought. That, again, isnt going to help farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A majority of them live in unprotected areas to meet their food requirement.The incidence of blackbuck herds raiding standing groundnut, pigeon pea, green gram, maize and sorghum crops in the vegetative stage is on the rise. It is only be a matter of time before farmers resort to various methods of trapping and killing them, experts say. It is for hunting this animal that is listed in the First Schedule of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972, that Hindi movie star Salman Khan was sentenced to five years rigorous imprisonment by the district court in Rajasthan.Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agriculture University professor V. Vasudeva Rao said that more blackbucks were living outside protected areas because they were attracted to the wide variety of crops raised in the ayacut of many new lift irrigation schemes that have come up in the drought-prone districts of Rayalaseema.The blackbuck prefers open areas to closed forests.Prof. Vasudeva Rao did his Ph.D on the behaviour and other aspects of the blackbuck in two different habitats that is in arid areas of Prakasam district and on the banks of Godavari River, in 1999. He is currently head of the Department of Vertebrate Pest Management in the university.Status changed thriceThe International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List had changed the status of the blackbuck three times in the past three decades. From Vulnerable in 1994-96, the status of the antelope has been changed to Near Threatened (NT) (2003-08) and to Least Concerned (LC) after that till today.According to the IUCN, the population of the blackbuck increased from 22,000 in the 1970s to over 50,000 by 2000.Blackbuck was the heraldry symbol of seven princely states of India before Independence.It was the State animal of the undivided Andhra Pradesh. However after bifurcation, Telangana changed its State animal to spotted deer. After considerable deliberations, the new Andhra Pradesh decided to continue with the blackbuck as its State animal. It is the State animal of Haryana and Punjab also."

In May itself, the district received 53.5 mm rain compared to 31.4 mm rains last year. In June, the average rainfall is 95mm, which helps in reaping a good harvest, for which the farmers are hoping.The farmers say that if they receive one more good shower then it would help them cultivate short-term crops, such as green gram, black gram and bajra for the season.Meanwhile, the Department of Agriculture has set the target of 4.3 lakh hectare sowing area for the kharif season. The department estimated the sowing of green gram and black gram in 30,000 hectares, sunflower in 28,000 hectares and groundnut in 1,600 hectares and commercial crops in over 15,000 hectares.Farmers have been extensively cultivating toor for the last seven to eight years and this time also, they are opting for the same crop, which gives them higher returns.Of the total sowing area, toor will be cultivated in nearly three lakh hectares, the officials said, adding that they believe that this target might cross.Since a large portion of agriculture land in our district is rain-dependent, only good rain can help us get better yield and profit. We hope at least this year, we make some profit, said Dundappa Nagur, a farmer of Jumanal village."

The types of pulses to be procured are gram, moong, arhar and masur.The extended Mokama tal area that encompasses parts of Patna and Nalanda districts is famous for the production of pulses. Actually, the four districts constitute the one uniform zone, Singh said.The NAFED has already started the work and around 1,900 metric tonnes of pulses have already been procured till Monday. In the meantime, a more elaborate system is being worked out. We are working on the detailed action plan, Singh said.Traditionally, only paddy used to be procured from the farmers of the state at the MSP. This year, we introduced the procurement of wheat at MSP in 18 districts of the state. Now, from this year, the procurement of pulses would also be done, Singh said, adding that the Centre has fixed MSP for 25 items of agriculture, including foodgrains and pulses.He said paddy is procured by Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), wheat by Vyaapaar Mandal and NAFED has been selected as the agency for the procurement of pulses in the state.The selection of NAFED has been done for the primary reason that the procured pulses have to be stored in specially designed godowns to prevent their perforation and other deformities in them. NAFED has access to such specially-made godowns, Singh said, adding the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) are already full.The first round of talks has already been held with the NAFED representatives. It is for the first time that a decision has been taken to procure pulses from the farmers at the MSP rates, Singh said, adding: Once the system has been set up, the procurement will become a continuous process."

Five days later, the situation turned violent.According to a report compiled by the state government and submitted to the Union home ministry last year, the protesting farmers turned into a violent mob that the police tried to control first with a lathicharge and then with tear gas shells. Finally, they opened fire. On June 6, three farmers were killed in Piplya Mandi and two, in Bhai Choupati.A year laterThe families of those who were killed maintain that the farmers had done nothing to provoke police fire.Dinesh Patidar, father of 17-year-old Abhishek, who had died in the police firing on June 6, said, We are still angry that no action has been taken against the policemen who killed my son.Of the five who lost their lives last year, four are from the dominant Patidar community. The Patidars are also angry because the government has not withdrawn the cases registered against about 2,000 people for participating in the protests despite repeated assurances. Some of us had to go jail even though the police did not have any evidence against us, said farmer and leader Amrit Lal Patidar, who has 23 cases against him. Protesting is not a crime, he said.Bhavantar Bhugtan YojanaA year later, Piplya Mandi remains tense, with farmers continuing to eye traders with suspicion. Nothing has changed at the mandi, said Rajesh Patidar, a farmer leader. The traders are still cheating us.Yet in August 2017, when Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY) was announced by the state government, it seemed like things were looking up for farmers in Madhya Pradesh. Under the BBY, the government would pay farmers the difference between the average wholesale price and the minimum support price (MSP) of the produce sold.Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana covered seven major kharif crops  soya bean, black gram, maize, green gram, sesame, niger seed and groundnut. Since August 2017, over 6.35 lakh farmers have registered themselves for BBY and Rs 1,900 crore has been distributed till March 2018.Of prices and protestsHowever, the impact on the ground is not what either the government or the farmer would have expected when BBY was inaugurated.Madhya Pradeshs farmers are again on strike and have blocked fruits, vegetables and milk to cities, demanding better price for their produce.They say BBY benefits the traders more than it does them.Before garlic came under Bhavantar scheme it was selling at Rs 8,000 per quintal in January this year, but now the price is only around Rs 2,000 per quintal and it came down to Rs 200 per quintal in May, said Satyanarayan Bhanej of Balaguda village, which is approximately 20 km away from Mandsaur city.What had originally been welcomed as a scheme by which the government would compensate farmers for losses incurred by selling crops at prices lower than the MSP, is now seen a catalyst for ruin. Farmers said the scheme encouraged distress selling because BBY compensations could only be availed for produce sold within a certain window.Once the traders come to know that a particular lot of garlic is under Bhavantar they will never raise the price. The Rs 800 per quintal we get under the Bhavantar scheme is not even enough to cover the cost of production. Wait and see once purchase of garlic under Bhavantar scheme ends, its prices will shoot up and traders will benefit, said Bhanej.A cap was introduced on how much would be compensated under the scheme and there was also no clarity on when the money would be received by the farmers.Amrit Patidar, who is involved in the ongoing strike, said, The gulf between the farmers and traders has increased because we believe that all policies of the government finally benefit the trader at the cost of the farmer. The trader mints money due to his financial muscle and the farmer who toils hard gets pittance for his effort. Traders dont agree. Bhavantar is not helping us either and the allegation of cartelisation is a myth, because there is no unity among the traders, says Sunil Ghatiya, president of traders association in Piplya Mandi.Bharatiya Janata Partys state general secretary Bansilal Gujar said despite some problems, overall BBY has helped farmers.He did admit, however, that there is a perception among the farmers that this scheme has helped the traders more than the farmers.Congress leader and former minister in the Digvijay Singh government, Narendra Nahata alleged the failure of BBY was evident in the low price of soya-bean, Madhya Pradeshs biggest cash crop of the state.He claimed the price of soya bean rose from Rs 2,200-2,500 per quintal to Rs 3,500 per quintal after the BBY window closed.Farmers are now worried that sale of rabi crops will be affected just like the kharif crops were.On the anniversary of the police firing that killed five, some mandis of Madhya Pradesh saw less vegetables, while many traders stocked up in advance to make sure they met their demand.A year later, what remains constant for the farmers is their anxiety over how much loss they must accept as normal."

Picture by Manob ChowdharyRanchi: Around 600 tribals armed with traditional weapons staged a demonstration near Raj Bhavan on Friday to press for their 13-point demand charter, which was later handed over to governor Droupadi Murmu.The protesters, who had assembled around 11am at Morabadi grounds, covered a distance of 2km via Booty Road, Radium Road, Circular Road and Kutchery Road to reach Raj Bhavan.The demonstration, organised under the aegis of Adivasi Moolvasi Astitva Raksha Manch, began at 1pm and continued till 2.30pm despite rain.During the demonstration, tribal leaders delivered speeches justifying their demands, including immediate release of community plots from the land bank created by the state government, strict implementation of provisions of the CNT and SPT acts and immediate implementation of land acquisition act formulated in 2013.Other demands no land acquisition without the permission of gram sabha, strict implementation of the rule formulated for Scheduled-V area, farm loan waiver, increasing the remuneration from Rs 159 to Rs 500 for labourers working under Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee scheme to prevent the migration of tribals and cancellation of local policy formulated by state government and making land survey record of 1932 the basis for determining the domicile status of a resident.They also sought the introduction of a Sarna code in census form, the appointment of only locals in panchayat, block and district headquarters, schools and hospitals.Apart from carrying traditional weapons, including bows and arrows, axe, pharsa, dauli and dhel-mungra at the demonstration, the tribals also brought along paddy and jackfruits with them to send a message that they were closely associated with land and forest and could not survive if their land was used for non-agricultural purposes.Manch convenor Dayamani Barla, who later handed the charter of demands to governor Droupadi Murmu, more such agitations would be organised if proper efforts were not made to fulfil the demands.""We are not feeling safe in the state. The government is adamant to give away tribal land for non-agricultural purpose. We are still unemployed and our people are migrating from the state.

Bhadri Reddy said, We will have no option but to agitate from Monday if the Union and State governments do not intervene and ensure return of market buoyancy.Meanwhile, YSRCP farmers wing State president M.V.S. Nagi Reddy, after visiting the Ongole II auction platform, said, There has been no improvement in the market condition even after Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidus visit to the district. Though the leaf production had been about 10 million kg less than the crop size fixed by the Tobacco Board, the domestic players were hammering the prices, taking advantage of the inactive participation by the exporters, who were shying away from the market because of lack of confirmed orders from the overseas buyers, Mr. Reddy said.Prices fall below MSPIt was not just the tobacco growers who were denied a fair price for their produce. It was not just the tobacco growers who were struggling to cope with the market glut. Prices of almost all rain-fed crops, including bengal gram, black gram, groundnut, green gram, and maize ruled much below the minimum support price (MSP), he added. The Tobacco Board, which was flush with funds, thanks to the collection of penalty from the farmers for overshooting the crop size in the past, could purchase the low-grade tobacco to prevent the growers from committing suicide, he said."

The police have also issued an advisory asking people to refrain from spreading rumours on social media.Mukesh Agarwal, one of the senior most police officers in the state, is monitoring the situation on the spot and also leading the search operations. Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal has asked his officers to frame a roadmap to implement the awareness programme 'Sanskaar' at all levels, in coordination with local bodies, women organisations and media persons. ""Assam is known for its unique hospitality and people coming from all over the country must feel an ambiance of friendliness where ever they go in the state,"" a communication from Mr Sonowal's office said.The parents of Nilotpal Das requested people not to politicize the issue. ""We are grateful to all for extending their support in this hour of grief but we appeal to maintain peace and calm,"" the family said in a statement."

Reuters Telangana farmers hold photographs of their relatives, who have reportedly committed suicide, during a rally organised by farmers organisations. ReutersThe K Chandrashekar Rao-led government in Telangana has issued cheques totaling around Rs 5,600 crore to 57.33 lakh land-owning farmers in the state ahead of the current kharif crop season under its flagship Rythu Bandhu agricultural subsidy scheme.Out of the Rs 5,600 crore worth cheques that we have issued since May 10, farmers have already encashed Rs 5,400 crore, Vakati Karuna, special officer for the Rythu Bandhu scheme, told The Indian Express.Under Rythu Bandhu, farmers are given a flat Rs 4,000 per acre investment support before every crop season, with this amount expected to meet a major part of their expenses on inputs. In all, we have covered 1.42 crore acres. Technically, the scheme does not discriminate between farmers based on their landholding size. However, 92% of the beneficiaries own less than five acres, while 5% have 5-10 acres and the balance 3% more than 10 acres, Karuna said.The state government had initially compiled a list of 72 lakh beneficiaries, based on a revenue department survey conducted during October-December last year. The survey collected the address and land ownership details of all farmers, apart from their Aadhaar unique identity and mobile phone numbers. The lack of proper land records resulted in the total number coming down to 57.33 lakh. But the records are still under rectification and more farmers will be added to the beneficiary list later, Karuna, also head of the states Land Records Purification Mission, added.The Telangana government also plans to extend the flat Rs 4,000-per acre subsidy for the rabi season, with the distribution of cheques for it to commence from November 18. All this, political observers feel, would come useful for the ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) next April-May, when elections for both Parliament and the State Assembly are scheduled.The crops cultivated in Telangana during kharif  sowing for which has begun with the onset of the southwest monsoon  include cotton, maize and groundnut, while farmers mainly grow chickpea, green gram, black gram and chilli in the rabi season.We fixed the subsidy at Rs 4,000 per acre after a study showed this as roughly what farmers spend on seed, fertiliser, pesticide, and field preparation. Besides, we are giving free 24-hour electricity supply for agricultural pump-sets. Both schemes (Rythu Bandhu and free power) together will take a huge load off farmers shoulders and they now need to only incur the cost of hiring agricultural labour, claimed Telangana Agriculture Minister Pocharam Srinivas Reddy.The TRS government has allocated Rs 12,000 crore for Rythu Bandhu in 2018-19, while the 247 free power supply to farmers is projected to cost another Rs 1,000 crore. The two schemes would consume about 14% of the states budgeted tax revenues of Rs 92,959.31 crore for the current fiscal.Rythu Bandhu seems to have been more than well-received by Telangana farmers. Earlier, to buy seeds or fertilisers, I had to borrow from money-lenders and input dealers. They would charge minimum 3% interest per month. But now, I dont have to depend on them to purchase basic inputs for planting my crop, noted B Satya Reddy, a farmer from Muthangi village in Patancheru mandal of Sangareddy district, who owns 4.5 acres of land.When we take loans from money-lenders, the tendency is to borrow more than what is required for only purchase of farm inputs. They, too, encourage this, which leads to our incurring huge debts. The money from the government (under Rythu Bandhu) is a huge support. The urge to borrow itself is less when we feel there is money in our bank account, points out B Mallesham, a farmer with 4 acres of land in Sultanpur village.The Telangana government has gone in for issuing cheques rather than making DBT (direct benefit transfer) payments into farmers accounts for a simple reason: DBT money might be used by the banks to adjust dues against past loans taken by farmers. The specially-printed cheques, on the other hand, can be encashed directly by farmers through banks of their choice. The state government, through the Reserve Bank of India, has also ensured sufficient supply of cash in bank branches  especially keeping in mind the currency scarcity that was witnessed during April.The Rythu Bandhu cheques have been distributed along with free Pattadar Dharani passbooks. Each passbook has a unique code and contains all relevant information about the farmer, including name, and location and size of the landholding. Apart from replacing all other farm ownership documents, it will record the purchase and sale of any land by the farmer. All these details can be updated on a regular basis similar to a bank passbook.The Rythu Bandhu scheme has, however, come under criticism on two major counts.The first is, of course, that it does not exclude rich farmers or wealthy non-cultivating landlords. As the subsidy is granted on a per-acre basis, it can be availed even by well-off bureaucrats, politicians and ministers. But the scheme also has a Giveitup provision, under which the cheques given by the government can be returned to the local authorities. All ministers, and many IAS and IPS officers, owning farmland in their native villages, have reportedly returned the cheques. The difference between the value of cheques issued and those actually encashed is partly a result of the Giveitup initiative.The second criticism is the exclusion of tenant cultivators. Often belonging to the poorest and most disadvantaged backgrounds, they constitute an estimated 40% of Telanganas farming population, while tilling lands owned by others. Theres little we can do, as the land that a tenant farmer is cultivating is registered in the name of the owner. The agricultural pump-set and electricity connection is also in the owners name, and so is the passbook that is being issued. We can only hope that the owner will pass on the benefits to the tenant-cultivator, admitted an agriculture department official.It was a conscious decision we took to avoid unnecessary litigation, because tenant farmers cannot submit proof of even cultivation of the land, which is done mostly based on informal lease arrangements. The real owners will go to court if their tenants are treated as farmers and extended support under the scheme, explained C Parthasarathi, principal secretary (agriculture).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

5b27ed359855b72445d1f8e0,Centre allows pulses import despite overflowing godowns,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/centre-allows-pulses-import-despite-overflowing-godowns/article24176785.ece,2018-06-16,"The Union government has allotted quotas for import of pulses and is enforcing an additional import agreement with Mozambique at a time when domestic stocks are at their highest, domestic production is expected to be high and prices are crashing. Farmers and millers are unhappy with the situation, but the government says it is balancing the needs of Indian consumers and commitments to foreign trade partners on the one hand and the interests of Indian farmers on the other.The final allocations of import quotas  totalling two lakh tonnes of tur or arhar dal, and 1.5 lakh tonnes each of moong and urad  were made at a meeting at the Directorate-General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) on Monday. Those amounts represent a quantitative restriction that was slapped on pulses imports in August 2017 in response to a glut in domestic supply and falling prices, which continues this year. On the back of a good monsoon forecast, the Agriculture Commissioner predicts domestic pulses production of 24 million tonnes in 2018-19, slightly higher than last years.However, the DGFT issued a notice last month exempting pulses imports from Mozambique from the restrictions.Fallout of 2016 crisisIn 2016, in the wake of soaring pulse prices and angry consumers, India signed an MoU to double pulses imports  mostly arhar  from the east African nation over a five-year period. This obligates India to buy 1.5 lakh tonnes from Mozambique this year. The government has also explored the possibility of similar long-term agreements with countries such as Kenya.There is an MoU ... we also dont want to just stop trade abruptly, DGFT Alok Chaturvedi told The Hindu when asked about the impact of imports. This is a long-term agreement. He pointed out that an inter-ministerial committee headed by the Food Secretary, including the Secretaries of Agriculture, Consumer Affairs and Commerce, made the decision to allow a limited quota of imports which have to be completed by August-end, before Indian harvests, so that our farmers are not affected.However, this does not take into account the fact that last years surplus harvests have already resulted in full godowns.Sunil Kumar Singh, Additional Managing Director, NAFED, said the government procurement agency alone had 40 lakh tonnes of pulses in its warehouses  a record  apart from stocks still remaining with traders and farmers.Falling pricesFarmers groups have been agitating about falling crop prices all summer. The import restriction is a classic case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted, says Avik Saha, convener of the Jai Kisan Andolan.Acreage upHe says the government should have realised that farmers had increased acreage on the back of rising prices, incentivised by a higher minimum support price and technical interventions to ensure higher domestic production.Those statistics pointing to oversupply were completely ignored and instead the government signed long-term deals with other countries, digging its own grave. The seeds of this calamity were planted in 2016, farmers are now harvesting a crop of woe and will continue to harvest it next year.This year, for the first time, the government has allowed millers  as opposed to traders  to import pulses. However, Suresh Agrawal, chairman, All India Dal Millers Association, is not a happy man.Prices outside India are higher than domestic rates, so it is not viable to import, he says, pointing out that while Indian rates for tur were at Rs. 3,400 a tonne, it would cost at least $410 (more than Rs. 27,000) to import from Kenya.Stocks everywhereThe government has stock, traders have stock, millers have stock, and farmers have stock, so there is a surplus. We dont understand why the government is insisting on import...we may be able to meet only 40-50% of our quotas. A senior official at the DGFT insisted that according to the terms of the allocation, import quotas must be met by the end of August."

The decision, taken by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, comes less than a year before the 2019 general election. An announcement to give farmers a price of 1.5 times of cost was made by Union Minister Arun Jaitley in Budget 2018 presented on February 1 this year.The announcement of higher MSP coupled with the forecast of normal monsoon this year, could further boost foodgrains output. However, a higher support price could also fuel food inflation.The Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), in its meeting, approved the MSP of 14 Kharif (summer-sown) crops. According to sources, the MSP of paddy (common grade) has been increased by Rs 200 to Rs 1,750 per quintal, while that of Grade A variety by Rs 160 per quintal to Rs 1,750.The MSP of paddy (common) was Rs 1,550 per quintal and Rs 1,590 per quintal for paddy (grade A) variety. The MSP of cotton (medium staple) has been increased to Rs 5,150 from Rs 4,020 and that of cotton (long staple) to Rs 5,450 from 4,320 per quintal.In pulses, tur MSP has been raised to Rs 5,675 per quintal from Rs 5,450, and that of moong to Rs 6,975 per quintal from Rs 5,575. Urad MSP has been hiked to Rs 5,600 from Rs 5,400 per quintal. Hike in paddy MSP will increase the food subsidy bill by over Rs 11,000 crore based on procurement figure of the 2016-17 marketing year (October-September).The Food Corporation of India (FCI), the government's nodal agency for procurement and distribution of foodgrains, buys wheat and rice from farmers at MSP and supplies the grains under the food security law.Paddy is the main kharif (summer sown) crop, the sowing of which has already begun with the onset of southwest monsoon. Earlier, sources had said that the MSP rate proposed by the agriculture ministry is higher than the government's farm advisory body Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), considering growing farm distress because of a fall in prices of most crops, owing to bumper production.India is estimated to have harvested a record foodgrains production at 279.51 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) on all-time high output of rice, wheat, coarse cereals and pulses."

Local stringers in Jharkhand and Hyderabad who sent out alarmist messages. A 'lone wolf' in Assam who summoned a mob. These are some of the individuals who may have been responsible for spreading fake rumours of child abduction that have killed over 30 people this year, an NDTV investigation has found.Spread over four states, our reporters relied on police records and local accounts to piece together a profile of the instigators of the messages that triggered a series of mob attacks across India.In at least three instances, in Maharashtra, Hyderabad and Jharkhand, the police have narrowed down on local media for manufacturing or amplifying dubious claims of child snatching.In Dhule, north Maharashtra, five people were killed by a violent mob on July 1. Amongst the reasons, the police claimed, was a video news report that went viral from a YouTube channel called MediaLive run by a local journalist called Rafeeq Sheikh.The report said that burqa-clad men were out on the prowl to abduct children from a local mosque, creating panic.Mr Sheikh claims the video was taken down within 10 minutes of it being put up. ""My adversaries downloaded the video and made it go viral after I took it down,"" he said.He told NDTV that he was only reporting an incident that occurred in his village. ""A lady in my village told me that she saw two men in a burqa trying to kidnap a girl, but failed when she spotted them from the kitchen and raised an alarm,"" he said.Police have denied any such incident.Curiously, police have not taken action against him, letting him off after questioning.Rafeeq Sheikh carried a report that burqa-clad men were out on the prowl to abduct children from a local mosque, creating panic.The role of the media has also surfaced in Telangana, where a transgender was beaten to death and two others badly injured in a mob attack on May 27 in Hyderabad.Police claim that among those who spread rumours of child abduction in the run-up to the attack are two local journalists, Subhan and Syed Saleem.Subhan allegedly shared a post of a video on his Facebook page called 'Reporter Subhan', claiming that child lifters were on the prowl in Mahbubnagar, nearly 100 kilometers from Hyderabad. The post blamed the police for rescuing the abductors. The video, in fact, was of the police rescuing a group of men who were wrongly targeted as child abductors.Among the 221 people who shared the post was Saleem, who allegedly has a track record of posting inflammatory messages on social media.Both were arrested on charges of abetment to murder. ""They heard rumours from other areas and spread it without understanding the consequences. The transgender was attacked because of them,"" said V.Satyanarayana, Deputy Commissioner of Police, South Zone, Hyderabad.Subhan, however, claims he did nothing wrong, and that the police have been unduly harsh.In Jharkhand, which witnessed the first instance of such mob attacks in May last year, the role of the media has been called into question.In Assam, however, police investigations have revealed how old-fashioned tools of communication, like phone calls and word of mouth have triggered a mob attack.For playing a role in spreading rumours that led to the murder of two men in June 8 in Assam's Karbi Anglong district, police have filed a case against a local man, Alfajos Timung.On the evening of June 8, the victims were finding their way to a waterfall when they encountered Timung.According to the police, Timung claimed the victims were child abductors, and got into an altercation with them. A crowd gathered and began to throw stones but the victims drove off.7 people were killed in Jharkhand in May 2017 over suspicion of being child-lifters.Timung then called ahead to a nearby village, and alerted them about the arrival of the two men, amplifying the story to allege that the car contained five child abductors, as well as abducted children. By the time the men reached the village, a crowd had gathered which beat them to death.""Not only did he give false information, but also propagated it and took part in the lynching,"" Dr GV Siva Prasad, Senior Superintendent of Police of Karbi Anglong district told NDTV.Timung was a school dropout but was an influential voice in the district as a member of the Karbi Student Union, say locals.His relatives claim that he was only trying to warn people against child abductors. ""Alfajoz has told us that he believed that they were really child lifters thus he alerted the villagers and the villagers had to check because these people exist,"" Timung's relative, Basanti Tehronpi, said. She said the area was rife with rumours about child abduction in the run up to the deadly event.Currently, Timung is in jail with his father and brother for instigating the crowd."

Vendors dealing in a variety of food from fried masala groundnuts to fried moong dal swiftly set up shop near the reservoir to cater to the visitors who made hay while the water flowed.Safety precautionsBalamuri, the mini-waterfalls situated downstream of KRS, too has come alive, attracting many visitors. Acting on an advisory from the Centre, adequate safety precautions were in place at Balamuri, which had earned notoriety for drowning instances. Barricades and deployment of security personnel ensured that the visitors were prevented from entering the waters.Thanks to the heavy discharge of water from KRS, Balamuri had acquired a glory that was last seen about eight years ago. Meanwhile, the Ranganathittu bird sanctuary was also among the tourist spots that drew visitors on Sunday. Though boating was suspended since Saturday owing to a rapid rise in water levels, visitors were allowed to go inside the sanctuary, but only to watch the birds from a safe distance from the waters. While the boats were tied to the dock, the ticket counter for boating was submerged in the waters.The water level in the river had risen considerably at Talakadu, near here, submerging a large portion of the sand on the river bank and flooding the changing rooms. The authorities had barred entry of people to the river bank in view of the rising water levels.However, it was the Shivanasamudra waterfalls that drew hordes of people from not only Mysuru and surrounding regions, but also Bengaluru and other areas. It was bumper-to-bumper traffic for up to 4 km from Shivanasamudra thanks to continuous flow of vehicles towards the waterfalls."

It seems Johny Johny Yes Appa was named so for the opening scene of the film, in which Johnys father calls out Johny Johny... and the son answers Yes Appa... while the titles flash on the screen.That happens to be one of the peak creative moments of the film, which is not one, but two films rolled into one. Johny (Kunchakko Boban), right from his younger days, is adept at stealing money, and passing on the blame to others. He grows up to be a thief, who maintains the image of a pious, well-mannered man.At home too, he is the beloved son, while his brothers find themselves out of favour with the parents, owing to Johnys doings.In the first half, the script treats Johny as a remorseless thief, whose source of happiness is not just the money he steals, but also the misery that he piles on others, including his brothers, through his actions.The scriptwriter seemed to want to push the boundaries of what was just another family drama, by painting the lead character in sharp negative shades. But, soon we see the writer developing cold feet, as the second half of the film is all about redeeming this negative character and portraying him as good at heart.A one-sided attemptThis second half looks like quite another film, with new characters and an entirely different story arc.Adam (Sanoop), an orphan boy, pops up in Johnys life so that he could carry out some good deeds and wash away the sins of the first half. The characters transformation is also shoddily handled and remains unconvincing.The perils of writing a story with just the lead character in mind, and without considering the fate or emotions of the others is quite evident here.For instance, Jaisa (Anu Sithara), the female lead character, has almost nothing to do and repeats the same set of actions throughout.Joji Thomas, who penned the script for the laugh riot Vellimoonga , fails here with a non-engaging storyline and scarce laughs.S.R.

How long does its leap last? I had seen pictures and knew about its endangered status since quite some time. The last thought before going to sleep for the past week was seeing this mesmerising creation of nature: the lesser florican ( Sypheotides indicus ), the smallest bustard in the world. Unafraid of the monsoons, it dwells in grasslands, ever vigilant with its inky black head and curlicue crests  a feature which instantly made me fall in love with this fascinating bird. The males give memorable performances in order to attract mates and are truly a sight to behold.So there we were, scanning the jowar fields and the fields of moong pulse  fields which were once grasslands. Through the binoculars, at about 300 feet from us, a speck of jet black amidst the verdant green  my first sighting! My hands trembled as I struggled to get a grip on my camera: perhaps the only tool to freeze this moment. And suddenly, it was gone! The bird ducks back into the grass to hide from danger, and then walks  rather quickly  under the plants only to emerge at a different spot. Thus it is a challenge to locate it if one is not paying attention to the moving leaves and branches  the tell-tale sign of the bird in motion.Soon enough, it raised its head again-but seemed nervous: a farmer from far away was approaching. Sensing danger, it flew up in shades of black, brown and white and quickly settled on the other side of the field, again hidden from view. I was lucky to take a picture of it in flight, although its shy face was not visible. But now at least the whereabouts were sure: binoculars up to scan again.This time it was closer: I could see the black head in the green fields with my bare eyes! Excited, I focused my camera lens on the subject  albeit still too far  and captured it in its stillness. Checking the photo, I zoomed in, and through the blurred picture, I saw its inquisitive eyes and beautiful crests. The biggest smile came across my face. I resumed.Ballerinas graceAnd before I could focus the camera again, something marvellous happened: it jumped! Something out of a fairy tale, something miraculous  a rattling sound, an athletic leap, a quick triple flutter of its wings to stay mid air for a fleeting second, and then a quiet free-fall back on the ground.I had finally seen what I had only heard of; the almost fabled antics of this adorable bird. For a second, I forgot my camera, I forgot all sounds, I forgot my existence. There was just that spectacle: the grace of a ballerina and a confidence no words can describe. Only it, no observers, just the observed.I snapped back, sighed and thought  can we do nothing to save this marvel? How powerful we claim to be, how potent, and yet relentlessly the population of this bird falls every year. I held back tears, and decided to attend the present. The black head had ducked, ready to jump. I quickly focussed my camera. And then it jumped: and I clicked once, twice and thrice  capturing its jump at three positions. I zoomed to check: the photos were perfect.And again it jumped. And again it leapt. It went ahead for nearly two dozen jumps in about half an hour so and didnt look exhausted in the least. Gleeful and free, oblivious to any trouble, its heart and joy seemed one  that is what the bird symbolised for me. And that is the memory I carry: a bird of mirth, a bird lesser than none, a bird that begs us to look and to be astounded.There is still time and I believe that with awareness, compassion and active monitoring, we will see that this bird is conserved. We will not risk losing it, and another reason to smile, forever.(The writer is a civil servant with keen interest in nature poetry, wildlife photography, astronomy and egyptology.)"

The city unabashedly again gave proof of this fondness when on Monday, it leafed through history to bake bread that supposedly tastes like the ones that were lost in a volcanic fire some two centuries ago. Loaves of these bread were found inside the remains of a bakery that have surfaced amidst the ruins of Pompeii . On a gastronomical tour of the city, we curate Nawabi, Anglo-Indian, British and Bengali cuisine that Kolkata has retrieved and restored on the food map.When a nawab from Awadh wanted to taste the clouds, his cooks came up with a mystic breakfast called nimish. Just before the break of dawn during winter, they hand-churned whole milk to collect the froth. Once set, it was garnished with saffron and silver tabak etc. According to Sambit Banick, chef and owner of Saffron Tree, Today, one might get it in Lucknow during peak winter season. Some Delhi vendors sell it as Dawlat ki Chaat . In Varanasi, they call it Malaiyo. While reviving it in Kolkata, Sambit made a small glass chamber and pumped in cold and moist air to prepare the froth. Besides the traditional garnishing, mildly-spiced almond dust is added. But we dont use silver tabak to avoid health issues, he added.According to Joymallya Banerjee, chef and co-owner of Bohemian, a lot has happened in Indian kitchens during the British period. While Bengalis use phoron, the British use different herbs. Bagane moshla evolved through the exchange between the Bengalis and the Brits. It is a blend of five herbs  coriander, parsley, mint, celery and dill. It used to be an important ingredient that faded out with time, Joy said, adding that he has prepared a prawn dish in butter sauce with bagane moshla. Colonial period witnessed a lot of crossover cuisines. Butter sauce is an example of that. It can also be used for preparing pabda maachh, he added. Anglo-Indian cuisine that once had a strong presence on Kolkatas food map is slowly fading away. Mutton pantheras, along with ball curry and yellow rice, has taken a back seat. Talking about its history, chef Neelabh Sahay of Novotel said it was introduced during British period and was extremely popular among the army troops. Some argue that pantheras used to be popular at roadside shops of Kolkata too. The royal army used to enjoy it with adrak chai. But what is pantheras? It is minced meat cooked with spices, wrapped in crepe and deep fried, he added. It tastes yummy when served with a dip of ketchup and kasundi!The Indian food graph is dotted with delicacies that originated from royal kitchens. The royal family of Sailana, Madhya Pradesh, is no exception. Maharaja Vikram Singh taught me a few recipes and I was floored. He taught me a korma with barely any spices in it, said Sharad Dewas, executive chef of The Park. But the chef was floored by mutton dahi vada. It is nothing but mutton patties of vada served in chilled yoghurt. The dish is garnished with coriander and other spices and tastes surprisingly good. This is one of the original recipes of Maharaja Digvijay Singh, he added.This comes straight from the kitchen of Sabarna Roy Chowdhurys family. This recipe has travelled centuries. It has potato, peas and cottage cheese. So, I am assuming that this recipe evolved after the Portuguese came to the city, said Sushanta Sengupta, owner and chef of 6 Ballygunge Place . This vegetarian side dish is a perfect match with rice. The style of cooking is a classic example of epar banglar ranna. It is a stuffed item that has multiple layers of mashed potato, green peas and chhana. It is served in a light gravy. It tastes best with mishti keshari bhat along with palong diye moong dal, the chef added.According to author Mani Sankar Mukherji, also known as Sankar: I have read that in Pompeii, there were some 38 bakeries for its 12,000 residents. These were run by local bakers, who held an influential position in society. Bakery was a flourishingbusiness there. Now, a group of Spencers bakers, led by chief chef Arup Dastidar, has reproduced panis quadratus in the city. There was no rolling mill at that time and in all possibility, the wheat was handground. This could be the reason why the percentage of bran was high in those loaves of bread. As a result, these are way more fibrous than the modern-day bread, Arup said. His team is baffled by the amount of water the dough soaked  almost double of the regular dough. As a result, instead of the stipulated 50 minutes, this three-kg bread took us one-and-a-half hours to bake, the chief chef told us. While the three-kg bread was displayed once, their 400-gram versions are available in the market. Meanwhile, these loaves of bread are also made of starter instead of yeast. Starter is wheat mixed with water and left for a few days for fermentation. This fermented mixture is then used. We borrowed the idea and used a bit of starter in our loaves as well,he added.Thakurbarir rannaghor or the kitchen corridor of Tagores family has always been one of the most enigmatic places in our gastronomic heritage. Thakurbaris culinary journey reflects a lot of fusion. Many of the members, including Rabindranath Tagore, were well-travelled. Hence, they have acquired the taste of western cuisine as well. The presence of amshatta, tikki, kebab and several other foods show that it was an experimental kitchen, said chef Partha Roy, who has recently curated a range of items influenced from Thakurbaris kitchen. It is argued that Kobiguru used to enjoy roast chicken. Saheb murgi is an Indian take on western chicken roast. Fowl is roasted after it is marinated with Indian spices, he informed."

Not very surprisingly the larger number of complaints have come from the suburban pockets of the city.For instance, a closer look at these complaints from citizens show that the maximum of them in the last six months have come from areas like Vile Parle (E), Andheri (E), Jogeshwari (E) from where 1403 complaints were received followed by Dadar, parts of Dharavi and Mahim from where 876 complaints have been received and Kurla, Chunabhatti with 796 complaints being received.For civic officials monitoring this website, an unauthorized or illegal construction is any structure that is embedded in the ground. Pointing towards one of the reason for the suburbs receiving a larger volume of complaints as compared to the city areas, a senior civic officer from the encroachment department said, ""There are larger open lands available in the suburban areas as compared to the island city allowing encroachers to have it much easier.""The official further stated that while complaints about vertical unauthorized extensions is much common in the suburbs while in the island city the kind of complaints they receive is much more about internal walls being demolished and amalgamations of two rooms being done.""If its an old load bearing structure, then its a greater problem especially as there are chances of it falling as well, citizens fear,"" said the officer.Data proves this further as in wards in the island city, the number of complaints received in the past six months are comparatively lesser for instance F South ward (Parel, Sewri, Naigaum) --74 complaints, C ward (Bhuleshwar, Pydhonie, Marine Lines) 115 and A ward (Colaba, Fort) with 189.Launched in the year 2016, BMC's web portal http://removalofencroachment.mcgm.gov.in/ is especially meant to allow citizens register their complaints about illegal constructions which is rampant in the financial capital of the country. Civic staff who go on inspections are expected to take photographs of teh site as a matter of record. However as per the website's mandate, no body except the complainant can go back to track the status of the complaint registered.However with the thousands of complaints being received by the civic body of the portal, the civic staff is unable to keep up with inspecting each one of it. Data shows that off the 42,000 complaints which have been recieved, inspections to 12,000 sites is still pending. Yet another hiccup in the system is also that there is no set time period within which action is expected to be taken by the concerned staff leading to complaints piling up.In a meeting held last week, additional municipal commissioner A. L. Jarhad who is in charge of the department instructed civic officials that by the end of the year, 100% inspections should be done while in 60% cases a notice should be served and a report on the same be submitted to him.""We understand that the volume of complaints received is humungous but that cannot be a reason for civic staff to not conduct inspections. Therefore we have set them a target of December by when every site should be visited. Once the visit is completed, a notice is served if the complaint is found to be genuine one, following which a speaking order is passed. Finally demolition action is undertaken. However the problem which arises many times is that the matter is dragged to the court and this delays the action to be taken,"" said Jarhad adding that there has been a greater awareness about the portal as the number of complaints are only on the rise.For instance the total number of complaints the civic body received in the six months period from May --October 2018 has been -9502 while in the same period last year the number of complaints received have been -8331.Civic staff however say that another problem here is also the fact that several complaints are duplicate of the same site.

The Mandsaur police firing that killed five farmers will be reinvestigated if Congress comes to power, it says.For the first time, Congress promises to launch a Ram Van Gaman Path tour to retrace Lord Ram's footprints in MP, pass a law to protect River Narmada and set up a new 'religion and spiritual department'. It also aims to begin commercial production of cow urine and cowdung cakes. Unlike Chhattisgarh, it hasn't called for prohibition but vows to rid MP of 'intoxicants'.To address upper-caste resentment after amendment of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, the Congress Vachan Patra promises a Samanya Varg Ayog or Commission for general categories to address their issues.The manifesto was released at the state Congress headquarters here on Saturday morning by PCC chief Kamal Nath, state election campaign chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, and former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Arun Yadav. Chairman of the manifesto committee Rajendra Singh was also on dais.Congress described it as the voice of people of Madhya Pradesh. There is something for just about everyone  daily wagers, jobless, industrialists, homemakers and even journalists (a law to protect mediapersons), but the focus is clearly on farms and job creation.Kamal Nath told reporters, Congress is not releasing a manifesto for the people of the state. Rather, this is our pledge to bring Madhya Pradesh back on the tracks of development so that farmers can smile, women will feel protected and youth can get employment. In the last 15 years, BJP presented only jumla patras (propaganda deeds) in the name of manifesto and deceived people. Congress is determined to end corruption and mafia rule which starts from villages.Scindia called it a a new morning after 15 years of darkness for farmers, women and youth. Congress has presented its resolution, not just a manifesto, out of the willingness to serve. We have promised progress and development, plus reduction in price of petrol and diesel, justice for slain farmers of Mandsaur and distribution of free laptops to meritorious students in every district. Women will be given priority during recruitment in police force. Industry will be promoted so jobs are created. And all this will be implemented with a specified time limit.Apart from agricultural loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh, Congress promises 50% waiver on electric bills for agrarian sector, grant of Rs 51,000 for marriage of young women, and salary subsidy of Rs 10,000 to firms to encourage employment generation and investment. The manifesto assures passing a law for right to housing. Rest houses will be built every 15km along the Naramda Parikrama route.The Vachan Patra says that if Congress comes to power, it will bring transparency in recruitments and appointments and Vyapam  which has been in the eye of a storm for eight years  will be shut down. Congress alleges the BJP governments involvement in Vyapam irregularities.Congress manifesto promises more than the BJP governments policies at the Centre and state. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan promised bonus on grains like wheat and dal, Congress promises to give bonus to farmers on practically every major crop grown in the state  wheat, paddy, jowar, bajra, corn, soybean, mustard, cotton, arhar, moong, gram and masoor, urad, garlic, onions, tomatoes and sugarcane. The Narendra Modi government in Delhi gave LPG connections to the poor through Ujjwala Yojana, and Congress promises Rs 100 subsidy per cylinder. It plans to raise social security pension from Rs 300 per month to Rs 1,000.We are going to the people with a new thought process, to give the state a new direction, said LOP Ajay Singh."

After the garlic price crashed to Rs. 5 a kg this year, Meena, 38, lost all hopes of repaying his Rs. 25-lakh debts.Meena produced 2,500 tonnes of garlic on 20 bighas of land, which included rented fields, near Brij Nagar village, 30 km from Kota. The bumper crop created a glut, leading to the price crash.After his death, the eldest of his four daughters was sent to her aunts house for completing her education. Others face an uncertain future. His mother, Ramnathi Bai, 60, hopes that Meenas two brothers would take care of the family.The younger brother Anirudh told The Hindu that Rs. 18 lakh of the loans was taken through the Kisan Credit Card. A private bank was sending notices on the Rs. 5-lakh tractor loan. The lenders will start knocking on the familys door after winter.Desperate effortsMr. Anirudh said Meena had got himself registered under the market intervention scheme of the Rajasthan State Cooperative Marketing Federation, but his turn to sell the produce was taking a long time. He sold some of the harvest at the local market to pay off labourers, but it only added to the huge losses.The federation procured garlic at the fixed market intervention price of Rs. 3,257 for 100 kg for a month-and-a-half.Meena is among the five farmers who died in the Hadoti region of south-east Rajasthan this year following the heavy losses incurred after growing garlic. The agrarian distress has equally affected the producers of onion, mustard, soya bean, urad and moong in Kota, Baran, Jhalawar and Bundi districts.The police and the government have denied that the farmers deaths were due to debt burden or crop losses. The farmers are particularly angry with Sangod MLA Heeralal Nagar, who reportedly said the deaths were being projected as suicides to claim compensation.Mr. Anirudh alleged that Mr. Nagar had wrongly claimed that he had visited their family to condole with them. Mr. Nagar has been fielded once again as the BJP candidate from Sangod in the partys list released on Sunday.With very few farmers qualifying for the State governments loan waiver scheme applicable only for debt from cooperative banks, the farmers problems defy a solution.The Congress has alleged that 92 farmers died from suicide across the State since the BJP came to power in 2013. Three of the four who so died in the Hadoti region were from Baran district.The local suicide helpline, Hope Helpline, in Kota can be reached at 0744-4333666."

The Naamdaar does not know what smoke is. He doesnt know how the wood stove burns. In my childhood, I have seen my mother cook on a wooden stove and water in her eyes. I have seen it, and this has inspired me to introduce Ujjwala Yojana, he said.The Marwar region of the state has 10 Assembly seats. Nagaur is considered the heartland of farming and Jats dominate here politically, influencing over 40 Assembly seats across the state. In his speech, Modi pitched that his party men understood the needs of farmers better than the Congress and Rahul Gandhi.The life you spend is the same as mine. Neither you were born with a golden spoon nor am I born with it. The poor mans misery is known to the person who rises from among them. Those who are born with a golden spoon, they do not even know the pain of a thorn getting stuck to their feet while walking barefoot in fields, he added.He also hit out at Gandhi over the Congress presidents remarks on Monday that his great grandfather Jawahar Lal nehrus caste, Kaul Dattatreya was also his. Modi said if Sardar Vallabhai Patel had been the prime minister at the time, the condition of farmers would have been much better. If Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, farmers would be happy today. If the first Prime Minister of India had been a son of a farmer, then the situation would be different today. Patel had fought with Gandhiji for the rights of the farmers... because he knew the troubles of the farmer and agriculture, he said.The PM added that if voted to power, the BJP government would implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee and that both the state and Central governments are constantly working on double farmers incomes. The Minimum Support Price for crops would be hiked by 1.5 times, he added.I congratulate the Vasundhara government. They have tried to bring irrigation water to 1.5 lakh hectares of land in Rajasthan, he said.Farmers in the state have been protesting for a long time about increasing debt, rising costs and low MSPs. Although the government did waive off loans of upto R50,000, the anger among the community is a concern for the saffron party.Reacting to the PMs allegations Congress election committee chief and MP from Ajmer, Raghu Sharma, hit back saying, The entire country knows that due to the incompetence of the Vasundhara Raje Government, 150 self-respecting farmers of Rajasthan has had to resort to suicide. Now that the Congress has announced that they will waive off farmer loans in 10 days, the BJP is exasperated and talking rubbish."

Addressing an election rally in the state, Shah referred to the report and alleged Vadra received commissions after a loan of thousands of crores of rupees was sanctioned to a big company.A company got a loan of thousands of crores and its commission reached the Nehru family's son-in-law within a few months, with which he bought 150 hectares of land in Bikaner at a throwaway price and then sold it for a higher price. I want to ask Rahul Gandhi if he can answer now, Shah said at Nagaur.At a time when Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly targeted the ruling party for failing to manage ballooning NPAs of public sector banks, BJP latched on to the report to try and corner Congress for its vulnerability to corruption and nepotism.Chronicling the details of the Bikaner land deal at a press conference here, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, Corruption and Congress are synonymous. This naamdaar parivar has one big farmer and his name is Robert Vadra. Grabbing land belonging to farmers, building an empire of corruption on that land...is what the Gandhi family, Vadra and the Congress are good at.Continuing his attack Patra said, ""Robert Vadra is a tainted 'naamdar'. His land scam model is world famous. He set up Skylight with a seed capital of Rs 1 lakh. He then bought land at rock bottom rates with other peoples money, changed land utilization, and then sold the land at 7 times, 10 times, 20 times the price, pocketing crores.Patra said he was quoting PM Narendra Modi in saying Rahul doesnt know how to differentiate between moong and masoor (dals). Vadra, while claiming farm land, wasnt growing any crop other than money.BJP has used Vadra to attack the Gandhi family, retaliating to Rahul Gandhis bid to target Modi on the Rafale deal. BJP has maintained that Rahuls stand against the deal was motivated by Dassaults refusal to entertain the role of Sanjay Bhandari, a defence middle man, who the party says, has business links with Vadra."

Zeenath, who whipped up this delicacy at The Hindu s Our State Our Taste cookery contest, organised in association with Andhra Pradesh Tourism at Mangalagiri on Saturday, perhaps has Dangeti Dharma Rao, the creator of this dish, to thank.I like trying new dishes and this particular dish, I saw it in the YouTube, she says, clueless about how Rao fiddled around with various ingredients to make this sinfully delicious halwa decades ago, the recipe of which was later disseminated and lapped up by people fond of wielding the ladle.I soaked the wheat and ground it to make wheat milk. I then boiled it along with jaggery syrup and ghee till the wheat milk turned into a halwa and garnished it with cashew and almonds, Ms. Zeenath shared the recipe even as people in the vicinity scooped out large portions from the bowl on the table before she knew it.Even after a century, the melt-in-the-mouth dish has not lost its original flavour that continues to tantalise the senses of people with sweet tooth.Nagalakshmi combined prawns with chintakaya (raw tamarind) to create a perfect taste liked instantly by the two-member jury. The chintakaya-royyalu curry was declared the second best and Sujitas kobbari palu annam (rice cooked with coconut milk) received the third prize.The penultimate episode of the preliminary round of the contest caravan that travelled across 11 mandals each in Krishna and Guntur districts saw 165 participants presenting diverse flavours at the Srimathi Nannapaneni Lakshmi Kalyana Mandapam in Mangalagiri.Authentic dishesIt was out-of-the-box recipe of Pravalika who made halwa with tegalu (tender palm shoots) and regipallu pachchadi (Indian plum chutney) that got her a consolation prize.Another consolation prize went to Vijayalakshmi for her dish patchi royyalu kura (prawn curry).The tilt of the judges, M. Damodar and K. Rajender Reddy, was clearly towards participants who kept their dishes simple. We are looking at traditional authentic dishes with high nutritional value, said Mr. Damodar.P. Mallikarjun Kumar, the lone male contestant, waited eagerly to explain the recipe of his dish coconut khova liberally sprinkled with cashew and badam.Pasta payasam, pesara pappu (green gram) gulab jamun, ragi puttu, kanda-bachchali attu, gummadi aviri pulusu, puchchakaya halwa and chilakada dumpa poornalu were some of the unique delicacies that vied for the top honours.The myriad flavours were generated in myriad ways. From the chopping to the plating of the food, the ingredients were grated, grilled, layered, levelled, melted or poured. Some involved scrambling, slicing, stirring, dipping and frying. But each dish was worth the effort that went into it.The show was powered by the Butterfly Group, in association with RKG Ghee and Oil and rice partner Fortune.

Water shortage and the resultant bad crop conditions in some parts of the state may lead to a significant escalation of prices in the wholesale market, which will push the retail prices up as well.Already prices of rice varieties have gone up by 5% and they may go up further by 10%-15%, Dhaval Shah, the director of Jairaj Group in Market Yard, told TOI. There is a strong possibility that pulses like chana, tur, urad and moong may increase by Rs7-Rs10 in the wholesale market over the next 15-20 days, he said. Shah added the new rice varieties  produced during kharif  are usually cheaper than old rice varieties. But this time, the difference isnt significant. In some basmati varieties, the price of the new produce is higher. We expect the prices of new rice produce to further rise by 10-15%, he addedNitin Nahar, a wholesaler and the director of the Federation of Associations of Maharashtra , said prices of all types of pulses have increased by Rs 3 to Rs 6 in the last 15-20 days. The price rise has begun to translate into an increase in the retail prices as well, he said and added that produce coming into the wholesale market is from the recent kharif season, which saw 30% dip in production.The per kg retail price of urad dal, which was Rs64 during Darasa, has reached Rs72, said Hanuman Unecha , a retailer on SB Road.

It also said an amount of Rs 10,720 crore, representing the value of notes which has not been paid as on June 30, 2018, has been removed from the balance of notes issued and transferred to other liabilities and provisions.demonetisation +IL&FS issue +RBI vs government: 10 flash points between Centre and central bank What is unusual about the current standoff is the number of issues it has spilt over to and the length of time it has gone on for. Interest rate, the perpetual point of sparrings, has been overtaken by several other turf wars. Among other issues are dividend payment, February 12 restructuring, regulation of public sector banks, reserves, board appointments etc.From Arvind to Krishnamurthy: Subramanian named new chief economic adviser Krishnamurthy Subramanian holds a PhD from Chicago Universitys Booth School of Business and one of his guides was none other than Raghuram Rajan. Subramanian, who is a prolific writer, backed had demonetisation, terming it as revolutionary.Former chief economic adviseris in India to launch his book, Of Counsel: The Challenges of the Modi-Jaitley Economy. He spoke toon a host of issues. Excerpts:How do you describe 86% reduction in cash? Draconian is a connotation of being severe and it was meant to be bold and severe. If you take away 86% (cash) nobody would you call it mild, or soft? The important point there, which all of you seemed to have missed, is what I was saying was that there is a big puzzle here. I am implying almost opposite of what people are saying. The puzzle is that the action, severe, extreme, draconian, whatever you want to call it (was taken) but impact on GDP was muted.I want to ask more important questions aboutas economic policy and politics of taking action. What should we learn from demonetisation? To me it is part of a worldwide phenomenon. Why do people apparently vote against their safe interest? In the US why do white male voters vote for Trump and the Republicans? This was a kind of extreme case of that because if you believed, as all of us do, a lot of hardship was imposed on the informal sector. If that was the case why was it almost rewarded by the same people (in the UP elections)? To me it says if the costs are broad based, its easier to take that action than if the costs are imposed on a few. So, it is more difficult to take on narrow vested interests, rich farmers, unions but it seems like it is easier to impose hardship on a lot of people and we need to get into the heart of that. So, that was the political puzzle, the economic puzzle is it that we dont understand how cash works. Is it that we are completely mis-measuring GDP? Is it that actually the Indian economy is very resilient that in ways we dont know? Thats why I think these are the questions that we will have to understand.I say in the book this is not a kiss and tell memoir. I say in the book that all that is for gossip columnists, Twitter trolls and TV anchors with multi-screen TV pundits, who say no more than two people at the same time!Its all context specific. Its something that countries have to decide for themselves.By definition the objectives are different. So, there has to be disagreement and creative tension. But all that has to be against a deeper background of trust, communication and independence. I used to speak out against Raghu (Rajan). I had to speak up in order to move the debate. I was very happy that I did that but I could do it because the basic understanding was there. You can disagree with people whom you respect. They (RBI) have broadly done a very good job but in the last seven-eight years, the financial system oversight has been a major concern. Then, there has been the. Suddenly, out of the blue, a Rs 90,000 crore blow hits you and nobody knows. We just need to get back to the drawing board and say look all of us have been complicit in various aspects of this and how we can move forward. We need to think seriously about reform, which is privatisation (of banks).On the Prompt Correction Action framework (for weak banks) I am very much of the view that it is a very sound way to find a solution  its like a YV Reddy kind of solution. The new thing that I am calling now is the asset quality review of the NBFCs. While I have criticised the RBI for oversight, the asset quality review did play a very useful role. Ever since 2012-13 we have all known the NPA problem is much bigger than people were claiming it to be. My beef with RBI is why didnt it start earlier? The government has to allow the PCA framework to continue, we need to think more seriously about public asset construction agency (PARA), the Bank Nationalisation Act and what we do with the power (sector).RBI should put the money only for recapitalisation of public sector banks, conditional on all the reforms being undertaken, otherwise it is money down the black hole. I started the excess reserves view a few years. I am pretty confident that it is Rs 4-4.5 lakh crore. Its a reasonably big number. It should not be used for general financing of the deficit because that would be raiding the RBI and it should be done cooperatively. The government has to be careful. Politicising the board, anything that kind of chips away at that fundamental autonomy, independence that should be maintained but equally I think that on the part of RBI, independence does not mean no consultation, no cooperation, no communication.This is kind of, at least at a perception level, you are getting into territory where people think some basic arrangements are being tampered with and institutions are being encroached upon. Its not in anyones interest to go down that road and the government has drawn back.First, best wishes. Its the best job I have ever done or will ever do. Build teams, forge relationships with everyone in government. Be absolutely independent-minded in thinking, certainly the finance minister wants to hear independent views. We must not compromise on the quality of analysis. Having a good relationship with the finance minister  having his trust and confidence and ear. In terms of issues, the financial system is his play, agriculture is going to be a real challenge and keeping a very high quality of macroeconomic analysis is very important, the current account, oil, keep track of all this."

The area under Rabi cultivation has shrunk so bad that the price of jowar (a quintessential millet used in Marathi kitchens to make) has shot up by 25 per cent, and is expected to go up further as summer approaches.With the yield of Kharif crop down by 20 per cent the price of pulses such as moong, udid, toor and jowar are already on the escalation path. In addition to this the sowing ofhas gotten contained to only 28 per cent of the land demarcated for it in the districts of Pune, Solapur and Ahmednagar, informed officials at the Agriculture department. Out of the 17 lakh hectares of land meant for Rabi crop, sowing has happened in only five lakh hectares, they elaborated.This is being attributed to the drought and the less rainfall recorded last. As such these are drought-prone areas that receive merely 500 mm of rainfall. The drought has reduced the sowing of jowar, wheat and maize. While sowing of jowar has come down to just 31 per cent of the land it is usually cultivated on, wheat has shrunk to 15 per cent and maize to 26 per cent. Other pulses have deployed only eight per cent of the land meant for them, said Dilip Zende, divisional joint director (Pune division). What is worse the standing jowar crop has also started drying up due to lack of water at many talukas of these districts, he added.Cultivation of other crops such as gram, sesame, onion, sunflower, flax seed andhave also been similarly hit. Currently the Kharif crop is being harvested and the early reports indicate that the yield will be down by 10-20 per cent, depending on the variety of the crop. This is expected to go up by the time the final reports arrive, the official said.Jowar grows on residual moisture from the monsoon but the situation is grim this year. Not only has the sowing gone down, the ground condition does not augur well even for the standing crop, that have already started drying up, Zende noted. He warned that Rabi yield will not fare any better than that of the Kharif.Dadasaheb Sapre, deputy joint director, said that the situation being witnessed this year is unprecedented. There were earlier instances of less sowing or crops drying during droughts, but large portions of land being left out of the sowing is very rare, he observed. He also pointed out that less jowar production will also mean less fodder for cattle in summer."

According to the rules, a survey has to be undertaken every 10 years.There has been a delay in conducting the survey due to various reasons. Now with the pilot survey already in place, remaining parts of the state can also be taken up, said senior officials.As per officials, 1,738 new properties were included in the pilot survey, which was conducted using maps and details from the waqf board. Of these, 1,465 were from Pune and 273 from Parbhani.When the last survey was held in 2002, Pune and Parbhani had a total of 1,189 and 153 properties, respectively, excluding cantonment areas. The new survey was meant to identify the properties donated through fresh waqf deeds. Of the new properties, there were five encroachments on Pune properties, while it was 15 for Parbhani, as per sources.Officials from the district collectorate and the settlement commissionerate stated that they would carry out the remaining survey in all other districts in the state. The survey was essential as many of the prime land parcels face encroachments and it would be a humungous task to remove these, said an official.A social activist said the waqf properties were always there but were encroached upon and now with the detailed survey, the actual numbers have emerged. It is after pursuing the matter with the officials that a true picture has finally emerged, said the activist.In Pune, the number of newly identified waqf lands stood at 1,636.69 hectares, with the highest 41 properties spread over 470 hectares being detected in Baramati taluka, 140 properties spread over 297 hectares were found in Shirur, while just four properties, spread over 1.06 hectares, were found in Bhor district.State government statistics revealed that Maharashtra has around 93,418 acres of waqf land with 23,566 registered properties.

And helping the sparse audience present to relive the memories of Pu La as he is popularly known were Marathi stage and television actors Atul Parchure, Vighnesh Joshi and Arun Nalawade.Visiting the works of PL Deshpande is like performing a cultural pilgrimage, said Deepali Kelkar, who anchored the event. Describing Deshpande as an amalgamation of Charlie Chaplin, Rabindranath Tagore and Vasantrao Deshpande, Kelkar said, He was like a flower whose each petal had a different shape, colour and fragrance.Bringing alive the genius of PL was actor Parchure who has the distinction of playing the character of Pu La in his presence. I heard that I had been shortlisted for a role in the play but which one I didnt know and was fortunate to get to play the man himself, said the actor who has worked in Deshpandes immortal classics like Varya Varchi Varat and Vyakti ani Valli.Describing his writings as evergreen which still retain their freshness, Parchure said, The manner in which he spoke and the way he expressed his thoughts was extremely witty.Referring to Deshpandes humungous sense of humour, Vignesh narrated a conversation between Deshpande and Madgulkar. Once Madgulkar, who was visiting Deshpande, picked up a letter from outside his house which was marked PL Deshpande, Pune. To this, Deshpande remarked, this address brings letters, the complete one brings in guest.Underlining the genius of Deshpande as a music director, a few of the songs composed by him like Kausalyecha Ram and He koni cheile taar were also presented Ninad Ajgaonkar, Ketaki Bhave Joshi and Gauri Damle.Actor Arun Nalawade, who had a close association with Deshpande, described his writings and compositions as brilliant. He used simple words, his thoughts were straight but the manner in which he put them together always had a powerful impact on the reader or listener, Nalawade said, while reading out a letter Deshpande had written to his friends newly-wed son Ashok Adarkar."

Crops like black, green grams, sorghum, chillies and other crops were affected by poor rainfall.There was no rainfall in the last 40 days. Though there was good rainfall early making farmers happy, there was very little rain after sowing, says A. Varatharajan, president, Karisal Bhumi Farmers Association. The monsoon failed before the crops could bear fruit. As a result, crops could not sustain growth, he said. Birds from the Western Ghats and other areas have been flocking here and eating some of the crops causing more damage.K.P. Arumugam, district secretary, Tamil Nadu Farmers Association, said that crops with low gestation period would give a decent yield while other crops have not grown well. A number of crops like sorghum, pearl millet and maize would be harvested after the Pongal. Black and green gram crops are being harvested now.When the Village Administrative Officers started their indefinite strike with a charter of demands across Tamil Nadu a few days ago, it was announced that Assistant Agriculture Officers and Assistant Horticulture Officers would issue cultivation certificates, instead of adangal certificates, to avail crop insurance. Awareness of the latest announcement should be created since a very short period is available, said Mr. Varadharajan.January 15, 2019 is the last date to avail crop insurance for maize, sorghum, pearl millet, black and green grams, groundnut, sesame and sunflower crops.According to officials, only 341.06 m.m., out of an average rainfall of 429.4 m.m. from north-east monsoon, has been recorded. A total of 542.99 m.m. out of 662.2 m.m. annual average rainfall has been received. With only a few days to go, 2018 is likely to be a rainfall deficit year.Farmers pin their hope that the crop insurance would compensate some of the loss incurred."

Many in the Tamil-majority area, across Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar, Vavuniya and Jaffna, were yet to fully recover from the harsh drought over the past few years when the unexpected, heavy showers ravaged their villages.According to data provided by the Disaster Management Centre on Saturday, nearly 1,25,000 persons from 40,000 families have been affected over the last week. Several of them were forced to leave their homes and are staying at welfare camps. Relief work is on but the floods have left a huge trail of destruction  to homes, property and livestock that supported many low-income families. The island has become increasingly vulnerable to flash floods, going by their recurrence in recent years. In the summer of 2017, the southern districts witnessed one of the worst floods in Sri Lanka, setting off landslips and claiming over 200 lives.In the recent instance in the war-affected northern region, Kilinochchi district is the worst affected, official figures show. Nearly 55,000 people have been badly hit and as many as 1,800 families are in relief centres, where district authorities provide cooked meals, essentials and basic medication. The call for aid from the rest of the country is growing. We will know the real extent of damage only when the people return to their homes. Six committees have been formed to come up with the damage assessment, said Suntharam Arumainayaham, Kilinochchi Government Agent (senior most administrative officer corresponding to the District Collector in India). Over the last few years, Kilinochchi, one of the main paddy producers in the country, was struggling to cope with a severe drought. To help the people to manage to some extent, we were providing relief and, in some cases, livestock. The recent flash floods have washed out most of their cattle, he told The Hindu .Livelihoods, the biggest challengeThe damage to paddy land has been significant and Chena cultivation, or the production of other food crops  including green gram, peanuts and potatoes  that sustains thousands of small scale farmers has been badly hit. The biggest challenge facing us is livelihoods. Over the last few years  in the drought and now the floods, they have been severely hit. For the people to come out of this, we have to address this challenge, Mr. Arumainayaham added.President Maithripala Sirisena has directed officials to give an immediate relief of LKR 10,000 (About Rs. 3,850) per family for restoring their damaged houses. After the extent of damage is ascertained, an amount of up to LKR 2,50,000 (roughly Rs. 96,500) is to be distributed. For the nearly 8,000 acres of paddy land that was destroyed, a compensation amount of LKR 40,000 (about Rs. 15,500) per acre will be given, an official statement said. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Friday visited the affected areas to assess the impact. However, the resurrection of livelihoods may need a long-term strategy from the leaders.
