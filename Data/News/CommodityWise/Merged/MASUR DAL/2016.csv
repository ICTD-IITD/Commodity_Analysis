V Manjula, principal secretary , IT BT and S&T department, flagged off the run. More than 500 stu dents and 50 athletes will carry the torch across the streets of Mysuru to propagate the cause. The torch symbolising knowledge will reach St. Philomena's College in Mysuru, where principal Dr Krishne Gowda will take forward the drive.The journey will culminate into a final event at the University of Mysore, the venue for the 103rd Indian Science Congress, where general president Dr Ashok Kumar Saxena and vicechancellor, UOM, K S Rangappa will receive the torch-bearers.The torch will remain lit at the Pride of India Expo (POI), meant to inspire thousands of students to take an oath to contribute to science.UOM will project its heritage to PM Narendra Modi and delegates at the Congress. The varsity, which is celebrating its centenary, will map its development through the theme song it had produced to commemorate its 100th year. Noted music director Hamsalekha, who composed the song, will lead the pack of musicians rendering the fourstanza poem at the inaugural session of the ISC. Modi will inaugurate the session at an amphitheatre, expected to be packed with scientists from across the nation and abroad. Sources said Hamsalekha has agreed to present the centenary theme song penned by 10 noted persons from different fields. The varsity will present a bust of Mysuru maharaja Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar to Modi during the inauguration.The five-day event will not only enhance science knowledge but also tickle the delegates' taste buds, with chefs all set to dish up a variety of fare.

One ate vegetarian food or enjoyed meat. Some ate both, but by default, became non-vegetarians. Eating non-veg food was a binary variable, either 0 or 1. Even if you ate it once a week, it still made you non-vegetarian.Vegetarians did not bother what their other halves ate  chicken, mutton, fish or anything else. Almost like there is no meaning in asking vegetarians whether they ate beans, carrot or ash gourd. Each enjoyed their food and if you didnt want to eat what they did, you simply moved away. If the sight of meat repulsed you, just got up and sat in the next table. Vegetarian children were taught not to screw up faces or make disgusting sounds when encountered with non-veg dishes or a mention of them. To each his own, they were told.I have been a strict vegetarian for the past 48 years but had many friends who ate only non-veg and perhaps, one dish of a vegetable. I have seen non-veg food, meat being cooked, fish being cleaned and remnants of a non-veg meal.Initially, it was a great effort to eat alongside a non-vegetarian but slowly I learnt to ignore it. I couldnt, however, ignore invitations to parties and gatherings just because non-veg food was being served. But, the concept of same ladles and spoons being used for both types of dishes rankled in my mind, and so I learnt to eat only salads and curd. I learnt to smile when a strong smell of kebabs being cooked assailed my nostrils by looking at my hosts friendly smile.I leant to appreciate when my non-veg friends from different faiths invited veg people for dinner and non-veg people for lunch so that everyone was comfortable. I also liked it when, in weddings, people had separate dining halls for veg and non veg people. I loved it when non-vegetarians visited my house and appreciatively enjoyed a meal of lentils and boiled vegetables. I have welcomed people of different faiths and food preferences into my family and learned to tolerate their culinary tastes.I can never forget the day when I stepped into an eating joint started by my student, who fondly handed me a bowl of what I thought was twisted vermicelli. It looked yummy with vegetables and capsicums. This is shrimp stir-fry he said with pride and I almost choked.I could not bring myself to even look at it but I didnt want to dampen his enthusiasm by declaring by vegetarian status. I will eat in leisure and enjoy every morsel. You go ahead and take care of others, I told him and rushed out.I spotted a little girl in tattered clothes, peeping in with hungry eyes. Here, this is for you, but eat fast! I said. She literally snatched the bowl from my hand and gobbled it in a jiffy. Her bright eyes and angelic smile made my evening. The food was amazing, especially the shrimp dish! I said as I waved goodbye to my host, grateful that I had made two people happy by not revealing my veg status."

Towering mejis and bhela ghars erected in open fields in the rural parts of the state are the traditional telltale signs of the harvest festival - both are deep rooted at the subcultural level and mirror religious significance.One can notice a flurry of activity in the villages around this time. Young men spend days together in building Mejis and bhela ghars. The bhela ghars are designed on iconic Ahom monuments.A thin line of difference exists between the two and its technical connotation varies from upper to lower Assam. Some prefer to put the two in the same category, but to a few others there are differences. The difference is stark between those made in upper and lower Assam.Bhela ghar is a temporary night shelter, used as a community feast hall, made of thatch, bamboo, straws, dried leaves and others, said Anil Saikia, an academic and culture exponent.It is an object of visual pleasure on uruka or the night before Bihu. It has immense cultural significance.Encased in rustic design that is simple but robust, a bhela ghar can accommodate a couple of people who opt to spend the uruka night inside it.As men devote time in building bhela ghars, the women put their best gastronomical skills to test, focusing on the community feast for uruka night and the main gourmet meal on Bihu.Bhela ghars are build mostly in the open space, a dried paddy field provides a safe option as it is burnt in full spirit on Bihu.Meji, on the other hand, is mostly made from wood, bamboo, straw, hay and with dried banana leaves, heaped on the fields.Some communities believe that a Meji is a representation of the funeral pyre of the godfather of the Panadavas and Kauravas from the Mahabharata.The custom is, after taking a bath people crowd around the meji and lit it with a bamboo flame. They pay their obeisance and seek blessings from the holy pyre. They then offer peetha, lentils, sesame, and sweets. to the holy fire.The Rajbongshis, Rabhas and Dimasas believe that a burning meji is a representation of the funeral pyre of Bhishma.Paying obeisance on Bihu is an important part of Bihu, said Upen Rabha Hakcham, academician, associated with Gauhati University."

After easing interest rates aggressively last year, the RBI is likely to wait for cues from the budget and the depreciation of Chinese yuan on India's trade performance.New Delhi fears a further depreciation of yuan could lead to flight of capital from emerging markets like India.Finance minister Arun Jaitley will present his 2016/17 budget at the end of February. Officials say he could raise the service tax to nearly 16 per cent from 14.5 per cent, further pushing up prices.Bhanumurthy said retail inflation was likely to remain in the range of 5-6 per cent for next few months though the rural distress would contain demand. ""The RBI could wait and watch for some more time,"" he said."
5903c6cc7be9e02646bd7d50,Desperation greets aid convoys in Syrian cities,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/522755/desperation-greets-aid-convoys-syrian.html,2016-01-12,"Anne Barnard and Somini Sengupta Jan 13, 2016, INYT 23:59 ISTMalnutrition has worsened in Madaya, a beseiged town, where people have been collapsing of hungerThe first trucks from a convoy carrying food and medical aid entered the besieged Syrian town of Madaya on Monday, only to discover harrowing scenes of desperation, including 400 people who needed immediate medical evacuation, UN officials said Monday night.The 400 were in the town hospital, and included patients who were severely malnourished and were facing other medical complications, the UN emergency relief coordinator, Stephen OBrien, said after briefing members of the Security Council. They are in grave peril of losing their lives, he said.The delivery of food packages, which included rice, lentils and oil, came amid a growing international outcry over the increasing number of deaths from malnutrition in Madaya, which along with neighbouring Zabadani, is besieged by pro-government forces, including the Lebanese militia group Hezbollah.The aid shipment there was being coordinated with a similar delivery to the northern Syrian towns of Fouaa and Kfarya in Idlib province, which are surrounded by Syrian insurgent groups.After a last-minute flurry of negotiations as the convoys idled at the entrances to the towns, trucks and sport utility vehicles began rolling in, Pawel Krzysiek, a spokesman for the Syria branch of the International Committee of the Red Cross, said by text message from Madaya. Unloading was expected to last through the night, he said on Twitter.Aid workers continued to unload the trucks in the dark, using flashlights and cellphone lights, since the town had no electricity.Crowds of hungry kids around, Sajjad Malik, the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees representative for Syria said in a text message released by the agency. Its heartbreaking to see so many hungry people. Its cold and raining but there is excitement because we are here with food and blankets.Um Majid, a nurse at a field hospital, said the mother of a desperately ill 8-year-old girl begged relief workers to take her to a hospital in Damascus, but they said they could not.Khaled Mohammad, a nurse anesthetist working in a clinic in Madaya supported by Doctors Without Borders, said weak and collapsing patients had continued to pour in to the health centre as people gathered to receive the aid, which he said included fava beans, sugar, hummus and canned tomatoes.OBrien said that getting the 400 people out of Madaya could be as complicated as getting the aid in. Negotiations would be conducted with the government of President Bashar Assad and other armed groups for guarantees that ambulances would become targets.Despite the arrival of the aid, and plans for new peace talks on January 25 in Geneva, spasms of violence continued on Monday, with an airstrike on a school killing at least a dozen children.UN diplomats and international aid officials welcomed news of the delivery, but coupled it with a plea for unimpeded access as international law requires. One convoy will not solve the problem, said Stphane Dujarric, a spokesman for UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.For months, aid to Madaya and Zabadani has been the subject of delicate negotiations toward an agreement known as the four-towns pact. Under the agreement, some aid was delivered in October, and last month, several hundred wounded fighters and their families were evacuated.Since then, plans for more aid and evacuations have stalled, and malnutrition has worsened in Madaya, where, according to interviews with a dozen residents as well as with humanitarian workers assisting a clinic there, people have been collapsing of hunger as they try to subsist on things like grass soup.Madaya is controlled by Syrian insurgents, mainly affiliated with an Islamist group called Ahrar al-Sham, which has been the main interlocutor with Hezbollah and its patron Iran in talks to reach cease-fires to help the towns.Five people died of suspected malnutrition in Madaya on Sunday alone, bringing the total since the beginning of December to 28, according to medics at the Doctors Without Borders clinic.Nisrine, a schoolteacher trapped in Madaya who for safety reasons asked that her surname not be used, said she and her son, Abdullah, 10, were waiting eagerly for the aid but that she was sure it would not last long.Nisrine said two people, an adult and a child, died there Monday even as the convoy was approaching. Samer Rajab, an activist helping in the aid effort said three people had died in Madaya and a third in Zabadani. People are exhausted, Nisrine said. They cant even go to wait for the trucks. Theres not much time. The food should be distributed today.The siege of Madaya, which is surrounded by land mines, snipers and barbed wire, is only the latest that Syrians have endured  despite Security Council resolutions insisting on the unconditional delivery of aid across front lines.Cut off from the worldThe UN says that 400,000 Syrians are in besieged areas or in areas that are hard to reach, with the largest number, 200,000, trapped by Islamic State militants in the east. Nearly 200,000 are penned in by the government and allied forces and several thousand more by Syrian insurgent groups, mainly in Fouaa and Kfarya.The convoys on Monday included deliveries from UNICEF and the World Food Program-me, along with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent, the local Red Cross affiliate that takes part in all international aid convoys in Syria. The World Food Programme has said it planned to bring enough food to feed 40,000 in Madaya and 20,000 in Fouaa and Kfarya for a month.Hezbollah, in statements last week, accused insurgent forces in Madaya of hoarding food. The statements also accused the insurgents of not allowing civilians to leave. And on Monday afternoon, the Syrian ambassador to the United Nations, Bashar al-Jaafari denounced what he called efforts to defame his government with reports of starvation deaths in Madaya.He offered two seemingly contradictory explanations. He said the images were fabricated, citing a photograph of one child who he said was Lebanese, not Syrian. He also said aid delivered to Madaya had been stolen by terrorist groups and sold to civilians at prices they could not afford.Terrorists are stealing humanitarian assistance, al-Jaafari told reporters outside the Security Council chambers.OBrien, however, said UN officials could see for themselves the extent of hunger. There has been very severe malnourishment. Theres severe shortage of food and we have reports of people who are either starving or indeed have starved and died, he said. As for Abdullah, Nisrine said that he fell asleep before he received any food: He got tired and disappointed while waiting, the trucks arrived so late."

This has long been the standard for most schools in India, where children learn both national languages (English and Hindi) and often their regional language. Americans are now following suit in raising children to be bilingual or even trilingual.So, why do we seek to learn languages other than our mother tongue? Why spend hours memorising the genders of new nouns, different verb conjugations and how to pronounce letters in a new alphabet? Each person has his/her own answer to this question. Whether it is to communicate with a beloved grandparent, to stay competitive in a global market or simply to increase your knowledge.However, it is essential to learn the culture in tandem with the language you are learning as well. We need to understand culture in order to get the perspective of native speakers, understand the history of the language so we can visit the region in which that language is spoken.In the initial stages of learning a language, it is overwhelming enough to learn the basics such as the alphabet, vocabulary and verb tenses. At that point, being able to write and speak in coherent, grammatically correct sentences is an accomplishment in itself.But becoming an advanced beginner or intermediate student of a language requires more than just being able to county to twenty, name colours/ animals and introducing yourself. It requires you to see the language from the viewpoint of a native speaker, and for that, you need to learn the culture.According to Katherine Surko, her experience in studying Hindi at Washington University in Saint Louis has been fantastic. In September, I knew may be half the alphabet tops, but now I am able to read and write whole paragraphs, which is well beyond what I thought I would be able to accomplish within a year. It is so exciting for me to be able to see such tangible progress, and it makes me really excited for new levels I will reach within the upcoming years. I enjoy the holistic approach our class takes from focusing on writing to speaking to having scattered events throughout the semester, and I look forward to continuing my Hindi studies in the fall in order to meet both my personal and professional goals.Knowing traditions and values better allows us to understand the idioms. An idiom is an expression whose meaning is not predictable from the usual meanings of its constituent elements, or from the general grammatical rules of a language. Idioms are used in every language but often seem foreign to non-native speakers because they cannot be translated directly. Understanding their usage requires a certain amount of exposure to the language as well as insight into the culture.Take for example, the Hindi phrase Khichdi pakaana. Literally translated to English, it means to make khichdi but this makes no sense without knowing what khichdi is. Khichdi, a mixture of rice and lentils cooked with spices and sometimes vegetables, is the quintessential north-Indian comfort food, a meal cooked on rainy days when people are cooped up indoors. Armed with this tidbit of information, it makes sense that the phrase figuratively means to scheme secretively/hatch a plan.History as linkAnother aspect linking language and culture is history. Just as culture evolves with times, so does language. Thus, the cultures past shows us the factors that have gone into shaping the language as we know it.A great example of this is the Hindi-Urdu language, otherwise known as Hindustani. In the early second millennium BCE, Sanskrit was brought to the Indus valley by those who settled there. A member of the Indo-European family of languages, Sanskrit soon became the standard (both spoken and written) in the region.In the mid-16th century, the Mughal empire (a Muslim Persianate imperial power that ruled much of India for the next few centuries) brought Arabic and Persian languages to the region. These, combined with the Sanskrit derivatives spoken by natives, created a blended language called Hindustani. The mid-19th century saw the introduction of British Raj in India.To allow for communication with the colonial rulers, English words were incorporated into the Hindi vernacular (such as the months of the Judeo-Christian calendar). Even the partition of India in 1947 brought changes for the language.While Urdu and Hindi are written in different scripts, they share a common set of sounds, words and grammatical rules due to their common history. In fact, speakers of Hindi, for the most part, are able to understand Urdu and vice versa.Regardless of ones relation to Indian culture, it is virtually impossible to escape its influence in the United States. Open a newspaper every morning and one can find an article regarding Indias role as an up and coming economic and cultural force in the world. Turn on the television and one can find entire TV shows, such as Outsourced, related to India. Historically tied to the West, Indian culture now permeates every aspect of American life from curry cook books to yoga.At the basis of these trends are the linguistic traditions rooted in Hindi. Along with Indias role in international affairs, the demand for an education based on South Asian culture and language is growing and US universities are answering the call.The history and nuances of a language derive directly from the culture of its speakers. Thus, attempting to learn a language without learning its associated culture is to miss out on everything that makes the language unique, exciting and beautiful.(The writer, a linguist, teaches at the Washington University in St Louis, USA)"

A retired steel plant superintendent, Das has been a walker for almost all his life, but this is his first attempt at a marathon.Every day, for the past two months, he has been running a distance of 21 km in preparation for the marathon. While no other member in his family is part of Sunday's event, they will certainly cheer for him when he crosses the finish line.""Apart from a sugar problem, I don't suffer from any ailment. Regular walking and jogging keeps me in good shape,"" he said.As a senior superintendent at Durgapur Steel Plant in West Bengal, Das, a sports enthusiast, dabbled in football and badminton. ""Even though it has been years since I retired, I keep myself active. I moved to Navi Mumbai seven years ago. The wide open roads here are ideal to stay in shape. My family, especially my wife Ritka, has been supportive of my mission,"" he said.One of the reasons he is able to run at this age is the strict diet regime that he follows. Sangita, his daughter, said he ate within limits and his diet included dry fruits, typical Bengali meals of rice, lentils, vegetables, fish and curd and an occasional dry snack.""I make sure I get proper sleep. I sleep reasonably early since I wake at 5.40am. Then from 6.15am to 9.15am, I jog on the streets,"" he laughed and said.Keeping his body in good shape is not his only mission. His mind, too, needs to stay sharp. Apart from being an avid news watcher, he tutors his grandchildren.""This way my father stays abreast of what is happening around and his mind stays focused,"" added Sangita.His son-in-law, Subhendu, recalls the time Das climbed 17 floors to their residence when the lift was out of order. ""Even younger people struggle to climb so many floors. But he managed it easily,"" said Subhendu.Thrilled to be part of Sunday's marathon, Das can't curtail his excitement. ""This is the first time I am taking part in the marathon and I am so happy to be a part of it,"" he said."

But should you eat them?Indias chronic shortage of pulses  the essential soupy item in everyday meals  has made a cheap source of protein for millions very expensive. So, the country is thinking of bringing back khesari dal (scientific name: lathyrus odoratus), which became notorious after it was linked to neurological disorders, leading to a formal ban in 1961.Yet, khesari had its own advantages. It is a tough guy in the field, highly resistant to drought and floods. If revived, it could sell very cheap because of its coarseness.The khesari family has been historically notorious. In 1942, an officer at Vapniarca, a concentration camp in the then German-occupied Ukraine, began feeding Jewish inmates bread made of grass pea (lathyrus sativus), a close cousin of khesari, to see its effects. Many began limping within weeks and died. In a Nazi regime trying to push the frontiers of science, Vapniarcas inmates were guinea pigs.So, why would India want farmers to grow a crop known to cause lathyrism, a neurological disease from eating legumes of the genus lathyrus to which khesari belongs? Thats because the Indian Council of Medical Research has cleared three new varieties developed by farm scientists, in which they have cut the offending toxin BOA to safe limits.These khesari varieties are mahateora, ratan and prateek. These arent the same varieties which caused diseases back in the 1960s that led to a ban. Those varieties are simply gone, NP Singh, the head at the Kanpur-based Indian Institute of Pulses Research, told HT.Khesari is very similar to peas. When the government imposed a ban nearly five decades ago, there wasnt such a scarcity (of pulses), Singh said. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute and Raipur University began working on separate ambitious projects to develop varieties that would be safer.So, in the light of the ICMRs findings, the Indian Council of Agricultural Research has sought the ban to be removed by the Food Standards and Safety Authority (FSSAI).Singh said 11.6 m hectare rice fields remain unused after harvest in eastern India because there is too little moisture to grow anything else. Thats where these new khesari varieties can be grown. People can consume it in moderation and use it as fodder.Moreover, khesari is still widely grown in Bangladesh. Experts believe large quantities of the deadlier variety are anyway being smuggled in every year.On the three new safer varieties, the jury is still out. The FSSAI is planning to run its own set of rigorous tests before allowing them to enter the market."

Now the government has cleared three varieties of the khesari lentil, which can grow in dry or wet conditions.But the opposition Congress party, which is trying to pressure Modi over continuing rural hardship, said the government was playing with the health of unsuspecting Indians by allowing the cultivation of khesari.The varieties developed by Indian scientists, however, contain a lesser amount of a neurotoxin that can damage nerve tissues and weaken the legs of both humans and animals than previous varieties, said Narendra Pratap Singh, director of the state-run Indian Institute of Pulses Research (IIPR).""The government thought if in a reasonable quantity it can be consumed then why not allow it, particularly when there's a crisis and we're importing pulses,"" said Singh.Despite the ban placed on the lentil in 1961, khesari is still eaten in eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh, mainly as a cheap source of protein for millions of poor people.""This is how the Modi government is tackling price rise - by lifting (the) ban on a pulse that's medically proven to cause paralysis,"" Congress party spokesman R P N Singh said on Twitter.The three varieties now allowed have been ready for the last 10 years and ""various experiments on animals have shown there are no adverse long-term effects if consumption is in reasonable quantity,"" IIPR's Singh said.Every year Indians consume about 22 million tonnes of lentils used to make a thick stew called dal, commonly taken with rice or flat bread across South Asia. About a fifth of the volume is imported from countries like Canada, Australia and Myanmar, which grow the legumes mainly to sell to India.Modi wants India to be self sufficient in lentils and last month approved a scheme to encourage greater cultivation of the legumes. Higher incentives for water-intensive crops like wheat and rice have made India a big grains producer at the cost of other key crops like lentils and oilseeds."

Dudi blamed Raje also for the closure of Kota thermal power plant's four units.The Congress leader held a press conference in the city on Friday to mark his completion of two years in office as the leader of Opposition. Targeting the BJP government at the Centre and the state, the Congressman declared to undertake a tour of the state from January 23 to gather people's feedback ahead of the budget session.""BJP has let down the farmers who voted for it in an unprecedented manner. It has made fun of them not only with meagre compensations of crop damages but also by letting the insurance companies to plunder them,"" Dudi stressed. He pointed out the subsidies for farmers cut in electricity, drip irrigation, green houses and poly houses schemes. ""BJP is like Bhasmasur (a mythological character); it came to power with the farmers' votes and is now bleeding them to death with its corporate pleasing policies. Sixty farmers have committed suicides in the state so far,"" Dudi said.The Congress leader highlighted that even though the BJP was in power at the Centre and in Haryana and Punjab (with allies), it was unable to deliver Rajasthan's share from the Gang canal and the Indira Gandhi canal.The leader of Opposition asserted that the chief minister had a negative approach. ""Besides the Barmer refinery and Dungarpur-Ratlam rail link, she has curtailed the Parwan river irrigation project in Hadauti, Kumbharam Lift canal in Jhunjhunu, Gurgaon canal in Bharatpur and Narmada canal in Jalore and Barmer districts,"" Dudi listed out. ""These water projects, like the refinery and the rail link ones, were stopped simply because they were initiated by the previous Congress government,"" he alleged.He targeted the Raje-government also for alleged atrocities against the Dalits, closing down government schools in rural areas, ignoring health facilities and free medicine schemes and not responding to Opposition legislators' queries in the state assembly."
58ff14577be9e041361623f2,It's time for food outside hospitals,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/524770/its-time-food-outside-hospitals.html,2016-01-23,"It's time for food outside hospitalsGautam Dheer in Chandigarh, January 24, 2016 0:02 ISTIn bone-chilling winter months and sweeping intense cold wave, the swelling numbers queuing up in torn, worn-out clothes--often handed out in charity by the brand-cautious elite in Le Corbusier designed capital city Chandigarh-- can take at least one thing guaranteed. Hot food throughout the year and all free of charge outside two big hospitals.The free meal is a tasteful delight with a mix of chapatis, high-protein lentil, halwa, and often a pack of biscuit and, of course, at times a banana.Shelter, perhaps, in the open and a patient to tend to inside a hospital, it's a situation one would dread to be in. But that's the way it has been for the countless who have been huddling at the Baba place for food in their hour of distress. He's fondly nicknamed Baba, which means the elderly or even a father. The Baba, Jagdish Lal Ahuja, has turned 81 and is not anymore in the pink of his health. But his unflinching commitment to serve food to the hungry outside hospitals is beyond just a Good Samaritan act. Here's why?The Baba, till date, has sold his properties worth several crores of rupees to continue his commitment to serve food to the hungry. That's something not many in the city will dispute. In fact, many are prepared to vouch for it. And the food-serving tradition is something that is not a recent one. The free food service has not missed a single day. In fact it touched a 16-year landmark of sorts on January 21.It was way back on January 21, 2000, when Baba organised his first langar outside the gate of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research --one of country's premier hospitals. The only addition since then is the other venue--the space outside another prominent government hospital in Sector 32, Chandigarh, where a similar set-up welcomes the needy with folded hands. For the innumerable poor, arguably plodding their way in sarkari hospitals unsure of the fate of their loved one, perhaps, on a bed in the intensive care unit, its the only moment of solace.Punjab and Chandigarh are the two places where the Sikhs are in majority, which is why both these places have thousands of Gurdwaras (Sikh shrines) that brought along a culture of langar--community kitchen food served to anyone who steps in any time of the day or even at night.The food-serving tradition for centuries at the revered Golden Temple in Amritsar epitomises the spirit to serve humanity enshrined in the Sikh holy scripture Shri Guru Granth Sahib. All that and similar traditions being practised all over the country are at a different high.But the Baba's initiative stands out amidst the many langars that go on. That's because the Baba does not enjoy any institutional backing or a dedicated flow of funds to support this philanthropic work that has continued for decades. Much of his savings and properties have gone into funding his passion to feed the hungry. Of course, well wishers in the city too pitch in with whatever little or more contribution they can make for the cause.Early this month, as Baba would approach the January 21 anniversary of his first langar, an uncanny feeling gripped him and left him sad like never before, which is when he said the January anniversary date of his first langar would be the last langar at the two venues. I wish I could continue, but my health is now failing, Ahuja had said.The Baba remained restless to say the least for the next few days. His passion to serve food was something that he pledged to continue till his last breath. Would it have ended in this manner? That wasnt to be the case. Within days, the Baba rose like a Phoenix. He was back with the same grit. He says he was flooded with phone calls of well-wishers from all over asking him not to give up his passion. The langar will not end, not until I am alive, he has declared.The philanthropic journey dates back to some three decades. It was my elder sons eighth birthday, when I decided to organise a community langar outside my shop 36 years ago, Ahuja said. The free food service outside hospitals started later. Winters can be nasty in this part of the region. Ahuja also distributes free shawls, blankets, pullovers and shoes to the needy. He came to Patiala in Punjab during partition in 1947. Then 12, he sold candies to make ends meet. When Chandigarh came up, he shifted with bag and baggage with his family to the new place. He sold bananas in a big way and many in the trade crowned him banana king.Ask about his motivation and he says: It's magical, rather blissful to see a smile on the face of a child who is hungry and gets hot food. It makes my day. For the poor outside hospitals, it is extremely difficult to cope with the distress of little money, an ailing loved one on a bed and a family to look after back home. At least they don't have to worry about food, he said.Food is prepared elsewhere and a white-coloured vehicle which reads, Jagdish Lal Ahuja, PGI Bhandare Wale, Chandigarh, arrives each day and announces It's time for food'."
58ff17117be9e04136162544,Barter system still alive in Assam,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/524765/barter-system-still-alive-assam.html,2016-01-23,"Ratnadip Choudhury in Morigaon (Assam), January 24, 2016 0:02 ISTPeople from hilly regions come to plains : Three-day annual fair is held in Morigaon districtSeptuagenarian Ramsing Ingti was advised by doctors some five years ago not to trek hill ranges as he had cardiac problems. But this advisory could not stop him from continuing with a one-day trek down the hills of Karbi Anglong in Assam to the plains of Morigaon, adjacent to the mighty Brahmaputra, carrying a headload of home-grown vegetables and country fowl and meet his friend Bidyanath Bordoloi from Nagaon.Bidyanath, a 64-year-old farmer, is a proud father of two doctors, but he is still rooted in traditional organic rice farming and come every winter he waits anxiously for Ingti to exchange his home-grown paddy with what Ingti brings. In this way Bordoloi and Ingti are keeping their friendship alive and are proud being part of centuries-old tradition in Assam where people from the hills and plains get together once a year and buy and sell their commoditiesbarter trade without any monetary transaction.Like Ingti and Bordoloi, thousands of people from across Assam and neighbouring Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh have been part of this tradition of seamless cashless transaction for three days every year at Joon Beel Mela, an annual barter fair in Assam, that dates back to the reign of the Ahom Kings and has reference in royal documents of the 15th century.I have been coming here since childhood with my father. I have known Bordoloi and many others through this fair. It is like a pilgrimage for me. And I will keep coming to Joon Beel Mela till I die. It is far beyond buying and selling stuff on barter, which has been our age-old transaction system when there was no currency. We must keep tradition alive, pass on the knowledge of traditional cashless transaction to the next generation, build communal bonhomie and above all making friends, said Ingti as he entered the mela.A week after Magh Bihu, a wetland locally known as Joon Beel (moon shaped wetland) in the nondescript village of Dayang Belguri in Morigaon district, some 90 km from Guwahati, becomes a major attraction for people as tribals attend the annual fair. In this fair, for ages the hill people have been carrying headloads of home-grown items and exchange with us. We give them rice, jaggery, woollen and lentils. This is perhaps the worlds oldest barter trading system which is till alive. But the government is taking no initiative to keep it up and running, Bordoloi laments.This year, the three-day fair concluded on January 23. Being held on the banks of a wetland, the fair starts with community fishing. In the Joon Beel, indigenous fishing equipment are used and people from different communities fish together in the wetland and later partake in eating food together.The fair is unique and important in many respects. Assam has seen many bloody ethnic riots and conflicts. Unity has always suffered badly in the multi-ethnic society yet people have fought and lived together. Joon Beel Mela acts as a melting pot of ethnicity with people from different communities of the hills of the northeast meeting the dwellers of the vast plains, exchanging their goods only through barter and it strengthens the bond of ethnic bonhomie. This fair is a legacy of Gova Raja, the Tiwa community king who started this fair where the ground rules of getting any item is that there is no use of money, only barter.It is one event in Assam where tribals and non-tribals, hills dwellers and plains settlers will rub shoulders and enjoy the annual cock fight which is also part of the fair. Though there is a pressure from the government to keep the cock fight out of the ambit of the fair, this time, the events were held.In the remote hills, we have to pay a lot of money to get essential items even today. Thus this traditional fair is life-saver for us. I have seen my parents exchange goods through barter in this fair. After marriage I have kept the tradition going. Here, we collect stocks in barter so there are no worries of inflation, said Madhab Rabha, who came from Sonapur.It is not just people from rural and remote areas who come to the fair. Even people from urban settlements, including Guwahati, flock to the fair to enjoy the essence of cashless trading. The ado for many is that this fair had remained confined to the northeast.The Tiwa head inaugurates the fair and also collects tax from the tribals as it used to be decades ago. This was the time when the kings of the erstwhile Gova kingdom took stock of their people, their regime and discussed matters with general public. The fair always ends with a traditional durbar held by the titular Gova Raja. This time even Assam Chief Minister Tarun Gogoi attended the durbar as a special guest.The Assam government has also chipped in to promote the unique fair. It now gives annual royal allowance for the 19 customary kings from different communities under the erstwhile Gova kingdom of Assam. The old-trade system might not be pertinent today but the fact remains that here you can see there is no fight over any deal because money is not involved, said Jor Singh Bordoloi, a prominent elder of the Tiwa community.Perhaps, it is time the Assam Government promotes Joon Beel Mela as a state event to build bridges of communal harmony."

If the MIM doesn't come to power, the city would share the fate of the municipalities around Mumbai in which Shiv Sena and the BJP came to power and enforced a ban on meat for ""six to eight days""."", Asad added at a public gathering in Uppuguda. While a ban on cow slaughter is in force,BJP and Shiv Sena had included a ban on bull and bullock slaughter as well. and would hit the poor who are engaged in the trade, he shared.At a public meeting in Shaikpet on Monday, Owaisi that his speech in Uppuguda was taken out of context. He explained that as many as 3,000 oxen and bullocks, apart from 10,000 sheep, are slaughtered every day. ""God forbid, if BJP and the TDP and their adopted son, Congress candidate from here pass a resolution in the baldiya (corporation), that instead of one day, the (meat) shop will remain closed for four days. Where will these 30,000 sheep and 9,000 bovine creatures be kept,"" he questioned.Citing the example of Aurangabadi meat delicacy nankhalai, Owaisi said that this dish is now unavailable on account of the beef ban. ""Remember that every region has its identity. If you say don't eat meat, then what will the poor man feed. Lentils are for Rs 120 to Rs 140 per kilo. Bada (beef) is for 120 for half a kilo. What will the poor man's mother feed her big family? Lentils or meat? You decide,"" he questioned. At a time when the ""health minister has said that children of our country suffer from protein deficiency"", Owaisi asserted that lentils are not a source of this nutrient. Muslims are being unfairly targeted for meat consumption when people of other communities are seen in restaurants serving Kalyani biryani, he stated."

The report has named companies that are buying masoor in large quantities and cornering stocks in Canada, which is the largest exporter of red lentils to India.According to rough estimates, last year dal importers had reportedly made around Rs 3,500 crore by creating acute shortages and jacking up prices of arhar. The consumer affairs ministry has already approached the Delhi police to investigate the role of traders in the dramatic rise in arhar prices.In fact, most of the 1.3 lakh tonnes of pulses seized in recent months were shipped around April-May, when prices were close to Rs 100 a kg, and were kept in warehouses,mostly in Maharashtra. Sources said the IB referred its report to the Centre earlier this month on the cartels' plan to raise prices of masoor. It has mentioned that the most important cartel in this sector is allegedly led by an Indian commodity trading firm along with other Indian and international players in the field.The report says the plan includes amassing stocks in Canada by offering prices higher than those prevailing there and delaying the lifting of stocks from the Mumbai port, thereby causing an upward trend in satta (futures).The IB has said the Indian firm with the most important cartel is allegedly buying masoor at Rs 1,200-Rs 1,500 a quintal more than the prevailing prices in Canada. The IB agency has also reported that a leading global supplier of African agricultural products, has allegedly parked thousands of tonnes of masoor and yellow peas in Dubai.""While steps must be taken to ensure that traders don't exploit the situation, we must also realise how the traders are a hundred steps ahead of us. They have better assessment of the likely harvest and map the potential country where the produce is available. They buy most of the produce by the time we start planning,"" said an official, adding that the cartels are in operation since there are only a few players in import of pulses."

Telegraph picture Calcutta, Jan. 27: Come Sunday, foodies in Calcutta, who have probably had their fill of Chinese, Thai and Mexican, will have a chance to get adventurous and step out of their comfort zone to taste khar, tenga and the heat of bhut jolokia, with a couple of silkworms thrown in for good measure. Northeastern food curator Gitika Saikia will be here to take the residents of the city, as well as Assamese residents here who have been pining for some authentic cuisine from back home, on a gastronomic journey through the hills of Assam. The pop-up is scheduled to be held at Club de Ville in Udita Bengal Ambuja on the EM Bypass, to highlight a medley of urban and rural cuisine of her state. A pop-up restaurant is a temporary set-up, often operating from a private home, restaurant or borrowed space, mainly during festivals and other occasions. Saikia, currently based in Mumbai, will cook simple yet mouth-watering dishes from Assam, with an emphasis on indigenous food. She had also held pop-ups in other states and abroad. Famous for her blog Gitika's Pakghor and her pickles, she will provide some of her signature dishes, including lai xaak gahori or pork with broad mustard leaves, til maas (fish cooked with sesame seeds) and rongalao murgi (tender chicken pieces with ripe pumpkin). For a real challenge to the tastebuds, she will present the fiery bhut jolokia, in chutneys as well as with pork and bamboo shoot. The event is the brainchild of food blogger Anindya Sundar Basu of Pikturenama, and his wife Madhushree Basu Roy, cook and food stylist. Connecting over social media, Saikia and Basu hit upon the idea of holding this pop-up to showcase the hidden flavours of Assam. ""Foodies in Calcutta are very open to trying out different kinds of food. The city offers plenty of scope for the introduction of Assamese cuisine. I am sure foodies will embrace the unique flavours of Assam,"" Basu said. ""I quit a more than 10-year-long corporate career in September 2014 to pursue my passion of promoting the unexplored Northeast, its culture and its customs. Since I am passionate about cooking, it was the best medium I could come up with,"" said Saikia. ""I first entered the kitchen when I was in Class II to make a fried egg. I remember it was a disaster and never tried it again till Classes VI or VII. I was a bad cook throughout and then moved to a hostel, limiting my cooking skills all the more. After marriage, my mother-in-law, who is an excellent cook, taught me indigenous fare. Seeing her cooking, my interest grew and every time I visited home, I would come back with new recipes and the availability of organic ingredients in the kitchen garden influenced me to try different things,"" she added. On Sunday, the guests will be served black tea served with homemade pithas (rice cakes) on arrival. The main course will comprise lai xaak gahori, guti alu aru tita phool bhaji (baby potatoes stir fry with red bitter flowers), topola bhat (sticky rice), til maas (river fish cooked in black sesame with a hint of herbs) xukan khorisa, mosola paat bhut jolokia gahori (pork with smoked bamboo shoots, bhut jolokia and Arunachali herbs), rongalao murgi, lau khar (bottle gourd and masoor dal cooked with organic alkali and flavoured with Assamese coriander) and steamed plain rice. The accompaniments are misa maas aru bhut jolokia chutney (shrimps with bhut jolokia chutney) and homemade bamboo shoot pickle. For dessert, tuck into kola bora payokh (black sticky rice pudding cooked in thickened milk)."

A husband selling his wife for hooch, a son turning his mother out of the house, husbands beating their pregnant wives, the sordid stories came one by one. At the meeting, which aimed to chalk out a plan of action to curb alcoholism, the women requested a solution to their woes and unanimously demanded a stringent law - a life sentence if need be - for suppliers of illicit liquor. The meet was organised by the political science department of the college in collaboration with Omiya Kumar Das Institute of Social Change and Development, Guwahati. ""At Barhuz and Horuhuz, villages under Pulibor police station, 300 of the 400 houses sell hooch. Several times we have caught suppliers from nearby Borbhetti area and taken them to the police station but they are set free by evening. All that is needed to get them off the hook is Rs 5,000. We have realised that if we show the police the houses which sell liquor, it will only inflate their pockets,"" a woman said. The women said they had spoken to Jorhat superintendent of police Amanjeet Kaur. She had sent sub-inspector Dibyajyoti Dutta, who beat up one or two hooch sellers and organised the women into a force but they admitted they were fighting a losing battle. In Baligaon, Kolioni and Jankhona areas, Dutta organised the women into a samiti and they succeeded in closing 10 of the 12 liquor outlets. But these re-opened after he left. The victims also alleged that the beatings by their alcoholic husbands also got worse after Dutta left. Rani Begum, who lost her husband and two sons to alcohol, had brought her grandson to the seminar today. Her other two sons are also alcoholics. The eight-year-old boy spoke about how his grandmother was struggling to bring him up after his father died. Jan Das of Horuhuz said she had bought an almirah to keep food items locked since half-a-kg of lentils could procure a liquor bottle. Jamuna Das was an exception since her husband has not touched alcohol for the past eight years. Joydeep Baruah of OKD Institute said two more meetings would be held and the decisions and recommendations taken there would be told to the affected in another workshop. Bolin Hazarika, head of the political science department, said chief minister Tarun Gogoi and his son and Kaliabor MP Gaurav Gogoi had been informed. Gaurav has asked for data of the number of illegal outlets, which is being collected by Dutta."

For instance, retail tur prices had shot up to Rs 200/kg in most places, which after series of government steps have now cooled down to Rs 160/kg though still costlier for common man.Despite several steps, pulses prices are expected to remain firm this year as well due to production concerns because of drought for the second straight year.In this backdrop, sources said, a meeting of central security agencies -- IB, DRI, Income Tax Department, Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT) and Delhi Police -- was recently called by the Consumer Affairs Ministry to discuss further actions to curb ""satta operators"" in pulses trading and keep prices under control.""In the meeting, the enforcement agencies were asked to concentrate on tur and urad traders in the coming days. They have been informed to take stringent action against ""satta operators"" in these commodities,"" the sources said.Since the harvesting of winter-sown gram dal will begin shortly, the agencies have been asked to keep a close watch on trading of this particular dal, the sources said.In order to check hoarding of imported dals, the customs department has been asked to collect port-wise details of imported stocks and see if imported pulses are being kept at ports beyond a reasonable period, they added.In the meeting, it was also informed that the recent income tax raids conducted in several cities on masoor dal traders helped cool down prices to a large extent.Retail masoor dal prices have now declined below Rs 80 per kg from Rs 120 per kg level in last three-four months, as per the government data.According to sources, the enforcement agencies have decided to meet on a regular basis and will also take views of the state officials in the meeting through video conference for effective actions against speculators.Besides keeping curb on speculators, the government is increasing availability of pulses in the domestic market through imports. It is also building a buffer stock.Pulses output had declined by 2 million tonnes to Rs 17.38 million tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June). In the current year, pulses output from the kharif (summer) season is estimated to be slightly lower at 5.56 million tonnes. Rabi (winter) pulses are yet to be harvested.India imports 4-5 million tonnes of pulses annually as domestic demand is about 22-23 million tonnes."

He is on a two-day visit to the state.The minister was here to attend the meeting of Hindi Salahkar Samiti, constituted by the Centre to look after the use of Hindi language in official communications.An official statement, circulated during the news conference, said the Centre has already taken a decision to import 10,000 MT of pulses.The Centre has imposed ban on export of all pulses, except 'kabuli chana', organic pulses and lentils, up to 10,000 MT. Zero import duty on pulses has been extended up to September 2016, the statement said. It said despite two years of less rain, there was more than adequate food grain stock available with the government.Besides to check hoarding and black marketing of essential commodities, the Centre has asked all states to impose stock limits for onion and pulses.In Odisha, prices of pulses have gone through the roof in the last few months. While arhar dal is selling at 160 a kg, prices of moong and urad dal have also skyrocketed much to the discomfort of common man, market sources said.State requires about seven lakh MT pulses per annum against its production of only 80,000 to one lakh MT only. Due to shortage in domestic market, pulses are being imported mainly from Myanmar."

In the past, we had spotted seven hunters carrying double barrel guns in the forest and they had peacefully surrendered after spotting us. Hunters generally carry lentils and spices in their bags for cooking. But here, the two persons had antibiotics and uniforms, clearly indicating that they were naxals,"" a senior police officer involved in the anti-naxal operations told TOI.The cops suspect the two to be militia from Odisha. Some leads on their identity are likely in the post mortem that will be conducted after the bodies reach Narsipatnam on Tuesday morning, he said. The police claimed they have information that AOB leader Chalapati and PLGA company commander Kudumula Venkata Rao alias Ravi were at the training camp and might have crossed the Visakha border by Monday evening following the incident.According to the sources, in order to lure away the security personnel away from the training camp, a naxal party displayed its presence at Korukonda in Chintapalli mandal ten days ago.

During the Bihar polls last year, prices of pulses had risen abnormally becoming a major political issue that contributed to NDA's poor show.The DRI has provided a list of major traders involved in import and export of pulses and other commodities for the panel to analyse and for stricter enforcement against caretlisation, hoarding and black-marketing, particularly pulses, onion and potatoes.

In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."

Harish, member of the Board of Regents of University of Agricultural and Horticultural Sciences (UAHS), Shivamogga, has called upon agriculture scientists to take up research on high-yield varieties of pulses to strengthen the food security of the nation. He was speaking after inaugurating an awareness programme on pulses held at the campus of UAHS, here on Tuesday to mark the International Year of Pulses. Pulses like tur, Bengal gram, horse gram, lentils, green gram and cow peas are rich sources of nutrition and form part of the diet in India for many years now. It is necessary to enhance the production of pulses to ensure access to nutritious food for people from all strata of the society, he said.Though the nation is the largest producer of pulses with a total annual production of around 18 million tonnes, there is a huge gap between the domestic demand and supply owing to which 4.60 million tonnes is being imported every year. It is necessary to be prepared to meet this challenge by increasing the production of pulses, he said. Even farmers in irrigated zones are not keen on taking up cultivation of pulses. They hold the wrong notion that the returns from this are not lucrative.Agriculture scientist T.K. Siddarame Gowda said that, owing to change in agriculture practices and due to shortage of labour in rural areas, the farmers are displaying an aversion towards the cultivation of pulses. The cultivation of pulsesis necessary for sustainable agriculture as pulses fix atmospheric nitrogen to the soil through root nodules. By taking up cultivation of pulses, the farmers can minimise the use of chemical fertilisers and thereby conserve the fertility of the soil, he added.Farmers in irrigated zones believe that returns are not lucrative in the cultivation of pulses"

This loss needs to be replenished by taking sup plements and iron-rich diets like spinach, meat, egg, lentils, beans and broccoli.But they never bother to get themselves properly checked and take timely medical help,"" said Dr B K Sowjanya, general physician, Continental Hospitals.The survey also found that city women were not getting enough exposure to morning sunlight, leading to Vitamin D deficiency, which causes fatigue and adversely affects the bone.Upon analysis of their 25-hydroxy blood test (the standard test to check Vitamin D deficiency), it was found that 2,370 out of 2,789 women, mostly in the 16-45 age group, had vitamin D level below 30 nanograms milliliter, which is insufficient.""There are several reasons why women suffer the most. Despite women being the nucleus of the family, ignorance about their health is showing an alarming upward trend of late in the city,"" said Dr Jyoti Ranganathan, head lab opera tions at Bengaluru Reference Lab, SRL Ltd.Experts put the blame of vitamin D deficiency on urban habits of sleeping and waking up late. ""Though there are vitamin D supplements, no food can replenish its deficiency as only getting morning sunshine before 8 am can help one get enough of it. Unfortunately, this problem is common as urban working women are mostly confined to their homes or air-conditioned offices,"" said Dr G Hari Charan, senior general physician, Sunshine Hospitals.The survey also revealed startling findings with regard to cardiovascular disorders and diabetes. It found that 24.53% of women (2,603) out of a sample size of 10,614 were diagnosed with cardiovascular disorders and 18.25% (10,273) out of a sample size of 56,292 women were diabetic. For both these diseases, women in the 46-60 age group were found to be most vulnerable.The best way to prevent such diseases is to lead an active life, spend at least 45 minutes on moderate intensity aerobic exercises, consume lots of fruits and vegetables, and home-prepared food, said B V Purohit, senior consultant cardiologist at Apollo Hospitals. ""To overcome stress, adopt relaxation techniques such as yoga, and hobbies like reading, gardening etc. and make them a part of your daily life,"" he added."
58ff13fe7be9e041361623cb,"Now, Bihar farmers hope for a reprieve from Nilgai",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/532878/now-bihar-farmers-hope-reprieve.html,2016-03-05,"Abhay Kumar in Patna Mar 06, 2016 0:05 ISTFifty six-year-old Ram Sharan Singh in Bihars Bhojpur district remained a worried lot after packs of Nilgai destroyed his crops year after year. So perplexed was he with the Nilgai menace that at one point of time, he was mulling over the proposal to shift to other business from agriculture.But the Centres decision to allow Bihar cull Nilgais has come as a major relief for him and other farmers. A recent notification issued by the Union Environment ministry, headed by Prakash Javdekar, in December 2015 says the Centre has agreed to the Bihar governments demand to declare Nilgai as vermin on account of the damage they cause to the life and property.This is arguably the first instance where the Ministry of Forest and Environment has declared any species as vermin and granted rights to a state to hunt them down. Bihar had been pressing about the matter after several complaints poured in about damage of crops by Nilgai. Such was the havoc created by the antelope that farmers last year complained to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar during one of his yatras.The concern was expressed again in the meeting of the State Board of Wild Life, held in May 2015, where it was decided that Bihar would declare the Nilgai as vermin. The proposal was then forwarded to the Union Environment Ministry, Bihars Principal Secretary, Forest and Environment, Vivek Kumar Singh told Deccan Herald.We were receiving regular complaints about crops damaged by Nilgai. Since Nilgai (also called blue bull) is a Schedule III animal, it has been quite difficult to handle the menace. But after cultivation was hit, there was a growing clamour to hunt down the Nilgai despite the emotional attachment to it due to gai factor, said Singh.Its not only the farm area where the Nilgais had wreaked havoc. Sometime back, a peculiar situation arose in Patna when an antelope strayed into the campus of Jayaprakash Narayan International Airport .Mercifully, before it could enter the high-security zone, zoo officials from the nearby Sanjay Gandhi Biological Park were requisitioned who helped in apprehending the wayward animal.Close on the heels of a blue bull entering the Patna airport, yet another antelope entered the campus of Gaya International Airport, some 125 km from Patna. Every takeoff and landing of international and domestic flights in Gaya was fraught with danger as the blue bull, which had once strayed onto the runway, was said to be hiding in the adjoining 50-hectare dense forest cover at the airport. The antelope was eventually apprehended by the forest department officials who came looking for the herbivorous animal with tranquilliser guns in hand.Prior to this incident, when a tiger strayed in from Valmikinagar reserve area (in Champaran), it killed several antelopes along the Gandak basin, while returning to its territory.The villagers, comprising mostly farmers, were profusely thanking the God because these Nilgais had destroyed acres of crops worth lakhs.Rattled over Nilgais havoc, we had organised Mahachandi yajna (a form of prayer) some time back to invoke the Goddess Durga. The goddess sent in the tiger to chase the blue bull. We are thankful to Maa Durga, said Rampujan Singh, a native of Saran.Bihar has a history of Nilgais damaging lentil crops like arhar and moong (pulses), thereby adversely affecting their production. Farmers in several districts where the Ganga and Gandak basin exists face huge losses as crops of wheat, maize, vegetables and pulses are damaged by herds of Nilgais. These animals not only graze in farmlands but also damage standing crops.During Vishwas Yatra undertaken by Nitish Kumar, the farmers narrated him their plight over the mess created by Nilgais. There are thousands of Nilgais. And their population is increasing by the day because a female antelope breeds twice a year, an aggrieved farmer told the Chief Minister emphasising on the need to capture and sterilise the Blue Bull.Later, farmers in many parts of Bihar put up bars and barricades to protect the crops from Nilgais and also continuously monitored their fields.The Bihar Agricultural Management and Extension Training Institute (BAMETI) organised one of the workshops on the issue in which representatives of the state government and other experts dwelt at length how to overcome this problem. The meeting, which was attended by Chief Conservator of Forests, wild life experts and activists of NGOs, deliberated on the issue and suggested ways and means to protect the crops from these wild herbivores.One of the suggestions was to empower mukhiyas to issue gun licences to kill these animals and make them honorary wildlife warden. But the suggestion was immediately shot down. As per the Indian culture, Hindus consider Nilgais as sacred because of the nomenclature. It has gai (cow) in it, and therefore it cant be gunned down, an expert argued.The other reason for the increase in antelopes population is said to be the shrinking forest. The carnivores that kept a check on their population are fast dwindling. As a consequence, the wild carnivores nowadays roam freely and, of late, have entered the human habitat.Taking note of the serious problem, the Centre, on December 1, 2015 issued a gazette notification which has allowed Bihar to cull Nilgais. Now this should make farmers heave a sigh of relief."

The school education and literacy department is yet to implement the safety norms as envisaged in the National Food Security Act-2013 that was officially rolled out amid much fanfare across Jharkhand on September 30 last year. Under the Act, cooked midday meals, collected randomly from all government schools, must be tested by accredited labs every month to check quality and prevent any untoward incident. Further, the school education department, in coordination with the health department, is supposed to carry out sampling and checking of the cooked food from time to time, apart from ensuring hygiene at school kitchens. However, despite a directive from the Union ministry of human resource development last year and several reports of children falling ill after eating midday meal, the department is yet to swing into action. Secretary (school education) Aradhana Patnaik said it was difficult to test midday meal cooked at schools located in other districts. ""The state's sole food testing lab is in Namkum. Bringing cooked food from other districts to the lab for testing is tough. By the time the samples will reach the lab, they will become stale. Hence, members of the mother's committees (responsible for cooking and serving food at schools) are directed to taste the meals before serving them to children,"" she said. However, she added that the department had already prepared standard operating procedures, containing guidelines of the food security act, for the district superintendents of education of all 24 districts. ""Also the chief medical officers (CMOs) of all the districts have been directed to visit schools and test cooked food from time to time. Nevertheless, we do send raw lentils and rice to the lab in Namkum for testing from time to time,"" she added. Chief food analyst at the Jharkhand Food Testing Laboratory (Namkum) J.K. Singh said they had not yet received any kit for collecting cooked rice, daal and vegetables either. ""We have not received midday meal samples as of now. And if in future, we are directed to test cooked food from schools, we have to be very careful in packing the samples as they are perishable,"" he added. Principal of Government Model Middle School, Hindpiri, Amarkant Pathak said this type of physical tests wasn't enough to ensure proper quality. ""They just taste the food in haste and serve it to children. In the past, we have seen children falling ill after eating foods that were tasted by the mother committee members,"" he added."

However, it still falls short of the demand by nearly three to four million tonnes, forcing the country to fall back on imports.The new versions of pulses being developed at the Kanpur-based institute include reduction of crop duration of moongbean from 75 to 55 days, lentil from 140 to 120 days and chickpea from 135 to 100 days.Varieties developedIt has also developed wilt-resistant varieties in chickpea, development of early maturing varieties in pigeonpea suitable for multiple cropping and green seeded variety of field pea for diversified food uses.The Centre is also promoting production of pulses in rice fallows and also popularising pulses cultivation in non-traditional area."

(Express Photo: Amit Chakravarty) Villagers near Beed selling milk at the Bashir Ganj area in the city. The farmers simply stand with their cans on the streets from 6 am and negotiate a price-per-litre directly with end-users. (Express Photo: Amit Chakravarty)Kantilal Bhosale has no idea that skim milk powder (SMP) prices at the New Zealand dairy giant Fonterras global e-auction platform have collapsed to $ 1,731 per tonne from the all-time-high of $ 5,142 less than three years ago. Nor is the 38-year-old, who farms two acres at Kasari village in the severely drought-hit Ashti taluka of Maharashtras Beed district, aware of India having an 18 per cent share of global milk production.All he knows is that the milk that fetched him Rs 24 a litre last year today commands just Rs 15.Bhosale would be willing to sell one of his three cows, but for the fact that there are no takers for them. The Maharashtra governments comprehensive ban on cattle slaughter and beef consumption, imposed last March, has made it tough to find even transporters, with stories doing the rounds of police cases being slapped against van-drivers ferrying animals to markets.While the ruling Bharatiya Janata Partys legislator from Ashti, Bhimrao Dhonde, was quickly shushed after he voiced his dissent against the ban earlier this month, the closure of a significant income avenue via sale of non-productive animals  especially in these times of drought and crashing milk prices  is an irritant for many farmers like Bhosale.Share This Article Related Article For consumers, milk could pinch further in the days aheadFor consumers, milk could pinch further in the days ahead The next inflation: When drought strikes  with a lagThe next inflation: When drought strikes  with a lag Amul milk gets dearer by up to Rs 2 a litreMilk dearer by Re 1 in Punjab,Haryana,HPDealing with another dry spellAmul sends SOS to Prime Minister as input costs riseYou paid Rs 20 for that one-litre bottle of water, right? I sold a litre of milk for Rs 17 today, says Rajendra Giri, 40, displaying his receipt from the Dattakrupa Dairy in Tawalwadi, which is just a kilometre away from Kasari. He will be paid at the end of the week, a pagaar (salary) that will help bring the vegetables and lentils for the next meal.Bhosale and Giri are spending a scorching afternoon huddling under the hay-roofed shed of a cattle camp near Kasari. There are currently 297 such camps in Beed, Osmanabad and Latur, the three most-parched of the eight districts comprising the Marathwada region that also includes Nanded, Parbhani, Hingoli, Jalna and Aurangabad.Unlike the two Kasari residents, who have no choice but to sell to the local dairy at Tawalwadi, Bhausaheb Aagam is somewhat better placed. He lives just 8 km from Beed city  as against 90 km for Kasari  where milk is retailing at Rs 32-35 per litre. At 10 am in the crowded Bashir Ganj area, Aagam has been standing for over three hours with a large aluminium jerry can at his feet, its lid snugly closing around the half-litre measuring ladle hooked at the mouth.I get at least Rs 10 per litre more than what it would be at the village, Aagam says of the Rs 30 price he has managed to hold on to, even with customers who drive a hard bargain. Aagam drives the 8-km distance to the city in his own mini-van, while counting himself among the lucky few with an easy access to a market that doesnt require dealing with procurement agents or a cooperative set-up: The only people in Marathwada still able to make a living out of milk are people like me, working alone.For the regions milk producers, facing their third drought in four years, the price that a litre of milk can get depends not just on its fat and solids-not-fat content, but also on whether they are selling to an agent stopping at the farm, going on their own to a dairy, or able to directly access a market of end-consumers.There arent any big private dairies in Marathwada or Vidarbha barring one or two, while the cooperative milk sector is almost non-existent in these two regions, notes Dattatray Vishwanath Ghanekar, managing director of the Kolhapur Zilla Sahakari Dudh Utpadak Sangh, which owns the popular Gokul milk brand and is based in western Maharashtra. Out of the estimated 80 lakh-plus litres per day of milk procured by organised dairies in the state  with near equal shares for the private sector and cooperatives  the Marathwada regionscontribution is less than five lakh litres or so.According to Ghanekar, most farmers in Marathwada and Vidarbha have only local non-descript animals. Now, with drought and low milk prices delivering a double-whammy, the few who maintain cross-bred cows and high-yielding buffaloes are making distress sales. Healthy three-year-old cross-bred milch cows are today being sold at Rs 22,000-24,000, compared to Rs 45,000-50,000 in normal times. The buyers here are mainly from western Maharashtra.It is the low-yielding indigenous/non-descript breeds that have no takers, including traders who were earlier supplying to slaughter houses. These animals are the ones mainly populating the cattle fodder camps sponsored by the state government.Santosh Chavan, a BJP leader from Ashti who has the contract to run the Kasari camp, points out that the village had some 1,000 animals until a year-and-a-half ago, when milk prices, too, were good. That number is down to 550-600, as some have died and others sold off. Also, of the five dairies operating in Kasari and nearby villages, the biggest one alone was procuring 6,000 litres a day of milk. Now, they together purchase 1,500 litres. The remaining milk has no buyers. So, producers simply sell at lower and lower prices, adds Chavan.Ghanekar does not foresee any immediate improvement in the situation. The main reason is global dairy product prices: These would remain under pressure from Chinas mounting economic woes, the Russian-West spat leading to surplus milk supplies in Europe and made worse by the end of the earlier regime of production quotas, and falling oil prices resulting in lower imports by West Asian countries.Indias own SMP imports have fallen from a peak of 1.30 lakh tonnes (valued at Rs 2,717.56 crore) in 2013-14 to 34,490 tonnes (Rs 681.69 crore) in 2014-15 and further to 9,193 tonnes (Rs 174.21 crore) during April-December 2015-16. Maharashtras private dairies, unlike the cooperatives that have a strong liquid milk marketing business, are mainly into production of commodities like SMP and ghee. The crash in global prices has affected their operations, causing them to slash milk procurement and pay lower prices to farmers.Meanwhile, in the cattle camps, nobody really cares about the wider economics. Fix a minimum price for milk and a minimum purchase commitment by the government. For us, there is no other means of livelihood left, declares Giri.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Choreographed by city-based dance artists Kishor and Kishori Hampiholi, the one-and-a-half-hour ballad is a presentation of Swar Sangam Sanskrutik Manch.""This seven act epic by Kavi Kalidas has all the elements essential for a dance drama. We will be presenting the story through classical and folk dance,"" says Hampiholi. Adapting the story to Bharatanatyam style of dancing, Kishori would be playing Shakuntala and would be on stage for more than 40 minutes. Their two children, Yashwant and Kamakshi, are also playing parts in the play. The group has been rehearsing for a month now for this performance.The script of the play has been penned by Sanskrit scholar Leena Rastogi. She has also written the four songs that form part of the presentation. ""We have used original shlokas from the play as dialogues. The entire music component of the play has been prepared by Shailesh Dani and his group of singers and musicians,"" informs Hampiholi. The play uses a narrator or sutradhar, who would be speaking in Hindi, to make the act more comprehensible for the audience.Kishor Nritya Niketan has previously performed presentations like Taj Mahal, Ramayan and Bhasmasur Mohini. ""They were very large scale presentations full of grandeur. But experience has taught us that too many props create obstacles in a dance drama. So this time we are using especially designed curtains as backdrops to create the scenes,"" says Hampiholi. ""The trend these days is to set a LED wall as backdrop. But we have used the skills of an artist in Bramhapuri to get the curtains specially designed,"" he says. The costumes for the dance drama have been bought from Chennai, Bangalore and Nagpur.To give a vibrant feel to the play, a koli dance has been added to the presentation. ""We have used the sequence of fishermen finding the royal ring in a fish. That portion of the drama has been presented with the Marathi folk dance,"" he says."

The signs along the thoroughfare suddenly switch to Arabic script advertising hookah shops, Middle Eastern sweets, halal meat and travel services.At a run-down strip mall in the neighborhood known as Little Arabia, flags from a half-dozen Muslim countries flap in a stiff breeze. Flying above them is a giant American flag.After Sen. Ted Cruz called for increased surveillance of Muslims in the US, many people in this community and others like it either challenged the Republican presidential candidate or dismissed his comments as mostly meaningless rhetoric.Majd Takriti, 43, stopped to discuss Cruz's remarks as he picked his mother up from a butcher shop. He said he took Cruz and rival Donald Trump with a grain of salt.""A lot of what they say is to attract attention,"" he said.A block down the street, Jordanian native and 44-year US resident Wathiq Bilbeisi slurped on lentil soup during his break at a Jordanian restaurant. He seemed mystified by the concern among some non-Muslim Americans about the candidates' comments.""The politicians, they want to say whatever the constituents want to hear. I don't think they mean what they say, and in the end, they'll have to come to terms with themselves,"" he said.Bilbeisi wasn't worried about the GOP seeking major changes to US law.""When they go to Congress to get laws to watch the Muslims, nobody's going to do anything about it,"" he said. ""It's against American values.""At a nearby hookah shop displaying pipes in a rainbow of colors, employee Guss Zayat said Cruz has a fundamental misunderstanding of Islam.Zayat, who came to America from Beirut about three years ago, questioned whether IS members were true Muslims.""They are killing more Muslims than anyone else in this world. They are killing children. They are killing Christians and Muslims in our home countries,"" he said. Politicians ""should know the difference between ISIS and Islam.""Cruz's statement on Tuesday came hours after the deadly attacks at the Brussels airport and a subway station that killed dozens of people and wounded many more. The Islamic State militant group claimed responsibility.He said law enforcement should be empowered to ""patrol and secure Muslim neighborhoods before they become radicalized."" Echoing earlier statements from Trump, Cruz also said the US should stop the flow of refugees from countries where the Islamic State has a significant presence.Muslims groups including the Council on American-Islamic Relations and the Anti-Defamation League condemned Cruz's statements. Many complained that the Islamic extremist attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, and the intensifying rhetoric of the presidential campaign, have bred animosity toward American Muslims.In Washington, Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates was asked Wednesday at a news conference about calls to step up patrols of Muslim communities. She said the Muslim community ""is one of our greatest partners in our fight against terrorism and public safety generally.""Ahmad Tarek Rashid Alam, publisher of the weekly Arabic-language Arab World newspaper and one of the immigrants who helped build Little Arabia, said anti-Muslim statements are ""nothing new.""""This has been going on in every Islamic neighborhood for years,"" he said. ""But now our kids are in the police, in the Army. Are they going to watch us?""He said Cruz's remarks seemed aimed at exploiting prejudice to get votes.""The way he talks, it could work maybe 40 years ago. But now, it's too late. Islam is part of the country. . We are already in the country, we're part of the country whether he likes it or not.""Sam Chashku, a Syrian immigrant who arrived in 1996 and married an American-born Christian woman, said Cruz's comments simply made him sad.""We love this country. We came from nothing. They gave us everything. It's crazy. This country is built on immigrants.""Sometimes, he said, he doesn't want to tell anyone that he's Muslim because ""people get offended, and I'm scared of hate crimes.""Trump, who has proposed a temporary ban on foreign Muslims entering the US, praised Cruz's plan as a ""good idea"" that he supports ""100 percent"" in an interview with CNN.Speaking Tuesday in New York, Cruz praised the city's former program of conducting surveillance in Muslim neighborhoods. He called for its reinstatement and said it could be a model for police departments nationwide.After the 9/11 attacks, the New York Police Department used its intelligence division to cultivate informants in Muslim communities. In a series of articles, The Associated Press revealed that authorities had infiltrated dozens of mosques and Muslim student groups and investigated hundreds of them.The program was disbanded amid complaints of religious and racial profiling.The Detroit suburb of Dearborn is widely known as the hometown of Henry Ford, who hired Arabs and Muslims in the early days of the Ford Motor Co. and helped create what is now one of the nation's largest and most concentrated communities of residents who trace their roots to the Middle East.Kebba Kah, a 46-year-old Ford employee who was entering a mosque in Dearborn for evening prayers Tuesday, said the bombings in Brussels were ""a very terrible thing,"" and insisted such attacks are roundly rejected by all Muslims save for ""a few radical groups."""

Due to the crane fault, only 30 containers were loaded on to the vessel since March 17, trade sources said.When contacted, Krishnapatnam Port officials said they had received confirmation that the vessel would reach the port by early next week.India and Bangladesh signed a coastal shipping deal during November 2015 to promote coastal shipping, enhance bilateral trade between the two countries and bring down transportation costs for EXIM cargo. Bangladesh imports onion, rice, lentils, cotton, industrial raw materials and machinery.As per the deal, the vessel would call at the ports of Kolkata, Haldia, Paradip, Visakhapatnam, Kakinada, Krishnapatnam and Chennai, while in Bangladesh it would be at Chittagong, Pangaon ICT, Narayanganj, Ashuganj, Payra, Khulna and Mongla. The vessels first call would be at Krishnapatnam Port.CongestionCurrently, container goods are moved from and to Bangladesh either through Colombo or Singapore as Chittagong Port does not have a deep draft and hence smaller feeder vessels are deployed. Besides, rapid growth in bilateral trade between India and Bangladesh led to congestion on the road at Indo-Bangladesh border. Hence, the importers and exporters urged introduction of feeder service between India and Bangladesh, said trade sources.Out of a total of 1.8 million tonnes of cargo moved on Indo-Bangladesh protocol route during 2013-14, fly ash accounted for 98 per cent, which was transported from Kolkata to various river ports in Bangladesh. During the current year, India for the first time used the Indo-Bangladesh river protocol to transport food grains via Ashuganj to Tripura. However, the quantum of cargo has not picked up because of low draft in the upper reaches of Bangladesh rivers and also because of certain non-trade barriers, says a Shipping Ministry release."

The crowd was sizeable at Rodali Bibah Bhawan here.Goswami admitted that the problem of traffic snarls, especially in the railway gate crossing areas of Naali and Garali, was still unresolved. He said because of the model code of conduct, he could not announce his proposals, but said he would implement the plan if voted to power.Another problem was erosion by the Brahmaputra at the Daini Gaon area of Nimatighat.Taking a dig at the BJP's tall promises, he said Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised to bring down the prices of essential commodities, but masoor dal now costs Rs 110 a kg and price of mustard oil, which was Rs 80, is selling for Rs 140-50.""If this is achhe din promised by the government, then god help the people,"" Goswami said.Regarding his own achievements in 10 years, he said he had inherited an infrastructure so poor that putting things right had taken up most part of his tenure.From broadening and smoothening the main arteries to constructing 150km of roads and building four bridges including the Bhogdoi hanging bridge, Goswami enumerated each development activity to applause from the audience."
5923306e7be9e01fd59ad0d3,Why drought isn’t grabbing the headlines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/marathwada-maharashtra-farmer-suicide-why-drought-isnt-grabbing-the-headlines/,2016-03-31,"Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices.This time it has been a most unusual drought. Even with three consecutive bad crops (kharif 2014, rabi 2015, kharif 2015) and a fourth not-so-great one (thankfully, theres been no big damage from unseasonal rains/hail unlike in March 2015), the annual consumer food price inflation is only 5.3 per cent.In the past, droughts invariably fuelled speculation and hoarding by unscrupulous traders. This time were hardly feeling it in the cities. Barring sugar, where the price increase in recent weeks is more of a correction from unhealthy lows, consumers arent paying all that more for what they are eating compared to a year ago. No ones talking much about onion prices, either. Even arhar dal is selling cheaper than when it consumed the BJP in Bihars assembly elections during October-November; the same goes for urad, moong or masur.Simply put, this is a drought essentially of farmers and rural producers. And since it isnt really pinching urban consumers, politicians even in Maharashtra  where the drought is most acute  have found it more important to discuss whether not chanting Bharat mata ki jai amounts to treason. Incidentally, Asaduddin Owaisis defiant speech that set off this most-important debate was made at Latur in the droughts epicenter of Marathwada!For farmers, the current crisis isnt just of production loss from drought. It is also one of low price realisations. Farmers in Maharashtra are today selling cow milk at Rs 15-16 per litre, compared to Rs 25-26 a year ago.This, despite a severe fodder shortage that would also means higher production costs. In most crops  whether cotton, rubber, basmati, guarseed or even potatoes, apples, kinnow and pineapples  producer realisations are below what they were a couple of years ago. The only reason nobodys talking about onion these days is because the bulb is being sold in Maharashtras Lasalgaon market at below Rs 7/kg, as against Rs 12 last March and Rs 45-plus in early-September when pyaaz was grabbing all the headlines.Drought, in a sense, has only added to the miseries of rural producers who are simultaneously battling the effects of a global commodity crash which has hit agricultural exports and farm prices. That, in turn, also explains why urban consumers arent particularly feeling the heat of the drought: they have been shielded mainly by low global prices. Compare this to the situation in 2007 when international prices were on the boil and we had food riots everywhere, including in places like West Bengal.Right now, the drought is not about agriculture: The current rabi crop  whatever has been planted  is close to being harvested, if it has not already. The more immediate concern, instead, is about drinking water. With two-and-a-half months to go for the monsoon to arrive in the most parched areas and the countrys major reservoirs barely 25 per cent full, meeting peak summer drinking water requirements is going to be a challenge. It will be even more in Marathwada where reservoir water levels are down to 5 per cent of full storage capacity.The one consolation we have is global climate models pointing to a weakening of El Nino, which was the main cause of the 2015 drought. The 2015-16 El Nino was one of the longest, starting around February last. It is even now in a strong phase and is expected to enter neutral zone only towards May, according to the latest forecast of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Since there is usually a two-month or so lag between its effects translating into actual rainfall, one cannot rule out a delay in the monsoon even if turns out normal.The NOAA is also giving a 50 per cent probability of a La Nina  El Ninos opposite, which is beneficial for the Indian monsoon  developing from August. But that again would deliver good rains not earlier than in the second half of the monsoon. A delayed, but good, monsoon is what seems most likely now. And that would mean a minimum three-month wait before things finally look up.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

""What we never imagined was that it would be in Tashkent,"" says Sameer, who runs a small landscaping business in the city. The brothers set up a restaurant, 'The Gabbar's' in Uzbek capital Tashkent last year. ""It is a multi-cuisine restaurant and though we serve European, American and Chinese dishes too, Indian items are the most popular.""As part of an MIDC Industries Association's tour to Tashkent to scout for business opportunities, Sameer returned with the thought of opening a restaurant there. ""What attracts tourist to Tashkent is its prostitution business. But the place also has lot of sites of historical importance too,"" he says. ""Being the biggest producer of cotton, it gets a lot of Indian business travellers too. For them, just like as it was for us, food is a problem,"" says Wargantiwar explaining how he thought of setting up the restaurant. ""The markets sell a lot of Indian whole spices and lentils. Cooking and serving Indian dishes is easy,"" he adds.It took him and his younger brother Aniruddha, who is living in Tashkent now, nearly 1 years to get the documentation done and to find a place. ""After initial struggle, we could rent an old abandoned restaurant with a sprawling area of 8000sqft. We retained the furniture that came with it but had to redesign the kitchen to accommodate Indian style cooking,"" Wargantiwar says.Though most ingredients are available, yet it was a struggle. ""Wheat flour available is very sticky. So we had to try out many varieties before choosing Kazakhstan variety, which is suitable for tandoori roti and parantha,"" Wargantiwar says and adds he still carries curry leaves from India. ""We are using Pakistani basmati rice only for Biryani. For other dishes, I have been carrying and stocking rice taken from Nagpur."" The staff and chefs too are from the city.The locals are gradually warming up to Indian tastes. ""There are at least 25 regular customers who just tell me their mood and I select the menu for them,"" says Wargantiwar and adds they are serving five different varieties of butter chicken and even saoji chicken with mild flavours. ""Many visit us for vegetarian food and love dal, vegetable jalfrazie and paneer items that we serve."" The ambience is also very Indian. ""There are 182 Indian families who visit us regularly. We screen Indian films and also play Bollywood music,"" says Wargantiwar who believes that restaurant business is good for maintaining PR. ""Dignitaries of various countries come regularly. We were food partners during Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit here,"" he adds.The brothers want to single out developing countries for setting up restaurants. ""But our ultimate destination is Rome,"" says Sameer. Lauding the effort of the brothers, city businessman Jai Khemka, who has been to their restaurant twice, says, ""Service takes time but the food served is absolutely fresh."" Besides Indian, other cuisines too are good, says city eatery owner Sanjiv Bandhwar who too was there. ""The place has a lavish feel and locals, celebrities and dignitaries who visit enjoy the ambience,"" he adds."

5904b2b87be9e04154dfaaa6,"Amarkantak I – A university, a toilet and Swachh Bharat",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/twinkle-twinkle/amarkantak-i-a-university-a-toilet-and-swachh-bharat/,2016-04-05,"What does it mean to set up a university in the middle of nowhere? Above all, this expands access to higher education for remote populations. But the relationship of the university and its neighbourhood is multi-directional, especially when the university looms as a large embodiment of modernity in a space where tradition seemed dominant until now.The Indira Gandhi National Tribal University Act of 2007 parked the first Indian university of its kind, one that attracts majority tribal students and whose core strength is research on tribal culture and heritage, off the beaten track, in Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh.Having just returned from a visit to IGNTU, I want to share some of the experiences that seemed very striking and portentous. This first blog about these experiences is about some of the universitys rural neighbours and their expectations of it.The following video is taken early morning in Pamra village. You can get to it through a sylvan path through a hole in the university wall  on one side of which are the red and yellow buildings, departments, hostels, guesthouses, library etc and on the other side tamarind and sal trees, hibiscus and jack fruit, chirping birds, masoor fields, clean, cool and mud tiled huts. On that side the battle with plastic and waste has begun; on this side Swachh Bharat is not a struggle but salient reality  fruit of a simple, organic lifestyle. On this side, captured in the video, time seems to have stood still.In the fields seen in this video they are not even using pesticides. But not too far down the path there is some dodgy looking bauxite mining going on, digging ugly craters in the meadows, leaving toxic looking lakes in its wake.As we walked back to the university, a villager working a field along the path called us over and said the above-mentioned mine was without an extant lease, he had seen other such mines wreak havoc on agriculture in neighbouring villages, but the bullies running the mine just wouldnt listen, couldnt the university do something about it?A few hundred steps closer to the university another villager conveyed to us not a plea but a plaint. In her courtyard were piles of the masoor dal crop, she pointed to its poor health, expressed sorrow over the poor rains, and then said what made her life harder was that she couldnt even buy vegetables from the market now  because the university had sent prices through the roof!The lives of the university and its surrounding villages are now intertwined. It provides work and hope of a better life. But alongside better schooling and jobs will come more plastic, more demand for scarce water, houses built with heating tin rather than cooling muds, the danger of deforestation, the pressure to use pesticides to increase yields.Can the university progress by leaps while its surroundings remain as sylvan as today? Yes. For example, water harvesting lakes are being established across the campus. The new buildings have energy efficient architecture. Respecting the organic lifestyle of its rural neighbours will go a long way in preserving and reproducing it.Respecting context is critical. Below is a picture of a Swacch Bharat toilet we saw at the Farri Semar tribal village, a few hours uphill trek from the university. On spotting it, one was struck by wonder. Wow the government delivered! But of course behind the blue door we found piles of stray leaves  making it clear that this toilet is not even being used to store crops. Its completely out of place, absolutely pointless.For a people used to going in the forest and still surrounded by forest, whats the incentive for using the new toilet? We are talking about a sparsely populated mountain village practising organic self-sustaining farming. The springs here are not threatened by faeces and plastic but bauxite, which brings us to another key point. For villagers who have to carry drinking water up and down the mountain, whats the incentive to carry even more water for cleaning the Swachh Bharat Mission toilet? A water less model may have had more success here.Basic lesson is respect context. In doing this, IGNTU can set new benchmarks for a university at one with its environment. But no question, this will have to be a careful balancing act  some local features like health and education need to be modernised while others like cleanness, organic farming, low emission lifestyles, tribal art and culture, etc need to be conserved. Still, as Samuel Johnson said, Few things are impossible to diligence and skill. Great works are performed not by strength, but perseverance."
58f4f73f60de470aa339dfb9,Mamata in making on big screen,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160407/jsp/bengal/story_78790.jsp,2016-04-07,"Calcutta, April 6: Five years ago, her husband began to train her rigorously, if at rather odd hours, to walk the walk, talk the talk and raise the finger the right way. Ruma Chakraborty, who had acted as Mamata Banerjee in two jatra productions, is now Indira Banerjee in the forthcoming film Baghini (Tigress). Indira Banerjee and the Bengal chief minister have everything in common, except the first name. Ruma, who began as a theatre actor, says how her husband, a journalist who was also a theatre actor once, took her through the grind. ""He would come back at 1.30am, and we would go out to the streets,"" says Ruma. ""Walk like a woman who isn't afraid. Walk like someone who feels 'I do whatever I think is right',"" Ruma's husband told her as they stepped out of their one-room Beleghata home. He would follow her from a distance, scrutinising every step she took, even as men on the desolate streets threw lewd remarks at a lone woman. He told her that when Didi raised her hand, her fingers were splayed, and when she raised her index finger, it often did not point up, but sideways, and how Didi draped the anchal around her shoulders. ""Walk like someone who thinks she is the last word,"" he said. As Ruma sits quietly in a corner chair in Baghini director Nehal Dutta's office, she appears to have Didi's body language and posture, but there the similarity seems to end. Ruma's expression is gentle. Her smile, which does not go away, is gentle too. She cannot stop speaking, however, about the role that changed her life. (Left) Mamata Banerjee; Ruma Chakraborty Five years ago, when Mamata had just come to power, Ruma had got the offer to act as the new chief minister in a jatra. Banglay Khomota Ebar Mamata (Mamata is the power of Bengal) was her first performance as Mamata. The jatra, a huge success, ran for a year. Standing on the stage without a prop and looking at her vast audience, she felt, even if momentarily and vicariously, the power that one can have over people. ""People used to come to me with their problems after a performance,"" says Ruma. They would cry and touch her feet. In 2014, the same company produced Didi Tomar Jobab Nei (There's no one like you, Didi), and it was a great hit too. Now, Ruma is pinning her hopes on Baghini, which should be ready for release this month. Director Dutta allays fears that the movie would get into controversial issues. Jyoti Basu and Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee are both featured in the film, but no controversy, he insists. The film begins with a seven-year-old Indira/Mamata playing with friends when a car hits one of them. The little girl protests, saying the car owner can leave only over her dead body. The chief minister will be invited to the premiere, though there is no clarity on the release date. Ruma has not yet had Mamata attending any of her performances, though she has heard that recordings of her jatras have been given to the chief minister. Has the role changed her? Standing in front of the film's flex banner, Ruma thinks for a while and says: ""I was very soft. Now I can assert myself more."" Real Didi Age: 61Sari: Dhanekhali tant, white with green or blue bordersMunch: Puffed rice and tea throughout the day. A bowl of lentils and a fried fish for dinnerFitness: Walks everyday on the treadmill and goes for long walks during district toursFootwear: Slippers, brand not knownDecibel: Amake joto garjabe, ami toto borshabo.

5904b09f7be9e04154dfa79c,Farmers’ Income: Doubling them seems doubly harder for NDA government,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sanjeev-singh-blog/farmers-income-doubling-them-seems-doubly-harder-for-nda-government/,2016-04-08,"Prime Minister Narendra Modis push for accelerated growth in agriculture sector, and farmer friendly policies are welcome. One hopes it can bring some relief to our brothers and sisters in rural India who have been facing drought-like conditions for two successive years. Agriculture remains the primary occupation in rural India with nearly 60% households relying on it as their principal means of livelihood.When PM Modi confidently says that his government plans to double income of farmers in the next five years, one has to take it with a pinch of salt. Failure of previous two monsoons and falling prices of crops have brought the agriculture sector down to its knees. According to reports, India witnesses a deficit of 12% rainfall in 2014 and 14% less rain in the June to September southwest monsoon last year.Large share of our population depends on agriculture. Doubling of farmers incomes will have strong benefits for other sectors too: PM  PMO India (@PMOIndia) March 28, 2016The government has acknowledged that more than 4000 farmer suicides or those related to agrarian reasons have been reported across the country in 2015 alone. Maharashtra tops the list with 3228 among others.Ambitious schemes have been announced to improve conditions of farmers, like the soil health card, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (organic farming), Pradhanmantri Gram Sinchai Yojana (irrigation), more support to Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and creating National Agriculture Market. But recent statistics give us a dim view of the future.The government concedes that the average growth rate of agriculture and allied sectors for 2012-2016 has been 1.6% against the target of 4% per annum. The Minimum Support Price (MSP) for major crops in India saw marginal increase, the highest being for masur dal (4.2%), paddy (3.8%) and wheat (3.6%) in 2014-15 as compared to the previous year. With inflation rate hovering over 5%, Prime Minister has his task cut out.Though there is increased allocation of Rs 35,984 crore for farming sector along with governments target of Rs nine lakh crore for agriculture credit in the financial year, it needs to be distributed in a transparent manner. If the monsoon doesnt play truant, and schemes are implemented properly on the ground, this year has the potential to turn around the ailing sector and resurrect Indias food bowl."
5904af9d7be9e04154dfa5f7,"Amarkantak II – Two tribal brothers, a wild boar and desperately awaiting DBT",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/twinkle-twinkle/amarkantak-ii-two-tribal-brothers-a-wild-boar-and-desperately-awaiting-dbt/,2016-04-09,"This is the story of lessons learnt on a trek from the Indira Gandhi National Tribal University to the neighboring Baiga village of Farri Semar, in Amarkantak, Madhya Pradesh. As mentioned in my previous post in this series, in this tribal hinterland, the lives of the university and its surrounding villages are now intertwined.On the half day Farri Semar trek being discussed here, the guru was award-winning photo artist and tribal documentarist Manohar Kajal, the guide was Gond tribal and department employee Omkar Singh Marari, the students Nritya Gopal, Julee Rajput, Priyanka Sharma and Rohit Kumar Burman  all from the Department of Journalism & Mass Communication.The village is made up of sparsely scattered, large and many-roomed mud huts, sitting amidst dry looking fields of masri aka masoor dal and desi chana. The trees are pretty and beneficent  those eucalyptus and pine transplants happily didnt make much inroads here. There are majestic tamarinds. Char aka chironji. Mulberries and papaya. Tendu  its leaves make bidi but the fruit is surprisingly wholesome. Munga aka drumstick tree. Pakri whose leaves translate into a vegetable delicacy. And of course the rich red flowering semal, which gives the village its name, ready to bloom into cotton.Amongst the many joys of wandering through this idyllic looking and very friendly village, the students were pursuing two specific quests. To find and photograph the native Baiga tribals traditional hunting tools and to find out if the village elders were receiving their pensions.Although these two research questions appear distant at first glance, the uniting factor is that both seek answers among the elderly, with whose passing a whole way of life will pass away.In the first case the challenge was that with wildlife having become sparse and conservation laws having become strict, most houses have junked or sold their hunting tools  the youngest generation doesnt even remember what they looked like.In the second case while it quickly became evident that there was a serious problem in the pension flow into the village, the challenge was that the homesteaders had poor understanding of documents and rights and bank accounts  even speaking their own address in a way GoI would comprehend appeared an insurmountable trial. Forget Aadhaar numbers, many didnt seem to know their house number.Panku Baiga, above, is blind and 85 years old we are told. He should be getting Rs 500 a month under the Indira Gandhi National Old Age Pension scheme. His granddaughter said the family has been running after various village officials, finally there is a cheque in the pipeline but they havent gotten any money yet.About other schemes we heard talk of village officials passing on the monies after keeping a bit for themselves. We heard of a man who used to get a pension but then it stopped. We didnt meet anyone who admitted to getting a pension.The children of Panku Baiga do farming and small jobs. His hunting tools are also long gone. But his memories of them are vivid. He grins like a child talking about those days. Birds he hunted plenty. And some black bucks and wild boars. In the above picture he is showing us his hand, with half a thumb missing. It was lost in an epic battle with a really big boar  it took ten men to carry back that prey.A meander and some tendu and tamarind and water later, we found a family happy because of the recent birth of a little one. Their house, seen above, was large and super clean like most others in the village, with its roof speckled with drying herbs and vegetable greens.Here we met Mangal Baiga. He is 100 years old his family say. Hes lost his hearing. Hes not getting any pension either. Turns out hes Pankus elder brother!When we ask the family if they have any hunting tools they all sort of coyly giggle and say theyve given up all that sort of thing, everybody does farming now, whats left to hunt anyway. But a bit more persuasion and lo and behold. They bring out the bow and arrow and Mangal Baiga proudly poses with them.They dont hunt any more but we shouldnt touch that arrow tip because its coated in poison. Hmmm. Wonder why? Mangal Baiga refuses to toe this coy line. He still believes and says straight that the bow and arrow is the tribals true treasure.Well theres obviously little of it left. The pension could compensate. But neither 85 years old Panku Baiga nor 100 years old Mangal Baiga has ever seen it. This then underlines the imperative of spreading the Direct Benefit Transfer scheme fast. If DBT takes its own sweet time reaching this remote hamlet, death may win out."
58f553657be9e01a17c97307,"In a shop with no name, a dal with plenty of fame",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/nagpur/In-a-shop-with-no-name-a-dal-with-plenty-of-fame/articleshow/51760513.cms,2016-04-10,"Nagpur: Among the city's gourmands, 'Param ki dal' is legendary. On the 18,000-strong Nagpur Foodies group on Facebook, effusive praise of how Param ennobles the humble lentil dish into something sublime is common. At Satranjipura on Old Bhandara Road, inquiry about the dalwallah prompts almost reflexive pointing in the right direction. And yet, for a first-timer, the place might as well be invisible.Reason? The eatery has no real name. No board, however tiny or rickety, announces its presence. ""It's the place where all the big vessels are kept out front,"" a paan seller says.Like quite a few eateries in the West which similarly choose to make themselves obscure by not having any signage, Param remains hidden in plain sight, a haunt for only those who care to seek it out.And when they do, they can't stop licking their fingers. The tiny, ramshackle place with four tables and benches and a vestibule for a kitchen serves all of three things: Dal, tandoori rotis and a fried rice with tomatoes and onions, fried in butter until it goes a mellow brown. No wonder, the wait for a table can be as long as an hour and a half. Taking a parcel is the most sensible thing.Every other restaurant makes dal that is more or less tasty. So, what exactly is it about Param ki dal that draws the people here from far and wide? ""I honestly don't know, baauji,"" the painfully reticent owner, who identifies himself as only Param to this journalist, says. ""You will have to ask that to our customers."" Those who love it say the charcoal-fired tandoor gives it an unparalleled smoky flavour, and that the balance of flavours is perfect.Keeping an eye on a large vessel containing boiling dal and kneading dough for the roti, Param reveals that the eatery has been running since 45 years. ""My elder brother, my four sons and I run it,"" Param, a spindly Sardar with a silver beard and his trademark orange turban, says.Despite the rundown appearance of the place, Param insists that even families don't hesitate coming here to eat. ""The only problem is drunkards from the bars nearby,"" he says. True enough, a tipsy man soon totters in and demands food. He is promptly shooed away.Why don't they spruce up the place or move to a bigger location? ""No, no, we have a small business. We make a limited amount every day. This place is enough,"" he adds.It's true. The joint remains open for only five hours a day: 1pm to 3pm and 5pm to 8pm, or until stocks last. They never do. And when they run out, foodies fondly remember Param saying apologetically: ""Baauji, khana khatam ho gaya.""No matter. Tomorrow, they will return, like they always do, to the dal shop with no name."

And, the talented girl has already started supplying it to anganvadis in Bundu with the help of sevikas. ""I'm sure if sold in city markets, it would do very well. It has nutritious ingredients and is cheaper by about Rs 60 compared to popular baby foods. Marketing is very important,"" said the savvy girl who is excited to go to Japan. Anil, who is the son of a farmer, said he had grown up watching closed mines in Ramgarh, Kuju, Barkakana, Bhurkunda and Khelari, which to his mind was acute waste of land that could be put to use in farming with a little effort. ""I designed a model where I showed how closed mines could be reclaimed as agricultural land by preparing the soil bed. Farming yield apart, this project will also help save people from the harmful effects of coal dust,"" Anil said. Prithviraj who designed a blazer for the visually impaired, also said he wanted to help people with vision problems. ""My blazer has a remote-controlled sensor that can help a visually challenged wearer find his way. At the state-level science exhibition, judges appreciated my working model, which gave me confidence for the national meet,"" Prithiviraj said. Ranchi district education officer Raj Kumar Singh said they received the letter about selected Jharkhand students from the Centre last week. ""We were sure about Pushpa and Prithviraj from the reaction at the state-level display, but Anil's name came as a surprise. But, his model based on using closed coal mines as agriculture land was different. We wish all three good luck,"" he said. ? Do you know any talented youngster from a humble background?

5904b1107be9e04154dfa83f,Gaon with the wind: How Gurugram is all set to unleash a revolution in naming,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ruminations/gaon-with-the-wind/,2016-04-13,"So yet another name change has been sprung on us, Gurgaon now transformed to Gurugram through a government diktat. Gramted, this is the state governments prerogative, but does this mean all other villages and towns in India bearing a similar gaon suffix will be grammed down our throats?Will Jalgaon become Jalgram, and Malegaon  which already sounds like a sexist-chauvinistic outpost when pronounced in an Anglophonic way (instead of Malay-gaon, which it is)  become Malegram? What about Goas Margao, which had an n missing in the first place, even while it was being pronounced Mudgao by the locals? Should it become Margra or Mudgra?Or should we let bygaons be bygaons? What about our hallis and pallis? Our bads and purs? And our urs and ores? Do we rest on them?The whole thing is quite unsettling. Its tough enough to understand why we had to revert to Udhagamandalam (Ooty), Tiruchirapalli (Trichy) and Thiruvananthapuram (Trivandrum) that Brits had rescued us from. The argument was we needed to go back to Indian names. But there was nothing wrong with Gurgaon. It was as Indian as it could be. No one mistook it for Jaggery Town, and even that could have been fixed by inserting a U to make it Gurugoan, although folks in Goregoan, Mumbai may have frowned. Will Goregaon itself become Goregram now?Of course, it is entirely possible that in the bygaon era Gurgaon was indeed called Gurugram. But the name changers have not exactly proved themselves to be paragaons of propriety by effecting a largely meaningless change. It is a foregaon conclusion that more Indians associate the village with gaon than with gram, which is a lightweight western measure.If anything, its the grams in India that should have been changed to gaons (as in Sevagram to Sevagaon), although many a lentil would have wondered what comes next. That would have been mean to the bean. Wouldnt Greengram, Horsegram, and Bengalgram panic?Meanwhile, there is fallout from the Haryana diktat half-way across the world. America is going where it has not gaon before. Word is that the Pentagon will be renamed Pentagaon to convey Washingtons insistence on the old order being maintained. Garrison Keillor is writing an Indian version of his book called Lake Wobegaon Days, and Hollywood is coming up with remakes for the Indian market: Gaon With The Wind, Gaon Girl, Gaon Baby Gaon, and Going Going Gaon!But undeterred by American protests, the Haryana government has unveiled a masterplan to create several new townships to perpetuate its embrace of gram. After renaming Palam as Aerogram, the state government is placing all cardiac units in the state in a township called Angiogram. It will also create new townships around Gurugram for obese people (Kilogram), midgets (Milligram), spies (Cryptogram), loners (Monogram), and bisexuals (Oscillogram). Those who walk side-by-side will live in Parallelogram.The local bandar sena has also demanded the state government create a township called Telegram for those without internet connection, and Diagram for those with drawing disability. Writers and journalists have demanded their own township called Epigram, full of smart-assy grammarians and copy editors. They plan to hold an Annual Epigram Panchayat where they will bandy puns and bon mots.The state government has coined new slogans to encourage fealty to Gram Rajya. People have been advised to greet each other with Jai Gram Ji Ki and Gram! Gram! Funeral processions will proceed with chants of Gram Naam Satya Hai  for those who are dead and gaon."

The fear went through the mind of hundreds of residents who live near the collapsed Vivekananda Road flyover as they rushed to the street the moment they felt a tremor on Wednesday. Some who stayed back didn't waste another moment as they felt it a second time. But reality dawned soon enough. Safety is not guaranteed as a part of the flyover is still standing ominously.The fear was palpable as dozens of autos stand right under the flyover. In case of a disaster, there is no escape route as the midpoint of the 2km road under the cursed flyover is inaccessible due to the collapse and police barricades. Panic spread as the shopkeepers abandoned store and frantically searched for an open space, but there was none to be found. The flyover runs in a handshaking distance from most of the buildings and in two cases, it passes over two second-storey balconies.""When I felt the ground shake, I immediately came downstairs. I stayed put for 5-7 minutes but thankfully, the timespan was little so eventually I gathered the courage to go back to my first floor office,"" said Manoj Agarwal, who runs a lentil business at Posta.However, for the majority, the flyover collapse returned in a flashback. The first thought was that the rest of the flyover would come down. Several autos are parked underneath it and are packed with passengers when they leave. Coolies and daily wagers sleep on the footpath at the Posta Patti. Fearing an aftershock, or worse, they evacuated the area quickly.""We felt two jolts and immediately evacuated the building. The other 20-odd residents of the building too rushed downstairs in fear. But after waiting for a while, with a prayer on the lips and sigh of relief, we returned to our flats. The flyover collapse is still fresh in our mind,"" said Deepak Mishra, a businessman who lives in 1, Sethia House with his wife and schoolgoing daughter. The building is among those marked ""dangerous and unstable"" by the Kolkata Municipal Corporation.Jitters at MetroArun Adhikary, a resident of Beadon Street, was stuck in Sovabazar Metro station when he felt the tremor. A minute later came the announcement that the services will remain suspended for 'some time' due to an earthquake. Panic-struck, his co-passengers tried to rush out of the station. There's complete chaos for 10-odd minutes and things settled down following another announcement from the Metro.""It was really scary. My two-year-old daughter was on my lap. First I thought that I would come out of the station and catch a taxi. But then came the announcement that the services would begin in 10 minutes. I heaved a sigh of relief and decided to take the next train to Esplanade,"" Adhikary said standing outside Esplanade Metro station.Anindita Mukherjee, a resident of Tollygunge, however, did not take a chance and came rushing out of Chandni Chowk station when the earthquake stuck. ""I was waiting to catch a Kavi Subhas-bound train. But the thought of catching a train after I felt the tremor in the underground was quite horrifying. I simply decided to rush out of the station, fearing aftershocks,"" Anindita said.Rajesh Das, a RPF personnel on duty at Esplanade station, had to control a mad rush of commuters fleeing to safety after repeated tremors were felt. ""I myself was also feeling extremely uncomfortable after I was convinced that it was a case of severe earthquake. But then, I found people jostling to get out of the station. I tried to make them feel comfortable by asking them to stay back,"" Das said.At 8pm, a contradictory picture was revealed at the Esplanade station. Commuters, many of them shoppers, were seen making a beeline in front of ticket counters. "" I think Metro is the safest mode of transport in such a calamity,"" said Aniruddha Sen, who had come to New Market for a last-minute shopping for Poila Baisakh."

But that has not deterred him from losing 18 kg in three months.The flabby Fadnavis is determinedly following a disciplined metabolic treatment: a mix of medicines to enhance metabolism, a targeted diet as per his body type and activity level, and a weekly two-hour regimen.The results are just becoming conspicuous.From 122 kg when he first consulted a doctor in December, Fadnavis is now going on 104. His target to get that lean-mean look is 88-90 kg. If he keeps at his diet-exercise regimen with the same vigour he has had since February when he started it, he should achieve success in three more months.His doctor, Jayashree Todkar, a metabolic and bariatric surgeon, said, ""His evaluation went on for two months; we learnt his metabolism was flexible and could be enhanced by medical intervention. We started him on the medicines which had a collateral result, in clearing his problem of sugar intolerance.""When Mumbai Mirror contacted Fadnavis, he responded with, ""Sorry, that's too personal.Would not like to speak on that.""His wife Amruta, who inspired him to shed the flab, was happy to talk. ""He had lost weight earlier but gained it again due to work pressure and erratic schedule. After I started my weight loss programme and lost about 5-6 kg, he was inspired,"" said Amruta. She vouched that losing weight increases one's vigour and energy to work.Todkar told Mumbai Mirror that he was simultaneously asked to use a pedometer to gauge his activity level. ""While he has an erratic work schedule involving a lot of travel, it turned out that his activity level was pretty good. He not only goes above the required minimum of 10,000 steps daily, but also walks briskly,"" she explained. She said his weight gain was mainly because the diets he was prescribed earlier had not been helping him; according to sources, he has been one of the biggest names in the business - including Bollywood faves - for shedding weight.Holistic health guru Mickey Mehta was also roped into the regimen. He is training the CM in physical activity, which involves two hours a week of a lot of breathing exercises, agility-and-strength training and sport stretches. ""He gets merely four to five hours of sleep. The breathing exercises help in taking care of the sleep deprivation,"" said Mehta, who is also training Amruta. ""We are aiming to get back his athletic body by end of this year,"" Mehta added.According to Todkar, understanding metabolism is the crux of weight loss. ""Metabolism is a chain of events in the body which needs to be studied closely. It involves understanding the hunger pattern and satiety level and the process of breakdown of energy after consumption. With bad metabolism, the body begins storing things resulting in problems like obesity, cholesterol, blood pressure and diabetes, and all these ailments complicate each other too,"" Todkar said.His diet regimen is as per his palate and nutritional requirements.""Studies have shown that the hunger hormone graph shows elevation thrice in 24 hours. So three healthy meals in a day are enough to be energised and suffice the nutritional requirements of a person,"" said Todkar.Fadnavis now has three meals a day. His regimen has been fluctuating for the past three months but his current chart involves a balance of proteins and fats, minimised carbohydrates and fibre.Since he doesn't have a sweet tooth, he has been allowed the luxury of one cup of tea a day. But Fadnavis prefers sugar-free if he decides to sip on chai. His proteins involve a mix of vegetarian (paneer, lentils) and non-vegetarian (chicken, fish).His carbs come from bhakri, chapati or wholewheat bread. His sources of fibre are green vegetables and low-glycemic fruits like pomegranate, apple, jamun etc. He doesn't have to cheat to have butter or ghee; he is allowed both, though in moderation and not in dollops.""If you see his chart, he is allowed to eat all kinds of food. What is important is how the food is prepared. He is neither allowed outside food nor junk food,"" said Todkar."

Till now total imports and domestic procurement of pulses have increased by around 1.6 million tonnes.While another 16,000-17,000 tonnes are likely to reach Indian ports in the next two months for which contracts have been signed, the government has floated tenders for importing one more tranche of 10,000 tonnes.The consumer affairs ministry has now asked the state governments to project their demands for pulses so that timely release from buffer stocks can be ensured.""While private players have procured one more million tonnes of pulses this year  from 4.5 million tonnes last year to 5.5 million tonnes this year  we have procured 50,000 tonnes from domestic market. Import of 25,000 tonnes by government agencies has been contracted,"" said a consumer affairs ministry official.Already the state governments have been empowered to impose stock limits on pulses and enforce them to ensure availability and check hoarding.These steps are being taken as the latest WPI shows that the prices of pulses have remained steep with inflation at about over 34% than last year.On Monday, the average retail price of arhar across the country was Rs 140 per kg while urad was selling at Rs120 a kg. Prices of masoor and chana dal have increased marginally in the past one month. In Delhi, prices of urad, arhar, masoor and gram have jumped significantly. While urad dal price has increased by Rs 28 per kg in the last one month, arhar, masoor and gram prices have gone up by Rs 15, Rs 7 and Rs 7 respectively.India is the world's largest consumer and importer of pulses and they remain for most Indians the primary source of protein. Given their significance, it is really shocking that per capita output and availability of pulses today is even lower than at the time of Independence and that the country remains so dependent on imports to meet a large part of its requirement of pulses. Government policy needs to treat pulses as top priority given its importance in the Indian diet, particularly for vegetarians."

Primarily, the high cost of pulses in Maharastra, Chhattisgarh, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka - from where the state procures dal - is responsible for the price hike. Besides, the state government's norms - fixing the limit of stocking pulse - have also added to the consumers' woes. The retail prices of pulses have registered a hike varying from Rs 5 to Rs 15 per kilogram. At present, arhar dal is being sold at Rs 148 to Rs 150 per kg at the retail markets. The rate of chana dal has also gone up to Rs 80 to Rs 82 per kg against the retail price of Rs 73 to Rs 78 last week. There has been no change in the retail price of moong dal, which is being sold at Rs 85 to Rs 90 per kg. But, the prices of biri dal have gone to Rs 145 per kg from Rs 120 and the rate of masoor dal stands at Rs 85 per kg while it was being sold at Rs 75 at the retail markets last week. Harapriya Samal, a working woman from Jhanjirmangala, said: ""Rice is our staple diet, and our meal is incomplete without dal. So, we are now forced to buy dal at such high rates,"" said Samal. Malgodown traders, however, put the blame on bulk procurement by several multi-national companies, who are now procuring pulses from the farmers. The state requires seven lakh metric tonnes of pulses per annum, while only 80,000 tonnes to one lakh metric tonnes are produced here. A Cuttack Chamber of Commerce official said the pulses' prices were expected to rise due to the existing curb on stocking pulses. At present, a trader is only allowed to stock 750 quintals of pulses according to the government norms. ""If the stock limit is raised, then only the prices of pulses can be kept under control at least for a month despite the high procurement rate as there will be adequate stock to meet the requirement,"" said the official. ""Various big companies are now directly procuring essential commodities from farmers, and as the prices of pulses are high at the point of purchase, there has been a gap in the supply which has pushed the prices,"" said Cuttack Chamber of Commerce joint secretary Prafula Chatoi, who said they had submitted a memorandum to the district administration demanding an increase in the stock limit for traders to 5,000 quintals. On the other hand, Cuttack collector Nirmal Chandra Mishra convened an emergency meeting to review the situation here today, and the Malgodown traders were asked to report the wholesale and retail prices on a daily basis. ""There is an adequate stock at Malgodown. We also urge the consumers not to resort to panic buying as the wholesale prices at Malgodown have been stable for the past two to three days,"" said the collector."

Wholesale and retail prices have shot up simultaneously. Prices of pulses, which have been rising since a year, still continue to move in the upward direction, hitting the common man's budget hard.While the prices of arhar and masoor dal have gone up to Rs 160 per kg from Rs 110 a month ago, chana dal which was Rs 70 per kg a month ago now costs Rs 130 per kg. Similar spurt in prices has been witnessed in the cost of moong and urad dal.However, according to city-based retailers, the hike is a temporary phase and the prices will go down within a week or two. Though there has been an abrupt hike in prices, it is temporary. ""The price of pulses are usually stable in nature and the recent hike in price is mainly due to shortage of dal production and also because of bulk buyers who create a shortage in the wholesale stock. It is demand like these that attribute to rise in lentil prices,"" a retailer Rajkumar Verma said.He further said that sugar prices are also on the rise and have shot up by Rs. 3-5 per kg. ""It is not just the spiraling price of pulses but even the sugar price has shot up by Rs. 3-5 per kg"", said Verma.Another retailer-cum-wholesaler at Khojwa area, Prince Kumar, attributed the price situation to drought destroying large portion of pulse crops thus, flaring up the prices. Arhar dal has seen the most dramatic increase among staples with the wholesale price recording a rise of 25% in a month.Meanwhile, denizens have started to cut down on the consumption of pulses and are opting for cheaper lentils. ""We were not expecting hike in prices of pulses anymore after suffering in October last year. Although the prices have not shot up as compared to previous year, yet if the trend continues it will soon have to be replaced with other alternatives so that my family gets required amount of protein, said Riddhi Sinha, a housewife."

Within a week, it has touched 150 per kg from Rs 120 per kg.According to market sources, poor yield in Bundelkhand and Madhya Pradesh has soared the prices.UP Dal Miller Association president Mithlesh Gupta said that Bundelkhand in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh were the main producers of arhar. Production was low due to draught in these areas.Farmers are selling their produce at high cost, as a result prices in open market rose. Hoarders too were exploiting the situation. He informed that impact of arhar dal had made the price rice in other pulses. Gram pulse, which was available for Rs 61 per kg on April 3 had recorded a hike of Rs 12 to 13 per kg. At present, gram dal was Rs 72 to 73 per kg.The traders expect that the prices may go up further and suggested that the government should import lentils to meet the domestic demand and take stern action against hoardersThe country consumes around 18 to 19 million tonnes of arhar, whereas production is around 14 to 15 million tonnes."

It will give unmilled tur dal at Rs 66/kg and urad at Rs 88/kg to states for retail sale. The states are expected to process and sell the pulses at not more than Rs 120/kg.States have also been asked to keep a close watch on the prices and to take stringent action against hoarding of the commodity. The Centre has already empowered the states to impose stock limits on the pulses to ensure easy availability, an official statement said after the decision.Prices of urad dal have reached Rs 200 per kg in the retail market while that of tur or arhar have reached Rs 170 per kg despite the wholesale price inflation moving into the negative territory for the past 17 consecutive months and the government claiming that prices of food items have stabilised.Besides production being less than the current requirement of pulses, hoarding is one of the main reasons why pulses have remained costlier in the past as many months.To check this, certain states have asked wholesale traders to submit daily sales report to the local administration. Traders have also been asked to submit rate chart of different variety of pulses. Stock verification of godowns is also being conducted on a daily basis in certain states, an official said.Pulses production in the country is expected to be 170 lakh tonne in 2015-16 crop year while the requirement is estimated to be 235 lakh tonnes. The government has procured 50,000 tonnes of pulses while 25,000 tonnes is expected to be imported in due course. Besides, the FCI is also creating a buffer stock of pulses under which a stock of 2 lakh tonne will be available.The government is also initiating procurement of rabi pulses and has targeted to procure around 1 lakh tonnes of black gram and masoor to build buffer stocks.Despite being the largest producer of pulses in the world, India imports the commodity as the domestic demand is far greater than the production.Pulses production, however, is expected to be better this year after the Met department predicted better monsoon rains in the Central India where the commodity is produced on a large scale."

Till now total imports and domestic procurement of pulses have increased by around 1.6 million tonnes.Pulses price on rising trend again, arhar cost up by 45% The price of dal', especially arhar' has started showing an upward trend yet again.In a span of just a fortnight, there has been a spike of over 45% in the price of pulses like arhar, masoor and chana. Wholesale and retail prices have shot up simultaneously.Like the Terminator, high prices of pulses are back. And production data shows that there is not much hope for any respite. Overall, production is estimated to increase by just 1%, as the second consecutive drought year takes its toll. Tur or arhar (pigeon pea), one of the most popular dals, has taken a hit with its production dipping by 9% from last year, and by 20% over 2014-15. Other pulses too are expected to see decline in production, bringing the total pulse production down by 12% compared to the non-drought year of 2013-14. This is ironic because 2016 has been declared the International Year of Pulses by the United Nations.The government seems to be more alert this time compared to last year, having imported about 5.1 million tonnes of pulses till January this year compared to 4.1 million tonnes last year. But international markets are equally on the ball. Canada and Australia had both planted increased acreage of pulses, expecting good prices. Last year, India had imported 1.5 million tonnes of pulses from Canada, nearly 30% of its total production. This year, Canadian farmers planted 5.1 million acres of lentils, up by 30% from last year, and 4.3 million acres of peas, a rise of 16 % according to data from Statistics Canada. This is because corn and wheat prices are running low and Canadian farmers are looking for better bucks from India.Australian farmers have sown a record 5,64,000 hectares of pulses in 2015, mainly chickpea (chana), but production is only slightly better than 2014 due to adverse weather in some parts. By November, some 3 million tonnes of lentil will be ready in Australia, according to Pulse Australia. Trade experts say that good crops are also in the offing from neighbour Myanmar and from African nations like Tanzania, Uganda, Mozambique and Malawi.But there's a rub. Canadian stocks are already sold out, as are Australian chickpea crops. International trade experts say that African output will become available in the second half of this year. Meanwhile, the deficient monsoon that affected crops in India has also severely brought down pulses production in Pakistan, another big consumer.In other words, the international demand is going to be very high even as stocks are limited and fast running out. This means high prices for import into India under constrained conditions.Currently, international prices of lentil (Rs 51 per kg), tur (Rs 80 per kg) and chana (Rs 45 per kg) are lower than domestic prices in India. But given the tight global supply position this spread may vanish in the coming months, spurred by increasing import orders from India and Pakistan. Global prices of moong (Rs 75 per kg) and urad (Rs 105 per kg) are already higher than the Indian domestic prices.The government will have to not only ensure quick buying in international markets but also streamline offtake from ports where last year huge stocks were held up causing prices to rise in the markets.But all this is firefighting. Unless production of pulses is boosted through better seeds, better support prices, and procurement the aam aadmi will have to continue suffering protein pangs."

Three consecutive droughts, with bouts of hailstorms and unseasonal rains, had dented his morale. He wanted to defend whatever little crop he managed to grow on his four-bigha land from stray animals which raided his fields in the dark.He had started to look tense and desperate. He even reduced his food intake, said Musrus son Mayaram.Musru, who owed Rs 1 lakh to moneylenders and relatives, was found dead the next morning. The post-mortem report could not ascertain the actual cause of his death, but his family, villagers and local officials believe he was the latest in the list of  sadma  (shock) deaths that have stalked the parched landscape of Bundelkhand. In Banda itself, nine such deaths have been reported in the last two months, District Magistrate Yogesh Kumar said.To witness the agrarian crisis, all one needs to do is drive through the parched region, past its definitive yellow and brown landscape. Swathes of land lie unused as farmers did not sow this season given the absence of irrigation facilities and crippling water crisis. Some took a chance, seduced by light showers, only to face huge losses later.Musrus family had borrowed the seeds and fertilizer, and even leased land at much higher costs. The burden has now shifted to his son Mayaram, whose plans to migrate were shattered by his fathers death. He now has to take care of three younger brothers. While politicians are building farm houses, farmers are forced to abandon their farms, said Mayaram, who remains without a job despite a graduate degree in education and a post-graduate degree in economics.Rising suicidesAccording to activist Sanjay Singh, around 18 lakh people have migrated from Bundelkhand over the years. Since 2003, 3,500 farmers are estimated to have committed suicide in the region. The figure this year is already 174, said Mr. Singh.While the agrarian distress has shattered the hopes of smaller peasants, even the big farmers are at a loss, many engaging in distress sale of grain and cattle. The poor quality of grain is also making it harder to sell. The Food Corporation of India accepts six per cent shrinkled grain but the farmers samples [with around 12 per cent shrinkled] are failing the FCI standards. They are engaging in distress sale much below the MSP of Rs.1525 per quintal. We have requested the government to relax the norms, said Mr. Kumar.The area under cultivation has shrunk and, consequently, the output of major crops has fallen sharply. Those relying solely on farming have been pushed to the brink.Farmers dont have enough to eat, forget about recovering the money for the cost of fertilizers, seeds, or selling it in the market. We were better off without sowing anything, said Munna Lal, a farmer in Hamirpur, who could only salvage two quintals of wheat after increased investment.The figures for the Chitrakoot Division explain it all. The overall output of wheat in the mandal has halved in the past three years. If in 2012-13, the output was 23.87 quintals per hectare, in 2015, the figure plummeted to 11.28 quintals. In 2016, it is just one-third. Chana dal (chick pea) also did not fare well. Production has fallen consistently from 3.25 quintals per hectare in 2014 to a meagre 1.75 quintals in 2015. The production of peas, masur and jowar has also fallen substantially.The total area under cultivation for the rabi crop in Chitrakoot division has halved in a year. In 2014-15, the cropped area was 8,90,982 hectares as against a target of 9,22,057, while 3,01,74 hectares were left uncultivated. The figures for the 2015-16 season are, however, much worse: against a target of 9,42,013 hectares, the cultivated area was a paltry 4,20,051 hectares. Significantly, 5,21,962 hectares were left uncultivated.The kharif crop production has been much below the State average. Rice output in 2014 was 16.17 quintals per hectare against the State average of 22.67, while bajra was 9.71 quintals per acre (State average was 19) and arhar dal (red gram) was only 3.85 quintals per hectare against the State average of 8.20.To address the crisis, the Akhilesh Yadav government has allotted Rs 867 crore for the damage to crops this year. The State suspended all revenue collection till March 31, while increasing the working days under MGNREGS from 100 to 150 days. From April, it also implemented the Food Security Act, under which food grains would be distributed for free for four months, and introduced 100 per cent coverage of all eligible families under the Samajwadi Pension Scheme. The government launched the Samajwadi Drought Relief programme, under which antyodaya families would get relief material of 10 kg of wheat flour, five kg of rice, five kg of chana dal (chick pea flour), 25 kg of potatoes, five litres of mustard oil, one kg pure ghee and one kg of milk powder.While observers have praised the State governments drought response measures, some feel the real test is in ensuring their implementation. While travelling for this story, this correspondent found that many villages were yet to even have their lists of FA beneficiaries ready. Officials blame the administrative mechanism and system of distribution for the delays and lapses."

The Cabinet approved a Rs 5,000-crore loan restructuring plan for farmers whose kharif crops were ravaged by drought in 2015-16.In what is being seen as an attempt to blunt the Oppositions plan of projecting unrest among certain sections as signs of the governments dipping popularity, the ruling BJP in Maharashtra unveiled several populist measures on Wednesday.Reaching out to the middle class, the Cabinet adopted a draft legislation aimed at regulating and capping prices of pulses, which have witnessed a spike in recent days. Further, with the Opposition targeting it over its failure to rein in farm distress triggered by drought, the government doled out fresh sops for the farm sector.The Cabinet approved a Rs 5,000-crore loan restructuring plan for farmers whose kharif crops were ravaged by drought in 2015-16.Cooperatives Minister Chandrakant Patil said that 48.41 lakh farmers had availed loans totalling Rs 29,680 crore from lending institutions for kharif cultivation in 15-16.It has now been found that farmers in 27,609 drought-hit villages have run into loan arrears worth Rs 5,000 crore. These farmers would not have been eligible for availing a new loan in 16-17 unless the arrears were paid off. So the Cabinet decided to restructure the repayment schedule for these loans, which will now be spread over five years. The state will bear the whole interest amount due in the first year for such loans, whereas for the remaining four years, 50 per cent of the interest will be paid by the state, Patil said.Simultaneously, the government also advanced loan repayment schedule for the Rs 3,503-crore loans availed by 5.33 lakh farmers in 2014-15, which were similarly reconstructed last year. Despite the states tight financial position, the government has also decided to approach the Reserve Bank of India to restructure loans worth Rs 2,439 crore, availed by farmers in 2012-13 and 2014-15.Meanwhile, Food and Civil Supplies Minister Girish Bapat claimed that Maharashtra was the countrys first state to adopt a price control mechanism for pulses. Following the Cabinet nod, Bapat said the draft legislation would be sent to the Centre for Presidential assent.Once the assent comes, a notification for its implementation would be brought out. Rules of business will be readied before that, he said.The Devendra Fadnavis government had come under criticism when tur dal prices shot up to Rs 200 per kg last October. With drought adversely impacting production of pulses this year too, there has been a hike in retail tur dal prices recently.Bapat said the draft legislation would apply to the sale of tur dal, black gram, green gram, lentils, beans, etc,across the state. But the capping rate would vary for different areas, since transportation costs and local factors would have to be taken into account, he said.Bapat also said the cap will be different for producers of pulses and for those involved in its trade.The government would fix the prices taking into account the availability of pulses, demand and supply, among other factors, he said. Rates once fixed will be applicable for a maximum of six months. To control an artificial spike in prices, the draft legislation makes it mandatory for producers and dealers to record sale by providing authentic receipts to the buyers.Bapat also said that the government was mulling a plan of asking producers and traders to display the maximum retail price on the sale product itself, but said this was challenging as dal was often sold loose. Provisions of penalising and imprisonment of up to one year for those violating norms have been made, Bapat said.Senior government sources, however, conceded that till the Act is implemented, the government will have to rely on inspection drives to check hoarding and improve supplies as its main tool to control prices. Instructions have been issued to district collectorates and the District Supply Officers (DSOs) to be vigilant and check hoarding of pulses, a senior official said. Stocking limits imposed for tur dal by the Centre are in force till September 30, 2016. Bapat also informed that discussion was on in the state and the Centre over the feasibility of announcing fixed remunerative prices for tur dal.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government has written to the Centre for allotment of 2.12 lakh quintal of tur dal purchased by the Food Corporation of India and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Fedration of India Limited from farmers in Maharashtra for buffer stock.WATCH INDIAN EXPRESS VIDEOS HEREFor all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
58fb4c5da3d24b44f321e9ae,Parsi indulgence on a plate,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/parsi-indulgence-on-a-plate/article8539730.ece,2016-04-30,"hicken farcha, dhansak, patra ni machhi, lagan nu custard dishes weve probably heard of, and dreamed of eating. But what do you do when you have no Parsi friends to invite you to their homes and weddings where you can sample any of these delicious-sounding treats?Chef Perzen Patel is your best bet. The founder of Bawi Bride Kitchen, a city-based Parsi catering and food delivery service, believes in sharing the best her cuisine has to offer.The whole thing started with Patels blog of the same name. She was in the hospitality industry and lived in New Zealand for nine years, and moved back to India to get married.A little while later, in 2013, she started the blog. It was an attempt to chronicle my amusing attempts at learning to cook Parsi food, she says. And as I started documenting recipes, my readers started asking where they could find this food, as its not very accessible. So, I originally started this as a weekend catering service.Last January, she took up Bawi Bride full-time. While there are several Parsi caterers in the city and food festivals do feature the cuisine, there is a dearth of restaurants where one can get a regular fix of delicacies like dar ni pori (sweetened lentils stuffed in pastry). In recent times, there has been a lot of interest around Parsi food, but it still continues to be available in only a few places in certain cities, Patel says. Only some dishes are known of, but obviously, there is a lot more to the cuisine than dhansak. Her recipes are from all over: her family, friends, their families, old recipe books. One of the favourites is a cheese-and-egg cutlet recipe that a friend of mine shared. Her grandmother used to make it for her during the summer holidays.Patel says, I have done pop-ups regularly in Mumbai, and an 11-day food festival with JW Marriott. She is looking forward to doing more events outside the city, especially those that dont have a huge Parsi presence.When it comes to the actual dishes, a hallmark of Parsi food is that it is khatta-meeta (sweet and sour), she says. For that, we use a very special kind of vinegar that comes from Navsari in Gujarat. Then there are the traditional masalas for dhansak and sambhar.As for vegetarians, while there isnt much available, she makes do by keeping the base flavours authentic and swapping the meat-based protein with vegetables or paneer. Caterers usually get scared when they hear the word vegetarian, and more so if it is to be eggless. Thats a double whammy! However, I try to keep the essential flavours the same. So, we have a wedding-style stew with root vegetables and a lot of cashews, dates and raisins; its called lagan sara istoo . We also make kaju paneer, adapted from kaju chicken, and vegetable pulao.At some point, Patel wants to open a restaurant serving Parsi food. Yet, she still keeps her blog active. Parsi food is spoken about with reverence, but she intends to make it accessible, and let people know that they too can cook it.Not many caterers will share their recipes, she laughs. But its not like they are a big secret. I shared the recipe for curry rice  thats on our menu  and someone from the US tried it and wrote to me saying it reminded them of their grandmother. Its a real feel-good factor when someone can relive memories through food.Only some dishes are known of, but obviously, there is a lot more to the cuisine than dhansakThe Wedding FeastThe guests are seated on long tables and the food is served on banana leaves.The chicken, mutton, and fish course are served at the same time, with rice.Dishes like patra ni machhi (steamed fish wrapped in banana leaf) are easy to make, but cooked only on celebratory occasions.The menu rarely changes; it has seven to eight dishes that are always present.Vegetarian dishes are few and far between."

The incentive will also be over and above the one-time bonus of Rs. 75/quintal already granted for chana (gram) and masur (lentil) last Rabi season, officials said.The proposal to grant additional incentives from the States side has been prepared by the Agriculture Department, which is now seeking to answer questions raised over growth of water-intensive crops in drought-hit regions like Marathwada, where some experts have pointed out excess consumption of water, attributing to crops like sugarcane, banana, grapes and oranges, which are mostly groundwater dependent.Senior officials said the decision taken will give a strong price signal to farmers to increase acreage and invest in improving production of pulses. It was about time we took a strong stand from our side to send a message to farmer to increase acreage in other crops and not only sugarcane. Merely telling him not to grow any particular crop does not make much sense anyway, said a senior official.The Centres current minimum support price (MSP) for tur (pigeon peas), urad (black gram whole), moong (green gram), masur (lentil), currently stands at Rs. 4,625/ quintal, Rs. 4,625/ quintal, Rs. 4,850/ quintal and Rs. 3,425/ quintal.However, experts said the State intervention is too little too late. With market prices for pulses hovering two times the MSP  tur trading over Rs. 10,000 and Urad around Rs. 15,000  increasing the MSP or even adding an incentive over and above that will not serve as a motivating factor for the farmers, experts said.The governments intentions are good, but even if assuming that the Centre increases the MSP next season by say 10% and we add another 10% incentive of the State, it will still be way below the market price to influence the planting decisions of the farmer in October when he actually takes a call on what to sow, said Nitin Kalantari, of Kalantari Foods Ltd, a prominent trader in the State.Some others pointed out that procurement must continue even as the government was looking at bonuses and incentivising the use of pulses.At most times, the State machinery does not procure even when prices hit below or around MSP, We have to petition the local collector to start procurement but the implementation of the MSP is poor in the districts, said Lalit Shah, of the APMC, Latur."

58f718f7a3d24b0b70c31fcd,The season of scorching ironies,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-season-of-scorching-ironies/article8557920.ece,2016-05-05,"Irony. This one word captures our response to the ongoing nationwide drought in more ways than one. We have woken up to the reality of drought a full six months after the end of monsoon. After waking up, we focus on the drinking water crisis in urban centres and not the multidimensional crisis of life and livelihood in rural hinterland. A petition on a cricket tournament, rather than the plight of the people and its real culprits, has triggered media attention to the drought. Finally, it is the apex court of the country, and not its Parliament, that has found time to pay attention to serious issues of drought relief and mitigation.On April 26, the Supreme Court concluded its hearing on a historic case. In an extraordinary gesture, the apex court of the land accorded highest priority to this case involving the plight of the last person affected by the second back-to-back drought in the country. Swaraj Abhiyan had filed this petition in the middle of December last year, following the failure of monsoon and early reports of rural distress. Over the last four months, a two-judge bench of Justice Madan B. Lokur and Justice N.V. Ramana held 14 hearings, running into nearly 40 hours. That is much more than the total time devoted during this period to drought by the Parliament and all the State legislatures put together.The colonial mindset persistsWhat makes this case truly historic is not just the time and attention it received, but the range and nature of questions it involved. Starting as a petition for immediate drought relief, this case has grown into a judicial review of the state policy on rural distress and agrarian crisis. This case could well mark a transition from the colonial framework to a constitutional framework of responding to a natural disaster like drought. During the British Raj, documents called Famine Codes laid down how the government was to act during famine-like conditions. The colonial approach was, naturally, minimalist and stingy. The idea was to spend as little money as possible while avoiding loss of lives.This colonial mindset continued to inform the administrative approach to drought even after independence. Famine Codes continued in one form or another. Democratically elected governments brought about some improvements like Maharashtras Employment Guarantee Scheme (which inspired the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme or MGNREGS), Public Distribution System and Mid Day Meal scheme. Technology for forecasting and tracking droughts has grown in leaps and bounds. Yet the governmental practices continued to be archaic and conservative. The patwari continues to be the eye of the government; annawari or paisawari is still the method to determine crop failure and the farmers continue to be paid ridiculously low amounts as crop-loss compensation, and that too after delays and bribes.Need for a new frameworkSwaraj Abhiyan contended in the Supreme Court that it was time to shift to a new framework based on citizen entitlements, fuller responsibilities of the constitutional governments for drought relief, emphasis on drought mitigation and elimination of arbitrariness and political patronage from drought declaration and relief operations. Lawyer Prashant Bhushan argued that many elements of this new framework were already in place. The country has a Disaster Management Act of 2005 that gives special powers and responsibilities to the Central government. We now have a National Disaster Management Authority headed by the Prime Minister. The Manual of Drought Management of 2009, a comprehensive document issued by the Ministry of Agriculture of the Union government, can replace the archaic Famine Codes. Finally, all the weather station and remote sensing-sourced data has been brought together in the form of Agricultural Drought Assessment Report issued for major States every month by the Mahalanobis National Crop Forecast Centre. Someone needs to bring all this together and operationalise it.This should normally be the responsibility of the executive. The Central government and the various State governments were expected to give life to this new framework. However, this case brought out the sheer lack of political will on the part of democratically elected governments to extend elementary entitlements to their own citizens. The Central and the 12 State governments, the respondents in this case, were repeatedly found unaware of their own regulations and unwilling to implement these. The court witnessed games of procrastination and passing the buck, and was constrained to comment on this more than once.Strangely, it was left to the petitioner to place on record all the key documents of the Government of India. In the course of the hearing, the Central government was forced to concede that it had not fulfilled many of its statutory obligations. The National Disaster Policy required under the Disaster Management Act did not exist. The Disaster Mitigation Fund proposed under the same Act has not been created. The National Disaster Response Force did not have any expertise to deal with the drought. It also admitted that the Centre had delayed releasing assistance to States under the National Disaster Response Fund.The Government of India did not even have the correct count of the number of people affected by the drought. The figure of 33.6 crore that it submitted to the court caused nationwide concern. In fact this was an under-estimate. The correct count of the population in areas officially declared drought-affected so far is about 43 crore. And if you take into account the districts that should have been notified but have not been so far, the total drought-affected population in the country is a staggering 54 crore, about two-fifth of the country.Using the MGNREGSThe most startling disclosures related to the MGNREGS. This scheme could have been one of the most efficient drought relief measures and should have been used generously during the last two years. Instead, the government was not even paying for the work that had already been done. At the end of fiscal year 2015-16, the governments owed more than Rs.12,000 crore as pending liabilities which needed to be cleared before payments could be made in 2016-17. It also turned out that the Central government was violating its own Master Circular in not releasing the full first tranche for MGNREGS amounting to over Rs.45,000 crore (while the much touted total budget for it is Rs.38,500 crore) that was due in the first week of April. Also, the government is paying lower than statutory minimal wages to MGNREGS workers.The court proceedings bared the real intentions of the regime. Belying the Prime Ministers pro-farmer and pro-poor rhetoric in public, the Central government argued that it had done all it could for drought mitigation and more than beyond its means. The governments counsel said that the state was not under any legal compulsion to offer additional dal (lentil) and edible oil in ration or milk or egg in the mid-day meal scheme as demanded by Swaraj Abhiyan. The government claimed that there was enough fodder for cattle and that all necessary steps had been taken to resolve drinking water shortage. In any case, the Central government claimed that drought relief and mitigation was the responsibility of the State governments and that it respected the spirit of federalism. This faith in federalism was touching, coming in the wake of developments in Arunachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand.The various State governments either pretended that all was well or used resource crunch as alibi. The cases of Gujarat, Haryana and Bihar came up for special scrutiny, as these States had not declared drought despite substantial rainfall shortage. Expectedly, the court was quite scathing in its remarks on these States.Apex court to the rescueGiven this lack of political will, Swaraj Abhiyan had to turn to the court for a paradigm shift in the way the state responds to drought. It requested the court for three kinds of reliefs. First, Swaraj Abhiyan invoked Right to Life under Article 21 to claim some immediate drought relief measures for six months in the drought-affected areas: universal access to food-grain quota, additional 2 kg of dal and one litre of edible oil for each household (following the Tamil Nadu model), one egg or glass of milk everyday in the mid-day meal and extension of the scheme during summer vacations. It has also argued for implementation of the drought manual on drinking water and fodder, especially its recommendation of reservation for drinking water and setting up of cattle camps.The second set of relief sought is medium to long term. This involves removing the informal cap on MGNREGS and ensuring adequate funds for employment generation, especially during the drought; restructuring of farm loans on the same lines as the famous restructuring of corporate loans; and raising crop-loss compensation to cover at least the cost of cultivation. Finally, the petitioners have pleaded for a change in the archaic and arbitrary practices of declaration of drought and fixing the responsibilities of the Central and State governments in handling a disaster of this kind. The Abhiyan has urged the court to appoint independent commissioners to monitor the implementation of court orders.The judgment has been reserved by the Supreme Court and is expected any day. Judicial scrutiny so far has already forced various governments to move on drought relief. The Central government has had to agree in the court to increase the first instalment of MGNREGS funds from Rs.7,000 crore to over Rs.19,000 crore and to clarify that there is no budget cap on the scheme. It also agreed to revise the rates of crop-loss compensation and implement it in the coming financial year. After dragging their feet for over two years, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh governments were forced to implement the National Food Security Act.It is only befitting in this season of ironies that the substance of this case has largely escaped national attention. On April 27, the Supreme Court was in the news concerning drought  but it pertained to the court confirming the High Court stay on IPL matches in Maharashtra!Yogendra Yadav is with Swaraj Abhiyan and is the National Convener of its Jai Kisan AndolanBelying the Prime Ministers pro-farmer and pro-poor rhetoric in public, the Central government argued that it had done all it could for drought mitigation and that drought relief and mitigation was the responsibility of the State governmentsIt is the Supreme Court and not Parliament that has found time to pay attention to serious issues of drought relief and mitigation for hundreds of millions of Indians"

Sources said food and civil supplies commissioner Rajesh Prasad, who chaired the meeting, impressed upon the traders about the need to comply with the dos and don'ts issued by the local administration to check prices or face action. This after a section of sellers spoke about their ""limited"" role if prices are high at the source, their alleged harassment during ongoing raids and why there was no hue and cry when prices of petrol products fluctuated frequently. As reported in today's edition of The Telegraph, the meeting held at the Circuit House was attended by representatives of wholesalers, retailers, chambers of commerce, railways, Indian Oil Corporation and officials of supply, agriculture, Fishfed and veterinary departments. The meeting was necessitated following the bad press both the state and Union governments had been receiving over price rise. The meeting, sources said, was held in a ""cordial"" atmosphere and the stress was on ""identifying"" the problems and fixing it through ""all-round"" cooperation. A slew of measures (see chart) aimed at both officials and traders were initiated during the meeting where issues connected with the market came to the fore. Sources said vegetable, poultry and fish wholesalers said prices of their products were more or less stable but there was something amiss with the retail market. ""For instance, a kg of parwal/patal (pointed gourd) is Rs 18 kg in the wholesale market but the same item is being sold for Rs 60 a kg in the retail,"" a source said, quoting a wholesaler. There was a discussion to issue receipts to retailers. Vegetables, poultry products and fish do not fall under notified essential items. ""A slight rise in their prices adversely affects household budgets, sparking off heated discussions on and beyond the dining table. This is something we are witnessing now,"" one of the sources said. As part of the measures, the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board was asked to set up 10 more shops by finalising the location of the plots with help from the district administration. ""There are two markets now. A committee has been formed to finalise the venues within May 10. The wholesalers were asked to upload prices on a daily basis so that it is in the public domain,"" the source said. The task force/enforcement teams in the districts will continue to raid places dealing in food items. Traders warned that prices of potato and pulses, which have stabilised, will see a rise soon because of likely rise in prices at source. ""A few more meetings will be held,"" an official said, indicating that the administration was unlikely to ease the pressure on those dealing in food items. Jorhat shop The Jorhat district wing of the Jatiya Mahila Parishad, a sister concern of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, today set up shop in front of Jorhat Court building and named it Modi Bazar in protest against the high prices of essential commodities. The shopkeeper and helper donned masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. A list of essential items and their prices in 2014 was displayed in the shop, with a comparison with prices this year. Siba Kalita, central committee organising secretary, said prices of all essentials, pulses, lentils, sugar, flour, and especially mustard and refined oils had skyrocketed. ""Everything has increased by Rs 40 to 60. The acchhe din promised by Modi has turned out to be really bure (bad),"" he said. The list showed the price of masur dal to have risen from Rs 80 to Rs 110, arhar from Rs 68 and 74 to Rs 100. The organisation demanded an immediate bringing down of prices to the 2014 level, before the NDA government had come to power."

They'll go to any lengths for their kids.Munna Gupta's amma was no different. About 30 years ago, when Gupta opened a shop selling moong pakodas, Chandravatidevi Gupta would toil over a heavy stone grinder every day, making a paste of several kilos of soaked lentils that would be fried to make the snack.Amma's recipe was, as mothers' recipes are wont to be, very good. It made Gupta's shop in Sitabuldi so famous, he named it 'Pakodewala.' The shop also sells the usual sinful suspects such as samosa, kachori, bread pakoda and aloo bonda (the last one, also Chandravatidevi's recipe), none of them using any onion or garlic. But it is the moong pakoda that is easily its biggest draw.""When the grinding became too much for amma,"" Gupta says, ""I decided to give her a break. I chanced upon an electric grinder that was used to make dosa batter. I tried using it for the moong dal and, fortunately, it worked,"" he says, adding that it was only after this that he could scale up operations.Gupta goes through 20kg of split moong dal (the green one, with the husk still on) for the savoury fritters every day. Crisp on the outside, they have a spongy texture inside to soak up the mini pool of two chutneys, one with tamarind and green chilli for tang and spice, and another with yoghurt to balance the heat.""Many people ask us what we put in the pakoda to make them so crisp. They wonder if we add bread crumbs. But we don't add anything to the moong dal paste, apart from salt,"" Gupta says. The taste, he insists, is due to the 'grace of god' and blessings from his mother, who passed away in 2002.The dal, he says, is soaked for four hours. This is followed by the lengthy grinding process to get plenty of air into the batter so that it becomes very light. The paste-like batter is then scooped by hand and dropped into uniform chunks into the hot oil. The trained hands make the process look much easier, and safer, than it actually is.And here's another secret: The pakodas are fried once until they are cooked halfway through, rested for some time and then fried on high heat for a second time. Side note: This trick is used to make a lot of deep fried dishes, such as french fries, crispier.""I used to make the pakodas with great speed but had to stop recently due to health reasons,"" says the 55-year-old Gupta, who belongs to the third generation of his family selling eatables. His grandfather, who migrated here from Benaras, and father ran a sweets shop on Sitabuldi Main Road. It was Munna's eldest brother Vijay, along with three other brothers and some cousins, who introduced savoury snacks to the menu.Gupta says rainy season is when demand for the pakodas becomes almost unmanageable. ""Most Buldi shop owners buy snacks from our shop. Nitin Gadkariji loves our moong pakodas and aloo bondas. He eats here and takes a parcel for home, too,"" Gupta beams.Somewhere, amma must be smiling, too."

""Akshaya Tritiya, otherwise too, is not a good mahurat for marriages or vastu pujan,"" says astrologer Anil Vaidya. ""This year it is all the more inappropriate due to Shukr Ast and marriages can't be performed during this period. The next wedding mahurat will be on July 7,"" informs Vaidya.Generally, the months of May and June see a flurry of weddings. ""This year these two months are exceptionally lean as there are very few mahurats,"" says Rushabh Kamdar, who manages Navaidhyam wedding hall, a popular venue. ""We are usually booked back to back throughout May and June and Akshaya Tritiya has been a popular date for those whose weddings are finalized at short notices,"" he says.The literal meaning of Akshay in Sanskrit is imperishable or 'never diminishing'. This has been interpreted as auspicious and a good mahurat to buy valuables. So, though the date may not have brought much luck to those in the banquet hall business, the jewellers are looking forward to good footfalls.Having opened recently after over a month long strike, they are hoping to tide over their losses and the lean wedding season with this auspicious mahurat. ""Akshaya Tritiya on May 9 and Guru Pushya mahurat on May 12 are days when people, especially in Maharashtra buy gold,"" says Nitin Khandelwal of Khandelwal Jewellers. Special schemes and aggressive advertising is being done to lure in customers. ""As there are no wedding dates over the next two months we are encouraging buyers to book gold in advance. We have floated offers of low rates for gold booked on these two mahurat days,"" he says.But those who study scriptures say that Akshaya Tritiya is not the occasion for buying. Donations made on this day are akshay daan or a donation whose good effects will be perennial. Buying gold is not donating, the people buying gold will keep it. This goes against the sentiment of this day, they feel.Kapil Chandrayan who studies astrology says, ""This day is for remembering the ancestors and as it marks the onset of summer, it is a day to offer water to them by performing rituals like donating a matka or offering cold drinks to poor.""The day is observed in many households by offering a repast of freshly made wadi, papad seviyan, kurdi, maltya, sargunde as prasad. These are prepared by grinding wheat, lentils and rice. The batter is given different shapes, sun dried and used in curries.""Most of these preparations are unique to this region because of the harsh summer,"" says Nandini Kohle, a bank employee. ""Working women do not have time to make these. But fortunately there are women who have turned the demand for these items into a thriving cottage industry and many like me buy from them."""

Kamaraj was the Chief Minister. Now, the people of the Oorali tribe at the village of Kaalidhimbam, in the Sathyamangalam hills, want news ones. The government says they can get it constructed under the Pasumai Veedu Thittam scheme  the State bears the Rs. 2 lakh required to build 300 square-feet houses  but there is a small catch. The villagers have been told the money will begin to come in once they start building the houses, but they want to know how they can afford the steel, sand and cement needed to begin construction.R. Ranganathan, a 19-year-old first-time voter who works in a T-shirt manufacturing unit in Gobichettipalayam, gives a future-tense answer when asked who is likely to vote for.  Yaaru nanmai seyyarangalo . By this, he means that he will vote for whoever is going to make good on the promise of free housing, which is just one of the demands of the people in Kaalidhimbam.The meaning of nanmai has changed in these parts, which themselves have changed after the death of the notorious bandit Veerappan. Today, there is a lot of development in these hills  one can even catch the sight of farmhouses with fancy names.But when the brigand was roaming this region, the tribal people found themselves caught between his threats and those of the Special Task Force, who believed that the villagers would lead them to Veerappan if coerced enough.Those days, nanmai simply refers to someone who helped these villagers survive, someone who could intervene on their behalf. A lot of those who helped us belonged to the Communist parties, says B.L. Jeevabharathi, secretary of the Tamil Nadu Tribal Peoples Associations branch in Erode. Today, his outfit helps tribal people in various ways. This appears to explain why the last time the people in these parts voted for the AIADMK, which was in an alliance with the CPI. Its likely to be different this time. Earlier, our people used to vote for whoever gave them money and vetti/selai [dhoti/sari], Jeevabharathi says. But they have become smart now. They will accept freebies, but they are very clear about who they are going to vote for.His thoughts are echoed in faraway Uganiyam, which lies in the Sathyamangalam Tiger Reserve. B. Periyasami, who ploughs others lands with his tractor, says with certainty that its going to be a new government this time. And his bet is on Vijayakant. Again, this has less to do with the DMDK leader than the fact that hes allied with the Communist parties.K. Ramar lives in a village that bears his name: Ramar Anai. A red flag flies at the entrance to the village. A lot of work has been happening at Ramar Anai.The 1.5-km path that forks off the road from Thalavadi to Dhimbam and leads to the village has just been laid. Fifteen houses are being built under the auspices of the Indira Awaas Yojana, which was instituted to provide housing for the rural poor. All of this, Ramar says, is due to the efforts of CPI MLA P.L. Sundaram.Ramar grimaces when he hears J. Marai, a resident of Kotagiri who is visiting her sister at Ramar Anai, get emotional about the election. Marai refers to the free rice, free saris and the pension she gets from the government, and says:  Kanji ootharanga. Avangalukku dhaane vote podanum? [Amma feeds us. How can we vote for anyone else?]On hearing this, Ramar, the village elder, says he will need to have a serious talk with everyone. They think only in terms of arisi , paruppu [rice and lentils]. They dont think about the future."

While the rates of chana dal, masoor dal, black masoor and brown vatana have increased by 10; prices of moong, kabuli chana, black chana, tur dal, big toor dal have shot up by 20, while urad dal has shown the most drastic gain of 40 per kg.Sifting through udat dal contemplating, whether to make the purchase or not, Rajani Desai, said, ""When chicken and vegetables become expensive, people opt for pulses but with pulses also being expensive what is the aam aadmi to eat?""The steep rise in prices of pulses in the state has been attributed to the weather conditions in Maharashtra. ""Drought-hit Maharastra has led to an overall poor produce leading to exorbitant rates of pulses. For the past one week, even the prices in Goa have been high,"" said vendor Gunaji Dhulapkar.The Economic Survey of Maharashtra 2015-16 has reportedly indicated that the production of cereals is projected to fall 41%, and pulses 11%, as agricultural growth in Maharashtra declined by 2.7% for the year 2015-16.""Since most of these legumes have to be brought from Maharashtra, Goa's dependency on the drought-hit state will affect our business badly this year,"" said another vendor Aarti Amonkar.While businesspersons in the local market are putting on a brave face for now, they feel sceptical of the scenario as the month of Shravan, a time when these pulses are most in demand, is fast-approaching.""We will definitely feel the hit once Shravan commences, especially for toor dal which is sourced from the Latur district in Maharashtra,"" said vendor Nitin Mandrekar.He further added that besides various pulse crops being affected, even sugarcane crops were a disappointment as a result of which there will likely be a crunch for sugar as well."
58f56dc8a3d24b0b70c21428,Insure farmers against climate change,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/insure-farmers-against-climate-change/article8587072.ece,2016-05-12,"Bundelkhand is where Indias marginal farming dream died. Known for the dacoits of Chambal and the Rani of Jhansi, the arid region, occupying districts of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has experienced drastic variation in climate in recent times. It faced a drought from 2003 to 2010, then floods in 2011, delayed monsoons in 2012 and 2013, and drought again since 2014. Farmers tried everything to adapt  growing a mix of dry crops during the kharif season, while interspersing the winter rabi wheat with cash crops like chickpea and mustard. They invested heavily in borewells, tractors, threshers and seeds and fertilizers through formal and informal credit.The past two winters, with hailstorms and unseasonal rain, destroyed crops (chickpea yields were mostly wiped out, the arhar crop failed completely), leading to farmer suicides (3,500 since 2003) and mass migration. Mitigation has been lacking; contractors not farmers benefit, and instead of providing crop insurance, warehouses are built. Bereaved families, hoping for compensation from the Uttar Pradesh government (Rs.7 lakh on death), were instead offered wheat bundles.India, a climate change hotspotIndia is uniquely vulnerable to rising temperatures  it ranks in the top 20 in the Climate Change Vulnerability Index. Our average surface temperature, over the past four decades, has risen by 0.3 Celsius, accompanied by a rising incidence of floods, droughts and cyclones. With the majority of all landholdings in India measuring less than a hectare, marginal farmers face a steep decline in household income and a concomitant rise in household poverty through exacerbated droughts. Climate change would impact soil health, with increasing surface temperatures leading to higher CO{-2}emissions and reducing natural nitrogen availability. Mitigating this by increasing chemical fertilizer usage could impact long-term soil fertility, leaving the soil open to greater erosion and desertification. Meanwhile, migration patterns, farmer suicides and stagnating rural incomes, along with increasingly ad hoc land acquisition in the name of public goods, have politicised the idea of climate mitigation. Marginal farmland will increasingly be useless for agriculture.Our dependency on rain continues to amplify  rain-fed agriculture is practised in the majority of our total cropped area supporting a significant proportion of the national food basket (55 per cent of rice, 90 per cent of pulses, 91 per cent of all coarse grain). Our regional crop patterns assume a specific range of weather variability, failing to cope with the recent high periods of heavy rainfall with long dry intervals. In 2013, large crops of wheat, gram, lentils and mustard, weeks away from harvesting, were destroyed in untimely rains. Indias flood-affected area has doubled since Independence, despite generous state spending on flood protection schemes.Research has highlighted the deleterious impact of climate change on crop production. By 2100, the kharif season will face a varying temperature rise (0.7-3.3 Celsius) with rainfall significantly impacted. Limited temperature rises could lead to a 22 per cent decline in wheat yield in the rabi season, while rice yield could decline by 15 per cent. Other staple crops  sorghum, groundnut, chickpea  could see a sharp decline. Its impact is already prevalent: it is estimated that without rising temperatures and rain variability, Indias rice production over the past four decades could have been 8 per cent higher. India is home to the largest hungry population  falling agricultural yields will only make matters worse.Some policy prescriptionsOur low agricultural productivity remains a key constraint. According to the Swaminathan Committee on Farmers (2006), for rice, we produce 2,929 kg per hectare, while China produces twice as much. For other staples, we remain woeful, producing 913 kg of groundnut per hectare, while Indonesia produces nearly half as much more. As suggested by the National Commission on Farmers, a rural spending plan, focussed on investments in agriculture infrastructure, particularly in irrigation, rainwater harvesting and a national network of soil-testing laboratories is needed. Simple water harvesting and conservation measures (micro-irrigation, watershed management and insurance coverage) can reduce the majority of the potential loss due to drought (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, 2013). Drought strategies should be extended to the village level  for example, each village should have a village pond, created under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme.Indian agricultural policy has made us structurally vulnerable to climate change. As suggested often by the National Commission on Farmers, conservation farming and dryland agriculture should be promoted. Each village should be provided timely rainfall forecasts along with weather-based forewarnings regarding crop pests and epidemics in various seasons. Afforestation, in a biodiverse manner, should be encouraged to help modify regional climates and prevent soil erosion. Our agricultural research programmes need to be retooled towards dryland research  it has been argued that adoption of drought-tolerant breeds can help reduce production risks by nearly a third, while offering attractive returns to breeders. Changing planting dates could have a significant impact; research highlights that planting wheat earlier than usual can help reduce climate change-induced damage. Zero tillage and laser-based levelling can also help conserve water and land resources. Crop planning can be conducted as per the climatic zones of different regions, while utilising better genotypes for rain-fed conditions.We should focus on expanding our formal credit system to reach all marginal farmers. Insurance coverage should be expanded to all crops while reducing the rate of interest to nominal levels, with government support and an expanded Rural Insurance Development Fund. A debt moratorium policy on drought-distressed hotspots and areas facing climate change calamities should be announced, waiving interest on loans till farming incomes are restored. The Centre and States should launch an integrated crop, livestock and family health insurance package while instituting an Agriculture Credit Risk Fund to provide relief in the aftermath of successive natural disasters.Climate change will impact the entire food production chain, affecting our food security. Livestock production, often considered to be a substitute to farming for marginal farmers, would face reduced fodder supplies given a decline in crop area or production. With Indias population rising, demand for diversified crops will be hard to square with diminishing yields. Agricultural investments in food crops, along with systemic support for irrigation, infrastructure and rural institutions can help move India beyond climate change-induced food insecurity, strengthening our stressed food production systems. Through adaptation and mitigation measures, we can overcome this Hobbesian crisis.Feroze Varun Gandhi is a Member of Parliament, representing the Sultanpur constituency forthe BJP."
58ff0c447be9e0420db2be6a,SC orders states to feed the drought-hit,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160514/jsp/nation/story_85645.jsp,2016-05-14,"New Delhi, May 13: The Supreme Court today passed a slew of directions for immediate supply of foodgrain, lentils and edible oil, plus milk and eggs for children, to people in 12 drought-hit states, as it came down heavily on the governments' failure to properly implement the food security act. A bench of Justices Madan B. Lokur and N.V. Ramana said there would be ""utter chaos"" and a collapse in the country's federal structure if the states chose to violate a parliamentary enactment. The National Food Security Act is deemed to have come into force from July 5, 2013. The court said the right to food was a ""constitutional right"" and states were bound to provide not just foodgrain under the NFS act, but also dal and edible oil despite there being no provision for such additional benefits. Foodgrain and mid-day meals should be given free of cost, the court said, while lentils and edible oil should be provided at subsidised rates of Rs 30 per kg and Rs 25 per litre respectively. (see chart). The court was hearing a PIL by Swaraj Abhiyan, a non-profit organisation, seeking supply of adequate foodgrain, dal and edible oil for the 12 states. The states are Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Maharashtra, Bihar, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. An estimated 50 crore people are affected. Under Section 3 of the NFS act, the monthly entitlement of foodgrain is 5kg per person for eligible households under the ""priority"" category and 35kg per family under the Antyodaya Anna Yojna for rice, wheat and coarse grains. There is no provision for supply of 2kg dal and one litre edible oil to the households under the act and supply of eggs/milk to schoolchildren under the midday meal scheme. The apex court rejected the Centre's argument that it would be difficult for the states and the Union government to provide such benefits as it would have large financial implications. ""A state government, by delaying implementation of a law... is effectively refusing to implement it and Parliament is left a mute spectator. Does our Constitution countenance such a situation? Is this what 'federalism' is all about?"" the court asked. ""Deliberate inaction in the implementation of a parliamentary statute by a state government can only lead to utter chaos or worse. One can hardly imagine what the consequence would be if a state government, on a similar logic, decides that it will not implement other parliamentary statutes meant for the benefit of vulnerable sections of society."" The court expressed surprise that some states had not implemented the act. ""...Uttar Pradesh has partially implemented the NFS act in the sense that it has been implemented only in 28 of its 75 districts. Gujarat has admittedly implemented the NFS act only from 1st April, 2016. ""It is surprising that the implementation of a law enacted by Parliament... is left to the whims and fancies of the state governments, and it has taken more than two years after the NFS act came into force for Gujarat to implement it and Uttar Pradesh has only implemented it partially. This is rather strange."" It added: ""No one can doubt that children are the future of our country and if there is some stinginess in providing them with adequate nutrition, the country as a whole is deprived in future of taking the benefit of their potential."" Taking a serious view of the way in which most states had started implementing the NFS act only from 2015, Justice Lokur said: ""Hopefully, someone somewhere sometime will realise the possible alarming consequences. ""Similarly, the entitlement of foodgrain at 5kg per person per month is a goal that must be achieved by the state at the earliest.... ""In fact, statute or no statute and implementation or non-implementation of a law enacted by Parliament, the state ought to appreciate and realise that an adequate supply of foodgrain must be made available without much fuss to people in drought-affected areas. ""As it is, because of the drought, such persons undergo immense hardship mainly for reasons beyond their control, and if there is a scarcity of food, it would only add to their misery."""

A majority of them can be found selling items ranging from ersatz art pieces to clothing to cutlery by the roadside in any given town across the country.The Scheduled Caste Raja Koyas or Rajanollu bards of Khammam and Adilabad districts are among those hit by the economic reforms and have found a somewhat strange calling in trading stainless steel utensils for discarded human hair. A few of these two-wheeler-mounted families can be found criss-crossing the district visiting even the most far flung of villages with their wares every day, the harsh summer notwithstanding.We started about six months ago from our mandal headquarter village Enkoor in Khamma district, said Jakkula Ramulu, found relaxing under a tree with five other families at Mankapur in Gudihatnoor mandal. We keep moving on our two-wheelers and even enter Maharashtra visiting villages at random and exchanging the utensils, he added.The motorcycle in question carries the family comprising of the couple and often an infant, besides 50 to 70 kg of stainless steel utensils and a few kg of rice and dal or lentils.The twosome does not seem to be bothered about the fact that the seat is completely crammed with their wares.We are not familiar with villages here. Its just that we keep driving towards one direction for a few days and enter all the villages on our way, explained Merugu Sammaiah, Ramulus brother-in-law from Mandamarri town in Adilabad.Often travelling up to 50 km a day, the Rajanolla families spend the night at the last village of their visit every day. We sleep in the local schools and start on the uncharted course early next morning, observed Ramulu.The nomads purchase the utensils in Vijayawada and trade it by weight.They offer a small item like a glass or some other water container for about 40 gm of hair.Traders come to our village to purchase the hair we collect and pay us about Rs. 1,000 per kg. What they do of the hair we do not know, said Nerusula Ramulu, the Rajanolla elder.It is assumed that the discarded hair is used to make hair care products and wigs. The hair is also exported to China and other countries where it is used in coat linings."

Telegraph picture Jorhat, May 16: Forget orange squash and mango pickle. Try kuji thekera or bor thekera squash and mirika tenga pickle instead. The food science and nutrition department of the College of Home Science here has come up with 60 delectable pickle, jam, sherbet and mouth-freshener recipes made from 13 lesser-known fruits of Assam, which are disappearing from the market. Former associate professor of the department and guest faculty Nilima Neog said the aim was to add value to the fruits like mirika tenga (Parameria polyneura), noga tenga (nutgall) (Rhus semialata), thereju (Prunus jenkinsii), bor thekera (Garcinia padanculata), rupohi thekera (Garcinia lanceaefolia), kuji thekera (Garciniia cowa roxb), pora amlakhi (Phylanthus acidus), leteku (Baccaurea sapida), ou tenga (elephant apple) (Dillenia indicus), bogori (Indian date) (Ziziphus jujube), poniol (coffee plum) (Flacourtia gangomos), kordoi (star fruit) (Avvehorea carambola) and nuni (mulberry) (Morus australispoir) so that people keep on growing them and make products which they can sell. Neog, who is working on the Rs 65.93 lakh project, is a recipient of the Dr J.S. Pruthi award for the best article published in the Food Packers Journal 2006-07 in which she had made five products from mirika tenga. ""The next generation, especially in urban areas, has probably not seen the pora amlakhi, kuji thekera, leteku and thereju. These trees have all but disappeared, though aamlakhi (Indian gooseberry) can be found in plenty,"" Neog said. Earlier, many of these trees were found in gardens as people generally believed that they had therapeutic value for stomach ailments, cough and common cold and kordoi in jaundice, she said. ""Nowadays, however, people rely more on allopathic medicines and the fruits like kordoi, the juice of which was believed to be very good for the liver, is no longer sought,"" she added. ""All the minor fruits we have selected are rich in vitamin C, ascorbic acid and other nutrients. Once we give out the recipes, they can be taken up for small-scale production and add to the income of a family,"" she said. Neog said in order to standardise the process, certain tests to find out the amount of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) present in each fruit, its moisture content total soluble solids, PH value, protein, carbohydrates, anti-oxidants, acidity and total sugar were conducted. Tests to find out the value of nutrients like iron, potassium or calcium, however, had not been undertaken. Neog said she and senior research fellow of the department, Barnali Baruah, developed nearly 100 odd products of which 60 have been approved for transfer of technology by a panel of experts after taking into cognisance flavour, taste and colour. ""We not only standardised the processes according to the quality set by Indian Standard Specification but also undertook acceptability studies and evaluated shelf life,"" she said. Among the products are toffees made of bogori (berry) and tamarind pulp, mouth freshener from pora amlakhi and a powder made from ou tenga (elephant apple) which can be had like chutney or put into other dishes like lentils or curries for flavour. They can also be made into squashes, jams and pickles. Neog has been working on the project under the ministry of food processing industries in collaboration with co-principal investigator Ruma Bhattacharya and junior research fellow Gitanjali Gautam since 2014.

(AP Photo/Eranga Jayawardena)Soldiers and police on Thursday struggled to find hundreds of people missing after landslides destroyed at least three central Sri Lankan villages, with fresh rains triggering smaller slides and forcing rescuers to briefly suspend their efforts.Torrents of water streamed down the hill where mountains of mud swallowed three villages  Siripura, Elangapitiya and Pallebage  on Tuesday evening, and the continuing danger forced rescue work to halt for about an hour. So far, 18 bodies have been recovered from the mud. The Sri Lankan Red Cross said at least 220 families were unaccounted for.Heavy fog, electrical outages and the loose ground also have complicated the search. Asked whether rescuers expected to find survivors, army Maj. Gen. Sudantha Ranasinghe pointed to an area in Elangapitiya village where 66 houses once stood.We dont have a trace of any house here. All gone with that landslide, he said. So I have my doubts.Villagers said torrents of muddy water, tree branches and debris came crashing down Tuesday around their homes in the three villages in Kegalle district, about 72 kilometers (45 miles) north of Colombo.Near Elangapitiya, the village furthest down the hill, soldiers carried bodies to a school where families waited for news of missing loved ones. The school entrance was decorated with white flags, a symbol of mourning.Farmer Hewapelige Lal said he had identified the body of his nephew, but that 18 other family members were possibly buried under the mud. He and his wife had left their home to take fruit to a daughter who lived elsewhere, but at some point his wife turned back.That was the last time I saw her, Lal said, sobbing. When he heard of the landslide, he rushed home but found the area covered with thick, heavy mud. All I could do was scream.In Elangapitiya alone, 14 bodies were recovered Wednesday and about 130 people were still missing, according to Maj. Gen. Sudantha Ranasinghe, who was coordinating rescue efforts. The Red Cross said some of those missing may have left before the disaster; heavy rains have lashed the island nation for several days, and local officials had warned residents of possible landslides.Hundreds of stunned villagers took shelter in nine temporary camps set up in schools and a Buddhist temple, where they were being given food, blankets and basic medical treatment.At the Viyaneliya Temple, about 300 villagers shared a meal of brown bread and curried lentils. Local officials interviewed each one to learn about missing family members and possessions buried under the mud.All nine of A.G. Alices children were unaccounted for after the landslide hit their home in Siripura village.I dont know what happened to me after the landslides swept down, the 70-year-old said.A man said his wife, mother-in-law, son and daughter-in-law were all in his house in Siripura when the landslides hit. I still cant locate my family, M.W. Dharmadasa said. I still dont know what happened to them.Military spokesman Brigadier Jayanath Jayaweera told reporters in the capital, Colombo, that the army had so far rescued 156 people trapped by landslides, and that more than 1,550 people are in shelters. He said the army was assessing the situation and would deploy more troops if needed.The same rains that unleashed the mudslides also caused severe flooding in cities including Colombo, the capital, where tens of thousands of homes were at least partially inundated.Sri Lankas disaster management center reported 41 deaths across the country since Monday from lightning strikes, floods, falling trees and other, smaller landslides.

Your refrigerator could be home to millions of harmful pathogens, say experts from the National Institute of Nutrition.""A significant number of food-borne diseases arise from practices in the kitchen. So not only is the way food is handled important, but how it is stored also determines its safety ,"" said Subba Rao M Gavaravarupu, NIN scientist and author of the recently-released study.The study, which surveyed at least 200 households, from various strata of society, found that 65 per cent of people stored leftovers in fridges for over 24 hours. Microbial analysis of such leftover cooked food showed incidence of micro-organisms in samples indicating potential hazard. ""A staggering 44.4 per cent of food tested positive for salmonella, 27.7 per cent had E coli and 11.1 per cent were tested for fecal coliforms,"" the scientist said.The study revealed that the highest incidence of pathogens were in foods like raw banana curry, fish curry, potato-lentil curry, egg curry and mutton curry. It traced fecal coliforms in foods like spinach curry, mutton curry and potatoes. ""A high amount of bacteria such as E Coli was present in these foods. The presence of such pathogens in food could lead to severe digestive tract problems,"" said Dr Sudarshan, a scientist from the institute.Another mistake that scientists pointed out was the idea of thawing food after taking it out of the fridge. ""The most hygienic practice is to heat food as soon as it is taken out of the fridge, not wait for it to thaw. When it is kept in the open to reach room temperature, it attracts more microbes,"" said Subba Rao.In view of the disturbing revelations, medical experts spoke about extremely risky food storage practices. ""We have substantial proof that there are chances that digestive tract infections could stem from consumption of such (improperly stored) foods. I suggest that people start using proper ziploc bags to safeguard their ve getables from contamination,"" Dr Zeenat Fatima, a dietician of Continental Hospitals, told TOI.Scientists said since temperature is one of the major factors determining food quality, proper refrigeration could be the first line of defence against food-borne illnesses. They also say that aw a re n e s s i s o f u t m o s t importance."
58fef85b7be9e0420db2a665,The rot in Indian agricultural policies,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160526/jsp/opinion/story_87563.jsp,2016-05-26,"Every aspect of Indian economic policies is influenced by all-pervading government control. Many times, they are also subject to massive leakages due to inefficiencies and corruption (for example, bogus ration cards, rotting grains and corrupt procurement in the public distribution system). The poor state of industrial development, inability to increase domestic defence production in spite of massive imports, diversion of government revenues from taxes on minerals, mismatch between demand for agricultural products and their production, and so on, are some examples. India has massive unemployment and underemployment. More are seeking fresh employment each year, consumption levels are low, and there are many poor people. Yet, growth in production of physical goods from agriculture and industry has, in five years since 2011, been modest. At constant prices, agriculture grew annually from 2011 in per cent at 1.5, 4.2, -9.2 and 1.1. Over these years, industry grew in per cent at 3.6, 5.0, 5.9, and 7.3; manufacturing at 6.0, 5.6, 5.5 and 9.5. There is heavy pressure of population on land. The average size of land holding was 1.41 hectares in 1995-96 and 1.15 in 2010-11. India has more arable land than China. Indeed it has the second-most arable land in the world. But it has very low productivity of crops per acre. When one takes paddy, as one example, and on comparing with China, India remains far behind. This is so for other crops as well and as compared to most Southeast Asian countries. A good reason for the low productivity is the growing fragmentation of holdings and their decline in size. The high population pressure on small land holdings is on account of high rural poverty. Alleviation requires consolidation of land holdings by leasing, urbanization and the acquisition of rural lands for the purpose with adequate compensation. This will also reduce this pressure. Consumption habits are changing at all levels. Rice consumption per person per month in rural India was estimated at 5.98 kilogramme in 2011-12 compared to 6.38 kg in 2004-05 - a fall of 0.4 kg in seven years. In urban India, the fall in rice consumption between these two periods was 0.2 kg per person per month - from 4.71 kg to 4.49 kg per capita. A high proportion was taken at subsidized prices from the public distribution system. Per capita consumption of wheat in 2011-12 showed a slight rise since 2004-05 of about 0.1 kg per person per month in rural areas and a fall of 0.35 kg in urban areas. As with rice, the share of PDS purchase in wheat consumption has increased considerably, from 824 grammes to 901 gm in the urban sector. At the same time, and in contrast, 69 gm in the rural sector and 57 gm in the urban sector were contributed by split gram, whole gram, pea and besan bought at rising market prices. The four pulses - arhar, moong, masur and urd - also rose. So did consumption of vegetables, eggs and fruits. All these have seen rising prices and no price support to consumers. Minimum support prices for cereals are increased almost every year and have been the same as procurement prices. But retail prices were not raised similarly. There is also government interference in the agricultural markets which cause the farmer to lose the margins made by middlemen. India has stimulated the production of cereals when the demand was dropping, while growing for other non-subsidized items. Rural households bought the cheap PDS grains and sold their own produce for government stocks, which are at unsustainably high levels without adequate storage. They might as well have been given free to the malnourished rural poor. Productivity remained low because of falling land holdings. Improved seeds were not easily available. Genetic modification of food grains was prevented by environmentalists with no evidence of ill-effects. (Research has shown no ill-effects on humans; in some cases, there might be resistance to plant resistance.) Fertilizers are subsidized, benefiting manufacturers and big farmers. Subsidies are relatively more for urea, leading to a mismatch in fertilizer use and inadequate productivity. Water availability has been shrinking as lakes and rivers become polluted and groundwater levels are used excessively. Per-capita availability of fresh water has declined sharply, from 3,000 cubic metres to 1,123 cubic metres over the past 50 years versus the global average of 6,000 cubic metres. India needs to make judicious use of surface water and groundwater. Dams on rivers have robbed some of them of their usual water flow, while diverting the course of others. Urban effluents have also destroyed the potability of river water. Fifty five per cent of India's total water supply is now groundwater. This has reduced levels across much of India. Growing water-intensive crops and using techniques like flooding for paddy have further depleted groundwater. Over 60 per cent of irrigation comes from groundwater. Nearly 30 per cent of urban water supply and 70 per cent of rural water supply come from groundwater. We need a rational water policy and less populism. Massive subsidies on equipment and electricity required to mine groundwater have accentuated its use to the financial detriment of the power sector. Free or heavily subsidized flat rate electricity tariffs helped bring the Green Revolution. They have now become the norm. The result is indiscriminate use of groundwater. Each of the issues mentioned is the result of government policies or their absence. Land legislation encourages fragmentation of holdings. There is little encouragement for leasing. Land acquisition for urban areas and for factories has been a corrupt business, and there is little incentive for many farmers to give up their land and move away. Government procurement policies and the public distribution system have stimulated rising production of rice and wheat. Little has been done to help production, storage and marketing of other items like vegetables, pulses, fruits and eggs (such as cold storages, improved varieties, and so on). There is little sign of a rational water policy: indeed, it is the opposite. Electricity tariffs encourage a rise in the use of groundwater. There is no policy on groundwater. Neither is there a limit on what water-intensive crops can be grown with it. There is no concerted recharging of groundwater. State governments follow irrational water-pricing policies. Cleaning up river and lake water so that it is available to supplement water supply in case of drought is uncommon. Little is being done to spread better agricultural practices and scientific developments that benefit farmers. Agricultural productivity can be increased even on small holdings, but there is little attempt, except by non-governmental organizations, to disseminate these practices. In Israel, these have reduced the use of water. There are vineyards producing good wine in the Negev desert. Groundwater use is not metered in India as it should be. Fertilizer subsidies do not benefit the small farmer. Rational policies, which ensure that subsidies reach the farmer and do not encourage unbalanced use of fertilizers, are urgently needed. Environmental agitations against genetically modified seeds should be countered by scientific evidence so that more productive seeds can be used. Agricultural policies have developed into a messy package. They need a thorough overhaul. Our political masters are unable to even think of it.

The procurement of rabi pulses is still going on.Onion and pulses are being procured from the Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF), which has a corpus of Rs 900 crore for this fiscal to support the market interventions.Onion production is estimated to be increased to 20.33 million tonnes in 2015-16 from 18.92 million tonnes in the previous year, as per government data.Whereas, pulses output is estimated to be down at 17.06 million tonnes, much lower than the demand of 23.62 million tonnes. The gap is met through imports.At present, retail onion prices are ruling at Rs 15-25/kg and pulses in the range of Rs 85-185 per kg in most parts of the country, showed government data."

Madhya Pradesh Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission ordered the seeds corporation to pay farmers an interest of Rs 4.26 lakh.The orders have been given by the bench to commission comprising expert member Subhash Jain and S D Aggarwal on May 28.Farmers of Tikamgarh filed a complaint against National Seeds Corporation Limited in district consumer forum in 2012. They had bought seeds in 2010 under the scheme of state government with the help of assistant director after analysing farmlands. The seeds were actually manufactured by State Farms Corporation of India Limited. Seeds were sown as per regular technique, but seeds did not grow. When the case was registered with district consumer forum, a report of inquiry by district collector and agriculture department officers was filed on directions of forum which stated seeds were of extreme poor quality.Later moving on to the higher commission Madhya Pradesh Consumer Dispute Redressal Commission, an appeal was filed in 2015 by National Seeds Corporation Limited, but after analysing the report and hearing both the parties, commission decided to go by the orders of district forum and asked the corporation to pay the compensation for the loss of farmers.

It was planned as a farming intervention to increase crop productivity, inculcate practical knowledge on seed selection and treatment, and preserve the indigenous variety of paddy.The project was initiated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) and Lotus Progressive Centre (LPC), a NGO, based at Morowa village in Nalbari district, in July 2011.The project period got over in 2014. The model, however, continued to be practised by the farmers. The farming families in a cluster of seven villages held on to the practice because of the positive results it brought.""The model led the overall crop productivity to jump from 13-18% to 30-40%, while also bringing about an increase in the income of the farmers,"" said Hemanta Baishya, member and coordinator of LPC.The model ensures that the agricultural land does not lie idle. For instance, a farmer might have five bighas of agricultural land and may use three bighas to cultivate the main crop of paddy. The remaining two bighas, considered 'baam' or shallow, are utilized for rabi and other crops.After the main crop is harvested, leguminous crops (peas, lentils and chick peas) and rabi crops are cultivated, improving the natural soil fertility.""The farmers have informed us that they are continuing the practice. It has led to crop intensity. This project has been a success. The followup is continuing,"" said Tapan Baishya, secretary, LPC.Before the introduction of the initiative, farmers had no practical experience in increasing crop productivity, and no knowledge of or systematic approach to seed selection and treatment, seed-bedding preparation, seeding duration. They also had an unsystematic approach to line preparation (the manner in which seeds are sown based on line rows).""The project period is over but it is now that we are witnessing the impact. This has given an immense boost to their financial and motivational levels. We do have a plan to expand it to other places as well,"" added Baishya.With most farmers are cultivating high-yield varieties - Joymoti, Luit, Athaisa, Untrisa and others, local varieties of rice paddy - Joha, Kola Joha, Mainagiri, Phool Pakhori, Tengre, Samraj, Boka Dhan, Tulsi Joha, Konkoni, Biru, Kajali Bah, Bordhan, Kalamdani, and others - are also being cultivated, besides mustard, peas, lentils, chick peas, among others."

After retirement, Mr C settled down in Delhi and Mr P in Bengaluru, but they made it a point to keep in touch with each other on phone and via email.Mrs C planned to go out of Delhi for two weeks once and when Mr P learnt about it, he invited his friend to Bengaluru instead of spending the hot summer alone, an invitation his friend readily accepted. Thus, Mr C landed at his friends house late one night.In the morning, there was a knock on his door and the helper brought him the very own south Indian kaapi in a steel tumbler. C sahib hated the smell but politely accepted it and added loads of sugar to gulp it down his throat.C sahib and his friend sat in the lawn, reading newspapers, interspersed with the gossip of the days, when Mrs P walked up to them and announced that the breakfast was ready. By sheer habit, he was hoping to see aloo, puree, pickles and egg bhhujia, but instead found idli, dosa, vada and sambar with the attendant chutneys. The breakfast was served in a silver thaali.Mr C was flummoxed and waited for the host and the hostess to take the lead. Being accustomed to using both hands in tearing his purees apart into bits and pieces, he found himself handicapped, having to rest his left hand on the knee.The friends spent their morning sightseeing and came home for lunch. What Mr C found on the lunch table was yet another unfamiliar sight. As he started digging in, he was given a detailed introduction by Mrs P somewhat like, Mr C, meet Mr Kharabhaat, made out of rice and lentils.

He was hoping to be served a Patiala peg but was insteadoffered some fresh coconut water.However, in about five days, Mr C got so hooked to the south Indian dishes that Mrs P had to double the produc-tion and spray red pepper flakes on the dosas.Back home, after Mrs C had come back from her holiday, Mr C came to the dining table to find the oil-laced bhaturas and channa laid out. He threw a fit and demanded idli sambar, kharabhaat and coconut chutney. Mrs C, who didnt know how to react to this outburst, kept a glum face and kept out of trouble by leaving the dining room.Mr C then enrolled his driver, Raghu, to drive him to various Udupi hotels and eateries located in different parts of Delhi. He also made it a point to carry a flask to bring home a few cups of Darshini-like coffee.Post script.

It sold for three times its estimate. Christies London had a beautiful note of nostalgia to share with art lovers. Gaitonde and Ram Kumar first met in Bombay in the early 1950s through the artist and gallerist Bal Chhabda, who was a common friend. Although Kumar was living in Delhi following his return from France, he frequently travelled to Bombay to exhibit his work at the Alliance Franaise, once even moving his family to the city for six months in 1954. Gaitonde, too, would travel to Delhi for his exhibitions at Kumar Art Gallery, and the two continued to meet, developing a close friendship based on mutual respect that would last till Gaitonde passed away in 2001.Over the next two decades the two artists met frequently, even though they lived in different cities, often along with others like Tyeb Mehta, Krishen Khanna and Maqbool Fida Husain. When Gaitonde, Husain and Mehta set up studios at the Bhulabhai Memorial Institute in Bombay with several other artists, Kumar remembers spending a lot of time with them there. Around the same time, in 1957, Gaitonde and Kumar collaborated with Husain and Mehta to establish the short-lived artists collective, Shilalekh, and produced a series of lithographs together so that their work could reach wider audiences.Ram Kumar recalls that even in the 1950s Gaitonde was completely sure of himself and his work, inspiring a great deal of confidence in him and in many other artists. Although he did not talk about his work and was not directly associated with any particular group of artists, he was respected by everyone in the art world. It was commonly said that when artists like Syed Haider Raza visited Bombay, they would first pay their respects at Mahatma Gandhis samadhi or memorial and then at Gaitondes door!When Gaitonde moved to a barsati in the Jangpura neighbourhood of Delhi in 1972, the two became neighbours as well. At least once a week, Kumar would stop by Gaitondes house on his way to buy groceries in the evening. A writer as well as an artist, Kumar would regale Gaitonde with stories of the art community, which the latter stood apart from but enjoyed hearing about, and of his many travels around the world. As Kumar was the only one in the neighbourhood with a phone, he also found himself conveying news and messages to and from his friends house. Often, the two would go to the cinema together or to the India International Centre to watch obscure French films.Along with his wife Vimla, Kumar took great care of Gaitonde in Delhi. Gaitonde was very fond of Vimla, although he categorically forbade her to clean his messy flat. Every day, she would ensure a box of daal or lentils would be sent to him from the Kumar household so that he had soft food to eat given his stubborn refusal to get dentures! Kumar also remembers the two of them buying a colour television for Gaitonde along with Husain and Arun Vadehra, so that he could replace the old box set he used to keep switched on all day long.Over the many years of their friendship Ram Kumar also made sure Gaitonde was financially stable when he needed it the most. Apart from arranging various grants for him, Kumar also wrote and spoke on Gaitondes behalf as a member of the jury for the Madhya Pradesh Kalidas Samman art award in 1988-89. Gaitonde won the award, and with its substantial funds was able to resume working on canvas after a debilitating accident he suffered a few years earlier.In the same spirit, Kumar bought this painting (lot 5) from Gaitonde at an exhibition in Delhi in the mid-1970s. After Kumars first choice of paintings from the show was requested by Tom Keehn, their friend and the American representative of the Rockefeller Fund in India, he gave it up and picked this luminous canvas from 1975. For more than forty years, Ram Kumar proudly hung this painting in his home, a mark of the high regards in which he held Gaitonde, and his deep respect for the latters artistic integrity and uncompromising dedication to his work."

The MSP is the rate at which the government buys the grain from farmers. Paddy is the main crop grown in the kharif (summer) season. Sowing of kharif crops would begin with the onset of the South-West monsoon this month.""We have increased the MSP of all kharif crops for 2016-17. Over and above the MSP, we have also decided to give a bonus of Rs 425 per quintal for pulses and Rs 100-200 per quintal for oilseeds,"" Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told reporters after the CCEA meeting.After including the bonus component, tur MSP has been raised to Rs 5,050 per quintal for this year from Rs 4,625 per quintal last year. Last year too, the government had given a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal to growers.Moong support price has been increased to Rs 5,225 per quintal for the 2016-17 kharif season from Rs 4,850 per quintal in the year-ago period, while that of urad has been raised to Rs 5,000 per quintal from Rs 4,625 in the said period.""This (increase in pulses and oilseeds MSP) is expected to give a strong price signal to farmers to bring more acreage under pulses and oilseed crops,"" Singh said.Besides pulses, the CCEA has also approved the MSP of paddy by Rs 60 per quintal for common variety to Rs 1,470 per quintal and Grade A variety to Rs 1,510 per quintal for this year.Among oilseeds, groundnut support price has been increased by 190 per quintal to Rs 4,220, soyabean and nigerseed by Rs 175 per quintal each to Rs 2,775 and Rs 3,825, respectively for the 2016-17 kharif season.The MSP of sunflower seed has been hiked by Rs 150 per quintal to Rs 3,950 and sesamum support price has been increased by Rs 300 to Rs 5,000 per quintal for this year.The support price of sesamum includes Rs 200 per quintal bonus and other oilseeds MSP include Rs 100 per quintal bonus.Among cash crops, the government has approved an increase in the MSP of cotton by Rs 60 per quintal to Rs 3,860 per quintal for medium staple and Rs 4,160 per quintal, respectively, for this year.The CCEA has approved increase in the support price over and above the recommendation of the government's advisory body Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP).Among other crops, CCEA has raised the MSP of ragi by Rs 75 per quintal to Rs 1,725 per quintal; jowar - Rs 60 per quintal to Rs 1,650; bajra - Rs 55 per quintal to Rs 1,330 and maize by Rs 40 per quintal to Rs 1,365 for 2016-17.With retail prices of pulses ruling over Rs 175 per kg in most parts of the country because of short supply, an increase in MSP of lentils may encourage farmers to sow pulses."

A few of them stayed back to earn a living as the conditions in the villages are still grim. However, they are living at Ghatkopar's Bhatwadi area, a place provided to them as shelter prior to Wagle Estate.Over 300 families had settled in various open grounds at Bhatwadi where they were harassed by local goons for a share of the money they earned by doing menial jobs.Thane guardian minister, Eknath Shinde then facilitated them with a shelter at Wagle Estate where they were given basic amenities.""We were not only given a place to live, but also grains, lentils, water and toilet facilities. Volunteers also helped us find work. However, as we have two acres of unyielding land and a house back home, my brother has left for the village to handle pre-monsoon repairs.

Some of these fiery dumplings have both, red and black, peppers. But in the olden days, people found a solution that didn't compromise on the spiciness and lowered the heat.They started stuffing them with prunes (dried plums), which added sweet and royal texture to the lentil dumplings. The dried fruit would swell on cooking and lend the dish different textures and layers of flavours.The common belief is that wardiyan belong to Punjab. But in their book, Classic Cooking of Punjab, Jiggs Kalra and Pushpesh Pant write that ayurvedic texts refer to vatika, a dumpling of sundried, spice-specked delicacy made with lentil paste. The book says the art of making wardiyan reached its acme in Amritsar with the arrival of merchants from Marwar, who were invited by fourth guru Ram Das to streamline trade. In the texts, there is also a reference to vataka or vada, made of soaked, coarsely ground and fermented 'maash' (husked urad) dal that was the progenitor of dahi vada, the book adds.The prune dumplings were also added to rice, especially at weddings. Women, who made wardiyan at home, also stuffed them with dry fruits and 'makhana' (puffed up lotus seeds). There are various variations, but the ones with prunes remained the most famous in olden days.However, these are today rarely available at your department stores. You have to reach out to special pappad-wardiyan shops, which are flooded with demand, especially from NRIs.Bhupinder Singh, owner of Ujagar Singh Karam Singh shop in Amritsar, says, ""We have been selling it for almost 100 years now. I am the fifth generation taking forward the legacy. We make our own dumplings. The ardent lovers of 'aloo bukhara' wardiyan even ask us to courier them. Punjabis living outside the state, particularly in Delhi and Mumbai, and abroad are more fond of it. Amritsar is popular as eaters' paradise. So when pilgrims visit the city, they make sure they take along these delicacies. We also have makhana-stuffed wardiyan.""Harjinder Singh, who has a shop on Lawrence Road, Amritsar, says, ""Prune wardiyan are our speciality. We have been selling it for 45 years. The demand is not only from Punjab and across the country, but also from NRIs.""Harjit Singh of Bhaiya Ji Di Hatti Papad Warian Wale, Ludhiana, says, ""It's our old product. Those who have tasted it once become its life-long lovers. Punjabi diaspora, too, loves this variety.""The popular market shelves and restaurants must serve this delicacy so that the taste that has not lost its spark for hundreds of years lives on.Relish this delight and speak with a plum in your mouth. Quite literally!"

But overthe past few decades, people have forgotten how to use them. File Photo: Thulasi KakkatQuick. Name 10 local pulses. Floundering? Okay, lets make this easier.Name five? Are you turning to Google while you sip on a turmeric latte fresh off Pinterest? Stand in a corner with your finger on your lips. Actually, dont. We are all equally to blame for this gap in culinary memory.In the span of two generations, urban India has forgotten how to grow, cook and eat a wealth of indigenous foods. With the UNFAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) declaring 2016 as the International Year of Pulses, this is as good a time as any to reflect on the challenge of reviving them.But first, what exactly are pulses? These are a sub-group of legumes that produce edible seeds. The term is used for crops that are harvested for dry grains, such as lentils, beans and chickpeas.As for the answer to my first question? Kulith (horse gram), tamarind seeds, chow-dhari (winged beans), matki (moth bean), sutari (rice bean), urad (split black gram), tuvar (pigeon peas), masoor (red lentils), kala vatana (black peas), chhole (kabuli chana).If you did not recognise 50 per cent of those names, you are not alone.I confess I got help: fortunately, the celebrity nutritionist and bestselling author, Rujuta Diwekar, who recently released a book on Indian super foods, is just a phone call away. She has spent the last couple of months working on a list of marginalised local pulses, along with her inspiring group of senior interns.Diwekars focus over the past few years has been on recording and interpreting oral wisdom, which she says is our collective heritage. In about 25 years, people who have this wisdom wont be alive, and we will lose it all, she says, explaining why she recently hired four senior interns, all aged above 65: mother, Rekha Diwekar (a professor of organic chemistry), Shaila Nimbkar (a doctor), Rekha Rohra (a school principal), and Sanjay Bhinde (a farmer).Miracle foodPooling all their resources, the team started research on pulses. Pulses are a miracle food. Theyre cheap, nutritious, climate resilient and easy to store. But our farmers have been ignoring them, and switching to more profitable cash crops, says Diwekar, adding that as a result, over the past few decades, people have forgotten how to use them.The senior interns, in fact, needed guidance from their elders. Nimbkar, who is 67, went to her 94-year-old mother-in-law. Bhinde took his questions to his village in Sangli, Maharashtra. Women there, in their 80s and 90s, told him about kulith, used for kollu rasam in the south, pithla in Maharashtra and khichadi in Himachal.You know a food belongs to a culture when you have diverse methods of using it, says Diwekar.Kulith became the star of this pulse campaign. It grows across the country, has an impressive nutrient profile and is packed with antioxidants. More importantly, its cheap. One serving of 25 grams, which contains 6.25 grams of protein, costs Rs.1.50. Compare that to Rs.5 egg, with 6.6 grams of protein. In the villages, they mix it with sugarcane juice and boil it for an easy, quick and nutritious snack for new mothers, says Diwekar.Traditionally, farmers would grow a grain, then follow it with pulses, which fixed nitrogen content into the soil. Then they would grow vegetables in that enriched soil. It meant we had a good sustainable cycle in place for generations. But these crops stopped bringing in money. So farmers abandoned them. Theres been a systematic brainwashing: we have been taught to look at everything native to us as suspicious or fattening, and everything we can eat out of a box as healthy.Theres hope though.With the Western world celebrating Indian super foods such as ghee, coconut oil and turmeric, Indians are finally appreciating their culinary inheritance.Diwekars not overly impressed by the shift. Instead of listening to our grandparents, we follow American food blogs, she says, adding dryly, Its like learning to love my child only after a DNA test proves its mine.If we want to eat better, we must become demanding consumers. Start asking for food that is grown responsibly. For food that is traditional, and nutritious. The market will respond.In the meantime, go through your grandmothers old recipe books. Every day, our senior interns would bring in food, kadhis and khichadis their grandmothers had taught them.Then she adds delightedly, Todays our final day, and they gave each of us a bhajani pulse mix as a farewell gift. It has 19 types of pulses and grains, and can be rolled into a chapati.Admit it. There is nothing in a box that can beat that.Urban India has forgotten how to grow, cook andeat a wealth of indigenous foods"

Archive photo Canara Coffee House was established on June 10, 1954. Archive photoVadodaras iconic and oldest cafe, Canara Coffee House, that represented the yesteryear charm and served its signature Maharashtrian and South Indian dishes, has met its end. Late on Sunday night, the restaurant was demolished by its owners, with a promise to return in a renewed avatar. For its hierarchy of fans  some second and third generation foodies  the loss is irreparable.Social media sites were flooded with eulogy from frequent patrons comprising students, executives and senior citizens, who reminisced the waiters with a pencil tucked behind their ears, taking down orders for the signature Poona Misal of the restaurant  steaming hot rice flakes and steamed lentils topped with yoghurt  and its dosas and uthappas; most importantly its inexpensive rate card that remained mostly unchanged over the years. As an assurance to its patrons, 82-year-old patriarch Pandurang Madhav Kudva, who has been running the coffee house, said, We will be back within some time and this is just a renovation we are doing. It is also an emotional time for us but we have to change with the time. We will be back with the same old taste and love.Kudva says, Nobel Laureate Venkatraman Ramakrishnan (Venki) has been a regular visitor to the cafe, since his days at Maharaja Sayajirao University. The coffee house was also frequented by several popular cricketers from Vadodara.Kudva said he had no idea that the Coffee House had a Fanpage on Facebook that was struck with shock and grief  the demolition, although rumours had been spiraling, was unexpected. A long-drawn dispute for the land with its original owners and a proposed road widening project of the VMC compelled Kudva to take the bold new step. He has purchased the plot and is now planning to design the structure to ensure that the impending road widening by the civic body does not hamper his business.Kudva said, I am happy now, as we have purchased the place where we ran our coffee house for a such a long time. However, I was upset by some of the social media messages which said, RIP and we miss you Canara Coffee House, I want to say them this is just a new beginning.Kudva said that his staff who have been loyal for the last 40 years, will also return. Kudva said, My staff is like family; that is the secret of our business. My restaurant will be closed for next three-four months but they have said they will work with us. That is the biggest wealth I have earned.Kudva who shifted from Karkala village of Karnataka at the age of 20 to help his brother-in-law Vasant Rao Mahle, who founded the Canara Coffee House in Vadodara on June 10, 1954. And, there is more assurance from the patriarch. The price at the brand new Canara restaurant will also be carried forward.

However, now Vijayawada is said to be the second city in the country after Hyderabad preparing this Arabic dish in such a large scale. Hyderabad-based eateries like Pista House, Bawarchi and city-based biryani points like Golden Pavilion, Southern Spice, Star Biryani have hired chefs from Hyderabad to prepare the dish. Infact, many of the joints started to install the 'bhatti' as early as two weeks ago.As many as 150 haleem centres have been set up in the city this year, out of which 12 are of the world famous Pista House. A self confessed foodie V Amar said, ""Areas with a prominent Muslim population in the city are dotted with haleem points. I've already tried the delicacy this year."" Haleem centres in Panja Centre, Labbipet, Autonagar and Bhavanipuram have been set up with special lighting and decoration.Restaurant owners said this year the prices have been raised slightly keeping in view the increased overhead costs. A 350 gram pack is being sold at Rs 120 and the 1.6 kg family pack is being sold at Rs 650. While head cooks, popularly called masters, are being paid huge sums for their month long service, they are usually accompanied by at least four helpers. Restaurant owners said along with the salaries, food and lodging has to be also taken care of for them.Farhan Khan, a haleem stall owner in Panja Centre, told TOI that he has hired a master from Hyderabad, who works full-time at the famous restaurant Sarvi. Farhan is paying a sum of Rs 1.3 lakh to his cook. ""Engaging a master during the Ramadan month is difficult. I had to shell out a huge amount for engaging one from Sarvi. He is bringing along four other workers. They will assist him in preparing the delicacy. We intend to ensure that the haleem is of the highest quality,"" said Farhan. He added that the party of five from Hyderabad would be given gifts after the Ramadan month concludes.Restaurant owners have made plans to transport the dish to neighbouring towns as well. Mini-vans and autos are being engaged to transport the dish to Guntur, Tenali, Machilipatnam, Ibrahimpatnam and Eluru.Meanwhile, Pista House and Bawarchi have entered into a partnership to set up haleem stalls in nearby towns. ""The taste of Hyderabadi haleem is world famous. Now, Muslims and people of other faiths can enjoy the dish in Vijayawada. Getting the same taste as Hyderabad is tough. That's why we called for master from Hyderabad,"" said Abdul Hassan, managing director of Bawarchi.This year Pista House opened their first branch in Andhra Pradesh, even though they sold haleem in Vijayawadites for the last two years. The five Pista House haleem points are at Moghalrajpuram, Autonagar, MG Road, Panja Centre and Eluru Road. ""We are keeping profit incentive aside, and are trying to reach as many people as possible. After receiving good response for our product in the last two years we decided to expand business in Vijayawada,"" said U Nirmal, manager of Pista House."

No serious adverse effects were noted, Dr. Urooj noted.If any negative effects were seen, it was in those who over-indulge in food after Iftar (breaking of fast) or do not sleep well at night., she said. However, Dr. Urooj cautioned people with Type 1 diabetes against fasting. The medical condition of persons with Type 1 diabetes may worsen if they fast, she added. Also, she said fasting might be hazardous to persons suffering from gastrointestinal diseases. Researches on fasting and its effects on digestive disorders report that Ramzan fasting seems to increase peptic ulcer complications.On lipid profileReferring to improvement in blood lipid profile, Dr. Urooj cited a study conducted in 1997 in the Annals of Nutrition Metabolism that demonstrated fasting lowered bad LDL cholesterol by eight per cent, triglyceride by 30 per cent and increased good HDL by 14.3 per cent, thereby protecting the heart from cardiovascular diseases. This is explained by the eating habits, she said adding that people tend to go for healthier options such as dates, nuts, lentil soup and home cooked meals.On blood pressureDr. Urooj also said persons with mild to moderately high blood pressure along with being overweight are encouraged to fast as fasting may help lower their blood pressure.But, she said such persons should consult their physicians to adjust the medicine. For example, the dose of diuretics should be reduced to prevent dehydration, she said. Fasting lowers blood glucose and insulin levels, causing breakdown of glycogen from liver to provide glucose for energy needs and breakdown of fat for energy needs. Diabetics, who are controlled by diet alone, can fast and hopefully with weight reduction, their diabetes may even be treated and improved.But, diabetics, who are taking oral hypoglycemic agents along with diet, should exercise extreme caution if they decide to fast. They should consult their physician regarding the drug time and dosage, preferably take the drug with Iftar in the evening. Diabetics taking insulin should fast under the close medical supervision and make suitable changes in the insulin dose, she said.Dr. Urooj also emphasised the need for consulting a nutritionist to select the right food ingredients, particularly sources of carbohydrates, proteins and fats to produce the lente effect (sustained release of nutrients).She emphasised the need to monitor blood sugar level before breaking the fast and after Iftar . If blood sugar is less than 70 mg/dl, one may feel dizzy, trembling, palpitations, sweaty and tired/fatigued. If these symptoms are present, they may have to break the fast by taking fruit juice or glucose drink and follow it up with a snack/small meal after 10 to 15 minutes. Never ignore warning of hypoglycemia, she said.Fasting has a positive impact on ones blood glucose level, blood pressure, lipid profile and weight.Asna Urooj,Chairperson, Department of Studies in Food Science and Nutrition, UoM"

The meeting was chaired by Consumer Affairs Secretary Hem Pande.Mr. Pande expressed the hope that similar steps would be taken by other States to make pulses available at reasonable prices.The government said that as on June 13, 2016, the procurement of Rabi pulses had reached 64,000 tonnes. Together with the earlier procurement of 51,000 tonnes of the Kharif season, the total domestic procurement by government agencies had reached 1,15,000 tonnes.Buffer stocksThe Centre has also ordered further import of 12,500 tonnes of pulses for buffer stocks, which include 10,000 tonnes of masur and 2,500 tonnes of urad. So far, 14,321 tonnes of pulses have been imported by the government agencies against the total contracted quantity of 38,500 tonnes, the statement said.While reviewing the lifting and distribution of the pulses allocated from the buffer stock, Mr. Pande said that only Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Delhi had lifted the allocated pulses. Requests for allocation are still awaited from other States, said the statement quoting Mr. Pande. The meeting also reviewed the measures being taken by the States to check hoarding."

However, not many state governments have evinced an interest as they are not keen to add to the list of items sold through the public distribution system. Only four states Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana and Maharashtra have lifted some quantity of pulses from the buffer stock.The Centre has offered to supply unmilled toor dal at Rs 66 per kg and urad at Rs 82 per kg to state governments with a directive against selling it beyond Rs 120 per kg."

Well, Uthly is born. Having managed to twist every cuisine to suit the Indian palate, we have Indianised noodles, pasta and sushi too. Taking this a step further, the city has opened doors to fusion food, the final product of which is a mix of flavours, texture and aromas. The idea is to bring together two or more cuisines to get a funky yet appetising dish. So, pull together ingredients from across the globe and create a unique recipe that suits your taste buds.Chef Shailendra Kekade, from a Balewadi-based restaurant, knows his food and how. His latest experiment is the Thai Bombay duck fry. Ask him what made him introduce this and he says, ""A Bombay duck fry is a favourite but not everyone gets it right. The rawa preparation needs perfection to attain the bang-on taste. So, I decided to twist the recipe to get a more tempting outcome.""Bombay duck fried in chilli and Thai spices marinade deep fried in a tempura batter. The dish brings out the flavour of Bombay duck like never before.Are you bored of eating the same old burgers? So, here's a twist. Chef Manu Nair, from a Kondhwa-based restaurant, shares, ""With the introduction of Uthly we hope to get young consumers intrigued about the cuisine. Uthly is an innovative healthy alternative to a burger made from healthy South Indian ingredients.""A lip-smacking combination of seven layers of authentic South Indian goodies, right from toasted rice cake on the base, topped with crispy lettuce, garden fresh salad, Malabar croquettes, special sauce, podi-coated lentil cakes and finally covered with a toasted rice cake on top.A vada pav needs no introduction. It is always a hot favourite for a quick bite or snack option. Making this dish yummier is its meaty variant. Shailendra says, ""The meat instead of potato adds tadka to the all-time favourite vada pav.""A chicken patty marinated in mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, coriander and curry leaves. It is deep fried in besan and served with pav, like the original.Two years ago when Pankaj Gomase, from Kharadi, was relishing two of his favourite foods, the idea of Modak Chaat came up. Pankaj says, ""I love modaks and chaats. When I was relishing these, I thought of combining them. This is how modak chaat was born. It is a healthy anytime snack."" He also sells ragi gola and Pandarpur ragda pav. ""People were sceptical at first, but now they come from across the city to relish this,"" he adds.Palm-sized modaks in bowls with soaked layers of tamarind and mint chutney, curd, spicy groundnuts and a sprinkle of chaat masala and coriander leaves. The dumpling is filled with carrots, potato, capsicum and more.Imagine a Chinese twist to your favourite paneer makhni. Delicious? Chef Vishwesh agrees. He says, ""We wanted to create a new taste and serve a different recipe to our guests. It is difficult to acquire a new taste, however when you mix two yummy connotations (read paneer makhni and noodles) you are bound to get a winner.""Creamy, rich and tangy, paneer makhani gravy tossed together in a wok with noodles. The bland noodles get a lift in taste and aroma with the makhni gravy. You can experiment a little more by adding dollops of butter or fresh cream.Nothing can go wrong with tandoori chicken. A favourite among everyone the, dish gets a twist when combined with dimsums. Chef Vishwesh Khanna, from Pimpri, shares, ""The USP of a tandoori dimsum is the texture and flavour.

Venkaiah Naidu (Parliamentary Affairs) plunged into damage control exercise, chalking out a roadmap and stringent measures to bring down the prices.The high-powered ministerial panel met on the directive of Prime Minister Narendra Modi as growing prices of essential item like potatoes (60 per cent dearer in wholesale markets) and pulses getting costlier by 36 per cent over the past year, pushed up India's annual wholesale inflation for the second month in May to its highest levels in nearly two years.""Gadkari and Venkaiah Naidu were not part of the original ministerial team set up recently. But today they attended the meeting as special emissaries of the Prime Minister,"" a source said.""In order to bring down the growing prices of pulses, the government today decided to boost imports via public and private agencies. This will help meet the deficit,"" an official source told IANS.The government is also keen to work out joint strategies with states and sought urgent steps on adequate procurement and actions against hoarders. The meeting, also attended by senior officials from the Food, Finance and Agriculture ministries, reviewed steps taken so far on inadequate storage facilities and procurement problems.The procurement of Rabi (winter) pulses has reached to 64,000 MT while the government has also ordered further import of 12,500 MT pulses for buffer stocks. A ministry source said that together with earlier procurement of 51,000 MT of kharif (summer) crop, total domestic procurement of pulses by June 13 had reached 1,15,000 MT.At the meeting, Paswan also said that while a pulse buffer stock is ready, the response from many states has not been encouraging.Besides pulses, the meeting also discussed the price conditions of tomato, sugar and wheat.Sources also said the meeting was also told that as a precautionary measure the government has procured 20,000 tonnes of onion to create a buffer stock to be utilised for market intervention.Earlier in the day, the Food ministry also flagged off mobile vans for selling pulses at reasonable prices in the capital.Paswan told reporters that ""Our department has been asked to procure more pulses for buffer stock"" and added that a team of officials will visit Myanmar soon to ensure early and smooth import of lentils.India's retail inflation also rose for the second straight month in May to 5.76 per cent from 5.47 per cent in the month before due to a sharp spike in food prices, Consumer Price Index (CPI) data said on Monday.--IANSnd/vd"

The country's pulses production is estimated to be 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June), while the demand is pegged at 23.5 million tonnes.The ministers discussed the progress made in imports of pulses as well as reviewed the buffer stocks position and lifting by state governments for retail distribution at subsidised rates.The government has procured 1.15 lakh tonnes pulses directly from farmers as of now for creating a buffer stock of 1.5 lakh tonnes this year.

Many African countries have also evinced interest to supply lentils to India.Despite several measures, pulses are still ruling high at over Rs 170 per kg in most parts of the country due to a widening demand-supply gap following two successive droughts.Paswan, who launched sale of tur and urad at a subsidised Rs 120 per kg through mobile vans of co-operative NCCF in the national capital today, said: ""If prices rise despite this move, the Centre is not responsible. In a federal structure, states have equal responsibility in controlling prices.""Passage of the GST Bill and creation of the national common agriculture market would address the price rise issue to a large extent, he hoped.The National Cooperative Consumers' Federation of India (NCCF) is the third player after Mother Dairy's Safal and Kendriya Bhandar that will be selling tur and urad at the subsidised rate in the national capital.Asserting that the Centre is ""serious"" about the price rise issue, Paswan said, ""We have created a buffer stock and have asked states to place their requirement for retail distribution.

But it is yet to be popular in Jharkhand.This is because the state farmers are apprehensive about cultivating pulse in place of the traditional paddy.To clear this bottleneck, the department of agriculture and experts are jointly focusing on improving the production of pulses ahead of the kharif season this year.Director of state agriculture department Jata Shankar Choudhary said that there has been a marked improvement in pulse production since the launch of National Food Security Mission (NFSM) in which pulse is a major component. ""As against three lakh hectare land under pulse cultivation in state, the area has doubled to six lakh hectare in the last two years,"" he said.He added that this qualified the state for winning the Krishi Karman award twice. Choudhary said that it was because of the farmers' reluctance to opt for any new crop, that the department and agriculture extension centres are still trying hard to popularize pulse cultivation.About 77% area of pulses in Jharkhand is available in 15 districts namely Gumla, Palamu, Simdega, Garhwa, Latehar, Ranchi, West Singhbhum, Seraikela, Dumka, Giridih, Lohardaga, Hazribagh, Pakur, Chatra and Sahebganj. All these 15 districts of Jharkhand have been included under NFSM-Pulses in which special support including subsidy on high yielding varieties of seeds are given to the farmers.Agriculture secretary, Nitin Madan Kulkarni said that in the 1st phase of NFSM, the government thrust on pulses has been in Palamu, Garhwa, Chatra, Simdega and Lohardaga districts.He has asked district development managers (DDMs) of National Agriculture Bank for Rural Development and State Agriculture Management and Extension Training Institute (SAMETI) to organize town hall meetings in all the districts.In this meetings, progressive farmers will be invited to indicate the quantity of pulse seeds (and arhar seeds in particular) available withthem for distribution during the ensuing season. ""The government will provide details of government schemes and support to the farmer club members,"" he said.At the national level, Jharkhand ranks seventh in pigeon pea (arhar),eighth in urad and 12th in moong daal production whereas it is yet to catch up with the top ten states in the production of chickpea(chana) and lentils (masoor)."

Tandoors are readied, onions deep fried and meat pieces spiced up for the Iftari spreads. Ramzan , the month of fasting and feasting, beckons the devout as well the foodie in you to experience an array of delicacies that are served in several areas of the city. We scouted Kondhwa, Azam Campus, Babajaan Chowk, Shivaji Market and Synagogue Street and here's a guide of the feast trails that will ensure you eat to your heart's content and soak in the festivities of this ongoing celebration.En route Kondhwa, make a stop at Baba Jaan Chowk for the haleem, that is a close match to its Hyderabadi counterpart. While many in the city prefer khichda and often term it 'Puneri haleem', there's a small eatery that still serves Hyderabadi haleem. Light yellow in colour, it's cooked for as long as 12 hours, to render the taste and texture. Ashfaque, from Four Season's, which has erected a tiny kiosk to sell Hyderabadi haleem, shared, ""Iftar isn't complete without indulging in haleem. Since it is difficult to prepare at home, many buy it from us. It's also more preferred than khichda since it is less spicy and easy to digest."" There's falooda available in different flavours, a little ahead of Babajaan Chowk. Complete with rabdi and ice-cream, these colourful coolers from Sakhi Falooda cannot be missed either. Ask for Akbar Siddiqui, who makes a special kulfi falooda, laden with rabdi and ice-cream.Iftar or not, Shivaji Market and its adjoining areas are always bustling with shoppers and foodies. Though the regular seekh Kebabs and biryanis at Radio Hotel andBismillah can be tried, there's halwa paratha, to end your meals. While eating at the spot isn't recommended, enjoy a guilt-free indulgence of crispy paratha and saffron halwa, laden with dry fruits, ghee and sugar, at home.The road leading to Azam Campus, is a quaint and narrow one on normal days. However, in the month of Ramzan, it comes alive, with a string of makeshift eateries, serving delectable finger foods, to break your fast. Be it deep-fried sesame toasts (bread topped with sesame seeds, chicken and spinach), seekh kebabs or shami kebabs, the aroma of them are inviting. There isn't much parking space available, and the stalls aren't hygienic. However, if you are willing to devour some kebabs and raan masala at home, here's where you can pack it from. Moosa Meethal, from Agra Hotel that serves an array of fried quails or tittar, chicken cornflakes and chicken hot fries, shared, ""The sale of iftar picks up after evening everyday. While most of the customers prefer take-aways, there's seating option as well. This year, we have introduced cornflake chicken and chicken hot fry. Both are Indianised versions of fried chicken and chicken pizza respectively, to adapt to the Indian taste."" The raan masala, that's available a little ahead, is a whole mutton leg, marinaded and cooked in Mughlai spices. Made by Shalimar Hotel, it is also a must-have here.A detour to Synagogue Street is recommended, before you head to Kondhwa, a haven for iftar comfort food. Imdadi, a huge eating joint, near railway reservation office, is put up during the holy month. While other iftari spreads have adapted to a mix of cuisines, with Russian kebabs, mayo chicken rolls and pizzas, Imdadi, sticks to what's traditional. There aren't many finger foods to try from; however, main course has many varieties  bhindi gosht , korma, kheema and dalcha. Laden with spices and flavours, the khichda, served in chicken, mutton and beef, is also worth a try, with a generous topping of fried onions and crushed lime juice. ""We have stuck to the authentic iftari fare during Ramzan. Though many eateries have come up with variations of snacks, we serve only shami and seekh kebabs and samosas, as they are the traditional delights. Also, the huge oven in which the chicken tandoori is prepared is quite a sight. This encourages many foodies to try it,"" shared Shakeel Shaikh, from Imdadi.If you haven't been to Kausarbaug, your iftar isn't complete. As you enter the bustling road from Kondhwa, the huge eatery, Sharif is sure to grab your attention. Divided in two sections, there's food everywhere and the sight is enticing. From the bland Russian kebabs to spicy chicken chakoris and kaadi gosht, you might be spoilt for choice. As you move on to the main course, select from chicken taka tak, a mix of chicken legs and minced mutton, nalli nihari, mutton cooked in nihari flavour and dalcha, meat in lentils, to name a few. This is not all. The shahi tukda, soaked in syrupy milk, jumbo sized malpuas with a generous helping of rabdi, gulab jamuns, caramel custard and phirni  a day isn't enough to try it all."

The talks followed after the production of pulses dropped by 12 per cent in the country this year and the prices increased by 80 to100 per cent in the national market. The Centre is importing pulses from Mozambique and other African countries besides Iraq and Iran. ""We had a discussion with the Centre recently, and since the price of the pulses is high in the country, the government suggested to import pulses,"" Jamatul Islam, deputy director of food, civil supply and consumer affairs department of Kamrup (metro), told The Telegraph today. He Islam said the current supply for Assam comes from the Kishanganj area in New Delhi. However, the major hurdle in acquiring the imported pulses is that the district will have to take unprocessed pulses. ""Assam does not have any mills to process the imported pulses. Delhi has suggested that those can be processed in mills in other parts of the country. But that will incur an additional cost to the product,"" Islam said. After the talks with the traders, the district administration has asked them to ascertain a price which will be both profitable for them and cheaper than the current rate. ""After adding the processing cost and the minimum profit, if the price of the imported pulses is higher than the current price, then it won't help. So, we have asked them to fix a price,"" said Islam. The current price of masoor dal is Rs 100 to Rs 120, chana dal is Rs 120 while the price of urad dal is Rs 160 per kg."

The retail outlets are supposedly selling the lentil at the said rates on the pretext of giving a Ramzan discount.Khader asked officials of his department to conduct surprise checks of the outlets and issue them notices if they are found to be selling the lentil at such high prices. Other multi-brand retail outlets like Adani and Reliance will also come under the scanner, the minister said.Khader said the association had agreed to sell tur dal at Rs 130 per kg (regular quality) and Rs 145 per kg (premium quality) at select counters in wholesale markets. Tur dal will be sold at these rates for the next three months, so that prices are controlled.Harsh Gupta, principal secretary of the department, said that Karnataka had sought 5,000 metric tonnes of tur dal from the Centre, and the consignment was expected to arrive next week. He said the departments powers to curb hoarding were limited to specifying/restricting stock limits to retail outlets.A trader has brought to the departments notice that the More supermarket chain was selling tur dal at high prices. The price appears to be high. We will examine the matter and if it is found that consumer rights are being affected, then we will refer the matter to the consumer court.According to Gupta, the government cannot dictate terms to independent businesses but can only put restrictions on the stock held."

The 250 year old vada, built in the time of the Bhosale rule in Nagpur, can now be hired for holding private functions.Giving a glimpse of how an event could be organized at the charming structure, Vilas and Neeta Kale, the trustees of Sir Gangadharrao Chitnavis Trust that manages the property, gave the guests a taste of traditional Maharashtrian hospitality. The carved wooden pillars had marigold flowers wrapped around it and hanging lights from the rafters along the ceiling bathed the insides of the wada in a warm glow. ""The place is ideal for traditional functions. The wada offers a natural setting for those who have a taste for aesthetics and wish to relive the charms of a bygone era,"" said Vilas Kale. The art work on the walls, the ancient artefacts that adorn various sections of the place provide a quaint aura to the place.The food was served in the traditional 'pengat' style where guests are seated on a patala or very low stools and served. Food, served on banana leaves was essentially Maharashtrian. The menu was carefully planned too, as nearly five varieties of salads, dips and relishes occupied the left hand top corner of the leaf. Patal bhaji and kadi were served to go with plain rice and masala bhat. But the star of the meal was gola bhat, a vada made with lentils served with plain rice and seasoned with tempered oil. ""The trick is to mash the vada in the rice completely,"" explained Neeta Kale insisting that the guest enjoyed this Maharashtrian delight.The Trustees hope to attract events of 50 to 100 persons, and will provide the catering and decoration to go with the function. ""We have sufficient parking space, rest rooms and people who would serve and attend to the guest to make it a memorable affair,"" said Neeta."

In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"

The country had imported 5.78 million tonnes in the entire 2015-16 fiscal to meet domestic demand.""Imports are happening. About 1.2-1.3 million tonnes of pulses have already been imported. Moreover, private traders have contracted for 3 million tonnes of pulses to be shipped between September and December,"" India Pulses and Grains Association (IPGA) Chairman Pravin Dongre told .Asked about the landed cost of imported pulses, he said it is Rs 32-33 per kg for yellow peas, Rs 92-93 for tur dal, Rs 105-106 for urad, Rs 65 for masoor and Rs 58-60 for moong.Importers are selling it to millers and wholesellers at a very less margins, he said.On overall imports for this fiscal, Dongre said it would depend on monsoon.""If monsoon is good as projected, domestic production will increase. Then imports will be less in the last quarter of this fiscal,"" IPGA Vice Chairman Bimal Kothari said.IPGA said the pulses prices have gone up in domestic market due to fall in production on account of poor and unseasonal rains in two consecutive crop years.Pulses production fell to 17.06 million tonnes in the 2015-16 crop year (July-June) from 17.15 million tonnes in the previous year. In 2013-14, output was over 19 million tonnes.As a result, retail prices of pulses have shot up with Tur and urad dals selling at as high as Rs 180 per kg and Rs 198 per kg, respectively, in the retail markets.Chana dal is being sold at Rs 105 per kg, while moong and masoor at Rs 130 and Rs 110 per kg respectively.The government recently decided to enhance the buffer stock limit of pulses to 8 lakh tonnes for making market intervention when prices firm up in retail markets. It is also importing pulses to boost domestic supply.So far, 1.19 lakh tonnes of pulses has been procured from farmers for creating buffer stock and 46,000 tonnes have been contracted for imports.

Telegraph picture Jorhat, July 4: The Jorhat district administration in Upper Assam has decided to put up two digital display boards at a vantage point to flash prices of essential items, including fruits and vegetables, on a daily basis. The move is part of measures adopted to curb price rise. In another move, the administration today suspended the licence of a grocery wholesaler on the charge of selling insect-infected dal. The developments come after chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal last week directed all deputy commissioners of the districts to visit markets, selling essential commodities, themselves and take action against traders indulging in hoarding and black-marketing in view of reports of excessive increase of prices of food items. Jorhat deputy commissioner (in-charge), Roshni Aparanji Korati, told The Telegraph that with an aim to make people aware and bring in transparency in the system of pricing of essential commodities, the administration has decided to install two digital display boards showing prices (mainly wholesale) of goods on a daily basis. She said the display boards - to function round the clock - will be updated daily and installed at a locationfrom where the boards will be easily visible. Korati said the footbridge on AT Road in the Chowk Bazar area has been selected for putting up the boards as it is the busiest road in the town and the bridge is visible from both the east and west from a distance. Korati added that the Upper Assam Chamber of Commerce (UACC), the oldest traders' organisation in Upper Assam, has agreed to fund the project. She said wholesale prices of grocery items, edible oil, vegetables and fruits will be updated on a daily basis by the food, civil supplies and consumer affairs department with all wholesale traders' bodies agreeing to cooperate in the process. Korati said attempts will be made to include retail prices of grocery items, edible oil and others, if space permits. She said the boards would be up within this month and the UACC told her that those have to be procured from outside Assam. Korati also said instructions have been given to the Jorhat Municipal Board (JMB) to put up boards in different areas stating whether a particular area was notified for collecting daily tax from vendors by agents of contractors allotted by the civic body. She said the licence of RK Enterprise of Marwari Patty here has been suspended for allegedly selling insect-infested masur dal unfit for human consumption. Jorhat joint director (in-charge) food, civil supplies and consumer affairs, Nekibur Rahman Borbora, said the licence of the wholesaler has been suspended for violating Assam Trade Articles (Licensing and Control) Order, 1982. Borbora said the shop would not be allowed to sell the item till a departmental inquiry is completed. After that, a case may be lodged in the court against the license holder. The dal sample has been sent to the Public Analyst Laboratory in Guwahati for tests. He said the three teams constituted by Korati comprising officials from his department, health and JMB, led by two executive magistrates, are visiting markets regularly and taking action if any irregularities are detected. UACC secretary Dulichand Agarwal welcomed the administration's initiative. He said the organisation will extend any cooperationneeded for public interest."
58fef1dd7be9e0420db29c12,Deal to buy Africa dal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160708/jsp/nation/story_95452.jsp,2016-07-08,"New Delhi, July 7: India wants to tell Africa it isn't after its land. Mozambique today became a test case. The two countries today signed a pact under which India will guarantee the purchase of lentils from Mozambique's farmers to meet its domestic demands, moving sharply away from a practice of leasing land in African countries that has attracted charges of ""neo-colonialism"". The agreement, signed during Narendra Modi's visit to Maputo today, is also part of a broader emphasis the foreign office has advised the Prime Minister to place on demonstrating more sensitivity during his four-nation Africa tour than India has in recent years. From the shortage of visits by Indian leaders to controversies surrounding alleged land grab by Indian companies, the foreign office wants Modi to deftly portray New Delhi as sensitive to African concerns, senior officials have told The Telegraph . Modi flew from Mozambique tonight to South Africa and will also visit Tanzania before ending his five-day trip in Kenya. Modi's visit to Nairobi, Kenya's capital, will be the first by an Indian Prime Minister in 35 years. Private Indian companies have leased over 2 million hectares of land across Africa - twice the combined area of Delhi, Goa and Sikkim - at mostly throwaway prices for periods as long as 99 years. These include lentil-growing Indian-owned farms spread across six countries. India already imports over 1,30,000 tonnes of lentils from these farms annually. But these land banks - which often involve the displacement of local residents - have triggered allegations of land grab, especially in instances where the private firm has not employed many local people. ""Sensitivity is very important,"" retired diplomat Anil Trigunayat, a former Indian ambassador to Libya and Malta who has represented India in 10 African countries, said. ""We need to be more sensitive to what they need, to their pride as nations, and to our shortcomings in the way we've dealt with them."" The pact signed in Maputo offers an alternative model to the land-leasing practices employed by Indian companies so far. Under the government-to-government agreement, India will provide seeds and technological expertise to Mozambique farmers to produce lentils under a jointly set up cooperative society. The farmers will be guaranteed a buyer - India - and will be assured a minimum support price on a par with what farmers in India receive. ""It's sort of like Amul,"" Amar Sinha, secretary (economic relations) in the ministry of external affairs, said earlier this week, explaining the model. ""Leasing land is quite controversial."" The pact is part of a larger strategy the foreign office wants the Prime Minister to employ on his trip to Africa, India's second-largest source of oil after West Asia. The four countries Modi is visiting are also emerging as key maritime partners in the Indian Ocean, while East Africa is home to a bulk of the Indian diaspora in the continent. But India is desperate not to appear only as hungering for Africa's resources and markets. ""We are not in the race for resources and minerals,"" Sinha said. Moving away from any path that can invite allegations of neo-colonialism - a charge China has faced - is important for India, Trigunayat said. ""Africans are proud people and are not ready to be neo-colonialised,"" the retired diplomat said. ""That's why China has faced a backlash. What is sad is that we have not been able to fill the resulting gap."" Through his visits, Modi is expected to signal that his government intends to maintain regular high-level political contacts with African leaders, many of whom have in the past accused India of remembering them only when it suits New Delhi. President Pranab Mukherjee visited Namibia, Ghana and Cote d'Ivoire last month, while Vice-President Hamid Ansari visited Tunisia and Morocco in May. ""And this is the schedule only for the first half of the year,"" Sinha said. But India must also stay cautious about the commitments - especially economic promises - it makes to African nations, Trigunayat cautioned. Far too often, African countries have complained about India promising lines of credit that are then delayed. ""We must only promise what we can deliver,"" Trigunayat said. ""There's no point committing something for which you don't have money."""

The shutdown comes at a time when restaurants styled on The Dhaba menu are doing brisk business.Sriparna Ghosh, who lives in Ballygunge Place, received the shock of her life last week when she found the shutters down with notices that declared the closure was permanent. ""The restaurant was open till the other day and I distinctly remember all the tables were full. Though many restaurants have come up in recent years, The Dhaba at Phari has retained its popularity due to its convenient location and wholesome food at reasonable prices. I hope whatever problem triggered the shutdown decision is resolved and the place reopens,"" she said.The owners  three brothers  are tired of the food business and have ""consciously"" shut it down. They would have perhaps quietly retired had the next generation shown interest. But several of their children migrating to Canada and the rest showing no inclination in serving mutton tadka and palak paneer, the owners said they were forced to take call as they were well past 60. Avtar Singh, the eldest brother is 70; Manjinder Singh, the youngest, is 64.A source close to the family said labour trouble had hastened the shutdown. ""At this age, the owners just did not want to plead with the workers and be at their mercy. The union is pretty strong in the restaurant. The owners felt they had endured enough and wanted to get out,"" he said. The staff had worked till Monday, June 27. The weekly closure was on Tuesday. When the staff returned to work on June 29, they too found the shutters down. The owners have since offered to settle their dues but the union has refused and wants the restaurant to reopen.Partho Dey from Garcha, who was a regular patron, said: ""It has happened with young Chinese who were no longer interested in the tannery business. Even in tea, Rajah Banerjee sold off the iconic Makaibari Tea Estate as his sons were not interested in the business. In both cases, the business did not evolve and excite the new. Ditto with Dhaba.""The Dhaba had its fair share of celebrity patrons like Tollywood stars Prosenjit and Dev and Bollywood actor Om Puri. But it's everyday south Kolkata folks like Payel Rakshit who will ""miss it most""."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160715/jsp/bihar/story_96725.jsp,2016-07-15,"Nitish Kumar Patna, July 14: Nitish Kumar is learnt to have linked India's recent MoU with Mozambique to import pulses with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ""failure"" to fulfil his promise to develop Mokama taal (lake), known as the pulse bowl of the country. The Bihar chief minister is gearing up to ""expose"" the ""reality"" behind the MoU signed with Mozambique last week, purportedly to address the shortfall of pulses and stabilize its prices in the country. ""Mokama taal has the potential to mitigate the pulse crisis as it alone constitutes 1.16 lakh hectares of the total 2.5 crore hectares on which pulses are grown in the country. Narendra Modi promised Rs 3,094 crore for the agriculture sector that incorporated the development of Mokama taal as part of his Rs 1.25 lakh crore special package for Bihar ahead of the Assembly elections. However, the Centre, contrary to fulfilling its promise, has also suspended the payment of Rs 4 crore under the Mokama taal development plan for the year 2016-17,"" a source close to Nitish said. The source added that the chief minister is working out a strategy to ""expose"" how Modi has resorted to importing pulses from the African nation instead of finding a lasting solution to the ""pulse crisis"" that was a major issue in the 2015 polls. JDU spokesman Neeraj Kumar, who belongs to the Mokama taal area and who is part of Nitish's strategy team, confirmed the chief minister's impending move. ""While the detailed project report (DPR) worth Rs 5,500 crore for the development of the pulse-growing Mokama taal area is lying with the Centre for the past two years, the production of pulses has drastically gone down in the last three years and imports have risen. The Centre imported 37 lakh tonnes and 57 lakh tonnes of pulses during 2014-15 and 2015-16 respectively against 30.4 lakh tonnes during 2013-14. It shows that Modi, who is calling for 'make in India' and development of eastern states, is making no genuine effort to harness the potential of Bihar's pulse producing region,"" he said. ""The Adani port, a part of the Adani group, entered into an agreement with the Indian Pulses and Grain Association - a government body dealing in pulses - in 2015. The JDU strongly feels that the Prime Minister has signed the MoU with Mozambique for the import of pulses to benefit Adani rather than controlling the sky rocketing prices of pulses in the country,"" Neeraj added. Nitish is likely to raise the issue at the coming Niti Ayog council meeting of chief ministers and also at other political and governance forums in the days to follow, the party spokesman said. Located right across the Barauni Thermal Power Corporation - a symbol of Jawaharlal Nehru's vision of industrialisation - on the northern bank of the river Ganga, Mokama taal is spread over 1,062 sq km comprising seven continuous lakes and is fed by the Ganga, Punpun, Harohar and several other local rivers. It stays submerged in four feet to six feet deep water from July to September. The farmers grow chana (gram) and masur - varieties of pulses - once the water recedes in September and October. Farmers have been fighting for water management and development of Mokama taal area for decades. The issue is close to Nitish's heart - he represented Barh, of which Mokama is a part, for five terms in the Lok Sabha before it was delimited in 2008."

Picture by Sarat Patra It was a proud moment for Biswanath Mishra, who served Lord Jagannath Odisha's popular poda pitha when his chariot stopped at the Mausi Maa temple on its way back from Gundicha temple to the Shree Mandir on the bahuda today. Poda pitha is the state's most popular sweet made of rice, jaggery, coconut and lentils. It is a tradition for Lord Jagannath to stop at the Mausi Maa temple during bahuda yatra and have a bite of poda pitha before returning to his abode. There is an interesting history behind the making of this particular poda pitha, which has been prepared by Biswanath and his family for generations. Biswanath told The Telegraph that his forefathers had started the ritual that he is now carrying forward. He plans to confer the responsibility to his successors after him. ""We are very proud to be selected by the temple administration for the job. It is indeed a privilege to say that the Lord ate the sweets made by us,"" said Biswanath. He said they prepare the poda pitha in a similar way as other people. However, the sweet made by his family never go waste and has never got lost during the preparation process. Biswanath said they prepare the sweet at a secret place. Devotees also enjoy the Lord's halt at the Mausi Maa temple for this ritual as the sweets, after being served to Jagannath, is distributed among his devotees. ""I came here all the way from Rayagada to witness the rath yatra and seek the blessings of Lord Jagannath. I had a bite of the poda pitha at Mausi Maa Temple after it was served to the Lord. I feel blessed to have this opportunity,"" said Biraja Nayak, a homemaker. Legend has it when Bharat of the Ramayan accused his mother Kaikeyi of forcing Lord Ram to go to the forest, she felt guilty and cried. To pacify her, Ram promised that in his next birth, he would visit her house and have pora pitha. Since then, the Mausi Maa temple is considered that of Kaikeyi who serves the sweet to Lord Jagannath."

The incident inspired him to start researching on words that are common to both Tamil and Korean languages.Although a possibility of the two cultures sharing a common origin has been disputed due to a lack of genetic and anthropological links Kim, who will soon give a presentation on the topic during the Madras Week celebration, asserts that Asians in general share a lot of values and are indeed genetically related. He adds that India's mission to capitalise on the growth potential of Asia has to be studied and developed so that South Korea and India can be considered as sister countries.During his research, Kim came across about 500 words in Tamil and Korean which share the same meaning and pronounciation. For instance the Korean word 'Apahada' which is 'Avadhipadu' in Tamil means the same --'in pain' or 'suffer'-in both languages. Similarly 'Vanakam' (hello in Tamil) in Korean is 'Vangapta', 'Manaive' (wife) is 'Manura' and 'Nal' (day) is also 'Nal'.Not just words, the two cultures share a lot of cultural and traditional practices too. Just like Tamils, Koreans have the habit of leaving the slippers outside the house and bowing before the elders as a sign of respect.And when it comes to syntax and grammar, Korean and Tamils share the same sentence structure. For example, 'I am cutting the grass' in Korean is 'Naan pul-ul-beda'.Kim says another thread of similarity could be a stone that Huh, the first queen of Kaya kingdom, took from India to Korea. This could be the 'Illavattakkal', the practice of a man lifting weight to prove his strength.The old Tamil ritual involved a young girl asking her lover to lift a heavy stone to prove his strength. These stones are still found in interior villages of Tamil Nadu, says Kim.""When a baby is born in Korea, we have green chillies hung outside the house to ward off evil spirits and I find the same practice here too. It is remarkably surprising to see girls playing five stones here just like Korea. These are some things that goad me to look deeper into the cultural similarities and I must say I feel com pletely at home here,"" he says.He substantiates his argument by citing examples of Korean food which are similar to the Tamil cuisine. Rice cakes, rice puff and lentil cakes are a few to name. ""There must have been an exchange of cultural habits and cuisines when people from both the cultures migrated to each other's' country ,"" he adds.The connection between the two cultures is believed to date back to the reign of King Suro and Ayi of Pandian Kingdom in CE 45. Experts don't rule out the possibility of queen Huh taking Tamil culture to Korea with her when she left India.Kannan Narayanan, a professor in AIMST University , Malaysia and an expert in Tamil-Korean heritage, says the Koreans are as emotional as Indians and have the same affinity for bonding and intimacy like Tamils. ""Even the smallest similarity is something we have to be really proud of.We just can't have a meal without pickle and they too can't have food without it. The Koreans believe they have Indian ancestors and the queen who migrated from India may have been highly influenced by the Tamils.""

It is remarkably surprising to see girls playing five stones here just like Korea. These are some things that goad me to look deeper into the cultural similarities and I must say I feel completely at home here, he says.He substantiates his argument by citing examples of Korean food which are similar to the Tamil cuisine. Rice cakes, rice puff, and lentil cakes are a few to name. There must have been an exchange of cultural habits and cuisines when people from both the cultures migrated to each others country, he adds.The connection between the two cultures is believed to date back to the reign of King Suro and Ayi of Pandian Kingdom in CE 45. Experts dont rule out the possibility of queen Huh taking Tamil culture to Korea with her when she left India.Kannan Narayanan, a professor in AIMST University, Malaysia and an expert in Tamil-Korean heritage, says the Koreans are as emotional as Indians and have the same affinity for bonding and intimacy like Tamils. Even the smallest similarity is something we have to be really proud of. We just cant have a meal without pickle and they too cant have food without it. The Koreans believe they have Indian ancestors and the queen who migrated from India may have been highly influenced by the Tamils. He adds that more research should be done in the area to strengthen the relationship between the two countries."
58f580117be9e01a17c9b2ac,"Food for thought, and some for history",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/chennai/Food-for-thought-and-some-for-history/articleshow/53379860.cms,2016-07-26,"If it's a south Indian household, it's got to have MS chanting Suprabhatam in the background as the family sips filter kaapi from steel tumblers, right? And we all, as a clannish compulsion, eat thayir sadam every single day, right? But what if that was not always so? What if we tell you our forefathers had a different breakfast/lunch/dinner menu and that they didn't really gorge on idli and dosai like we do now? Well, much of what we eat in Chennai, today, is a give and take of influences from as far as Greece, tracing a pattern of the ups and downs of the spice route, of the early British settlers, and the later requirements of affluent Chettiars... Some of the dishes that we order without a second thought today, have traversed a fascinating history down the food route.""Till the Brits started the plantations, we didn't know what tea and coffee was, and dutifully drank pasumpaal (cow's milk). But the Brits made drinking tea and coffee fashionable. Again, it was a very gradually acquired taste, frowned upon by good 'desi' types who only drank milk back then. And so, our famous kaapi drinking habit is an imported one."" Geeta DoctorThere was absolutely no culture of eating out. Lunch was served between 9.30am and 10am. And that is how the tiffin culture started in Chennai  way back during the times of the early settlers  as a stop-gap arrangement between lunch and dinner. So those working in the factories and offices would need something snacky to eat. ""That is how, idli, dosai and vadai became the staples down south,"" says Geeta Doctor, freelance journalist and food writer, adding, ""I am not saying we did not eat them before that. We did, but not as an everyday dish. The credit for popularising these dishes goes to the Udipi Hotels. Of course, there were others later, like Dasaprakash, and Woodlands Drive-In where tiffin time was about meeting up, without the family objecting to eating out  a place where young people would not be seen as being 'wild' for eating out. The Udipi hotels were the first to 'serve' idlis/dosais/vadais in portions outside of the home and this serving of two idlis with a variety of chutneys and sambar became a staple. The cooks were Brahmins from the Udipi Mutt, and that sort of made it food fit for the gods back then, it sanctified these three-four items associated with that hotel.""'Where does the dish Chicken 65 come from?' was what Amitabh Bachchan asked in the first season of KBC. Tamilians were perhaps the only ones who screamed the right answer in unison. There are more theories about how we 'own' this dish. One says AM Buhari of the Buhari chain of hotels, 'invented' the dish in 1965. One aunty suggested the name of the dish came about because it took 65 days to prepare the marinade... or maybe, it was the 65th dish on a longish Army menu card... or did the name come about because it was made of chickens which were exactly 65 days old? Yet another story is that the chicken was marinated with 65 red spicy chillies, and hence the name. And well, are you man enough to down something that fiery (aambala singam da) and all went with it? Well, whatever the story is, we still have it on the menu everywhere down south. We. Own. It!... brought to us the railway mutton curry, essentially a Bengali dish of a curried gravy with mutton and vegetables. Today, when you order it in your favourite Nungambakkam restaurant, note that this dish is a variation of what originated when the British Raj colonial-era upper crust (that travelled first class in trains) desired to eat. It was a non-fussy preparation, that involved bunging everything into a pot and letting it simmer for hours as the train traversed the length of the country, and hence, ideal as a train preparation.We, Tamilians, didn't enter Earth slurping on thayir sadam. The dish came much later... it was almost in the early 40s that we discovered the art of mixing it all, and packing it together with a dollop of pickle for that tickle on the palate. So much so, that today, every five-star hotel discreetly places a bowl of the dish bang in the middle of even a Continental food festival. ""Much of our food habits today were also defined by our forefathers' travelling habits. When the railways came in, and people began to travel, they realized that they had to eat food at the stations (""Shiva, Shiva! Enna sollarel?""), or take something packed from home. And that made thayir sadam quite the hero of 'eating out', even as you ate homemade,"" says Geeta, and adds, ""Till then, thayir sadam wasn't perhaps a standalone dish; it was the last course of a meal, but on the train, it was an easy thing to eat, and quite flavourful, too. Soon, variety rice also came about  as people discovered rice could be mixed with veggies and spices and packed into a lunch box to be carried wherever they went.""There was never anything called the curry and rice in our forefathers' menu, ever. There was, however, a man called P Venkatachalam, who decided to mix all the masala we use, bottle it, and export it, as he discovered how much the Brits loved this masala. ""If you look at our cooking, we never have one set of masalas for all, but he sort of mixed it all up back then and created the curry powder, which went to Britain, and spread all over. Today, even here, we serve a dish, which was never part of our milieu to begin with  the curry rice,"" says Geeta.If it weren't for us taking appalams and papadams on train journeys to add crunch to our variety rice, the others would never have figured out what it was, loved it, taken it to their respective countries, and made the simple papadam a Conde Nast traveller's itinerary must-try.It is considered a 'Madras preparation' the world over, and is still a proud dish on all upper-crust menus in town. But ever considered how it came about as you relish a hot bowl? Here's how: Famous clubs back then served a mix of food cooked for the British upper class by the Indians. The mulligatawny soup came that way  prepared quite the way a south Indian would make rasam, but with milder spices, and more suited to the British palate. The clubs served a soup, a main course, and a dessert  which was often a rice pudding, or a thicker version of paal payasam, if you'd have it, laughs Geeta. The soups also came the railway route. The catering was done by the Anglo-Indians, but the makers of those dishes were very much we people.So, that snacky tidbit you order was never our invention either. Neither is the bread-butter-omelette that all bachelors gulp down with tea at the ubiquitous stalls all around town for breakfast or lunch. These dishes also came up the railway route, via the Anglo-Indians who catered on trains. They had the Indian cooks mix Indian spices and veggies as they do for their own mince pie versions. The bread, with the omelette packed into it, was also a creation from back then.We adapted a Greek rice dish, and made it ours! ""The biryani, which we've sort of stamped as our own, is essentially a Unani dish, and is more in culture with north India. But we've adapted it to our palate, with what is available here. Today, there are so many variations of the biryani available all over the state, that we never question its origin,"" says Bangera, and adds, ""Today, at our hotel, I make buttermilk panacotta  I'm taking an Italian dish, and adapting it to our current trends. What is south Indian cooking, but a clever mix and match of rice, lentils, vegetables and spices? You can create anything you want with those, and the creativity of a cook now, if liked by many, can become 'our' dish in the future. So, the food scenario is evolving all the time, and I am sure our ancestors did the same  they just made the best use of what was available to them, with what knowledge of cooking they came across.""The Marathas who ruled Tanjore for about 12 odd years are the ones who gave us those twists on sambhar we all love to call 'Chettinad' style of cooking  the pitla, the rasavangi... dishes that had just that extra punch of the tangy kokum and chilli, but made pretty much the same way we make sambar. They also left us with the 'poli' that sweet roti... But research reveals an interesting theory. Dr Suresh, an archaeologist, says the sambhar was really a Maratha preparation which we slurped up, and not the other way round. It was named after Sambaji, the son of the great Maratha warrior, Shivaji. Apparently, the royal scion was so hungry one day that he couldn't wait for the royal cooks to cook him anything. So, went to the kitchen himself and prepared dal in the Maharashtrian way he knew. And lo... Sambaji had made sambhar for the first time!""At our hotel, we serve something called the Chennai Chowder. It is created for Chennai, using local spices and herbs. It's popular, and is going to stay on the Chennai culinary map forever. I look at everything from the perspective of Chennai, and Tamil Nadu. The chowder is a very American dish, but at the end of the day, it is just a way of cooking, and we produce the same using indigenous ingredients. That's how food evolves everywhere; there are no barriers, and nobody to say this is mine. In Nepal now, they consider the coconut pudding as their creation. So, cuisine has boundaries now, and it must have been the same 500 years ago, too,"" opines Ajit Bangera, senior executive chef, ITC Grand Chola."

58f63de97be9e031f13b0fc6,The vegetarian path to golfing greatness (Comment: Special to IANS),http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//sports/more-sports/shooting/The-vegetarian-path-to-golfing-greatness-Comment-Special-to-IANS/articleshow/53473217.cms,2016-07-31,"I thought my son had played reasonably well in a Junior World Golf qualifier in Sacramento , shooting a 77 (+5) on a par-72 course. As I sauntered over to check out the scores, I saw that the winning score was a 64 (-8) by a kid whose parents I knew. ""What did you feed him today?"" I asked in congratulating them.Without skipping a beat, since that is what they were chowing down at that time, they said ""Cheeseburgers"". A food item my son has never experienced in his 13 years of existence.Can a vegetarian ever aspire to the top echelons of golf on a diet devoid of meat? And are we, as parents, failing in our duty by not cooking and plowing burgers and hot dogs into our son?Both my wife and I were brought up as vegetarians for religious reasons.We come from a family lineage in South India whose most cherished dish is 'thair-sadam' (curd and rice). I, however, did stray during my college years to experience being a meat-eater. Not satisfied with just having 'Intel Inside' my computers, I wanted to see what it felt like to have 'Meat Inside' my digestive tract.I still recall the sensation of my first bite into a Whopper and that oh-so-succulent taste of spicy tandoori chicken. Why could my son not feel the same sensations in his palate?When he was three, my wife carefully orchestrated a switcheroo -- replacing potato with chicken nuggets. He chomped at it for a few seconds, gave me a smile that I felt so excited by (I now realise it might have been gas) and then promptly vomited it to let me experience 'Meat Outside'. In all the years since, he has never once expressed a desire to eat anything that has meat in it. And he has a stubborn streak that does not relent easily.So why is this relevant to how he plays the game of golf at the age of 13? Because he is figuratively (and literally) dwarfed in size and strength compared to boys that he plays with of a similar age. It has no bearing on the short game around the greens. But what a difference it makes on those drives from the tee box.Contrast a booming drive of 280 yards on a long par-4 of say 400 yards to enable a short wedge to the green, to eking out 200 yards on the drive and needing an accurate 3-wood to just get close to the green. That shot disparity on one hole accumulates over the long par-4 and par-5 holes to a final differential of at least 7 strokes. Game over, finito, checkmate, acabado in Spanish -- or maybe avocado in my son's mind.Conventional wisdom stresses how essential meat is as a source of protein and bulk to world-class athletes. Can you imagine Usain Bolt Peyton Manning or even Jordan Spieth performing their best on a belly full of salad and lentils? In my quest to better understand the impact of meat on world-class athletes, I Googled vegetarian world-class athletes. And I was quite inspired reading about Carl Lewis Martina Navratilova , Murray Rose, Robert Parrish, Billie Jean King, Venus Williams Tony Gonzalez and a host of other athletes who have and continue to excel with a vegetarian/vegan diet.But the skeptical side of me asks if any of them started their first 13 years on this diet, or was it a lifestyle they adopted later in their success?It is said that vegetarian foods have less caloric density than their meaty alternatives and hence athletes need to be aware of their caloric intake and expenditure to accommodate this. My son sparingly bites into his peanut-butter sandwiches in the middle of his rounds and has absolutely no gauge of his caloric expenditure. Maybe similar bites into a tuna sandwich might give him more calories but I am reasonably sure that will not make any difference to his overall performance during his rounds.This is ultimately a lifestyle choice -- does he need to consume meat-based foods to give him the muscle, strength and endurance to elevate his game? What does he need to do to bring home the bacon (pun oh-so-intended)? Can a combination of a vegetarian diet with an emphasis on physical fitness -- something he is lax about -- give him an equal or potentially greater advantage?It is uneasy being the parent of a vegetarian child aspiring to golf greatness. As parents we want to give our children the best advantage in every aspect of their lives. Maybe we are being unnecessarily paranoid in our thinking. We wait with bated breath for that growth spurt to kick in since height is such a great advantage in golf. And hope he quickly understands the value of physical fitness.Imagine our joy down the road (or maybe that should be down the fairway) in seeing him out-drive his meat-eating competitors. But 'lettuce' see how all this plays out - we really do want to avoid a 'Vegexit' option for our son.(31.07.2016 - Sridhar Narayanan is an engineer and lives in Cupertino, California.

The purpose of the project is to protect indigenous art forms restricted to particular parts of India, and help in creating markets for these products.Weve identified 100 such items from all over the country and will file for the GI status on their behalf. The full process takes about two years, he said.He pointed out that the GI is different from other intellectual property rights since the tag calls for the use of local resources and looks at sustenance of people involved with the making of these items.Items on the listThe list also includes intricately woven kangri baskets from Kashmir, among others.Most food items, however, are from Bengal, including goyna bori from East Midnapore and moa from Joynagar in South 24 Parganas.While goyna bori is fritters made of ground lentils, which resembles womens jewellery (goyna), moa is a hand-rolled ball made up of puffed rice, emulsified milk and jaggery.Sarpuria from Krishnanagar along with sitabhog and mihidana from Burdwan are also on the list.While the Union government has plans to export sweets from Bengal, the GI tags for these delicacies would provide a major boost to the Centres initiative.The GI is the process of identifying an item as originating in a territory, region or locality where the quality and other characteristics are unique to the geographical area.Chakrabarti told reporters that once an item gets the GI tag, IIT-Kharagpur will fund custodians of these local art forms for the next five years to help revive these items.Brand priceThe GI products today generate a premium brand price internationally, Chakrabarti said.Elaborating, the the tech school director said, The GIs provide socio-economic value to the producers. GI rights are collective rights, which provide producers a distinct socio-economic advantage. Once they get a GI tag, it would contribute to local employment creation and sustenance of rural economy.DH News ServiceMost food items are from Bengal, including goyna bori from East Midnapore and moa from Joynagar in South 24 Parganas.

P. Chakrabarti said in the next three to five years, they will identify 100 such products all over the country and help the community get the GI tag.To begin with, the Intellectual Property Cell of the institute has recently taken up activities to facilitate the process of filing of GI for Goyna Bori, the fine art of using lentil paste mix to create exquisite designs, distinct in West Bengals Midnapore.With distinct historical basis dating back several centuries of the Rajbari and also referred by Rabindranath Tagore in his works, Goyna Bori is believed to have originated in Midnapore.Apart from being edible, Goyna Bori is actually more about unique pieces of fine art having great appeal to the eye.Besides sweets from the State, the IIT has also planned to file GI for Kangri, a basket that is traditionally used by the people of Kashmir to keep themselves warm by keeping burning charcoals in it.Patent officeWe have spoken to the patent office that as an institution we want to file GIs. The communities will get the rights. After that we will help them build an economy around it. The entire region will benefit out of this. In the past, India had to fight for intellectual property rights for turmeric. But once these communities get the GI tag they will only have the right to that brand, Dr Chakrabarti said.The IIT model will be a five-year project which will begin after the community gets the GI tag. For the first year, they will pay everything besides the labour cost and from the second year onwards the IIT will start taking back the money in a phased manner.These communities may not be prosperous as others are using the brand value of their product. We will ensure that they make good business out of it, he said, adding that for the project the IPR team will work closely with the local communities.Once the communities get the GI tag then others will not be able to sell the product by claiming it is from that particular region.The geographical indication (GI) tag identifies a product as originating from a particular location and conveys an assurance of quality and distinctiveness that is essentially attributable to the fact of its origin.Once granted, the GI tag prevents unauthorised use of the geographical indication and boosts exports by giving it a unique identity. Products like Dajeeling Tea and Mysore silk are examples of popular GI tags in India. - PTI"

At least two children have been washed away and all other villages like Hindu Basti or Betnir Char have disappeared, said Uzefa. Some foodgrains and lentils have been distributed by the government, while a sister organisation of the Jamaat-e-Islami-Hind (JIH) provided sugar, water and flattened rice, she said.Kashem Ali, a large farmer of the same village who used to have nearly 40 bighas (16 acres) of land about a decade ago, is now left with just eight bighas (3 acres). The river is changing course and devouring villages. Many villages have disappeared over the last few years, he said.Shams Ahamed, a teacher in Guwahati who visits the area often, said it is not only villages but entire subdivisions are disappearing into the river.The South Salmara subdivision [formerly with Dhubri district] is literally vanishing due to erosion. The river cuts into the land mass displacing hundreds of thousands, who are ending up as refugees, Mr. Ahmed said.He added that the Muslims among the displaced face an additional problem as they are asked if they are from Bangladesh when they seek to relocate. The flood refugees relocate to a new place, a new village perhaps in a relatives place. Once the flood water recedes, they find that their village has disappeared, Mr. Ahmed said and added that the problem is growing with each flood.The demand for a proper resettlement of these displaced persons is growing."

Experts said two straight droughts fanned last year's infestation.But the new seed is still a setback for Monsanto, which has also been hit by a roughly 10 percent decline in cotton acreage in India this year as farmers switch to crops like pulses and lentils in the aftermath of the whitefly blight.SEED SALES SLIDEMonsanto's Bt cotton sales in India have fallen 15 percent so far in 2016, said Kalyan Goswami, executive director of the National Seed Association of India.The firm, which last year sold some 41 million packets of Bt seeds in India, could stand to lose up to 5 billion rupees ($75 million) due to lower sales and the steep cut in royalties enforced by the government earlier in 2016, according to Reuters calculations. The company, which unsuccessfully challenged India's decision to slash royalties in the courts, declined to comment for this article.But in the wake of the whitefly infestation, Mahyco Monsanto Biotech (India) Pvt Ltd (MMB), a joint venture with India's Mahyco, said last year that Monsanto and its Indian licensees marketed their product as resistant to bollworms, not other pests.Some experts were optimistic the indigenous cotton seeds developed by the Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR), which comes under the farm ministry, would catch on over time.""Just wait for the crucial three to four years to see a complete, natural turnaround. By then most farmers will give up Bt cotton and go for the indigenous variety,"" said Keshav Raj Kranthi, head of CICR.Kranthi said planting a hectare with the Indian variety cost less than half the 80,000 rupees farmers paid to sow Bt cotton over the same area, and the crop yield was almost as high.Unlike GM seeds, farmers could also store and replant the local seeds the following year, he added.Some experts voiced caution over the new variety, however.""By all accounts, the indigenous cotton looks pretty promising, but it will be put to test this year,"" said Devinder Sharma, an independent food and trade policy analyst. ""It's a potential game changer, but it has to succeed first.""BOLLWORMS REAPPEARExperts began raising doubts last year about the resilience of Monsanto's lab-altered Bt seeds, which still account for more than 90 percent of the cotton seeds sold in India.Monsanto's Bollgard II technology, introduced in 2006, was slowly becoming vulnerable to bollworms, they said, as any technology has a limited shelf life.Kranthi cited the increase in insecticide consumption as a sign of rising pink bollworm infestation.In 2015 cotton farmers used an average 1.20 kg of insecticides per hectare, up from 0.5 in 2006, when Bt cotton seeds were at the pinnacle of their productivity.Between 2006 and 2015, fertiliser consumption for the cotton crop doubled to 270 kg per hectare, said Kranthi, indicating rising costs of cultivation and stagnating yields of Bt cotton.But the more pressing concern for many has been whitefly, with farmers like Mann answering the call from India's farm ministry and state agriculture universities to switch to local seeds to fight it.""The only other option we had this year was to plant the Bt cotton again or leave the land fallow. Both were fraught with economic risk, and to obviate that risk we decided to plant the desi (indigenous) variety,"" he said."

""Moog dal is priced at Rs 95 in the market. I just got it for Rs 69,"" he said.Singh is among the hundreds of customers who have readily taken to the initiative by the Agra Dal Mills Association (ADMA) and Agra administration to provide pulses at subsidized prices to the residents. The scheme hit the city on Monday and there hasn't been a dull day in these mills. The total sale of quintals till Wednesday has crossed 20 quintals with Wednesday contributing around 12 quintals of sale of pulses.Traders say that the numbers would only increase. The pulses which are sold at subsidized prices include chickpeas, urad, moong, masoor and arhar pulses.Arhar daal is being sold at Rs 118, matar daal at Rs 38, moong at Rs 69, moong chilka at Rs 60, urad dhova at Rs 118, etc. Speaking to TOI, Rahul, a trader, said, ""We have got good response and sales are increasing every day. On Tuesday, there was sale of around 4-5 quintals and on Wednesday it was around 8 quintal by 5 pm in the evening,"" he said.""The scheme is definitely in favour of the city, and it must not be stopped,"" he added. ""Even though the customers have to buy a minimum of two kilograms of pulses, that hasnt deterred the customers from purchasing. Clearly, the low prices of pulses have helped,"" said another trader, Ramakant. Dwarika Prasad Agrawal, general secretary of ADMA, added, ""The response has been good. People from neighbouring areas are also coming. We will continue the scheme till Rakshabandhan. Further course of action will be decided after that. Another buyer, Neelam Gupta, who bought close to eight kg of pulses, said that the scheme would help in curbing monopoly enjoyed by traders. ""The scheme should be continued by the association,"" she added."

Telegraph picture Jorhat, Aug. 4: A death went unlamented and a birth unheralded at Malowkhat, on the outskirts of Jorhat town, as the respective families struggled to survive after the swirling waters of the Bhogdoi wreaked havoc in the area. Though the events took place a few days apart at Jorhat Medical College and Hospital, they went unreported as the place was far from the scenes of high drama caused by the floods. Dul Dutta and Uma Sharma's families had taken refuge in relief camps after their houses were submerged. Dul said his mother Bhanu fainted as soon as she saw the waters of the Bhogdoi engulf the kitchen and the granary. ""Our house is very near the breach and we had to shift to a relative's pucca house on high ground. From there, she saw the kitchen and the granary submerge and fainted. With the help of other people, I carried her to the boat brought by the State Disaster Response Force and shifted her to JMCH. The shock had sent her into coma and she did not recover. After a week, she died,"" Dutta said. He said her body had to be taken directly to Rajakhat samsan (crematorium) as they could not bring her home because of the waist-deep floodwaters. ""I had to perform the shraddh ceremony on the road,"" he said. On July 20, Uma's wife Kobita Das Sharma gave birth to Chandni. She was rushed to JMCH by her family from Kaibarta Gaon in Malowkhat, which had been flooded by the Bhogdoi. A couple of days later, she was released from hospital and had to wade through knee-deep water to reach her brother-in-law's house, a pucca building built on higher ground. ""It was not possible to come back to the relief camp as my newborn could be exposed to disease and our house was still under water. Therefore, we brought her here,"" Uma, a daily wage labourer said. He had shifted from Nowboicha in Lakhimpur district about four years ago in search of work. Uma's mother-in-law Dhaneswari complained that they had not yet received a mosquito net to protect the baby. Dul said the administration provided enough rice and lentils but the NGOs who had brought relief materials usually distributed them to people living in makeshift shanties on the road and the people in interior villages were left out. He lamented that about 10 bighas of land on which he had sown paddy had been submerged and it would be difficult to feed his family, comprising his wife and three children. One of his daughters is married."

The farm thrives on natural manure from plants, especially a species called Gliricidia sepum (gobbrada gida).The group believes in not harming Mother Earth with chemical techniques, so widely in practice now.Nestling at the foothills of a picturesque range of hills in Malavalli taluk in Mandya district and surrounded by tranquil forests, the Bettada Budadha Thota (BBT) beckons with its sylvan and verdant surroundings.The farm is frequented by wild boars, peacocks and elephants, and is now popular with visitors from the city.About a dozen groups have visited the farm, while volunteers from India and abroad have participated in tree-planting and farming. Every year, 250 saplings were being planted, but in the last two weekends, volunteers have planted a record 1,400.Although the farm is not easily accessible  you have to take a kutcha of 4 km road  it is drawing city-dwellers who want to spend some time in the lap of nature. On August 10-11, 250 students are visiting the farm.Laxminarayan S, a member of BBT, says, People are so impressed they want to join our group. But we advise them to form their own groups and offer knowledge and help.For this community, the last three years have been enriching. They have learnt, hands-on, a lot about natural farming techniques. We plan our activities in such a way we work with the monsoons, sowing and harvesting, a he said.In 2012, the group bought 10 acres of dry land at Kempayyadoddi. With the exception of mulberry and sapota trees, nothing was growing on this land.The group first planted trees for the fence and bunds. Then came horticulture plants. Local crops like millets, green manure crops, sun hemp, pulses were planted later. After a year, the group started farming in 10 more acres.BBT uses what it calls the natural resource utilisation system of farming. Here manure, water and lighting are derived naturally, says Dr Rajendra Hegde, the agricultural expert in the group.We wanted to create a model for people to see and learn from. We were not interested in irrigated crops. In fact, we use drip irrigation and water-saving techniques, he told Express.Since this is a dry region with only 250 mm of annual rainfall, BBT has developed huge farm ponds of 5,000 square feet (set up in collaboration with the government, with 60 per cent funding).In an adjacent expanse owned by the government, BBT has installed open wells so that the water needs of grazing animals and wildlife can be sustained. The group has also installed solar lighting both for the farmhouse and the fields.Although farmers have stopped groundnut cropping, fearing raids by wild boars, we have planted groundnuts by installing solar lamps around to scare the animals, Hegde adds.The 11 members share everything they grow  ragi, lentils, groundnut, chillies. They spend `7.5 lakh on the farm annually, with a monthly investment of `5,000 each.The group hopes to help local farmers. We talk about community farming as nuclear families alone cant pull this off. Sharing our knowledge, we want to stop rural migration to cities. Only elders live in this village, as youngsters have gone away to the cities, Hegde says.The group believes it would have done its bit to address the agrarian crisis if it inspires some youths to stay back and take up community farming."

Aid agencies had warned of the risk of starvation for the remaining 300,000 residents, who have been surviving on mostly rice and lentils.Civilians still remained trapped on Sunday however, as the road, under regular attack, was not yet safe enough for them to use.""The Great Battle for Aleppo"", as the opposition has dubbed it, saw an unprecedented alliance of around 10,000 rebels, Islamists, and jihadists fighting regime troops for control of the city's southern suburbs.Much of the manpower came from Jabhat Fateh al-Sham (JFS) - until recently known as the Nusra Front and affiliated with al-Qaeda - which brought in reinforcements from its various strongholds across the country.Footage released by the group showed fighters from inside the city linking up with others on the outskirts after they managed to overrun the government's military complex in the Ramussa district, seizing huge caches of weapons.Mostafa Mahamed, a commander with JFS, tweeted news of the victory late on Saturday: ""When we unite, (President Bashar) Assad won't stand a chance.""Since the start of the offensive a week ago more than 700 fighters from both sides have been killed, according to the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor. Most have been suffered by the rebel side, which has been bombarded by Russian air strikes.The news of the liberation was met with euphoric scenes on the streets of eastern Aleppo. But celebrations were short-lived after regime warplanes began pounding the city in retaliation.Doctors at the Omar bin Abdulaziz hospital told The Daily Telegraph patients and staff took cover in the basement for most of night.""Everyone is staying in the safest room,"" said Dr Fatima AlMousalem, whose hospital has been targeted several times in recent weeks. ""We expected this bloody attack from the Assad regime. It happens every time they lose ground.""The defeat is a crushing one for Assad's government, which sees Aleppo as the prize in the civil war.Both sides have thrown everything they have at the battle for the city, as each believes its fate will decide the outcome of the conflict.But the beleaguered Syrian army has become increasingly reliant on air support from Russia, and on Afghan recruits and troops from the Lebanese Shia militia Hizbollah, on the ground.The rebel advance now endangers a major highway linking the government-controlled part of Aleppo to the outside world, leaving an estimated population of 1.2 million at risk of losing a supply line.Families in the western districts late on Saturday rushed to buy any food and drink left in preparation for shortages.Eastern Aleppo is mainly controlled by US-backed Free Syrian Army fighters. Some in the opposition camp were uneasy about Islamists taking the lead in the battle.""People love Nusra now they liberated the city, but they do not represent us,"" said activist Ahmad al-Abdullah, who was wary about the jihadists' intentions for Aleppo.But the president of the Syrian National Council, an umbrella opposition group, hinted at the need for further cooperation among the ""revolutionary forces"".Any such move would complicate matters for the US, which has been trying to reach a deal with Russia to jointly target jihadist forces while sparing non-jihadist groups.""This is the final blow to the initial US policy meant to support the moderate opposition in Syria,"" Michael Horowitz, analyst at the Levantine Group, told the Telegraph. ""Residents of Aleppo will, unfortunately, always remember that America did nothing to help, and that it is eventually the armed opposition that saved them."""

The findings of the research were shared with the media here on Friday.Small farmers in flood-prone areas were advised to use 'Swarna sub 1' paddy seeds, which can yield a good harvest despite being submerged in floodwaters for 14-17 days. Similarly, farmers in drought-hit areas were recommended 'Sahbhagi', 'Abhishek' and 'Shushk Samrat' variants of paddy seeds, which have the capacity to stand drought and produce good crop.The use of paddy seeds suggested under the IRRAS led to a 103% increase in productivity in flood-prone areas and 75% increase in productivity in drought-prone areas. Experts also recommended rain based Rabi crops such as HD-2967, HI-1563, K-9351 and K-9301 variants of wheat, HUL-57, PL-6, PL-8 and ARUN variants of 'masoor' and PG-186 and PUSA-256 varieties of 'chana'.The research was conducted in three phases  'on-station trial' conducted at ICAR-Patna, RAU-Pusa and BAU-Sabour, followed by farm trials at the Krishi Vigyan Kendras and finally in the actual fields.The researchers have also established that replacing traditional method of paddy transplantation with direct sowing reduces the cost of production by almost 50% and increases profit by over 20% whereas using certain weed controllers increases net profit by almost 50%. The districts where the research was conducted were West Champaran, Sitamarhi, Aurangabad and Gaya."

Each season they till their land in hope, watch the skies with trepidation and await the results of their toil with fingers crossed. The sons of earth gamble their everything each season, sometimes hitting the jackpot and sometimes nought. With the long-term Samba crop season looming close, the farmers in the Delta districts of the State are readying themselves for yet another round of gambling. However, even before the plough has sunk into the rice bowl, the farmers believe the odds are heavily stacked against them.After missing out on the money spinner Kuruvai cultivation, the farmers were relying on Cauvery water from Mettur for a bumper Samba harvest. However, the uncertainty over release of water this year has left them apprehensive about their future. Though the customary date of dam opening (June 12) is long past, what casts a shadow of gloom in the delta is low level of storage in the dam, which stood at 94.43 feet last year when the gates were opened on August 9, as against the present level of 62.38 feet as on Friday.Lack of official word on the release is only adding to the pressure, feel the farmers. P Sukumaran, a farmer from Tirupoonthurthi, says, The farmers are confused. The water was not released for Kuruvai crop and the government is silent about the preparations for the long-term Samba. This confusion has resulted in the dwindling of acreage this year. Last season, the Thanjavur farmers brought around 45,000 hectares under Kuruvai cultivation, this year the acreage was a paltry 35,000 hectares. The reason: non-availability of Cauvery water. This despite proactive steps by the administration to incentivise farmers using borewells.If the government announces a tentative date for the release, it will go a long way in soothing the frayed nerves, as the farmers could get some time to plan their move, says Sukumaran. If a date is given, farmers can raise saplings for long-duration CR1009 variety in nurseries using borewells. This would help them share the saplings with those dependent on river water, he adds.The government decision to make available black gram seeds at depots has sent the rumour mills into an overdrive in the delta, with a section in the area believing this to be a subtle way of pushing the farmers to skip Samba. Alternative crops like lentils cannot be cultivated in the Delta beyond June-July, as these crops cannot withstand even occasional heavy rains, points out Arupathy P Kalyanam, general secretary of the Federation of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Association. The way out lies in pressuring Karnataka to release Tamil Nadus due share, Kalyanam says.Water in the four Cauvery reservoirs in Karnataka is over 56 per cent of their storage capacity. In this scenario, the onus lies on the Union government to direct Karnataka to release water for Tamil Nadu, he adds.If farmers managed to salvage some pride by using borewells during the Kuruvai season, they cannot be expected to replicate their earlier exploits for the long-term crop, as Samba is completely dependent on Cauvery for survival. While Kuruvai is regarded as a money spinner, Samba is the staple for the delta farmers, as with increased acreage and prospective yield, the margin of profit is enough to wipe off big debts. But only if the Cauvery trickles down. On an average, 1.06 lakh hectares are brought under Samba crops, while the acreage stands at 27,000 hectares for Thaladi paddy (cultivated after harvest of Kuruvai) in Thanjavur district.Even if the water is released by August 15-20, the possibility of farmers managing to salvage Samba is very much alive, feels Kalyanam, as they could sow long-term varieties like CR1009. It generally takes 15 days for water from Mettur to reach the tail-end delta, as the channels and canals are heavy on silt due to officials neglect. There was a time when water would trickle down in seven days, he recalls. Pegging the annual loss of the farming community at `1,000 crore due to erratic release of water, Kalyanam said that if there was any further delay, the future looked bleak as the harvest season would coincide with the north-east monsoon.There are many permutations and combinations the farmers need to try before deciding on the crops. One factor that has much bearing on the prospects is the monsoon. With a weak south-west monsoon failing to quench the thirst of parched catchments in Karnataka and Wayanad, the farmers there are not cosily placed either, say agro-technologists.P Kalaivanan, president of Thanjavur unit of the Tamil Nadu senior Agro-technologists Forum, seconds Ranganathans surmise. He says the Meteorological Department had predicted 113 per cent above normal rainfall during June-July in the southern peninsula, while it was to be deficient in eastern India. However the reverse is happening now, he says, adding that things have come to such a pass this season that even if farmers resorted to direct sowing to save water.The long-term varieties should be planted by first week of September. In the case of short-term varieties, they ought to be transplanted before October 15, since the north-east monsoon starts by that time. To save the crop till the onset of north-east monsoon, we need at least 200 TMC and releasing water before that level is reached could prove to be detrimental, he points out."

Officials from state-run trading firm MMTC and cooperative major Nafed were also present.""The government has decided to import further 20,000 tonnes of chana and 80,000 tonnes of masoor to strengthen buffer stock,"" the Food Ministry said in a statement.The meeting also discussed about alternate mechanism for the release of pulses from the buffer stock at an appropriate time for effective market intervention if sufficient quantity is not lifted by the states, it said.It was observed in the meeting that pulses prices were showing a declining trend in recent weeks and rates are expected to fall further in view of good sowing of pulses.The Centre is importing pulses through MMTC, which has so far contracted about 86,000 tonnes of lentils for the buffer stock purpose. Pulses from the buffer stock are given to states for retail sale at a subsidised rate.So far, a buffer stock of 1.95 lakh tonnes of pulses has been created through purchase from domestic and global markets, while the target is 2 million tonnes.The state governments have been requested to expedite lifting of pulses of tur and urad from the buffer stock for distribution at a subsidised rate of not more than Rs 120/kg.The Centre is giving pulses from the buffer stock to states at lower rates. Tur is given at a rate of Rs 67/kg and urad at 82/kg.At present, pulses prices are retailing as high as Rs 185 per kg due to shortfall in domestic ouput following two consecutive years of drought.Pulses output is estimated to be lower at 17.06 million tonnes in 2015-16 crop year (July-June) as against the annual demand of 23.5 million tonnes. The gap is being met through imports."

Picture by Bhola Prasad It was a very special Navroz or New Year for Parsis settled in India on Wednesday. Though Parsis the world over observe Navroz on March 21 according to the Zoroastrian calendar, those in India celebrate another new year according to the Shenshai calendar they adapted after settling in Gujarat during the 8th or 10th centuries. But, the celebrations, including customs and rituals, are same in both, said young Parsi entrepreneur Varun Gazder in Jamshedpur. ""We celebrated Navroz with our family,"" Varun said. ""We go to the agiary (Parsi fire temple) in the morning for special prayers but some of our friends and family walk in anytime to seek blessings."" Like the Gazder family, the 180-odd Parsi community in Jamshedpur started the day by praying at the agiary or fire temple on Straight Mile Road, which was decked up for the occasion, then met up with friends and loved ones to wish each other Navroz Mubarak. Then came the feasting, one of the enduring passions of the community. Delicacies such as dhansak, sevaiyan and sooji ka halwa were must-haves on the festive platter. Spicy dhansak, a popular Parsi delicacy, is prepared by cooking mutton with a mixture of lentils and vegetables and is then served with caramelised brown rice. At the Parsi Hostel in Sakchi, meritorious students and achievers were also felicitated. A cultural programme was also organised where schsool students performed. Eminent Parsi educator Nargis Madon, the director of JH Tarapore School, explained the significance of this Navroz. ""When the community migrated to India, their first settlement was in Sanjan, Gujarat. The king of Sanjan, Jadav Rana (also known as Jadi Rana) showed the Parsis a bowl of milk symbolising that his kingdom was full. A Parsi priest asked for sugar and stirred it in the milk without spilling a drop So, Parsis, as you see, blended with the local people very peacefully and sweetly,"" Madon smiled."

The entity offering the lowest cost of intermediation and transportation will be allowed to take over the stock, although it is not clear how the government intends to ensure that the benefit of lower prices is passed on to consumers.While the modalities are being firmed up, sources said procurement will remain with government agencies and the new entity will be responsible for managing and marketing the stock of pulses. The government has approved creating buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes, which will be maintained through the year to check artificial price rise.Officials said since the selected organisation will get pulses from the buffer stock at a fixed price, they will have to quote the cost of maintenance of stock, and transportation. Sources said there will be enough checks and balances to ensure that the selected entities abide by the contract conditions. ""Since e-tail players have experience in managing warehouses and also making products available at doorsteps, they can also participate in the bidding when we invite expression of interest,"" said an official.So far, government agencies such as FCI and Nafed have procured 1.4 lakh tonnes of pulses from the domestic market and another 59,000 tonnes have been contracted for import. On Tuesday, the government decided to import another 1 lakh tonnes of arhar and masoor."

The health department suspects food poisoning and has shut down the hostel mess and cut-off potable water supply.""On Sunday night, 30 students were admitted to the hospital in two batches and another 26 were taken to the CMCH on Monday morning. By Monday afternoon, a total of 64 students were hospitalised,"" said Edwin Joe, dean at CMCH.""The students are in stable condition and responding to treatment. Had they been brought on Sunday afternoon when they began feeling sick, there was no need to hospitalise them,"" he added.Meanwhile, two ambulances were stationed at college hostel to shuttle students to the hospital in case of emergency. ""We have also deployed two doctors at the college hostel to take care of students. Around eight students have complained of abdomen pain and vomiting there,"" said the deputy director of public health and preventive medicine, S Somasundaram.The food safety department has collected samples of potable water supplied at the hostel and lentils cooked at the college mess. ""It is said that the lentils used to cook lunch on Sunday could have led to the problem. Food safety department has collected samples, and we can expect the reports in three to four days,"" Somasundaram said.The students, however, feel that the potable water supplied at the hostel was the source of infection. ""There are two water filters installed in the hostel. One of them was switched off on Sunday night after some of our friends were rushed to the hospital,"" said a student. The drinking water is supplied from overhead tanks, and when TOI asked when the overhead tanks were cleaned last, a teacher said it was done 10 days ago.Health officials said it would be difficult to ascertain if the students were suffering from food poisoning. ""We doubt the quality of lentils used for lunch on Sunday, but by the time we collected samples on Monday, there was no sample left. So, we had to collect raw samples. I'm not sure how much the test will help,"" Somasundaram said.The hostel seems to have a history of water contamination. A similar incident was reported in July 2014, when 24 students of the college were admitted to CMCH after they complained of vomiting and diarrhoea. In 2012, 46 students were taken to Sri Ramakrishna Hospital complaining of illness after drinking water supplied in the hostel. ""We have instructed the college to carry out regular cleaning of the water tanks and the mess kitchen,"" Somasundaram said."

The victim, identified by police as Pramod Kasana alias Balli, was last seen alive when he left his house in Rajpur within Loni police station limits at 7.30 pm on Monday.Pramod used to work as a part-time wedding photographer in Loni. His family members found his body in a lentil farm, barely half-a-kilometre away from their home, at 6 am on Tuesday.The body bore a gunshot wound as well as stab injuries. His younger brother, Lalit (21), a commerce graduate, told TOI that Pramod usually went out in the evening to meet friends and acquaintances.""On Monday evening, when he did not return home by 9.30 pm, we tried calling him on his mobile phone.

58f221b4a3d24b68099aa776,The race to light up the last village,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-race-to-light-up-the-last-village/article14592893.ece,2016-08-25,"Jalan Singh, 30, has not removed the cardboard carton that protects the sides of his new Godrej refrigerator. You cannot miss the striking red cooling machine in the room. Having spent Rs.12,000 on it, Singh is proud of his acquisition. Sixty-nine years is a short time in an independent countrys life but it has been a long time for power to reach Singhs village, Tanwarpura, an hours drive from Barmer city in Rajasthan. Power that arrived in the village two months ago, although erratic, nudged Singh to buy a refrigerator. He opens it to show it to us, but its empty. The rains may have tripped some lines, a government official offers an explanation. Rains did lash the village a few days ago. Having been consistent this year, they promise good harvest and some extra income. Singhs spirits are not dampened by the temporary absence of electricity; he reels off his wish list: a fan, a cooler, and an atta chakki (flour mill).Rukh Singh, his neighbour, has beaten him to procuring an atta chakki . The flour mill means two extra hours of sleep for his wife. In the early hours before dawn, Tanwarpura wakes up to the sounds of the chakki as women work it to pound flour. With the manual mill, it took my wife four hours to prepare the flour for our daily meals. The electric one takes an hour, Rukh Singh says. His wife smiles behind her veil, allowing Rukh Singh to speak on her behalf.The Singhs got an electricity connection under the Modi governments flagship scheme of rural electrification launched in July 2015, the Deendayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana (DDUGJY). The governments goal is 100 per cent electrification by 2019. Official estimates peg the number of un-electrified villages in India at 18,452. Of this, the government claims to have electrified 10,097 villages till date, a figure that doesnt go uncontested.The lifelines of a villageAt least there is light, says 34-year-old Chagan Kanwar, a mother of two. Two weeks ago, for the first time, solar energy lit up houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti in Barmer district where she lives. Designated as a Desert National Park area and situated almost at the farthest edge of the State, a few kilometres before the border with Pakistan, the village has around a hundred households. Power for Kanwar means less pollution. The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining, she says. The inhabitants of this basti were accustomed to travelling 25 km to Gadra village to charge their mobile phones. A shopkeeper there would ask for Rs.10 to charge each phone. We used to take 10 phones once a week to get them charged, says Pan Singh. Mobile phones, lifelines for the villagers and the only connection to the outside world, when powered ran for a week.Their main lifeline, however, is the sun. Under the off-grid scheme of DDUGJY, houses in Salam Singh Ki Basti have been provided with a 100W solar panel which can light five LED bulbs, one standing 12W fan, and a socket to charge a mobile phone. These three utilities come as part of the solar kit, a one-time investment of Rs.1,029 which works out to 5 per cent of the total cost incurred to install the kit in every home. There is no burden of electricity bills.The villagers have become so accustomed to the absence of power that even its presence does not prompt them to switch on the fan. The two villages, Tanwarpura and Salam Singh Ki Basti, are examples of the grid and off-grid programmes of the Centre, which are committed to providing electricity in every village. Explaining the decision for this, the Executive Director of Rural Electrification Corporation, Dinesh Arora, says: States have generally preferred and adopted grid connectivity for most of the villages except in areas where connectivity is either not feasible or cost-effective.In Rajasthan, as at the Centre, a Bharatiya Janata Party government is at the helm. Both Central and State officials are racing to power villages, but they are also wary as the media has turned its gaze to the claims made by the government in rural electrification. Officials everywhere are now tutoring villagers on the art of communicating with the media. With a spate of critical reports on the app-based claims of electrification on GARV making the government more watchful, even the hint of a journalist in the remotest of villages sends officials into a tizzy.Promise of powerMeanwhile, in distant Uttar Pradesh, power is a touchy issue, especially as elections are set to take place next year. When the Centre claims credit for any development, the State is quick to point out loopholes.In Anandpur, a village at the edge of Hathras district which is famed for asafoetida, a dried latex that is indispensable to curries and dals (lentil), power comes and goes. A gift from Delhi, an LED bulb, has brought light into the lives of 70-year-old Ram Prasad and 17-year-old Rahul. The electricity meter, wrapped in plastic, is a prized possession and is precariously mounted on the mud wall of the house that has a small porch, a room, and a tube well in the courtyard. There is a toilet too, Prasad points out, seemingly well-versed in the drill of showing to outsiders the trappings of modernity that have crept into the village. The toilet is pitch dark; light hasnt travelled there yet.For rural India, the DDUGJY brings not only the promise of power to every village, but its attendant trappings too. Our ancestors will be happy. They never saw light, says Savitri, a resident, as she begins cooking potatoes and chapattis under the light of a solitary bulb. The bulb has freed her from having to swat insects that she would have otherwise battled with under the light of a kerosene lamp or candle.Glimpses of a fractious relationshipAnandpur is an odd mix of upper castes (mostly Thakurs) and backward castes. Adversity and deprivation is the glue that holds these communities together. Most of the villagers wear a bemused look as officials from the electricity department come inquiring about the availability of power here. Mukesh Kumar from the State Electricity Board examines 18 meters installed in Anandpur and requests people to show their papers. He looks agitated. We were not informed about the installation. What if the villagers refuse to pay for the power or their homes collapse in the rains? he asks. The question hangs in the air, offering a glimpse of the fractious relationship between the Centre and State.The Prime Minister claimed in his Independence Day address that Nagla Fatela, a village in Hathras, was electrified but the media found surprised villagers and a dark village when it reached there. The embarrassment caused by this episode has left everyone on edge here and the U.P. government is determined to keep a check on every connection by sending its officers to the field. Kumar is one of them. Other senior officials have been dispatched from Lucknow. Says Rakesh Verma wryly: Ideally, the village should be getting 14 hours of power but that seldom happens. Lets see what happens after the elections. The officials wait patiently for Anandpurs residents to show their cards. Others who also wait are the men who installed the meters, the Centres officials.The scheme is premised on the Centre and the State working in tandem. The Centre provides the infrastructure; the State provides the power after working out its availability  12-14 hours a day is what has been calculated. The reality plays out differently as power keeps tripping. Young Anshu whispers that she saw a snake first when the light came on some time at night in her thatched hut just two days ago. Snakes are common in the tiny village of Anandpur, which is ringed by paddy fields. The villagers could not steal power like other villages nearby  katiya , or the illegal tapping of power, is rampant there  as high tension wires made that impossible.The power is erratic and the wait long and uncertain. We wait and watch; so do Savitri and Rahul. Everyone looks at the cooler fan installed upside down, a common jugaad in these parts, which works when the electricity comes. This is a welcome addition to their huts as it helps make the nights less muggy.In Anandpur, the monthly income of a family of five rarely exceeds Rs.2,000. Electricity is a luxury. Agricultural holdings are small, and income is supplemented by selling milk. The villagers are worried; they ask as they wait for the power to come, Do we have to pay the bill? As per the plan, the village will get power from 12 p.m. to 6 a.m. Pointing out the absurdity of the schedule, an official on a visit to the village says, We dont draw the plan. We follow instructions from Delhi. Contesting this, Mr. Arora says, The responsibility of releasing electricity connections to individual households lies with the discoms chosen by the State.These villagers are the Antyodaya card holders. In other words, they are the poorest of the poor whose entitlements are a few kilograms of rice and two litres of kerosene a month. The supplies get exhausted quickly and they are forced to purchase these goods from the open market. The nearest school is 2 km away and the villagers are wary of sending their girls to school. Rahul is studying for an examination and he finds the light a godsend. I can study now when the light comes; I dont have to study under the lamp, he says, wistful though for a regular supply.The State government is working out a way to regulate the tariff so that people pay for the power they consume. From the headquarters in Lucknow, the chairperson of the State Electricity Regulatory Commission, Desh Deepak Verma, has been keeping a watch ever since false claims were made about electrification, by dispatching officials to the ground. He says the problem is with the definition of an electrified village. One in 10 homes is all that a series of schemes have focussed on. What about the 9 others? And within the 10 per cent, only poles have reached some villages; last mile connectivity is still distant.Its 6.30 p.m. when dusk falls to herald the night. Thirty hours have passed, but Tanwarpura has no power. Is it because of the rains? Electricity is transformative, but only when it is available, Rukh Singh says. We get it for about two hours a day. A tiny bulb dispels darkness in Jethmal Singhs house. I got my connection under the UPA (United Progressive Alliance) governments Rajiv Gandhi Grameen Vidyutikaran Yojana (RGGVY) before it was re-christened by the BJP government as DDUGJY. Only five connections have come in the last six months under the DDUGJY, he says. Thirty of the 35 households which have electricity in this village were electrified under the RGGVY. A Tata Sky dish hangs at the back of Jethmals house. The TV, however, is missing.On August 12, the governments field engineer encouraged us to purchase a television so that we could tune in to Prime Minister Narendra Modis Independence Day address. We bought the set on the 13th, he says. People gathered in Jethmal Singhs house on August 15. But the TV conked off after the Prime Ministers speech and has been sent for repair.Bhiram, who lives ten minutes away from Jethmals house in the nearby village of Tirsingra, also listened to the Prime Minister speaking from the ramparts of the Red Fort. The field engineer told me that light would reach my village too, he says. But there was a problem. In April 2015, the government identified 34 un-electrified villages in Barmer. Tirsingra was not one of them.Un-electrified and not on the listA hundred kilometres away from Tirsingra, Mahadev Nagar has a similar story. There is no power in the village and it is not on the governments radar. Surta Ram, 40, calls fellow villagers to gather on the lawns of the primary school to discuss the problems related to lack of power. Photographs of Indira Gandhi and B.R. Ambedkar hang prominently in his house. He calls himself a samaaj sevi (social worker). For the last five years, we have been contacting government officials at all levels: the Collector, the MLA, and others. Now they tell us that our name is not in the government survey, he says. Ten days ago, the MLA said that our village will see light this Diwali. Lets see.Mahadev Nagar has a primary health centre, a facility that other villages mentioned as lacking here. But it is just a building. There is no doctor here. No one wants to come here because there is no electricity, Surta Ram says.Adds 39-year-old Puga Ram: Yesterday, three malaria patients had to travel for 5-10 km for injections. The ambulance also doesnt come inside our village. Puga Ram teaches in the village school and is concerned about the childrens education. This is the age of computers. How will these kids get digital literacy if there is no electricity, he asks, distressed. There are five classrooms in the school; one is under construction. The heat inside the room compels the teacher to take his classes on the sands outside under the trees. Misra Ram shows a receipt of Rs.200 dated November 2015. For electricity connections, we had to apply in groups of five. A hundred such forms have been sent from our village. I have applied thrice. But there is no progress, he says.All conversations with the villagers start and end with electricity. Its announcement and presence have fuelled aspirations long bottled up.Back in Salam Singh Ki Basti, Abdul Khan shakes his head, disgruntled with the governments solar-powered electricity scheme that is oddly restrictive as well as liberating. We wanted electricity powered by the grid. The current set-up limits us to a few predefined utilities. There is nothing more that we can do with this, he says. The power limitation of the solar kit doesnt allow them to use other appliances. Unlike in Tanwarpura, electricity in this village doesnt match aspirations. Also, the government is advocating for one kit that fits all. This means that the village school in Salam Singh Ki Basti gets the same set kit as the houses. There are multiple classrooms, but only one fan.In the summer heat in Anandpur, 70-year-old Prasad dreams. Now that we have seen light, we have become a little greedy. Dil aur chahta hai (the heart desires more), he says. That means a few hours more hours of light. And a fan that will make the summer more bearable.The kerosene lamp affected my childrens health as they studied under its light. Now I dont have to worry as the lights dont go off when it is windy or when its raining.

The sun has still not set in this part of the hemisphere and as we go in, I glance back at the orange and pink horizon, marvelling at how much light there is despite the lateness of the hour.Like the famous Bohri Thaals back home, Ethiopian food is best known for its concept of communal eating. In Ethiopia, eating food from a large pooled platter is traditional and shows camaraderie among your dining companions  not only because everyone usually eats from the same plate, but most Ethiopians feed each other as they dine, to express solidarity and friendship.The food is served on a platter known as a gebeta, a large circular, usually metal platter. The most popular ingredient on the platter is the spongy sourdough flatbread called injera, which serves as the spoon and very often the plate itself for the lentils, meat, and vegetable sauces piled on top. Our beautiful young hostess, Adina, informs us that injera is made from teff, an iron rich cereal grain thats fermented with water for several days before being baked into large, floppy pancakes that have the texture of crepes and the taste of sourdough bread. For those familiar with Indian breads, think a cross between appams from South India and chillas from the North.A typical Ethiopian meal consists of the platter where a circle of injera is placed on the gebeta, then the different stews, curries, or vegetables that youve ordered are placed on top of the injera. From a single dish to a mix of different dishes, everything is piled onto the plate of injera. No utensils are provided, you eat with your hands , while sharing a single platter of food with everyone around your table.More than the food, it is this style of eating which forms the crux of an Ethiopian cultural experience. Apart from the sensuous connection with food, eating with your fingers is also practical in that its easier to pluck that last bit of meat off the bones thereby avoiding waste, and leaving a lingering aroma on the fingers to sustain the memory of a marvellous meal.As I mull over this little nugget, I realize that Ethiopian food is not for the gastronomically squeamish or those who dont like to finger their food! It involves a lot of touchy-feely, communal give-and-take. You need to mark your little territory on the platter as it can get messy (think touching someones jhoota fingers while reaching out for that chunk of food). Or as my prudish college friend used to indignantly exclaim when we would want to share one Softy ice-cream, Mainu hora nu chuhia joothan nahin khana hain! (rough translation: I dont want to eat food touched by someone elses fingers and mouth!). For her and those like my older son, a fastidious and adept flatware user, the thought of using fingers  and sharing a common platter to eat  would seem blasphemous. But for those of us who grew up around Bohri thaal meals and South Indian friends, it is no big deal. Growing up, I was fascinated by how my South Indian friends would effortlessly roll little balls of rice and curd in their palms and toss them efficiently into their mouths without any projectile hurling from between their fingers. (But that, my dear friends, is a blog for another day!)Since my sister and brother-in-law have been here before, I leave it to them to order the dishes. And what a fabulous repast we have in front of us when the big steel platter groaning with food is placed in front of us. On top of the injera is piled a concoction of various foods starting with Azifa, a salad of collard greens seasoned with black cumin. Next to it is Foule, which is cooked fava beans mixed with fresh tomato, green pepper, spice and cheese and tossed with butter. For the veggies among us, the plate du jour is Atakilt Wot, a delicious potpourri of chopped cabbage, sliced carrots and chunky potatoes cooked and simmered with onions, garlic, ginger and vegetable oil. And for the meat lovers, the enticing aroma on the plate comes from Ye Doro Wot, which is chicken cooked to tenderness in a hot and thick red pepper sauce called berbere and seasoned with onion, garlic, ginger and a butter sauce.As I eat and savour the food, I quiz the hostess about our meal. She informs us that most of the food revolves around wot or a stew which is prepared with a spice called berbere. This spice, which is the chief ingredient in Ethiopian cooking, is a fragrant blend between the Indian garam masala and Mexican chili powder. It consists of among other things, sun-dried chilies, ginger, garlic, cardamom, nutmeg, cloves, cumin, and coriander.Before we know it, we have chomped our way through a mountain of injera. The foodie has dived headlong into the meal as soon as it was placed in front of us and only occasionally surfaces to take a deep breath  and another injera. As I polish off my side of the plate with the last piece of injera, my fingers dart to the other side of the platter where there are still some juicy bits of chicken left. The Foodie notices the movement and with a grin, nudges my fingers out of the way to seize that last morsel and pop it in his mouth. We both laugh at this greedy finger-jousting and head out into the night with the aroma of the meal still lingering on our fingers."

Pictures by Ranjeet Kumar Dey and Dilip Kumar Patna, Aug. 27: ""Let me check the quality of dal (lentils) first. Is it thick or not? Just show me."" The first words of district magistrate (DM) Sanjay Kumar Agarwal on his arrival at the Patna Law College relief camp left little to imagination. The Telegraph, in its edition dated August 26, had reported about watery dal and vegetable curry being served to flood victims at BN Collegiate School relief camp. The DM is scheduled to visit BN Collegiate School camp on Sunday The people had just started eating their lunch when Agarwal had reached in the camp during the inspection to check the quality of food being served to flood victims. Though it was not the same relief camp, the mission was to check the quality of food. Agarwal also tasted it in front of the flood-hit people. Agarwal asked the volunteers serving the food to bring what the flood victims were served -rice, dal and mixed vegetable curry (potato and brinjal). ""Show me the dal bucket. Yes, this is thick,"" exclaimed Agarwal, before lunch was served to him on a steel plate. While eating the meal, he asked a child standing in front of him whether he had food or not. The child replied in the affirmative. After eating the meal, Agarwal said: ""I tasted the food to check its quality and also to boost the morale of the flood-hit people. I also want to say that the food served in the relief camp is not inferior in quality. It is food for common man and it tastes like home-made food."" Even the flood-affected people praised the quality of food served to them. They are served meals twice a day apart from chuda (beaten rice) and jaggery for breakfast. ""Food is good in this camp, we are here for almost 10 days. Sometimes it is just okay but mostly, the quality is proper. We have heard that even boiled egg is served.

He even took potshots at Pakistan. And all through the discourse that lasted 40 minutes, Jain religious leader Tarun Sagar had MLAs cutting across party lines at the Haryana Assembly listening in rapt attention.Delivering his Kadve Vachan to mark the start of the monsoon session, the first such event organised at the Vidhan Sabha, the monk, who appeared in the nude, was seated on a dais, above the seats of the Governor, Chief Minister and MLAs.Invited to speak by Education Minister Ram Bilas Sharma, Sagar said, Rajniti par dharam ka ankush zaroori hai. Dharam pati hai, rajneeti patni. Har pati ki yeh duty hoti hai apni patni ko samrakshan de. Har patni ka dharam hota hai ki woh pati ke anushasan ko sweekar kare.Agar rajneeti par dharam ka ankush na ho toh woh magan-mast haathi ki tarah ho jaati hai (The control of dharma over politics is essential. Dharma is the husband, politics is the wife. It is the duty of every husband to protect his wife. It is the duty of every wife to accept the discipline of her husband. If there is no control of dharma over politics, it will be like an elephant out of control).Sagar identified female foeticide as a big problem that was disturbing the balance of society, leading to more crimes and rapes, and said that he had come up with a formula to tackle it at three levels  political, social and religious.At the political level, the government should decide that those who do not have daughters should not have the right to contest Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha elections. At the level of society, people should not marry their daughters into families that do not have daughters. At the religious level, saints should decide that they will not accept alms from houses where there are no daughters. The result will exceed expectations if this formula is followed. We are living in the 21st century. Even today, when boys and girls are differentiated, I feel we are living in the 14th century, he said.At this juncture, Sagar took a dig at Haryana Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who is a bachelor, saying, Khattar sahib ko ismense bahar kar do (Khattar should be kept out of this).Taking on politicians, Sagar said that the Parliament, which was set up to solve the countrys problems, has become the biggest problem. He claimed that according to a survey, 160 MPs have criminal cases registered against them and said that efforts should be made to ensure that criminal elements are not able to climb the stairs of Lok Sabha and Vidhan Sabha.Terming terrorism as a major issue, Sagar said that no religion promotes terror. If the amount of government money that is spent on weapons is used for education, employment and healthcare, there would be a transformation, he said.Taking potshots at Pakistan he said, Humara padosi desh, sab ko maloom hai, atankvaad ko aasan de raha hai.bhasmasur paida kar raha hai Bharat ko pareshan karne ke liye. Mujhe lagta hai aaj nahi toh kal bhasmasur tayyar kar raha hai apne liye. Ek baar galti kare woh agyan hai, do baar galti kare woh nadaan hai, teen baar galti kare woh shaitan hai aur jo baar baar galti kare woh Pakistan hai. Jo har baar shama kar de, woh Hindustan hai (Everyone knows that the neighbouring country is harbouring terrorism creating Bhasmasurs to trouble India. If someone makes a mistake once he is ignorant, if someone makes a mistake twice he is innocent, if someone makes a mistake thrice he is the devil, and if someone makes a mistake repeatedly, that is Pakistan. And the one who forgives repeatedly is India).Sagar also praised the Narendra Modi government for prescribing a retirement age for active politicians, and had a word of advice for the Khattar government.Agar humne Rishikesh mein Ganga ka shuddhikaran kar liya, toh Haridwar aur uske neeche ke tamaam ghat apne aap shudh hote chale jayenge. Agar satra ke pehle hi din aapne dharam ko apne yahan pe baitha liya, rajneeti ke tamaam ghaat apne aap shudh hote chale jayenge. Khattar sarkar par yeh aarop lag sakta hai ke ihno ne rajneeti ka bhagwakaran kar diya, par main aap se nivedan karna chahunga, yeh rajneeti ka bhagwakaran nahi hai balki rajneeti ka shudhikaran hai (If we manage to purify Ganges in Rishikesh, then Haridwar and all its ghats will automatically keep getting purified. If on first day of this session you place Dharma in the assembly, all the ghats of politics will automatically keep getting purified on their own. There may be allegations against the Khattar government that they have saffronised politics, but I would request you that it is not saffronisation of politics, rather it is the cleansing of politics), he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b2e286a9855b7245313ee4e,Just Beef Won't Make You Run like Bolt; Diet Is Only Part of a Greater Process,https://www.hindustantimes.com/other-sports/just-beef-won-t-make-you-run-like-bolt-diet-is-only-part-of-a-greater-process/story-SBSHGIFBL1WYSpgTrHI7gK.html,2016-08-29,"Bharatiya Janata Party parliamentarian Udit Raj has triggered an intriguing debate, whether beef, or lack of it, in the diet of the Indian athletes, is to be blamed for the poor showing at the Rio Olympics.Raj tweeted on Monday: (sic) usain bolt of jamaica was poor and trainer advised him to eat beef both the times and he scored 9 gold medals in Olympic. He later clarified that his comment was not an endorsement for beef eating. Its 200% wrong to interpret my comment as an endorsement of beef eating, he told HT.However, the Twitter statement triggered a troll outburst on social media. Diet is an important part of an athletes training. But not all Indian athletes are non-vegetarian so the question HT asked experts was whether a vegetarian diet put our athlete at a disadvantage.Bolt ScienceI dont want to get into the controversy of beef due to cultural and religious issues, says sports medicine specialist, Dr. Ashok Ahuja, former head of the department of medicine at Sports Authority of India centre in Patiala. Red meat alone cant make every sprinter run like Bolt. By the way, red meat also means lamb, horse and even camel meat, not just beef.Ultimately its the training that proves the difference. And looking at Bolt, you can fathom his kinetic advantage in terms of height-weight ratio (Bolt is 1.95 meters tall and weighs 94kg ). His stride length is 2.44 metres and completes the 100m with 41-42 strides.When we compare that to the top Indian sprinters, the disadvantage is glaring. Besides, Bolt also has a genetic advantage too.Scientists have looked into the genetics of Jamaican sprinters trying to understand their dominance, adds Ahuja. The first gene associated with powerful sprinting is the angiotensin-converting enzyme, or ACE, gene. If you have a particular variant of this gene (known as the D allele) you are likely to have a larger than average heart capable of pumping highly oxygenated blood to muscles quicker than the average human.That also gives your body a better response to training. In people of West African origin, the frequency of the variant is slightly higher than in those of European and Japanese origin. In Jamaica, its a little higher than in West Africa, explains Ahuja. This small effect may be amplified by the ACTN3 gene.This encodes instructions to create a protein called alpha-actinin-3, which helps muscles generate strong, repetitive contractions. Like the ACE gene, it comes in different types. The desirable variant for a sprinter is known as 577RR. While only 70% of US international-standard athletes have the desirable variant, 75% of Jamaicans have it whether they are athletes or not. That gives Jamaica another edge.The Indian dietTop Indian athletes and coaches believe healthy diet is must for recovery, and is one of the components of good system for development.Dietary habits have a deep association with the cultural and societal norms prevalent in a country, but individual preference matters most.No doubt red meat has high protein and iron content, but there are other sources of protein and iron to supplement the diet. It all depends on the individual, says Ahuja, adding these days the market is flooded with food supplements. So there is always option of having essential nutrients through supplements in case natural food doesnt provide.Indian wrestlers are mostly vegetarian and used to vouch by a diet comprising mostly of dairy products and sources of proteins such as lentils and pulses. But of late, things have changed though our champion wrestlers such as double Olympic medalist, Sushil Kumar, still prefers a vegetarian diet.International grappler Amit Dhankar has made some changes in his eating habits, following his trips abroad. Generally when we travel for competitions it becomes a challenging task to stick to Indian food, says Dhankar. So, I have made some changes in my diet and have included fish and chicken which is easily available within India as well other places where we travel for competition.While former International judo player and coach, Yashpal Solanki, says he too had to change his eating habits during his competitive days.Solanki, who was finished fourth in the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games, said he included chicken in his diet, a rich source of lean protein. I have changed to vegetarian again as I am into coaching now and dont need high level of protein, he adds.Satyapal Singh, a Dronacharya Award winner for coaching para-athletes, said he doesnt prescribe any particular diet, but advices his athletes to follow good habits. Basically the food should be of good quality. The athletes shouldnt be forced to eat something which they dont like, he says."

Now, the government has embarked on a mission to take the indigenous art to greater heights by seeking global recognition for it. For the first time, the district administration, tourism department and M L Verma Tribal Research and Training Institute are jointly organizing a series of Gavri shows at various tourists spots and public places across the city to enlighten the audience, specially foreign tourists.Tribal artists will perform the dance drama till September 18, enacting tales from mythology and social episodes inculcating lessons on environment protection, human values, respect for women. "" Gavri is played so beautifully that the audience have an out-of-the-world experience. The magical effect of the folk music and dance force the viewers to stay put and watch the entire act until the episode reaches its end. We are sure it will captivate the hearts of the tourists who will be amazed to see the tribal foll's talent,"" said Udaipur collector Rohit Gupta. Photography and videography competitions are being held for audiences who can participate by uploading pictures and video clips on social media. The purpose is to give maximum publicity to the waning art and the artists who hail from the marginalized sections of the society.Concern for womenGavri, is a 40-day festival of dance-drama which is performed by the Bhil community after monsoon, in the month of September-October. It is celebrated by the tribes in Udaipur, Rajsamand and Chittorgarh districts. Women do not take part in Gavri and all the female roles are played by men.The artists perform plays in those villages where their married sisters and daughters reside. The purpose behind this custom is to ensure the wellness of their loved ones after marriage and instil in them a sense of pride and security.A team of 40-100 persons form the Gavri 'mandli' which moves from one place to other enacting some 40 tales named as 'Badshah ki Fauj', ' Bhanvare ka Khel', 'Sur ka Khel', 'Dhani Banjara', 'Sehi ka Khel' etc. It continues for more than a month entertaining and educating the masses about social and environmental issues. The food and other expenses are borne by the residents of the hosting village."" Gavri has been known to be in existence since the 3rd or 4th century, it was prevalent in the times of SiddhRaj Jai Singh, a ruler in Gujarat, who is believed to have shared a good bonding with the Bhils,"" said Shri Krishna Jugnu, a writer and historian. For Bhils, Gavri is not just entertainment but it also has strong religious purpose - they express their devotion to lord Shiva, thank gods for good rains and hope of having a prosperous year.Gavri's OriginThe Gavri dance-drama of Bhils has its origin in the mythological tale of Shiva and Bhasmasur. Bhairavnath is the form of Shiva and devi Amba symbolises Gauri. There are four kinds of characters - Dev, humans, demons and animals. The 'dev' characters are completely free from vices, eternal and symbols of ideals. They can move in all the three lokas.It symbolizes strength of characterLife for the Gavri performers is not easy. For 30 days, the participants spend their life in austerity, following strict rules. They follow celibacy, do not wear shoes, abstain from alcohol and meat, skip dinners, sleep on the floor and do not bathe during this period.The Bhil community is engaged in this dance-drama throughout the day for a month, leaving aside their farming work. Once the festival is over, only then does the community start using the new crop.The dance drama is performed in a circle in the centre of which a trishul (trident) is planted, the singers stand near the trident and dance. Any open platform of the village becomes the stage. The five main characters are Raiee Budia (representing Shiva and Bhasmasur), the raiees representing, Mohini and Parvati, Kutkadia and Pat Bhopa, all other players are called Khelye. Kutkadia is the 'sutradhar' (narrator) of this play and he relates briefly the story of each play before it begins, thus the audience knows in advance. Trident, dhol, thali and mandal are used for music and the artistically prepared costumes and settings of the actors add to the effect of the play. These costumes are decorated with religious and auspicious mandras like sun, moon, stars, peacock, 'papiha' etc. Faces of human actors are painted with bright colours or masks are used. Black, yellow and red are mainly used. Dark blue colour is used for demons, black for thieves, red for goddesses and yellow for 'jogi sadhus'."

No wonder, when diplomats from Kenya and Zambia came visiting last month, they were keen on meeting senior officials from the Department of Consumer Affairs to explore opportunities for trade in pulses.Government sources said Australia and Canada have already increased the area sown to pulses by 30% and 40%, respectively, in anticipation of demand from India.Indias pulses imports rose by 50% in value terms to Rs 25,691 crore in 2015-16, with in-bound shipments totalling 5.8 million tonnes, the government informed the Parliament in August."

The government has not yet issued an official forecast.""Last year, higher pulses prices were hitting consumers. Now farmers could suffer due to steep fall in prices,"" Dongre said.The price of pulses - such as green, black and red gram - hit record highs earlier this year after back-to-back droughts curbed output in 2015. But in the past few weeks, prices have softened with ample rains prompting farmers to cultivate more.""I have reduced area under cotton to cultivate pulses on more area,"" said Sukhdev Nathu Mali, a farmer from Jalgaon district of western state of Maharashtra.PRICES TO REFLECT NEW SUPPLIES, IMPORTSAs of Sept. 2, India's area under summer-sown pulses reached a record 14.2 million hectares, up 33 percent from a year ago, with the market already reflecting the expected bumper supplies.""New season supplies of moong (green gram) have started and prices have fallen below the minimum support price (MSP),"" said Nitin Kalantri, a miller in the western state of Maharashtra.Prices of other pulses could fall below the MSP once supplies roll in from the new season crop, he said.India fixes the MSP based on production cost and makes purchases if prices drop below the government-fixed rate.Rising imports are also expected to drag on prices.""Canada and Australia are set to harvest record crops.

Otherwise next year they will shift to other crops and again prices will rally,"" Kalantri said."

Noted agriculture scientist US Gautam was the chief guest on the occasion.Gautam in his address expressed concern over fluctuating production of pulses in the country. He said that as pulses are grown largely in the rain-fed areas, they suffer a lot due to both high and low rainfall. Changing climatic conditions and rising pollution level are also responsible for low yield of pulses, he informed.""If improved quality of seeds and production techniques are made available to the farmers, the production of pulses is likely to go up by 30%"", he said.He has urged the scientists to include farmers in various research based programmes, and apply the same research in their fields which would give better results. IIPR Director, NP Singh in his address highlighted the achievements of the institute in conducting researches on variety of pulses.He said that in the international year of pulses, three high yielding varieties of pulses including IPC 2006-77 in chickpea, IPM 410-3 (shikha) in mungbean and IPFD 12-2 in field pea were identified for different zones. Lentil biofortified variety IPL 220 with high iron and zinc has been recommended for identification, he informed.He said that scientists of the Institute have identified heat tolerant varieties of chickpea and lentil, and large seeded lentil would soon be available for cultivation.On this occasion, Jitendra Kumar was awarded the best scientist award 2016, SPS Chauhan was given the best worker award in technical category, Kirti Tripathi was given the best worker award in administrative category and Mohd Shabbir was awarded as the best worker in the skilled supporing staff category."

We have agreed on the zones in which these strikes will be carried out,"" said Lavrov.The much anticipated -- if tentative -- breakthrough came at the end of marathon talks between Lavrov and Kerry in Geneva, as the pair push for an end of the five-year civil war that has killed 290,000 and displaced half the country's population.""Today, the United States and Russia are announcing a plan which we hope will reduce violence, ease suffering and resume movement towards a negotiated peace and a political transition in Syria,"" Kerry said.The vexed question of Assad's fate remains, with Western powers calling for his removal and Russia backing him.But both Kerry and Lavrov said the complex plan represents the best available chance to end the fighting between the regime and the mainstream opposition rebels, while still targeting Al Nusra jihadist rebels and Islamic State extremists.'Window of opportunity'Key to the deal is the withdrawal of Syrian regime forces around rebel-held Aleppo, allowing desperately needed humanitarian access to besieged communities.Russia also needs to persuade the Syrian air force to stop strikes on anti-government positions, which have also killed large numbers of civilians.In turn, Washington has to get the opposition groups it backs to separate themselves from Al Nusra, which has allied itself with a range of rebels at different points in the fluid conflict.Only if commitments by Moscow and the Assad regime to cease violence for seven days are ""fully met"" will the US and Russia start cooperating with joint strikes, the Pentagon said in a statement following the announcement.Lavrov cautioned that Moscow could not ""100 percent guarantee"" that all the parties would obey the ceasefire.""The Syrian Government has been informed by us about these arrangements, and it is ready to fulfil them,"" he added.A truce agreed in February and endorsed by the United Nations Security Council has been repeatedly broken by both sides.The final hours of the talks dragged out as Kerry contacted US President Barack Obama's office to get approval for the plan, but the top diplomat said both governments stand behind it.""The United States is going the extra mile here because we believe that Russia and my colleague have the capability to press the Assad regime to stop this conflict and come to the table and make peace,"" Kerry said.The UN's Syria envoy Staffan de Mistura described the deal as a ""window of opportunity"", and said he would discuss with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon when stalled political negotiations can restart.'Back to square one'Pro-regime forces have taken back a strategically important district on Aleppo's southern outskirts, rolling back nearly every gain from a month-long rebel offensive there.The government advance further sealed off Aleppo's opposition-held eastern districts, and regime troops backed by the Russian air force have completely encircled opposition-held neighbourhoods, leaving the civilian population completely cut off.In another major blow to the rebels, the military commander of the Army of Conquest, the largest rebel alliance, was killed in an air strike, Islamist sources said Thursday.""Rebels are now back to square one, under an even more ruthless siege,"" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP.In Aleppo, once Syria's economic powerhouse that has been ravaged by the conflict that began with anti-government protests in March 2011, desperate civilians described a battle for survival.""This siege is much harder than the first one.

Since India began allowing its own citizens as well as outsiders to visit the valley in the early 1990s, tourism and trade have boomed. And the marks of modernisation, such as solar panels, asphalt roads and concrete buildings, have begun to appear around some of the villages that dot the remote landscape at altitudes above 4,000 meters.847 tourists this yearThis year is busier than ever, said Ishita Khanna, co-founder of the eco-tourism agency Ecosphere. By Aug. 29, with at least a month left until the end of the tourism season, there had been 847 foreign visitors to the region in 2016, compared with 726 for all of last year, officials said.They could not give a figure for how many Indians had travelled to the region in jeeps and buses across treacherous mountain roads, as Indian tourists do not need special permits. But additional district magistrate Jagan Thakur said that 70 per cent of the tourists to the region were Indians.Many of the valleys 13,000 or so residents  ethnically Tibetan yet long resident in Himachal Pradesh  welcome the influx of tourists eager to explore the mountains or simply enjoy the pristine surroundings.In years when the climate and roads are good, they flock in together in high numbers, Mr. Thakur said. Villagers will actually convert their houses into home-stays.In the hillside village of Demul, with only around 250 residents, people have devised a system whereby half of the residents move in with their neighbours while renting their earthen-hut homes to travellers during the summer, and then share the earnings. That income is helping many invest in better schooling for their kids.They have a great system in this village ... everybody takes turns, said British traveller Tom Welton. They collectively bring all the money together and at the end of the year they distribute it equally to the whole village. Tourism has become so important it now makes up at least half of most peoples annual income, Ms. Khanna said. The rest of the peoples wealth comes from traditional channels herding sheep and goats, and growing crops like black beans, barley and, more recently, green peas.For the crimson-robed Buddhist monks in the valley, the increase in visitors brings a chance to teach Buddhism to others. More people should learn about it, said Lama Tenzin Rizzin, a resident of another hilltop village, Key, a half-hour drive from the valleys main town of Kaza.Environmental challengesSome villagers and travellers worry that the influx of new funds will bring competition, greed and environmentally taxing change such as flush toilets that might empty straight into the Spiti River or put a strain on the regions already limited water sources.We cannot go beyond our limits. Mass tourism is not good for our culture, said Tenzin Thinley (35) who runs a home-stay in the valley village of Kibber and works as a tourist guide. Hospitality is important in Spitis culture, and we will not let it disappear.While increasing trade with cities outside the valley has broadened the dinner table with lentils and grains that cant be grown in the valley, it has also brought an influx of junk food that the elders are struggling to keep away from the children.Too many tourists mean too much money, Mr. Thinley said. I do not want to be greedy.  AP"
58f665677be9e031f13b3f16,The history of Vaduku language,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/The-history-of-Vaduku-language/articleshow/54353674.cms,2016-09-16,"The vast peninsular mass that lay between the Aryavarta and the Tamilakam - history sings its glory relatively less, except of the kings that it has produced. It has little classical literature, except that it has been the setting for the most loved epic of India. It has fewer treatises on art and architecture, but has the frescoes of Ajanta, palaces of Hampi and colossus of Sravanabaelagola. That was where, we suppose, Konkani language was born.The Tamil had a name for the inhabitants of this middle country, they called them vadukar. Incidentally, that just means northerners, and is analogous to the modern Kannada word badaga. But the Tamil categorically distinguished them from the vadavar, who were the northerners beyond the Vindhyas - the Arya . (Aiyangar, 1923: Some Contributions Of South India To Indian Culture, 24)The language of the vadukar was called the vaduku language. Tamil found the language ""unlearned in character and long in sound"", though apparently they understood it. (Aiyangar, 1923 : 25) Their contempt for the language arose probably more from their overall dislike for the vadukar, than the language per se. Nevertheless, historical records hint at much intercourse between the Tamil and the vadukar, so possibly there was a lot of linguistic exchange too. The influence of Tamil language on Kannada and Telugu is obvious, but even Konkani, and subsequently Marathi, carry significant Tamil baggage. (Southworth, 2004: Prehistoric Implications Of The Dravidian Element In The NIA Lexicon)The Indo-Aryan inputs into vaduku came later as the inhabitants of Aryavarta began to trickle through the Vindhyas for various reasons - ascetics looking for secluded spots in Dandakaranya, ambitious kings seeking to build empires, traders pursuing markets and sources of materials, and, perhaps, even shepherds looking for fresh pastures. The legend of Krishna fleeing from Mathura to the Gomanta mountain to spare his people the wrath of Jarasandha, is one of the better remembered instances of Arya venturing across the Vindhyas. So is Parshurama's legend, his massacre of the kshatriya, and all that. Considerable movement of Arya into the vadukar land seems to have happened on account of natural calamities. We know of at least two major recorded events: the drying up of river Saraswati between the third millennium and the second millennium BCE (Valdiya, 2002: Saraswati - The River That Disappeared, 57), and the twelve year drought around 290 BCE, recorded in inscription no. 1 at Sravanabaelagola. (Rice, 1889: Inscriptions At Sravana Belgola, 4)Konkani was the language that inherited most of the Indo-Aryan influence resulting from this contact. It is not surprising, therefore, that this language, spoken from ""Malwa and Rajputana to the Krishna and Tungabhadra rivers"" has been traditionally called the Maharastri Prakrit, fitting it into the hierarchy of middle Indo-Aryan languages. The other languages, which evolved from the vaduku, namely Kannada and Telugu, had far lesser Indo-Aryan influence, and as a result were not considered a part of the middle Indo-Aryan family. But it is interesting to note that Marathi has been sometimes included in the Panca-Dravida group of languages, along with Kannada and Telugu, the other middle Indo-Aryan languages have been put into the Panca-Gauda group.Konkani seems to have come under Indo-Aryan influence on two flanks - across the Vindhyas and along the western coast. Northern Deccan was the ground for the early encounter between the vadukar and the Arya, as the latter crossed the Vindhyas. Paithan, for instance, developed as a major entrepot of trade and commerce, finding mention even in first-century Greek text, the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea . When must it have happened ? Obviously we have no historical records. But circumstantial evidence can give us some clues. Black-gram, green-gram, horse-gram, hyacinth bean, lentil and grass-pea seem to have been native crops of the northern Deccan. It is only around 1900 BCE that wheat and barley were introduced, apparently through 'cultural diffusion', according to Boivin and others. (Boivin, Fuller, Korisettar & Petraglia, 2007: First Farmers in South India, 3)Could the introduction of wheat and barley mark the encounter of vadukar with the Arya ?When the sea engulfed the port at Dvaraka, the then flourishing Saraswati valley civilization was on the lookout for an alternative port. The international trade then relocated to Sopara. That was probably the beginning of the exodus of the Saraswat to the south. They seem to have slowly moved southwards to the present Konkan and further into Kerala, infusing Indo-Aryan vocabulary into the southern languages. This is what, for instance, differentiated Malayalam from Tamil. It is estimated that eighty percent of the vocabulary of the scholarly usage of Malayalam today is constituted by Sanskrit. (Kerala Sahitya Akkadami, 2005: Malayalam Literary Survey, Volume 27)(The opinions expressed in this article are the writer's own. The writer is currently engaged in the research of the Konkani language)"

Officials told Express that the visit could take place either in October of November.Weerakkody said that Sri Lanka is looking to get investments to the tune of US 4 billion in the petroleum sector to meet domestic demand and also exploit export potential, keeping in view the strategic location of the island nation.According to Sri Lankas Central Bank, the country imported US$ 2.7 billion worth of petroleum and petroleum products in 2015. Fuel imports accounted for 14.3 percent of the import bill. In 2014, when word prices were significantly higher, the fuel component of the countrys import bill was as high as 23.7 percent.Sri Lanka only refinery at Sapugaskanda, is 47 years old, and is facing problems. According to the website of the Ministry of Petroleum, the refinery has been undergoing immense production constrains and technical difficulties due to non-availability of Iranian Light crude which is best suited for use in the refinery in terms of the yield and refinery margin obtained from the refining process.As a result of ongoing US sanctions against Iran, there was an attempt to shift to Oman Export Blend, Murban, and Arabian Light. But the use of these resulted in a substantial reduction in the refinery margin, impacting adversely on the profitability of locally refined products. Sanctions against Iran have also led to the closure of the refinery on several occasions.It is in this context that Minister Weerakkody is seeking foreign partners to set up a refinery or improve matters at the existing one, to enhance domestic refining capacity.Gas ExplorationWeerakkody also said that Sri Lanka is formulating a gas exploration policy for marketing and distribution as there are good reserves of gas in the Mannar basin in the northern part of the country.Saliya Wickramasooriya, Director General of the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat, told Express that Sri Lankas quantified gas resource is 2 Trillion Cubic Feet (TCF) and the potential is at least 10 TCF.Cairns (India) had done a study of the gas reserves potential at a cost of US$ 235 million. The study had identified natural gas reserves valued at an estimated US$ 12 billion in a section of the Mannar Basin.The Government has already inked an agreement with Total S.A., a French multinational, to conduct a Joint Study on two blocks off the countrys east coast, known as JS-5 and JS-6.Petroleum Minister Weerakkody asserted that his country is in favor of LNG being included in the energy mix for power plants to be set up in future. He said the decision to opt for LNG has been taken to safeguard the environment and keeping in view the gas reserves in the country.Sri Lanka has decided to shelve the proposed coal power plant at Sampur, which was a joint venture of the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and the Indian National Thermal Power Corporation (NTPC).Indian Company PetronetLNG Shows Keen InterestWhile India has reservations about the switch over to LNG from coal at this juncture when all agreements relating to a coal fired plant has been signed, it has not stopped the public sector Petronet LNG Ltd from exploring the possibility of setting up an LNG-fuelled power plant here.Further discussion on this will take place when the Power Ministers of the two countries meet in October or November.Trincomalee Oil TanksThe Sri Lankan is wanting to develop 30 World War II-vintage oil tanks in the Trincomalee Upper Tank Farm through a joint venture with the Lanka Indian Oil Corporation. The LIOC is already using 12 tanks in the Lower tank Farm. The Sri Lankan government is to get a consultant to help develop the tanks in the Upper Tank Farm."

With the help of these newly trained youths, out of the 2.73 lakh hectares of wasteland, 1.53 lakh hectares have successfully been converted into farmland,"" R.P. Singh Ratan, director extension, BAU, told The Telegraph. He said various pulses like tur ( arhar), black gram (urad), horse gram ( kulthi), millet, sarguja lentils and corn had been planted on the converted farmlands. Each BAU krishi vigyan kendra had trained an average of 2,500 local youths, encouraging them to take up farming and allied activities as a source of livelihood as per directives of chief secretary Rajbala Verma and state agriculture secretary Nitin Madan Kulkarni. Ratan revealed that 500 seed villages had also been set up in the state during the current kharif season. These seed villages would be responsible for producing certified paddy oil and pulses seeds. BAU has supplied breeder seeds, produced in its labs, to farmers of the seed villages, which in turn would produce quality certified seeds. These seeds would be certified for quality by independent agencies and later distributed among farmers throughout the state for direct sowing, he added. An ICAR team, that wound up a five-day long visit to BAU today, stressed on paying attention to personality development and communication skills of students. Addressing senior BAU officers, the ICAR team chairman and former vice chancellor of University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, P.G. Chengappa, said students of BAU were very talented but lacked motivation. He said overall intake of students in various colleges and faculties of BAU was too low, and that needed to be increased. He also emphasised that 40 per cent seats in all courses be earmarked for sons and daughters of farmers. The ICAR team also expressed displeasure at the large number vacancies in teaching positions. During its five-day trip, the team met BAU vice chancellor Dr N. M. Kulkarni, senior officers, teachers, scientists and support staff and visited all colleges, hostels, laboratories, libraries, experiential learning units, instructional farms, fields and the BAU main block to get first-hand knowledge of the ground realities. The ICAR team included additional director general (Natural Resource Management) S. Bhaskar, retired professor of Central Agricultural University (Imphal), H.N. Gour, retired dean of Central Agricultural University (Rajasthan) S. N. Sharma, associate dean of University of Veterinary Science (Tirupati) P. Eshwara Prasad, and principal scientist (education division) K.P. Tripathi."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Ranchi, Sept. 28: They are mere students, but already have tips up their sleeves to improve yield of pulses, ensure better food security and welfare of farmers. The schoolchildren shared their thoughts at a two-day state-level students' science seminar that kicked off at Amar Shaheed Thakur Vishwanath Shahdeo Plus Two Zilla School on Main Road in Ranchi today. Around 44 students from Classes VIII, IX and X from 22 districts of Jharkhand are taking part in the event organised by the department of secondary education. On Day One, 28 students from 14 districts voiced their opinion on Pulses for Sustainable Food Security - Possibilities and Challenges on Day One. Tomorrow, the remaining 16 will air their views on the topic. Atharva Shukla, a Class X student of St Xavier's School, Chaibasa, laid stress on chalking out innovative schemes for farmers to grow pulses. ""Pulses like chickpeas, masur, urad and moong are high in nutritional value but owing to the sudden rise in their prices, many farmers find it difficult to sow them. I feel the government should provide adequate land to these farmers to help them grow pulses. This will, in turn, be a financial boon for farmers and help them make profits,"" said Atharva. Ritu Kumar Pal, a Class IX student of Kasturba Gandhi Residential School, West Singhbhum, suggested measures to increase productivity of pulses. ""This is only possible when the government takes the initiative to make farmers aware of modern agricultural methods and also provide them high quality seeds,"" said Ritu. Aradhana Patnaik, secretary of department of school education and literacy mission department, was the chief guest on the occasion while Manish Ranjan, director of state secondary education department, was the guest of honour. ""I am amazed to hear such alternative remedies suggested by these children to combat malnutrition. Many poor kids do not have proper access to pulses or even milk. I genuinely wish the government acts on alternative ideas shared by the students,"" said Patnaik. Echoing Patnaik, Manish Ranjan said that in 1950, per capita consumption of pulses was only 50gm in comparison to 150gm in 2016. ""When we look at countries like Canada and Australia, even today per capita consumption of pulses is 50gm. Malnutrition is a major challenge which needs to be tackled and pulses are one of the prerequisite ingredients to combat the problem,"" he said. Winners will be judged on parameters like pictorial presentation, oratory skills, question-answer sessions and relevance of speech. The first prize winner will get the opportunity to take part in the national-level science seminar to be held at Nehru Science Centre in Worli, Mumbai, on October 4."

They would weave magic with their ladle and earn rave reviews from public and connoisseurs alike. Those were the days before cooks had not become chefs, before restaurants with their psychedelic lights and designer food items made inroads into small-town India.As days passed and people's fascination with the world grew, so did the craze for niche food, allowing Odia cooks to slip into the oblivion, their simple recipes no longer tingling the taste buds.These days people outside Odisha know the state for its majestic temples, graceful and stunning Odissi dance, pristine beaches and wonderful weaves. Somewhere down the line its rich food legacy got lost in the maze of multi-cuisines and fusion food.But the recipes still remain, and at times, during family gatherings, they would make their presence felt, lip smacking and finger licking delicacies that would remind people of the days gone by.Starting from a spread of authentic seafood and non-vegetarian cuisines to a wide variety of extraordinary desserts, authentic vegetable curries to traditional pithas or pan-cakes, Odia food offers a wide range. And the USP lies in its simplicity, cooked with less spice and less oil, and yet sublime as it hits the mouth.But lack of patronage and marketing has eaten up on its popularity. ""No state in India can match the variety and flavour of Odia food. But not many people know about it due to lack of patronage and promotion. The culinary skills of Odia cooks and their spell of magic has been mentioned and complemented upon by many great personalities in several books,"" said Usharani Tripathy , food historian and writer.One of the major ingredients associated with Odia food is its connection with gods, temples, rituals and festivals.The Jagannath temple in Puri attracts lakhs of devotees from across the globe not only to see the Lord but also for the delicious 'Mahaprasad' served there.The oldest organised kitchen in the world has the capacity to cook for one lakh people and 172 types of dishes in a single day, each with its own characteristic and taste.Interestingly, food also plays a significant role in religious events which are organised throughout the year when certain special dishes and cakes are made.The festival of Raja is held for making Poda pitha, Chitau amabsya for chitau pitha, Gaintha pith during mangala osha, ghanta tarakari (mixed veg curry) on Dwitibahan Osha, Muan on Dhanu Sankranti and several others. In a nutshell Odisha celebrates at least one festival associated with a food item every month.""We Odias are very fond of food and the culture and geography of the state complement it brilliantly. There is an abundance of vegetables, sea food, fish, mutton and chicken, and the diverse culture in different parts of the state led to a huge variety and diverse taste and cuisines,"" said Ritu Mohanty, a food blogger. His Facebook page has over 6000 members who post recipes on different food items every monthWithin the state different regions have different food habits. While people in coastal region prefer fish, crab, prawn, dalma (lentils cooked with vegetables), pakhal (water rice) and pithas, those in the north are fond of mutton curry with mudhi (puffed rice) while people in western Odisha enjoy bamboo shoots, special soups (letha) and lots of chattneys with rice.Pancha phutan (Combination of five different spices including black cumin, coriander, fenugreek, fennel and mustard seeds) is primarily used in Odia delicacies, and are healthy as well as easily digestible.Mostly Odia cooks avoid using rich and hot spices and use simple techniques, but the end product is always lip-smacking.""No tricks are required to cook Odia food as we use very little spices. We cook mutton curry in a simple way and it's still tasty. Even simple vegetables can be cooked in different ways,"" said chef and Odia food specialist Susanta Kumar Dash.He is the new breed of chefs who are making an effort to bring the lost flavours back to the table and more and more people are lapping it up. As interest keeps growing, a number of hotels and restaurants have started promoting Odia food and organising food festivals, giving those staying in Odisha and away a taste of the past.""During the recent Ganesh Chaturthi I was invited to cook in Mumbai where people literally hugged me and kissed my hand after eating Odia food. Even in marriage parties people are opting to have simple Odia cuisines instead of rich north Indian dishes,"" Dash added."
58ff3b087be9e0420db2ed59,Online tips for farmers,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160930/jsp/jharkhand/story_110988.jsp,2016-09-30,"State agriculture minister Randhir Singh (right) inaugurates the e-Kishan Bhavan in Dhanbad in the presence of mayor Chandrashekhar Agarwal (from left) and MLAs Raj Sinha and Phulchand Mandal on Thursday. Picture by Gautam Dey Dhanbad, Sept. 29: Latest agriculture techniques, tips on how to improve yield and customers for field produce - all these and more will now be easily available to farmers, just at the click of the mouse. On Thursday, agriculture minister Randhir Kumar Singh inaugurated the e-Kisan Bhavan at Agricultural Produce Market Committee complex at Barwaddah, around 5km from the district headquarters. The centre, equipped with three computers with Internet connection, generators and inverters, will provide an e-platform to farmers to sell their produce online and get information about current rates of agricultural produce like wheat, rice, pulses, lentils, vegetables etc. It will also offer regular updates about weather and prevailing rates of various commodities. Minister Singh said: ""The e-platform schemes launched on the one-nation-one market policy intends to integrate all wholesale markets or 585 agriculture produce market committees to provide a transparent system. The direct and indirect benefits of the e-platform includes improvement in competitiveness and efficiency in the agriculture market, elimination of traders' cartels and price manipulation by local trading groups."" Farmers will also get better price realisation. ""Better price realisation will serve as an important incentive for producers, which, in turn, will lead to increased production. The e-platform will also help deal with market imperfections because in many states, farm harvest prices are much below the minimum support prices in the harvest season,"" he added. Better competitiveness in the market through larger participation of buyers and more transparent system of bidding will be the other advantages. Regarding other achievements, Singh cited the 1.5 lakh dobas or small ponds that had been created to ensure supply of water for irrigation and other purposes. Dhanbad MLA Raj Sinha, his Sindri counterpart Phulchand Mandal and mayor Chandrashekar Agarwal were also present at the launch."
58f64294a3d24b0b70c299e8,Still missing in Mullaitivu,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Still-missing-in-Mullaitivu/article15419824.ece,2016-10-01,"There was a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making smallsums of money. Now that has become impossible.-Edel Queen, residentThe last time Mary Sabamalai saw her son Mayuran was in 2008, when he came home for his 21st birthday.This was about a year after she surrendered him to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), during the final stages of their battle against the Sri Lankan armed forces. Mayuran went missing in 2009.Since then, Mary has been to different government offices in Mullaitivu and outside, carrying his photograph. Tall and lean, he is dressed in white formals, sporting a tie. Not a day passes without Mary, 52, wondering about Mayuran, the eldest of her four sons. She has two daughters. Her husband, now in his sixties, is a fisherman who takes up other odd jobs occasionally. Some months ago, Mary petitioned a presidential commission looking into cases of missing persons. I got an acknowledgement saying they have received my letter, but that is all, she says.Mayuran, she firmly believes, is alive somewhere.Kamala (name changed) knows how to keep her four-year-old busy. Look, the hens are running. Catch them, she tells him, just so that he would move away from her bicycle that stands slanted. Her trick works. But three minutes later, little Mukesh (name changed) squats behind the rear wheel and looks at her through its spokes. He giggles quietly, sensing her fake anger.It is not often that Mukesh gets to play with his mother. On most days, Kamala sees him for barely two hours after she returns from work. I usually leave at six in the morning and get back by 7 at night, says the 25-year-old. It was past lunchtime that Saturday and she had not heard from the farm where she is employed. The days labour fetches her Rs.600 (roughly INR270), if she picks a sack-full of groundnuts and shells as much. On some weeks she gets called for work all seven days. Like Kamala, many in Mullaitivu work in kachchaan or groundnut farms, as farm hands. The district accounts for the second highest share of groundnuts produced in the country. But that is not what Mullaitivu is best known for.The dogs of warHome to nearly 1.3 lakh people, mostly Tamils, the town located on Sri Lankas north-eastern coast paid heavily during the three-decade-long civil war that ravaged the Tamil-dominated Northern Province. Its residents, displaced multiple times, are slowly stitching their lives together. They cannot let go of the past, and the present holds them in its vice-like grip.A UN panel of experts report published in 2011 estimates some 40,000 civilian deaths in the final phase of the war. The report attributed most civilian casualties to government shelling, a charge that Colombo has flatly denied. The impact was most intensely felt in Mullivaikkal village here, where thousands of displaced people took refuge. That is where Kamala lost her mother and her young husband.It is more than seven years since the Sri Lankan armed forces defeated the rebel Tigers, ending the brutal war. In October last year, the UN Human Rights Council adopted by consensus a resolution moved by the United States, and co-sponsored, among others, by Sri Lanka, that seeks to probe allegations of human rights violations during the war. Even as different actors argue for and against international judges participating in the process, survivors in the countrys war-ravaged Northern Province continue battling its lingering aftermath every day of their lives.Gruelling schedulesAfter my first husband died, soldiers would just walk into my house and speak very inappropriately. They would harass me day after day. The local men were even worse. They would just hound any woman living alone. I knew I could not survive by myself, that too with a child. I got married again, says Kamala.Her days now begin at four in the morning. She takes an hour to cook and pack rice meals. She makes four packets, two each for her husband and herself to take to work. We have rice for breakfast and lunch, there is no time to make anything else. When she returns home in the evening, it is time to prepare dinner. After her father died in 1996, it was Kamalas mother who toiled as a labourer to support her and her siblings. I didnt realise her role when she was alive, but today I miss her the most. Had she been around, she would have taken care of my children while I am away at work, she says, fixing her glance at Mukesh, who is still playing with the cycle pedal.Kamala does not seem to mind her gruelling schedule. At least it takes her mind off the past. Right from her school days, distress followed her like a shadow. The LTTE demanded one child from every home to join their cause. They took me. I could not stand their horrible practices and somehow managed to escape, risking my life. She dropped out of school in Class VIII.Even as she despises the LTTE for taking her by force, she thinks the organisation helped maintain some order in the town. The rampant alcoholism we see today would have been impossible had the Tigers been around. Things were not so costly. Life was better in a sense.With her husband too engaged in daily wage labour, the couple gets by with some support from an elderly neighbour who takes care of Mukesh during the day. Her elder son, who is seven, lives with an aunt in Kilinochchi, about 50 km away. Kamala has not spoken to her aunt in weeks. If I do my son cries a lot, asking me when I will bring him here.She plans to, in January. But by then she would have to think of ways of sending him to school. Whether it is transport or tuitions, everything costs money. A tiny home built with financial aid, an uncertain job and a meagre income from it is all she has.Catch-22 on the coastOn the other side of Mullaitivu, closer to the coast, are families whose lives are tied to the sea. Fishing is a key driver of the districts economy, along with agriculture.A small group of women gather at the front verandah of one of the homes. They are attired in gowns that flow below the knee, some in bold colours sporting floral prints. It is past noon and very warm, the sporadic sea breeze alone bringing some relief. They used to call this place a prawn bank, says Edel Queen, who formerly headed a womens organisation here. The catch has fallen in the last few years, largely due to Indian trawlers fishing illegally in Sri Lankan waters. More recently, Mullaitivu fisherfolk are being forced to compete with fishermen from the southern districts of the island who have begun fishing in the northern seas. The drop in fish production has left many men and women jobless. Edel recalls a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making small sums of money on a regular basis. Now that has become impossible, she says.Many of them burnt their fingers borrowing money to set up small businesses. Leasing companies have mushroomed in the north, says Edel. Trying to replay old loans, many find themselves trapped deeper in debt. According to government data in 2012-13, Mullaitivu has the highest percentage of poor households in the country at 24.7 per cent. The mean household income here, as per census data for 2012-13, is Rs.23,687 (approximately INR10,700), the lowest among Tamil-majority districts, and in the country.With few options, most of the women now take up odd jobs for a small daily wage. They make and sell fruit juices in the village or package grocery items in small quantities.A few others, mostly younger women, have joined a garment factory in Puthukkudiyiruppu, travelling 20 km one way. This is one of the three factories that were set up in the north following the war.Employing many thousands of women, mostly in their twenties, the factories draw cheap labour. The women stand all day and work, making branded garments that fetch them a few hundred rupees every day. With no crche or child care facility, the factory automatically excludes young mothers.Broken familiesAccording to the District Secretariat records, Mullaitivu has nearly 6,000 women who are the sole breadwinners in their families. At least 5,000 women are widows, with many of them losing their husbands during the war.In addition to the many thousand lives that the indiscriminate shelling claimed during the conflicts last days, over 750 people in the district are reportedly missing. Some since the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami that devastated the district. And others during the war, due to enforced disappearances.My neighbours saw the army personnel arrest and take away my husband. I dont know where he is, I am still searching for him, says Nirmala (name changed), a woman in her early thirties. She has checked in rehabilitation camps, prisons and hospitals in vain. Some say he might have died, I dont know. What if he is alive? He must be alive, somewhere far away.Between appearing before commissions that hold public hearings and running to government offices with petitions, she takes up any daily wage job that comes her way to support her two young children.Amid growing pressure from families of missing persons, the government in Colombo recently decided to set up an Office of Missing Persons by an Act of parliament. It is a welcome move, but it should be set up in Vanni, says Nirmala, referring to the mainland area of the Northern Province. We cannot keep running to Colombo every time, right? How will young mothers go all the way, forgoing a days income and spending on the journey? Who will take care of their children?A missing person, in many families, also translates into having one less earning member. Aged parents and young spouses run from pillar to post, seeking answers or, possibly, some closure.Almost every family has lost a relative to the war, or is looking for a missing member. Many homes have a photograph of a relative hanging in the living room, with an oil lamp lit beside. Grief over the past coexists with anxiety about the future.Men are engaged in daily wage jobs, if not in farming or fisheries. However, given the number of single women running homes, there is a desperate need for sustainable jobs and child care facilities, the women emphasise.We need industries. That too industries linked to our natural resources  the sea, agriculture or forests, says Edel. They teach us to sew or make sugar candies or pappadam [a lentil-based flatbread]. How long can we do that? Where is the market? How do we compete? she asks, having tried it all  from skills training workshops held by government and non-governmental organisations to entrepreneurship.Vanni parliamentarian Shanthi Sriskantharajah agrees. The reason that women have not got into palmyra products is because there is no market. We need industries focussing on natural resources of the region. And we need to find a way of marketing the products.This is something that neither the central government in Colombo nor the Northern Provincial Council elected by the Tamils seems to act upon. They keep organising some programme or the other for women. They buy them milo packets and make presentations. Thats about all. Nothing changes, Shanthi notes.Accessing natural resources comes with a set of challenges. If fisherfolk are faced with a diminished catch, many farmers are fighting for their land that is still under military occupation.After President Maithripala Sirisena came to power in January 2015, defeating former strongman Mahinda Rajapaksa, he began releasing private land that the armed forces had occupied during the war. In Mullaitivu, the government has released almost 1,000 of the 2,000 acres taken over by the army, according to the District Secretariat.Reclaiming land after 30 years of displacement involves major adjustments for the displaced families. Those who were children back then would have grown up now and have families of their own, explains Sundarampillai Sivamani, a 60-year-old farmer. Sivam akka, as she is known in her village, grows paddy and groundnuts on a small farm her family has taken on lease. The five acres she owns have been occupied by the forest guard for years.That is what happens when you get displaced for so long, she tells me, sitting at a bus shelter. Families lost members. They lost birth certificates, national ID cards, land deeds. The missing documents haunt them as they try to trace and reclaim their own land. But I realise how lucky I was, I did not lose any of my children. Especially since she witnessed her 14-year-old nephew succumb to a bomb that landed near their bunker. He had a bath, and had oiled and combed his hair so neatly. He looked like a prince that day.She remembers his last words, Athai (aunt), I am feeling very scared today, he told her. Dont worry, we are in a bunker and will be safe here, she assured him. The army had said they were all safe there. He probably believed her. He smiled. Within minutes, however, she heard his mother scream. A shell had pierced through his head and he dropped dead. His smile was intact, says Sivamani, her bold voice suddenly shivering. No one had time even to bury the bodies there or grieve, they had to run for their lives.Battling everyday challengesIn Mullivaikkal or Nandikadal, the lagoon where LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran is said to have been killed by the army, the residents are under watch, though many observe that surveillance has lessened since President Sirisena came to power.Is it okay to be named, they ask each other as they give interviews. It should be fine, we arent saying anything that is untrue, one of them reassures. We cant take a chance, you never know with the military, warns another. They negotiate this everyday fear, systematically evoked by the government and the armed forces in the islands post-war years.They try out different ways. Some Tamil women have joined hands with Muslim women who have recently returned to Mullaitivu, years after the LTTE forcefully evicted them. We have to reflect on the past together. Or we cannot move forward, says a prominent member of the group, requesting anonymity. Our Tamil leaders do not look beyond Jaffna. They do not know how we live in Mullaitivu, she says with anger. This feeling of being left out in the margins is not uncommon in the district. Leaders in Colombo will not let us come up in life. Their actions keep reminding us that we are Tamils, that we are second-grade citizens. They feel abandoned. There are some changes, we must acknowledge, intervenes another member of the womens group. They do not agree with each other. But they dont mind listening.However, most of them have little time to dwell on anger or resentment. The stark reality of negotiating each day presents a challenge. A kilo of rice costs 68 rupees (roughly INR31) in Mullaitivu. Sugar costs Rs.100. Coconut, 30 to 40 rupees. And sea fish, Rs.500 per kg. This is our situation today, says S. Mary, also employed in a groundnut farm like Kamala.Her family, like several others in Mullaitivu, migrated from the islands hill country, where Tamils of recent Indian origin live and make a living at the countrys famed tea estates. We left during the 1983 riots in the south. Only to face an even worse war in the north. I want to go back to the hills now, she says.Kamala hopes she gets called for work the next morning.There was a time when women worked on the shore, tapping and drying fish, making smallsums of money. Now that has become impossible.-Edel Queen, resident"

The Price Stabilisation Fund Management Committee has approved further import of 80,000 tonnes of masoor and 90,000 tonnes of tur variety of pulses to boost domestic availability and keep prices on a leash.This is in addition to the 1.2 lakh tonnes of pulses procured from the domestic markets and farmers, a senior official said. The committee approved the tenders for import of masoor and tur proposed by MMTC because the prices quoted were below the minimum support price fixed by the government.The government has also opened 417 centres for procurement of pulses which is more than double the number announced last week. More (centres) will be opened if required, a senior official said adding that procurement agencies have been directed to procure pulses directly from the farmers.Earlier this year, the government had decided to build a buffer stock of 20 lakh tonnes of pulses for market intervention in case of a sudden spike in retail prices. The Consumer Affairs Ministry has directed cooperatives NCCF and Nafed to sell the pulses  tur and urad  through their outlets in various cities at the rate of Rs 105 per kg and Rs 120 per kg respectively. In a bid to make things easier for the state governments, the Centre has decided to supply milled pulses to them."

Villagers are not willing to take risk and maintained that the crops were ready for harvest.""Soaring tensions have made farmers apprehensive. Instead of waiting till the first or second week of October, harvest began this year by the September-end,"" said Teja Sing, a farmer from Gharsana. With the state getting normal rainfall this season, farmers are expecting a bumper crop of pulses and oilseeds.The sudden change in plans has forced farmers to put all other engagements on hold. Family members have been pressed into service by farmers and are supporting the menfolk in harvesting crops.The local administration is also doing their bit to help farmers. Officials said that they would not restrict the movement of villagers to their fields, even in areas close to the border, until they receive orders from the government.""Though visiting farmlands adjacent to the border is regulated, we have not put any restrictions on the movement of villagers. Since harvesting is done only during the day, it's not a problem as such,"" said P C Kishan , district collector.Meanwhile, all 336 villages of the district near the border region have been cautioned and apprised of evacuation plans.

A delegation from the tehsil met the sub-divisional officer (SDO) and warned of massive agitation if their demands are not met. ""They want water supply to their fields increased,"" said an official. Farmers have threatened to take over the pump house from where water is being released to district if their demands are not met. Officials also claimed that the mahapadav failed to get support as most of the farmers were busy harvesting their crops."

It has acquired RH Agro 's rice mill in Sonipat, Haryana, for Rs 70 crore and has taken four other rice mills across the country on exclusive lease, which will help it launch 18 packaged rice brands by the end of this month.At present, Patanjali sells three variants of packaged rice  silver, gold and diamond. It meets its procurement needs by buying finished rice and packaging it at its Haridwar facility. The new mills will not only give the FMCG company the capability of producing 3.2 lakh tonnes of finished rice a year from paddy but will also allow it to produce region-specific rice variants that it plans to sell locally and export as well.""The acquisition will give us technical know-how in rice processing,"" said Acharya Balkrishna, MD of Patanjali Ayurved. ""We have partnered with thousands of rice farmers in many regions of the country to produce traditional variants.""Other than the mill in Sonipat, which will process basmati, Patanjali has leased two mills in Madhya Pradesh to process the pusa variety.

5929e1237be9e0138af8f302,Drought proofing: Farm ponds turn out to be game-changer in parched Bundelkhand,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/drought-proofing-farm-ponds-turn-out-to-be-game-changer-in-parched-bundelkhand/,2016-10-06,"Newly constructed farm pond in Mataundh village of Banda district, UP. Newly constructed farm pond in Mataundh village of Banda district, UP.Back-to-back droughts wreaked havoc on agricultural production and farmers incomes across India in 2014-15 and 2015-16. Regions like Bundelkhand were all the more affected, as the absence of any protective irrigation cover forced large-scale distress migration of rural residents to cities, including the national capital. Bundelkhand being one of Indias main pulses growing belts, the impact of the drought there was also felt through the sharp spike in prices of legumes.Watch What Else Is Making NewsOne way to at least partly insulate regions against droughts is through constructing of farm ponds on a large scale. Many states  Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Karnataka, among others  have dabbled with this solution with reasonably encouraging results.Stopping rainwater run-off and its storage in large man-made tanks/lakes was part of traditional wisdom in Bundelkhand. The regions Chandela rulers built many such artificial reservoirs such as the Kirat Sagar, Vijay Sagar and Madan Sagar in Mahoba and adjacent areas. But in recent times  especially following the Dewas experiment in MP  the focus has been more on farm ponds. These are farmers individual assets, unlike community tanks/lakes that are public assets. Construction of farm ponds requires farmers to set aside a piece of their land for this purpose, which farmers were reluctant to do earlier. But the consecutive monsoon failures are now making them seeing the utility of such assets.Bundelkhands population density, as per the 2011 Census, was 328 persons per square km, below the 828 persons for Uttar Pradesh (UP) and the national average of 382. Average landholding for the region, at 1.43 hectares, is also higher than the 0.76 hectares for the whole of UP. The larger landholdings, plus only a very small area having assured irrigation and recurring droughts, has made its farmers more receptive to construction of farm ponds.Taking the above facts into account, the UP government conceived a scheme under the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, which offers a 50 per cent subsidy to farmers for construction of farm ponds. The cost estimate for a 1,320 cubic meter pond (20*22*3 meters)  which can provide one irrigation for a one-hectare farm  was put at Rs 1.05 lakh. Under the scheme, the farmer would contribute half of this amount, with the government subsidising the balance 50 per cent. At the same time, the farmer was given the freedom to hire the machine for construction himself. Besides, even if he engaged family rather than hired labour, the government would not reduce its absolute subsidy contribution of Rs 52,500. This flexibility gave a huge boost to the speedy construction of farm ponds.The UP governments initiative was launched in April this year in all the seven Bundelkhand districts falling in UP: Jalaun, Jhansi, Lalitpur, Hamirpur, Mahoba, Banda and Chitrakoot. Initially, 2,000 farm ponds were sanctioned, of which 500 were earmarked for the worst-hit Mahoba district. The fact that 1,900 ponds got built by end-June before the onset of the monsoon was proof of the farmers enthusiastic response to the scheme, in which NGOs and officials also played major roles. Many farmers, in fact, even invested extra money to construct ponds of larger size. Riwai village in Mahobas Charkhari tehsil alone saw 25 ponds of 2,000 cubic meters each getting built by farmers.The state government has subsequently sanctioned 2,500 new farm ponds for Bundelkhand. Of these, 1,200 will be of 3,100 cubic meters size that can store enough water to give one irrigation over 2.5 hectares. Bundelkhand, as already pointed out, is a pulses bowl. These, unlike paddy or wheat, require only one or, at most, two irrigations after planting. The farm ponds  which are brimming with water after a good monsoon this time  will be of immense use for the chana (chickpea), masur (lentil) and matar (green peas) crops grown during the winter rabi season.Assured irrigation created through farm ponds has led to some farmers in Bundelkhand even planning rearing of fish or taking a crop of singhaada (water chestnut) in their fields. There could also be scope to earn extra income from planting of fruit-bearing trees on the bunds. By enabling harvesting and conservation of rainwater, creating irrigation potential and providing a means of drought proofing, farm ponds have shown they can be a potential game-changer for even parched regions like Bundelkhand.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Here, the pandal was in the shape of a corridor of a zamindar's house. ""This is a religious-cum-social gathering. We always ensure to give devotees a feel of being close to their culture,"" said Sudipto Sen, secretary of JDBA.

A spell of rain on Thursday had cast a shadow over festivities and additional arrangements had to be made to rain-proof the venues."

Amid efforts to revise the draft to satisfy the objections raised by the Centre, the state government has indicated that it would mainly rely on improvement of domestic supplies and drives to check hoarding to control prices.In a snub to the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Maharashtra, the Centre has returned states draft legislation for regulating and capping prices of pulses.In April this year, the state government, which had come under fire for spiralling tur dal prices, had introduced the draft legilsation for controlling prices of tur dal, black gram, bengal gram, green gram, lentils, and beans, etc. Reaching out to the middle class in the state, the Devendra Fadnavis had claimed at that time that it was the countrys first government to adopt such a price control mechanism.Watch what else is making newsBut the piece of legislation has failed its first hurdle. While the state cabinet had referred the draft to the Centre for the Presidential assent, Mahesh Pathak, Prinicipal Secretary, Food and Civil Supplies, when contacted, confirmed that the Centre had raised queries on the draft, which had been returned back to the state.Amid efforts to revise the draft to satisfy the objections raised by the Centre, the state government has indicated that it would mainly rely on improvement of domestic supplies and drives to check hoarding to control prices. Pathak informed that the governments move to distribute subsidised tur dal had already impacted retail prices, which had overshot the Rs 150 per kg mark in April. The retail prices are now hovering around the Rs 110 per kg mark, whereas the wholesale rates are about Rs 100 per kg, Pathak said. The senior bureaucrat informed that on similar lines the Centre had recently allotted 500 tonne of split bengal gram to the state. We plan to distribute it at a subsidised rate of Rs 55-Rs 60 per kg. The supplies will be distributed within the next fortnight, he said.Sources in the government admitted that the Centres refusal to grant assent to the bill could lend more ammunition to the Opposition to fire salvos at it. The consumption of pulses is expected to soar during the Diwali festival at the end of the month.Officials said that the Centres main objection to the draft legislation was a provision for penalising a producer or a trafer found violating the price cap norms. While the government had proposed an imprisonment of up to one year, the Centre has said that it was not in consonance with the universal Essential Commodities Act (1955), which advocates seven year imprisionment for violators. Some other minor technical inconsistencies have also been identified, said a senior state government official.Till the time of filing this report, the state government appeared divided on the revision measure. While the states Law department has mandated a Cabinet nod for the revision to the draft, the Food and Civil Supplies department feels this wasnt necessary, a source said.

Non-state actors should not be supported by any country. That is crux of our security doctrine. We have said that non-state actors involved in terrorism should be curtailed. Sometimes, it can bounce back on you also. I think this is one such event,"" Parrikar said.Over 60 security personnel, mostly young cadets, were killed when militants stormed a police training centre in Quetta, Balochistan province, late on Monday - the deadliest terror attack on a security facility in Pakistan."

(Express Photo) A farmer near Jalandhar watching his paddy crop being combine-harvested. (Express Photo)Wheat inventories in government godowns have dwindled to a nine-year-low of 21.66 million tonnes (mt) as on October 1 and perilously close to the minimum buffer-cum-strategic reserve norm of 20.52 mt for this date.The precarious public stocks position is, however, counterbalanced by ample global supplies and also the prospect of a bumper wheat crop in the coming rabi season, thanks to the recharged soil moisture conditions from a decent southwest monsoon.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe Centre had, on September 23, reduced the import duty on wheat from 25 per cent to 10 per cent. The decision was forced by a poor domestic crop in 2015-16, notwithstanding the Centres own production figure of 93.5 mt being some 10 mt below the estimates by grain traders and analysts. The lower import duty is also applicable only up to February 29.Wheat of Ukraine origin is currently being imported at $ 208-210 per tonne cost & freight India, while the corresponding price for Australian premium white grain (the new crop to be shipped from late-November) is $235-240.So far, 2-2.2 mt of imports have been contracted during 2016-17, of which about one mt have arrived. Given the narrow window for imports at 10 per cent duty and three weeks voyage time from Ukraine, I dont expect more than 2.5-3 mt to land this fiscal, said Amit Takkar, managing director of Conifer Commodities Pvt. Ltd, a Gurgaon-based grain trading consultancy.The Centre, he pointed out, may not want to encourage wheat imports beyond a point, especially keeping in view Assembly elections in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh early next year. There would also be the temptation to hike the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat significantly ahead of the polls.At Rs 1,525 per quintal ($ 228/tonne), the current MSP payable to farmers at mandis is already way higher than the landed cost of Ukrainian wheat at Indian ports. A mere 10 per cent import duty will obviously not be enough to sustain a higher MSP.There are indications of the latter being raised to Rs 1,625 per quintal for the 2016-17 season.The announcement of the MSP  not only for wheat, but also other rabi crops like rapeseed-mustard, chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil)  is expected anytime soon.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

""It's just how I live,"" he says, shrugging. ""Go home, take my shoes off, take my clothes off.""Then he starts cooking - experimenting with ingredients he has picked up on his way back to his flat in the trendy Williamsburg area of New York, spending two hours a night chopping and blending. Which sounds a little like dicing with danger, when done in the altogether.""I've been cooking naked with knives for the longest time, so I feel pretty comfortable chopping,"" he says.Now he is making a career of it. Noriega, 27, has been widely dubbed ""the world's hottest chef"", while more than 200,000 followers digest his delectable daily dishes on Instagram. His most recent post on his YouTube channel, Franco Cooks, has been viewed over 70,000 times in the five days since he sat down, in his very skimpy boxers, to teach us how to cook chia seed pudding.The former model - catapulted to stardom when fellow Peruvian, photographer Mario Testino, recommended him to Dolce & Gabbana - is riding a viral publicity wave: having opened Baby Brasa in Manhattan's Lower East Side earlier this year, he will open his second restaurant in the West Village in January, quickly followed by a third in his own neighbourhood.Is there not a risk that, by using his chiselled abs to promote his culinary concoctions, he'll be seen as nothing more than a gimmick?""It is a risk,"" he concedes, perched on a stool outside his Peruvian rotisserie. The pocket-sized restaurant specialises in organic free-range chicken with Peruvian spices, but also serves up quinoa salads, jasmine rice with Peruvian corn, and yucca fries.""But life is full of risk - and that's what makes it interesting.""Noriega is savvy enough to realise that, were a woman to promote her restaurant in a bikini, she'd be pilloried for it. ""It's not like I'm posing for this,"" he insists, of his impossibly chiselled photo feed.""I live like that. I swam for Peru when I was younger, so was always almost naked - in my Speedos, anyway. And Peru is a hot country, so you wear fewer clothes.""For him, the whole ""naked"" USP is just good business sense: using the God-given tools at his disposal.""Can you tell me who this Jamie Oliver guy is?"" he asks, having never heard of his British namesake until he was mentioned in an article comparing the two. ""Did he cook naked?""No, no, I say, he used ""naked"" ingredients - stripped-down, simple food. No fuss. But now he's built an empire, married a model, lives in a huge house in London and has made a fortune from cookbooks and saucepans and things.Noriega's eyes light up and he nods, keenly - clearly taking mental notes.Inside the open-plan kitchen, Noriega - now modestly clad in a T-shirt and denim apron - shows me how to whip up his special chicken and lentil superfood salad. He laughs at my massacring of an avocado as I try to concentrate on his CV - and not get blinded by his biceps, or lose a finger - while wielding a massive knife.It was when he moved to New York a decade ago that he was introduced to Testino, through a family friend. ""I was very fortunate, because thanks to Mario I could go straight to the top,"" he says. ""I didn't have to hustle. Immediately I was doing D&G, Burberry, Calvin Klein.""But I wasn't using my brain. And I saw very quickly that it's different for women - they have much more creative control, and then they can become muses and creative directors as they get older. There are so many successful female models. But I bet you can't name more than five men. We have to do something else.""Besides, the restaurant business was in his blood. When he was a child growing up in Lima, his parents ran a successful chain of them and were always in search of new ventures. Food was a huge part of his life: ingredients such as avocado, quinoa, and ceviche - now considered superfoods in fashionable quarters on both sides of the Atlantic - were simply daily staples there.Enrolling in New York's International Culinary Center, he sweated for a year in the kitchens to learn his craft. He worked alongside the celebrated French chef Daniel Boulud, owner of the Michelin-starred Daniel and dozens of restaurants in New York and around the world. He grafted at a Peruvian restaurant in Queens, Pio Pio - determined that, when it came to opening his own place, he'd be on top of his game.He was also determined not to spoil those abs. Ah yes, those abs. As a former professional swimmer (he qualified for the 2004 Athens Olympics, but was injured before they began) and model (something he still does on the side), he's well versed in the importance of healthy eating. ""But not just salad. I didn't want to lose weight - just be good to my body.""Nowadays he keeps fit in the gym, by skateboarding across the Williamsburg Bridge into Manhattan, and riding his bike around town. Many of his clients, he says, are men who come in after the gym and want a filling, healthy meal.His organic, free-range chicken is three times more expensive wholesale than battery-farmed chicken - but he believes it's worth it. Half a bird costs $13 - more than fast-food joints, but still very affordable for New York.""I don't understand how you can work out and then go and scoff a $10 Thai meal - full of sodium and MSG,"" he says. ""People come here who care about what they eat.""Not surprisingly, he is perfectly happy to strip off for the Telegraph's photographer - despite winter having arrived in New York this week. Endearingly helpful and friendly, he happily flashes the Blue Steel when handed a knife to strike a pose - before breaking back into an easy grin, and putting his T-shirt on again.And he insists he is still single (though, like many a pin-up before him, swerves the question of whether he's straight). Women do make up the majority of customers, laughs Milan Kelez, his business partner and another Peruvian former model, as two women in their twenties ask to have their photo with him. They make quite a pair.""People think we're brothers or gay,"" Kelez says. ""But we're just really good friends.""He hands Noriega a new dish to try - patacones, a traditional South American plantain cake, with avocado toppings. They chew on it, intently. ""More seasoning,"" they conclude.The new restaurants will be much bigger, with around 80 covers in both the West Village and Williamsburg locations. And Noriega has more in store. His YouTube channel may be in his mother tongue - one of the few printable comments under a recent video says: ""Watching to improve my Spanish. Honest"" - but he is thinking about an English version, and is in talks for a possible television show.This week he was in Peru, speaking to financiers about more projects. His hope is to have a Baby Brasa - the name comes from ""pollo a la brasa"", a Peruvian roast chicken dish - in every major city in the US. Perhaps even the UK, I ask, imagining the queue.""I know that people might come into the restaurant for the first time because of my Instagram,"" he said. ""But when they come back, it's because of the food."""

Picture by Sarat Patra Bhubaneswar, Nov. 6: Get a taste of experiential tourism in Puri. Travel to the holy town and engage with the local community and take lessons in making delicious Odia dishes. Meet Yugabrat Kar, who runs Wild Grass, an eco-friendly restaurant. He has started this initiative through which tourists can take classes from local chefs in learning how to make traditional Odia dishes. An elaborate insight into the local cooking styles is on offer for visitors who take part in the sessions. The session begins with the participants visiting the local market and buying ingredients. ""Instead of going to shopping complexes or malls, they shop from the local vendors. In the process, the participants get to meet the local traders and interact with them,"" said Kar. This is followed by engaging with the chefs in making the dishes, where each session starts at 9 in the morning and concludes at 2pm. ""They first start making masala chai with local herbs. They then start to learn wholesome meal that includes five items,"" Kar said. Participants get to learn how to prepare various Odia vegetarian and non-vegetarian fare such as dahi baingan, dalma (lentils cooked with vegetables), saga mooga (leafy vegetable cooked with lentils), khata (chutney), dahi maccha (fish cooked with curd) and kankada jhola (crab curry) among others. ""Many a time, tourists come to me asking to learn a particular recipe and we make sure that we help them learn it. We also make sure that the recipes are easy to follow and they can make it when they return to their country,"" said Jayanta Mandi, the head chef. He is assisted by two other local cooks. A group of four foreign tourists took a taste of the cooking session yesterday. Stefano Betazzoli from Italy could not stop praising the prawn curry that he learnt to make at Wild Grass. ""Roaming around the local markets to buy the ingredients was great fun. After cooking, all of us had lunch together and the prawn dish was really nice. The experience was exciting. I love to cook and I am going to make it in my hometown and let my friends and family taste it,"" said Stefano. The initiative was launched six months ago and about 60 foreign tourists have taken part in it till date. The novel idea struck Kar during the period of his travel to over 26 countries. ""During my journeys, I got acquainted with the concept and thought of employing it here. Experiential tourism is catching up across the world and it is a great way of attracting tourists,"" said Kar. Kar has also started an eco-tourism facility at Lamtaput in Koraput district that aims to empower the local tribal community. Titled Desia, the site aims to promote responsible tourism."

Considered to be 'heaty', kulatachi pithi used to be consumed widely in the past, particularly in certain regions in the Western Ghats, as it was believed to increase body temperatures during the cold season.Horse gram, known as kulith locally and Macrotyloma uniflorum scientifically, is a leguminous, protein-rich lentil that got its name from being used as a staple for horses and cattle. While it was once grown and consumed in various parts of Goa, cultivation of the pulse crop is presently confined to Mencurem, Sal, Dhumashe and a few other remote villages. Its quick, dense growth is known to play a vital role in curbing soil erosion.Kulatachi pithi is prepared by roasting a cup of dry horse gram until brown and grinding it to a powder along with peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. This mixture is then soaked in water for a while and later boiled with salt, garlic cloves and groundnut oil. Water can be added if the gravy becomes too thick. A garnish of finely chopped coriander leaves completes the dish.Another delectable preparation is kulatacho ros, which involves soaking horse gram in water for 12 hours and then bundling the seeds into a muslin cloth until they sprout. Red chillies, coriander, cinnamon powder, dried garlic cloves, ginger, grated copra, pepper and cloves are then roasted in a shallow pan on low flame. Water and salt is added to these spices along with the sprouted horse gram seeds. Once ready, kulatacho ros can be relished with boiled rice or chappatis.Thanks to the anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties of horse gram, several people incorporate the pulse into their cooking, especially individuals suffering from kidney stones, high blood sugar, cold and asthma."

As the bank is situated at least 4-5 km from our native place, it takes at least 3-4 hours to make the entire trip on foot. This apart, we have to spend 5-6 hours more in queues of almost 500 customers to complete all processes including exchange of old currencies, deposition or withdraw of cash amounts,"" said Savita Devi, 55, a resident of village under Bagodar block.Delayed sowing of seeds or cutting of standing crops will affect agricultural production. ""This is the time for germination of Rabi crops like wheat, mustard, gram, masoor or others, which requires moderate temperature between 9-17 degrees for better germination or other activities. If the sowing of such seeds is delayed by 7-10 days, it would certainly affect growth and produce of such items. On the other hand, this is the right time for cutting of Kharif crops like paddy, which cannot be done after its stem is wetted (normally from the second half of October to the first of November as per the quality of paddies)."" said the District Agriculture Officer (DAO), Brajeshwar Dubey, adding that as Gawan and suburban areas are considered better farming field for Rabi crops, the delays may affect the rural economy to a great extent.In a relief, the state food and supply department (FSD) is working on appointing banking correspondents (BCs) to lessen the woes of the rural people in availing money at their door step.""The PDS units will function as common centres where select bank activities shall be done and BCs will be the interface between the customer and the bank,"" said FSD minister, Saryu Rai.Refraining from thoroughly disclosing the nitty-gritty of the proposed system the minister said the work towards implementation of this initiative is moving at pace and probably by the end of next financial year it could be implemented in phased manner.

These include gram, whose MSP will rise by 14.3%, while masur is set to go up by 16.2%, an official statement said.Gram MSP now stands at Rs 4,000 per quintal, including a bonus, from Rs 3,500 per quintal in the previous year, while masur stands at Rs 3,950 a quintal from Rs 3,400 earlier.The Modi government has generally avoided large MSP hikes to control inflation, among other things. In the three years it has been in power, the NDA has increased MSPs by 3.9% on an average a year, compared to 9.5% raise by the UPAs 9.5% average hike.Also read | Sweet paradox: Indias drought-stricken farmers plant thirstiest crop"

As they spend most of their time queuing up at banks, with many of them returning empty-handed, time is fast running out for farmers. Since most of the over 1,500 acre of taal areas remain submerged during most part of the year, farmers can only grow rabi crops  wheat, maize, lentil and gram. And they have only until the end of this month to buy seeds and start sowing.With ATMs in several rural belts not functional, farmers have been complaining about the timing of the decision. SK Singh, a farmer from Maranchi village in Mokama block of Patna district, said, This is my third consecutive day in the bank queue. The bank runs out of cash before my turn comes. I have to pay at least 10 labourers working in my field. Spare a thought for daily wagers who have little grain and other essentials. We know banks are doing a good job but why are ATMs in rural areas not opening?Maranchi has an IDBI branch. Its ATM has not functioned since the note ban. There is a PNB branch nearby. Villagers usually travel to Barh, 35 km away, or to Begusarai, 60 km away, to withdraw money. Maranchi, Phulpur and Jalalpur villages of Mokama have over 1,000 medium and small farmers. Seed is like god for us. We have ploughed our fields but only 30 per cent of the farmers could buy seeds. We can afford to go without food for a day but need to buy sseds of peas, lentil, gram, wheat and maize.India vs England Live scoreJagdish Prasad, a farmer in Baraiya village, pointed to a vast stretch of ploughed land and said, We need seeds worth at least Rs 4,000-Rs 5,000. How can we think of reaping when there is no sowing? Share-croppers say the landowners, whose land they till for a fixed amount, wouldnt allow them to work till they paid Rs 9,000 for a bigha of land. Most land owners are not flexible. They will let their field go barren if we do not pay them their advance. Whats worse, many of them insist that we pay in cash, said Surendra Singh, a share-cropper who says at least 50 per cent of farmers till others land.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

We can no longer afford to pay for them, said Siddesh Kumar (46), a senior lawyer at the Supreme Court.Eight days after 500 and 1,000 currency notes were demonetised, many like Kumar have started to feel the pinch.Kumar, a resident of Mayur Vihar Phase-1, says paying 30 a day for getting his car washed and 5 to get a set of shirt and trousers pressed would mean he would have to soon stand outside the ATM for a few hours, which he trying to delay as much as he can.My wife has 1,200 in hand and we are treating it like gold.

The vegetables were also available at a much cheaper price, Sinha said.She and her roommate used up one 1,000 and a 500 note they had at the local Safal outletto buy paneer, kidney beans and several varieties of lentils.Both of us work late and there is no time to stand in ATM queues. We are managing with what we have. We will think of what needs to be done once our supplies get over, she said.Roadside vendors at Dwarka said the worst hit by this demonetisation are the fruit sellers.Vegetables are essential. So, people cut down on fruits. My regular customers who used to buy at least two to three kilos of fruits in a week, have either not bought anything or are managing with just half a kilo, said Sushil Yadav, a fruit seller who sits at Mahavir Enclave.Many residents are turning to e-commerce portals for groceries.I had never before ordered from these websites. Its the only option I have now. It is convenient in these times, but I can hardly wait to go back to buying vegetables by touching and feeling their quality, said Dr Sudha Prabhakaran, a professor at Ambedkar University.Residents also complained that their schedule has gone for a toss in the past week. Thirty eight-year-old Ambika Sharma week was spent shuttling her children between school, tuition classes and dance lessons.She used to send her daughters with her housemaid in an auto rickshaw, but now she has taken things into her own hands.On the first day when the announcement was made, my husband filled the petrol tank using all the 500 notes we had. I drop and pick my children up from school and then drop them for tuitions in the evening. On weekends, they also have dance classes, she said.Read: Delhi Police, IT dept conduct raids after sting ops on illegal money exchange"

But in these days of 'conscious eating', another potato is slowly but steadily taking over the mantle of 'favourite'; the sweet potato While most of us usually tuck into piping hot, steamed, sweet potatoes as a tea-time snack, the interesting feature of the tuber is that is lends itself beautifully to cooking, be it sweet or savoury dishes, and is increasingly being opted for as the 'healthier carb'.But, do not be fooled by the word 'sweet'. Sweet potatoes contain a whopping dose of beta-carotene, Vitamin C , potassium and other vital vitamins and minerals. In fact, the nutritional value of this tuber has been ranked as the highest among several other foods.Goa boasts two varieties of sweet potatoes grown locally the brown-skinned, orange variety and the white-skinned variety that is also known as the 'Goa Velha white'. Both are popular and widely available, especially during the winter season.Food blogger Xanti Fernandes e Pinto of xantilicious.com says she finds sweet potatoes to be an excellent alternative to regular cooking potatoes in most dishes as they are a rich source of complex carbohydrates and Vitamin C. Some of her favourite sweet potato-based sweet dishes are bebinca and neureo. ""The sweet potato neureo, or kongancheo neureo , is something I have been eating since I was a child at my Hindu neighbour's home,"" she says.The procedure to make these, Pinto says, can get a bit tricky as the dough, due to its stickiness, needs to be handled between plastic sheets while rolling and folding. And like in most sweet potato-based dishes, the level of sweetness can be adjusted as desired by simply adding a bit of sugar.Homemaker Nirmala Fernandes has fond childhood memories of a sweet dish she would be served at the convent whenever she visited her aunt. The dish consists of parboiled sweet potatoes that are then sliced or cubed, pan-fried with a dash of coconut oil and tossed in a pre-prepared filling of grated coconut and coconut jaggery (ghodd-chun).""Apart from steamed, sweet potatoes, this version is also a family favourite,"" she says.Avid foodie and owner of the popular food blog, 'Hungry? Hog?', Sapna Sardesai says she indulges her family with many different sweet potato preparations. ""Sweet potato kheer, made with sago and coconut milk, is quite a popular traditional dish and a favourite, too,"" she says.Another popular preparation, she says, is the puran poli, which is traditionally an Indian stuffed bread with a lentil filing. ""A stuffing made using boiled and mashed sweet potatoes, a bit of sugarcane jaggery and grated coconut makes for a delicious alternative,"" Sardessai explains.Sweet indulges can hardly get better than this."

Rough estimates suggest that close to 50,000 vehicles have been stranded over the last few days in various places, with cash-strapped transporters refusing to ferry goods. The result has been an escalation in prices of essential commodities.Insiders fear that the situation is only likely to worsen over the next few weeks, especially after the the toll relaxation period lapses on November 24. The biggest challenge remains the limited withdrawal limit set by the central government.

And within this North American nation, Saskatchewan province is the major production base. In 2015-2016, India imported dal worth $1.519 billion from Canada. India brought in 20% of its total requirement for this commodity and Canada accounted for about 43% of the imports. In the same period, more than 60% of pea imports and 90% of lentil imports were from Canada.They didnt come cheap. Potts pointed out that prices of pulses in India had risen sharply over the last couple of years, in large part due to weaker than average monsoons and reduced output in the country, creating a larger than normal need for imports. Canada upped its production and export, as farmers increased planted area for lentils by more than 45% in 2016, after a rise of more than 25% the year before.Read more: Modi govt hasnt got the pulses math right. Five reasons whyBut the high prices commanded earlier in the year have eased. Imports of Canadian pulses have helped to ensure a steady supply of staple foods during a time when Indias production was reduced, Potts said.With the 2016 Indian crop rebounding significantly from the drought-reduced output in the past couple of years, prices in India and Canada have softened from the highs in 2015 and early 2016.However, due to strong and growing demand, we expect strong pulse imports from India again this year, although lower than in the last year, Potts said.The Canadian publication Financial Post quoted a market analyst as saying that prices of top quality laird lentils, for instance, had tumbled 34% in Saskatchewan last month.This trend could make Indian meals that much more affordable as the chill sets in."

I have a restaurant at Rethi Bowli. A few days ago, I saw a number of young people lounging near the function hall and when I spoke to them, they told me that they didnt have food. I decided to do something and this is a result of that, says Syed Naseer, who is the brain behind the soup kitchen.The residents of Mehdipatnam were greeted with this message near pillar no 47 of PVNR Expressway: Muslim youths of Hyderabad; Free Food to All Indians Effected (affected)due to Demonetisation. We started serving food from November 21 and every day, we start at 2 p.m. and the food distribution goes on till evening when we run out of food. A number of people have begun waiting for the food to be served, informs Mr. Naseer. The food is simple Hyderabadi fare of khatti dal (a sour and spicy lentil preparation) and rice. Rethi Bowli, Attapur, Mehdipatnam and Tolichowki areas have a huge migrant population who work in the function halls.Many workers in the nearby adda , auto-rickshaw drivers and cab drivers had only Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes, and some of them were hungry, so we decided to pool our resources and buy cooking equipment for this effort. The bawarchi (cook) is not charging anything. We are getting rice for the cost price and we are cooking 100 kilos every day, says Akram, who is a manager at a function hall and is part of the effort.The circle of friends who have come together is limited to about 30 persons and are generating resources among themselves, networking through a Whatsapp group Dildar Hyderabad.When the judges of the Supreme Court said that food riots can break out, I became aware of the situation we are in. And anything can happen when so many people are suddenly rendered jobless and helpless. The soup kitchen is our groups humble effort to ensure that we feed at least a few people and they are not led astray, says Mr. Naseer."

Rashtriya Mazdoor Kisan Sangh president Shivkumar Sharma claimed that demonetisation would take a heavy toll on production of Rabi crops as non-availability of currency notes is paralysing the sowing of wheat and lentils.Speaking to TOI, Sharma said, ""This is the peak time for sowing. 80% of sowing has been done in this cash crunch period. Most farmers have used last years old, left-over seeds for the sowing. If I don't get fertiliser in the next three days, my agricultural production will suffer."" Sharma has 81 acres of farm land in Sohangpur, Hoshangabad. ""I require fertilisers worth Rs 2 lakh right now. Other farmers will need seeds and fertilisers also."" According to Sharma, a farmer buys seeds mainly from private companies and not the government Beej Nigam (MP Seed and Fertiliser Development Corporation). ""As much as 80% of seeds are purchased from private companies because they are superior in quality and ensure high yield. These companies want us to pay in the new currency which we don't have. Where do I get Rs 2 lakh in new currency to purchase the fertiliser I need?"" Sharma asked.Sharma argued that Beej Nigam seeds and fertilisers would mean devastation to Rabi crops. ""The other place where seeds and fertiliser are available is co-operative society. But only 30% to 40% farmers are members of these co-operative societies,"" he said. However, BJP's Kisan Morcha president Bansilal Gurjar said, ""There will be no adverse effect on Rabi crops. The mandis are working in full capacity and payments are being made to farmers' accounts. The Beej Nigam and co-operatives have high-yielding seeds which are being distributed to farmers for Rabi season.""But the crisis is not just over seeds and fertilisers. Farmers don't have cash to pay for labour in their fields. The only relief for farmers is that diesel can still be purchased with old currency."

Thats because the Egyptian studied in an Indian school, while growing up in Kuwait. All my teachers were Indian and they will always have a special place in my heart, says Mariem. Mariem got an opportunity to come to Kerala recently when she took part in the Spice Route Culinary Festival.And Kerala is just as I imagined it, she says. It is like heaven. The people are so sweet. India is very simple and, yet, at the same time, it has many layers.As a chef, Mariem is very familiar with Indian cuisine. In the Gulf countries, there are lots of Indian restaurants, she says. But Kerala has a different cuisine. The aroma of the food is completely different. It is much lighter and healthier than the rest of the cuisine in India.At the festival, Mariem enjoyed eating the Karimeen Pollichathu (fried pearl spot fish). This fillet fish, infused with spices, and wrapped in a banana leaf was very good, she says. These are items which I have never tasted before, especially the spices. Most of the spices in India have a completely different smell and taste. In Egypt, we mostly use cumin and coriander.And she got some valuable tips on her trip. I understood that if you dissolve the spices in water, before adding it to the food, then each ingredient balances against each other, with no one particular spice overpowering the other, she says. I will be trying this when I return to Cairo.Meanwhile, it is interesting to know that one of the most popular dishes in Egypt, the koshary, has an Indian origin. During the second World War, when Indians soldiers were stationed in Egypt, they would make this food, says Mariem. Soon, the Egyptians loved the food so much that they forgot their original food. Today, at every street corner, there is a koshary shop.A koshary consists of black lentils cooked with rice mixed with a spicy tomato sauce, infused with vinegar. You can also add chick peas, fried onions and pasta, she says. It is a meal by itself and has become part of our street food culture. Other dishes include a foul - a form of beans which is cooked slowly and is placed inside sandwiches. Then there is the ful medames, which is a dish of cooked fava beans served with vegetable oil, cumin, parsley, garlic, onion, and lemon juice. Then there is the Marouk, which is a form of chappati. We use flour, water and oil and cook it on a flat pan, says Mariem. We then stuff different types of beans inside it.Interestingly, the Egyptians dont eat meat all that much. And when they do, it is usually at official functions like weddings, festivals and feasts. We like beef, lamb, camel and goat, but we are not dependent on animal protein, says Mariem.In Cairo, Mariem works as the Culinary Director for Food Tracks, which has been established by a top Swiss chef Markus Iten. The company is focused on training and educating chefs, says Mariem. We also provide consultancy for food and beverage establishments. As for those investors who want to set up something, we provide the expertise.Meanwhile, Mariem is looking forward to coming back to Kochi in the future. I love the place, she says."

Harshini told The Hindu . Following this, the HR and CE Commissioner ordered the family to vacate the land, she said.Ms. Harshini said the eviction was carried out after affixing notices on the encroached structures on November 22, before the officials demolished the three buildings and a shed on the land on Monday evening.On Monday, the priests family claimed they did not get the notice to evict them, covering the notices pasted on the doors with papers.Executive Officer of Bhagawati Amman temple C. Sivaramasuryan said the encroachers even attempted to sell a portion of the land many years back, and that was stopped with timely intervention from HR and CE officials."

He has exhausted the three Rs 500 notes he had the day the government scrapped two high-value currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000.The daily wage earner could not get them exchanged at the nearest bank, which is 7 km away in Bithoor, because of the heavy rush but a merchant in Hingupur agreed to pay him Rs 400 for one note.The scene is no different in cities and towns across the country after the November 8 shock announcement took out 86% of the currency out of circulation. On Thursday, tens of thousands of people lined up at banks and ATMs across the country, as the first payday since the recall of the high-value banknotes raised fears of more chaos amid the severe cash crunch.Most government and private sector employees get their salaries credited to their accounts on the last day of the month and millions of people were expected to withdraw cash to meet their immediate needs  such as school and medical fees, newspaper bills, and other sundry purchases. In India, 78% of consumer payments are made in cash, which the government is attempting to change.A penniless Lal, however, has a way out. As he has now decided to do what almost everyone in his village has been doing for a week now - barter grains for goods.He offered the village merchant Pooran Gupta a sack full of wheat, weighing 100 kg, in exchange for vegetables, spices, wheat flour, rice and oil. He has another one at his house that he plans to trade sometime later. The owner of the field they had worked on had given them the wheat in exchange for their labour.This is the only way I can make sure my family has food and lentils with their meals. The children dont understand the problem, we cant make them understand either. They want food and we have to arrange (for food), Lal said.Money is no longer available to us. God knows when we will have work.The daughter-in-law of one of his dead brothers, Meena, is worried about arranging for the wedding of her eldest daughter. Sumans wedding has been fixed to be held on December 20 and the family doesnt have much cash to spend on the ceremonies.Meenas husband has a broken hand and her three children are too young to work. However, unlike Lal, this family has one bigha of land and rice  in abundance after the autumn harvest  would be the medium for exchange. As will be wheat for potatoes, flour, vegetables, cooking oil, spices and even for salt.Families like Meenas have been dealing in rice and wheat as currency in the countryside.I will have to trade the rice even for clothes. How will my daughter live in her sasural (in laws house) if we fail to provide right hospitality to the baratis (guests from the grooms family)? She will be teased for any folly of ours. I cannot jeopardise her dignity, we will do the best we can to arrange funds, Meena said.She has struck a deal with a farmer who would give her ghee or clarified butter, vegetables and flour for the wedding feast. In turn, he will keep one-quarter of the wheat crop the family would sow.To earn some cash, she has started working in households in Kalyanpur, 15 km away from Ghazipur, and will barter the paddy for the clothes from local shops.Gupta, the merchant who has struck some goods deals with the villagers, set a reminder. He said the barter system will not work as the villagers are bound to run out of things to exchange.Cash squeeze has begun hurting me. The number of people for barter is increasing by the day and how long I can barter is the question before me? he asked."

(Source: File) When she tip-toed into politics in 1982, Jayalalithaa was probably unaware at the time, of the political behemoth she stood to become  a supremo without whom the pantheon of Indian politics would be incomplete. (Source: File)Without J Jayalalithaa, Tamil Nadu will be rudderless. And perhaps, so will her party, the AIADMK. Although O Panneerselvam was elected yesterday night as the partys new figure-head and subsequently sworn in as Tamil Nadus Chief Minister, his leadership skills are incomparable to Jayalalithaas natural political prowess and the larger-than-life stature she projected.WATCH | Tamil Nadu CM J Jayalalithaa Passes Away After Suffering Cardiac ArrestJayalalithaa exuded an impenetrable, unbending, mother-like persona. Her magnetic pull drew supporters from all corners of Tamil Nadu  a support which was inimitable, zealously loyal, and extremely frenzied in its nature. Yesterday evening, as reports of Ammas deteriorating health were conveyed, an unmovable crowd that had pitched itself outside the Apollo hospital began turning violent. Several women were in throes of theatrical, hysterical mourning. Last week, a man set himself on fire. Back in 2014, when Jayalalithaa was arrested, the state erupted into mass protests (some orchestrated by AIADMK) demanding Ammas (what she is affectionately called) release. Newspapers reported people committing suicide as a sign of protest. However, despite the countless corruption allegations  charges which were inconsequential in marring her identity  Jayalalithaa emerged victorious, unscathed.What was it about Jayalalithaa that led her to become an extraordinary political figure with cult-like following?When she tip-toed into politics in 1982, Jayalalithaa was probably unaware at the time, of the political behemoth she stood to become  a supremo without whom the pantheon of Indian politics would be incomplete. Jayalalithaa redefined the face of politics in South India.WATCH | J.Jayalalithaas Life JourneyThroughout her political career, she intelligently and meticulously built her identity. For one, having acted in over 100 South Indian films, her repertoire as an actress helped tremendously  she was already a household name. People felt a sense of warm familiarity, which worked in her favour. What cemented her grounding in politics however, was her relationship with M.G. Ramachandran, the actor-turned-political icon, who chaperoned her into the political realm and invited her to join AIADMK, a party he had founded. When MGR passed away, Jayalalithaa had to fight for the partys leadership. Eventually, however, Jayalalithaa  his political heir  inherited the political empire along with the impassioned love of MGRs mass supporters. Interestingly, MGR had an overwhelming tribe of followers, who he had accumulated thanks to his cinematic charisma.In the fabric of Tamil Nadus history, threads of politics and cinema have freely entangled and intertwined. It resulted into the likes of M.G. Ramachandran and even M. Karunanidhi to become political exalted figureheads, enjoying cult-like following. This dates back to 1949. It was C.N. Annadurai, the founder Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and the first Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, who had written and acted in theater. A handful of his plays went on to becoming cinematic productions. Annadurai was the first politician who saw Tamil cinema as an apparatus for propagating propaganda. He fervently encouraged inserting Dravadian ideologies into Tamil films like Parasakthi. Interestingly, it was M. Karunanidhi, former Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, who wrote the screenplay for Parasakthi. Actors like S.S. Rajendra and Sivaji Ganesan, who starred in the film were also members of the DMK.But Jayalalithaas larger-than-life figure cannot be attributed to her relationship with MGR and cinema alone. Many have spoken about her flamboyant oratory expertise. Back in 1982, she had rallied fervent support from the crowds, when she gave her first political speech at the AIADMK conference on Pennin Orumai (Unity of Women) in Cuddalore. I am asking you; you tell me, arent you all on the side of Puratchi Thalaivar MGR? she asked enthusiastically. In return, the crowd responded with a loud, overwhelming Yes. Thirty-four years later, Jayalalithaa still managed to draw in massive crowds. In the 2016 Assembly elections, she managed to shepherd throngs of people; some turnouts had over a lakh of attendants.Others argue that it was also perhaps the mother-figure that Jayalalithaa projected that played a pivotal role in garnering support. That, her followers looked at her as a nurturer, a caretaker, a protector  a sacrificial maternal figure who would always look out for their interests over her own. Jayalalithaa was comfy with that identity. It led her to play up to her image as Amma (mother)  a title she willfully adopted. Under that title, she introduced several schemes that were aimed at benefiting the common man, which included Amma Unavagam (Mother Canteen). The scheme introduced a restaurant chain run by the Government of Tamil Nadu, where the food offered on the menu were commendably low-priced, where a full sambar (lentil)-rice meal could be bought for five rupees.Despite the numerous accusations of mismanagement of funds and faulty land deals, Amma has always been considered a demigod, whose image could never be tainted. As the news of her demise sends shock-waves across the country, Chennai, the epicenter of it all, will have to brace itself for the storm.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Luckily for us, the people at Silver Beach Entertainment and Hospitality have resurrected the space that used to be Aurus, and turned it into Estella: a modern-Australian eatery that serves up some exceptional cocktails and great food.While Silver Beach Entertainment and Hospitality is known for restaurants like Nom Nom (Pan Asian) and Silver Beach Caf (European), the food at Estella is less modern-Australian and more fusion.Each dish on the menu brings together ingredients and flavours that can be traced back to European, Chinese and Thai cuisines, brought by successive waves of immigrants.Behind a wood panelled faade, architect Samip Padora has put together a space that is understated, with an industrial edge running through it. The focus of the restaurant is an island bar that extends to the outdoor seating area as well. The deck, with two cabanas and tables, is perfect for a December dinner.Imported ingredientsUnder chef Rohan DSouza, who has travelled extensively through Australia, the kitchen turns out small plates and main courses that make use of produce like kangkong (water spinach), puy lentils and meats that are imported from Europe and Down Under. A daily soup is the complimentaryamuse-boucheat the start of the meal.We highly recommend sampling the bread basket, which features a pliant focaccia and an exceptional saffron and cheese roll. They are served with a rotating selection of butters.Special mention must be made of the drinks that have been concocted by Nixon DSouza, senior mixologist and head of operations. A refreshing twisted gin and tonic, which is served frozen, and an excellent yuzu sour were just two of the standout cocktails that we tried. And that set the tone for our meal: a range of dishes that managed to be wholesome without being overwrought.Seafood lovers must try the plump grilled Tasmanian scallops, which are served in the shell with pureed broccoli florets, miso honey cream and carrot foam.Also worth considering are the Vietnamese prawn sticks with garlic mayo and egg yolk crumble. These are served on sugarcane sticks and the lightly cooked meat contrasts well with the natural sweetness of the cane.Vegetarians need not despair, as the menu includes everything from the cheesedu jour burrata  to avocados, and kale. We sampled the competently put together pumpkin falafel with smashed avocado and smoked jalapeno, but what were looking forward to ordering again is the zucchini moussaka, which was homely, but elevated by the use of firm puy lentils and a decadent four cheese sauce.Spicy and smokeyWorking on our second cocktail of the night, intriguingly called a smoked and age (the smoked rosemary sprig added oomph to the mix of whiskey and port wine bitters), we rounded out our mains with the grilled salmon served on a bed of squid ink pasta, and accompanied by a hot garlic sauce. Spicy, smokey and unctuous, this is one dish that exemplifies the kind of food that Estella serves up.The blueberry and lavender Viennese shortbread offsets the cloyingly sweet rose panna cotta (though if youre anything like us, youll ask to buy some of the biscuits to liven up your next afternoon tea), and the banana and caramel parfait, which is served with in-house coffee ice cream and kiwi marmalade, was a hit for its restraint.With a range of exceptional cocktails and a menu that manages to be eclectic, surprising and unusual, Estella is the kind of place that gives Juhus dining scene a shot in the arm. Never mind what exactly its cuisine is, whatever its worth, is worth trying.The author is a freelance writerEstella, Nichani Kutir, Juhu Tara Road, open only for dinner.

58e531087be9e05a951f55c9,Govt scraps import duty on wheat,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161209/jsp/business/story_123724.jsp,2016-12-09,"New Delhi, Dec. 8: The government today scrapped a 10 per cent duty on wheat imports to put a lid on rising prices and guard against lower winter crop yields on account of the cash crisis. In September, the Centre had reduced the duty on wheat to 10 per cent from 25 per cent even as prices rose to about Rs 2,200 per quintal in December from Rs 1,550 a quintal in July. Prices started to rise after traders discovered that government procurement was significantly lower at 22.9 million tonnes (mt). They also started doubting the government's estimate of wheat production for 2015-16 at 93.50mt and have said actual production would be nearly 10 per cent less. Harpal Singh, a leading Delhi-based grain trader, said, ""Private companies have already firmed up orders for import of 5-6mt of wheat."" Companies, which are believed to be in the fray to ship grain include Cargil and Glencore. Private millers have already imported 1.72mt wheat from Australia, France and the Ukraine since September when the duties were reduced. ""The bigger problem is that the winter crop of grain and rice can be expected to be lower as sowing has been delayed in many areas. Secondly, farmers who have been hit hard by the cash crunch have neither been able to use their normal mix of fertilisers nor could they hire sufficient hands,"" Singh said. After demonetisation, restricted flow of new money and the limitation on withdrawal from Jan Dhan accounts also hindered cash flow in rural areas. In November, the government had announced 6-16 per cent increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for winter crops - wheat, barley, gram masur, mustard and safflower - for the 2016-17 season. The MSP is the price at which the government buys grain, pulses and oilseeds from farmers to keep a reserve stock for rainy day and for sale through the public distribution system. The government has set a farm target of a record 270.10mt for the 2016-17 crop year (July 2016 to June 2017), an increase of 6.7 per cent over the output of 253.23mt in 2015-16. However, analysts feel these targets may not be reached."

Its an investment of Rs 5000 for her, a senior citizen. She makes a small profit on it and she gets by on it.Once she has sold her bag, she goes back to the market to buy another and thus continues her cycle of existence. But things have changed for Ramani since Nov. 8 when Prime Minister Narendra Modis government announced demonetization of high-value currency notes. It resulted in cash being sucked out of the market and buyers have become tight-fisted with the cash they have in hand.Ramani has been stuck with a bag of garlic she bought 25 days ago, for credit from a stockist. I used to sell a bag a day, she said when New Indian Express visited the market yard on Thursday, a month after demonetization kicked in.Her daughter Uma works in the same market as a daily wage worker. She used to make Rs 300 sifting onion at a stockyard. Work has been hard to find in the past one month. I have not been able to make Rs 100 a day. It is a very tough life for me right now, said Uma.The APMC market is said to be south Indias biggest agricultural market. Spread over 93 acres houses 1,980 wholesale shops that employ nearly 2,000 workers and trade in a mind-boggling variety of things Indians need every month: onions, garlic, potatoes, rice, atta, sugar, pulses, chillies, jaggery, coconuts, you name it.One month of demonetisation has left the bustling market wobbling, its business down 60 per cent from Rs 50 crore a day. Nearly 60 per cent of the business used to be done through cash.The markets assistant secretary, B N Krishnappa told New Indian Express, Theres just no cash around. Today (Thursday), our overall turnover was less than Rs 20 crore. We used to do Rs 50 crore.A fortnight ago, when New Indian Express visited the market, the scenario had been similar but today a stoic acceptance of reality has set it. Debit and credit cards are being accepted now and traders said they are contemplating buying card swipe machines shortly.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of the Bangalore Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said retailers not placing big orders because customers are holding on to any money they have. Stocks in the warehouses have dwindled. Its a panic situation, he said.Lahotis own company, Sunil & Co, used to purchase 3,000 bags (50 kg per bag) of sona masuri rice every month. Demand has fallen steeply since November 9 and he bought only 1,400 bags of rice in the last 30 days. He has cut his stock of dals down from 40 tonnes to 20.Perishables like onions and potatoes continue to move but slowly. Purchases are down 40 per cent and mostly on credit, Krishnappa said. The market sources 52,391 quintals of onion per day (over 2.10 lakh bags) from Chitradurga, Bagalkot, Chalakere and Gadag districts at a cost of Rs 4.33 crore per day paid to farmers through the 100 commission agents based here. The quantity of purchases has remained the same in the demonetization month but post-dated cheques with a 45-day credit period are being handed out for about 40 per cent of the produce. The market used to accept 15-day post-dated cheques earlier.The markets Coconut Traders Association president V Manjunath said the coconut business has gone down by 50 per cent. Coconuts arrive in trucks from Tiptur, Kanakpura, Pandavapura, Channapatna, Mysuru and Hassan. His own business is continuing to tick but only because he accepts accepts cheques and demand drafts.  I used to sell a minimum of 10,000 coconuts per day and a maximum of 50,000. In the past one month, my minimum has been 3,000 and the maximum has not crossed 25,000, he said."

A press release talks about appetising stuff  building good bacteria in our intestinal tracts. To this end, nothing comes out of a package at 212 All Good; even cola is homemade, a secret, all-natural recipe by beverage developer Tanai Shirali, that tastes good enough for thirds.A three-page appendix details superfoods featured on the menu, from adzuki beans to yam, via groats and moringa, kraut and kabocha. Even the wood-laden room with warm lighting is filled with natural textures, distinct from the jagged artificiality of the mall around it.The focus is on tasty, clean eating, but there are plenty of options for diets of every stripe.The polenta twinkies with miso-aubergine mash were mushy and under-seasoned.Vegan Jain with no gluten? There are plates for you. A meal of carbs, meat, sugar and spice? There are options for you too.Our medium-rare, well-seasoned lamb burger came on a bun made from sorghum, potato and tapioca flour, topped with addictive pickled onions and a cashew-chilli sauce. It was served alongside methi salad, tofu mayo, and fermented carrot ketchup. Get the house hot sauce; chilli-heads may want to eat it with a spoon.There was an oddball salad on the menu that paired pear with smoked baingan. We expected to wince at first bite, but it was scaffolded smartly with walnuts, mozzarella and mixed greens, and glazed with a lush layer of kefir-spring onion dressing. Kefir is a fermented milk drink loaded with good bacteria, much like yogurt, or many fermented foods, and there are quite a few of these in 212AGs kitchen.Creamy, peppery, tofu mayo-coated chicken salad on gluten-free toast came with discs of lightly pickled tendli. The highlight in a dish of mushy, too-wet, under-seasoned polenta twinkies on miso-aubergine mash was the bright crunch of pickled carrot strings and the tartness of barnyard-y goat cheese (though there was too little of both).The chilli chocolate lentils (made with whole masoor) merely sounded imaginative.

PHOTO: PTIPTIManipur, which has been struggling to cope with an indefinite economic blockade since November 1, now faces a siege-like situation following a wildcat total shutdown imposed by the United Naga Council (UNC) and other Naga organisations since November 25.The latest shutdown follows the arrest of UNC president Gaidon Kamei and information secretary Stephen Lamkang, who have been remanded in custody till December 22.Faced with demands for their release for a lifting of the blockade, Chief Minister Okram Ibobi Singh, however, told The Hindu , The law will take its own course.The blockade has emptied the States markets of essential supplies. With nothing to buy, demonetisation has, ironically, left the people indifferent.Since November 1, there has been no normal movement of trucks on National Highways 2 and 37  lifelines that pass through Naga villages  or along the 100-km Imphal-Moreh Road on the Trans Asian Highway No 1.New districts opposedThe UNC, which claims to represent Naga interests, is opposed to the creation of the Sadar Hills district out of the Senapati district, with a substantial Naga population.At midnight on Thursday, the State Cabinet finalised the creation of seven new districts, with the nomenclature of Sadar Hills changed to Kangpokpi. Mr. Ibobi says this has been done for administrative convenience, and that to create a district is the prerogative of the government.Ethnic strifeHowever, Naga organisations, who met to take stock of the development, have said, It amounts to rubbing salt in the wounds.The creation of new districts has been a subject of ethnic strife in Manipur since 1971, when it was first proposed.Successive governments have failed to resolve the festering identity-driven tensions sparked by the exercise. For instance, Naga and Kuki villages are located side by side in all four hill districts of Manipur.Mr. Ibobi Singh, who has helmed Manipurs successive Congress-led governments since March 2002, told The Hindu: The UNC does not respond to our invitations to hold talks on the stand-off and other issues. So we requested Home Minister Rajnath Singh to resolve the crisis by convening a tripartite meeting.However, the State government at the last moment backed out of a meeting between the Government of India, the Manipur government and the UNC on November 15.Home Ministry officials met representatives of the UNC as planned but failed to break the impasse.Whereas amity is widely prevalent in people-to-people interactions, the ongoing stalemate between the State government and Naga hardliners has slowed normal life to a halt in Manipur. Essential commodities like potatoes, eggs, lentils, edible oil and salt have vanished from the markets; life-saving drugs are scarce, and fuel is being strictly rationed.Ruling on a public interest litigation (PIL) petition, the High Court of Manipur on November 25 directed the State government to provide adequate security to vehicles plying along the two national highways. Two other directives call for the deployment of paramilitary forces to ensure the free movement of the trucks.Cross-border trade with Myanmar at border towns of Moreh in Manipur and Namphalong in Myanmar, legalised since 1995, has also come to a standstill,hit by the double whammy of the blockade and demonetisation. Although the formal trade agreement identifies only some items, all manner of goods make their way to Manipur from here.The blockade has driven down the rupee-kyat exchange rate at these markets from 1,900 kyat/Rs. 100 to 800 kyat/Rs.100. Transportation of goods from other States to Manipur has also been affected.The All Naga Students Association Manipur told reporters that it had no objection to the creation of the new district, provided the Nagas were consulted on the process."

Wholesale prices in Akola and Latur , the key pul se market in the state, fell to Rs 4,500-4,875 a quintal this week--below the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,050. MSP is a price decided by the Centre and no trader can a offer a rate lower than it for the produce. The average price during June was Rs 9,1009,450. Farmers and experts say this rate could further dwindle once fresh stocks reach the market as harvest picks up over the next two weeks. Officials said one of major reasons for the fall in prices is the current cash crunch, which has affected the cost of agricultural produce in the state.""Other than the cash crunch, traders who had hoarded the stock have begun to liquidate it to create a demand-andsupply imbalance, which have led to a massive crash in prices,"" said an official from the Akola wholesale market.Huge import of pulses that the Centre has ordered has affected the prices too.Officials say last year's drought saw a huge shortage of the dal, forcing prices to spike. This year the production has been good, as the area under cultivation also increased after Maharashtra's special incentives to farmers last year to grow pulses in an effort to stop shortage of pulses in the market and arrest a surge in prices. The government has given free seeds and fertilizers to farmers willing to grow pulses. ""Not only Maharashtra, but other pulse-producing states such as Karnataka , too, had a good crop this year. Looking at the market situation with demonetisation in the backdrop, the Centre will have to start buying from the market to stablize the prices,"" said an expert.Retail prices of tur dal have dropped marginally in some parts of the city .""This season we have had a bumper harvest of not just tur dal but other dals as well. The wholesale rates of moong dal, masoor dal and tur dal have fallen by Rs 20,"" said Deepak Gala , a wholesaler at APMC .On Thursday , retail price of tur dal in Bandra was Rs 140 and in Andheri Rs 160. Both rates were applicable at Apna Bazar in Bandra, which sorts pulses by grade."

Citing the increased hardship faced by Delhis homeless, following the Centres demonetisation announcement on November 8, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has directed the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) to provide meals at night shelters in the capital.While night shelters provide tea and rusk to their inmates, Kejriwal has asked Urban Development Minister Satyendar Jain to ensure that lunch and dinner are also provided in the capitals night shelters, government officials said.Many migrant labourers stay in night shelters. Demonetisation has hit them very hard. The chief minister has asked the DUSIB to provide lunch and dinner in night shelters, in addition to breakfast, which was already being served, a senior government official told The Indian Express.Watch what else is making news:The DUSIB will start providing meals at 10 of the shelters on a pilot basis, government officials said.These shelters are located at Geeta Ghat, Yamuna Pushta, Dandi Park, Jama Masjid, Sarai Kale Khan, NizamuddinNila Gumbad, Sarai Phoos, Jhandewalan shelter 1, Kotla Mubarakpur and Fatehpuri near Old Delhi railways station.The shelter management agencies or NGOs will provide the meals for the first three days while DUSIB will make the necessary payments to them.A senior government official said, For the first three days, the shelter management agencies will provide the three meals on behalf of the DUSIB. Once the process is set in motion, the DUSIB will procure dry ration  rice, lentils, spices  from Kendriya Bhandar or Mother Dairy and give it to the NGOs to cook and distribute. This will happen under the DUSIBs supervision.Government officials said NGOs like Prayas, Society for Promotion of Youth and Masses and Aashray Adhikar Abhiyaan, that run night shelters at various locations in the capital, have agreed to provide meals to the homeless starting Monday.According to government officials, the modalities between the NGOs and DUSIB will be formalised over the next two or three days.There are 262 night shelters in Delhi with an estimated capacity to house 21,000 people, according to the DUSIB.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

While wheat price records an all time high in Odisha leading to surge in price of flour, suji and maida, prices of pulses have fallen considerably much to the delight of consumers.Market sources said wheat price has soared from Rs 2,000 per quintal to Rs 2,700 in the last one month whereas dal prices witnessed a downward trend since early December.Tur (Arhar) dal, which was being sold Rs 10,000 to Rs 11,000 per quintal a month ago, is now priced Rs 7,500 to Rs 9,500. While green gram (moong dal) priced Rs 8,000 per quintal is now sold Rs 6,000, Bengal gram is priced Rs 13,000 instead of Rs 12,000. Similarly, red lentil is sold at Rs 6,000 per quintal against its earlier price of Rs 8,000 and black gram is priced Rs 8,500 to Rs 9,500 instead of Rs 12,000.The price of pulses is likely to fall further. General secretary of Federation of All Odisha Traders' Associations (FAOTA) Sudhakar Panda said the price of arhar would slide down to Rs 6,500, moong Rs 5,000 and black gram Rs 7,000 in January.While the country has a requirement of 2.2 crore tonnes of dal, this time pulses production is expected to touch 2.3 crore tonnes. Plus, 40 to 50 lakh tonnes of pulses will be imported.In wheat, the situation has been worsened by stocks with FCI which is yet to start open sale. This was largely a result of last years crop loss.Panda said since Odisha, which needs 16 lakh tonnes of wheat, largely depends on other States, the import is hit by cash crunch. ""We used to send money to the traders through RTGS and they pay cash to farmers. Since currency crisis still prevails in Punjab and UP from where we procure wheat, the traders are unable to buy,"" he added."

Naidu said water has not been released from the Tungabhadra dam anyway, so he had not bothered to sow a postrainy season crop. My worry is now the chilli crop. I sowed 30 acres, and I hope it survives. I need pesticides urgently but I have no cash, Naidu said.Years of drought have rendered the farmers of Ballari a stoic lot. So the anger does not burst forth from the likes of Lepakshi Naidu but it takes a lot of smothering of temper to accept the possible loss of 30 acres of chilli for the lack of a few thousand rupees.The pesticide shops in Ballari is a good place to sense the the distress of farmers. The owner of one, Chandrashekhar, told New Indian Express that rabi sowing had indeed dwindled due to the water shortage but the cash crunch made it worse. But what has kept farm operations going despite these twin blights has been the age-old informal coping systems policymakers make light of. Chandrasekhar sells his pesticide bottles on credit. But for how many farmers will I be able to do so? he asked.The pesticide bottle evokes a particularly morbid image in southern Indias farmscape, drinking monocrotophos mixed with Coca Cola being a preferred method of committing suicide by farmers.At Kolagallu village, about 8 km from Ballari, the demonetization debate among farmers has moved onto its effects on market prices for produce. Will the price crash below last years? Will it soar miraculously? Will produce be sold at all? Yerriswamy, a farmer, cited paddy as an instance. It fell. He grew sona masoori rice on his five acre patch and the harvest is in progress. But news from the market is not good, as it rarely is even in a normal year. But then this is the new normal, a memorable post-demonetisation coinage by the eloquent Arun Jaitley. The mills are not buying paddy owing to shortage of cash.Sowing target 2,04,000 hectares Actually Sown 33,421 hectares Unsown 80%Last year, Yerriswamy sold his paddy for Rs 2,100 a quintal. This year, ahead of harvest, he is ready to sell for Rs 1,800 per quintal  if they would only buy.Right now, his priority is his harvest. He has no money for the harvester, which costs Rs 2000 a day to hire. The rich farmers may manage but what about farmers like me? he asked.He revealed that he has a loan of Rs 3 lakh to clear. And before long, the dreaded quote drops from his lips: We are left with no choice but to consume poison.In the same village of Kollagallu we move on to cotton, a notorious source suicide stories in the past. Honnur Swamy has apportioned all his three acres to cotton this year and is now caught without an exit option. He has no money to pay to labourers. The banks dont understand the plight of farmers. They dont allow us to withdraw more than Rs 2,000. And we have to pay commission to some people to get Rs 100 notes.CROP TARGET ACTUAL Cereals 37,245 7,427 Pulses 1,04,630 22,230 Oilseeds 54,340 3,434 Commercial 7,785 330Farming isnt only about inputs and labour. There are incidental costs too. For instance, drinking water has to be bought for the farm workers. We met Kumar, a young small farmer, as he was serving food to workers on his farm under the shade of a tree. He has an arrangement with the shopkeeper. He makes the payment in one go at the end of the month. But theres the rent to pay for the harvester.I have money in my bank but it allows me to withdraw only Rs 2,000 after waiting from morning to evening. And then what good is a Rs 2,000 split between eight farm workers?""I dont know whats going to happen. Where are the currency notes?"" he asked."

Adivasi Odia is spoken by these tribes of Bagata caste. In the pre-independence era, the village had landlords and zamindars who were given the authority to collect taxes and were entrusted with administrative works. For safety of the villagers, the Vizianagaram rajas had given them weapons including swords, knives and guns.What is interesting is that the villagers have preserved most of these weapons and consider it a matter of pride to get these from the royal family.Guru Gujjala, an AP Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC) employee at Tyda and resident of this village, said, ""These weapons which are around 50 in number and around 100 years old has been with the Gujjala family since generations. Even though the family has split into different households, they still retain the weapons. Once a year, during Dussera, these are exhibited in the village. I have also heard that guns, copper plates and inscriptions were buried in the ground in the village few decades ago so as to prevent outsiders from taking these away.""""Despite offers of purchase from outsiders, the villagers never parted with these weapons and keep them as treasures within the village as these were given to us by the maharajas of Vizianagram more than a century ago,"" added old Bangari Gujjela , who is a descendant of the erstwhile landowners' family.Though a considerable big panchayat, the place suffers from water problem. Interestingly, Gujjala Ramanaidu, the first MLA from S Kota constituency post India's independence belonged to Kondiba.Besides, weapons, the forest-tree is another interesting feature of this village. Secluded from the village at one end stands this banyan tree and offers a picturesque view of the surroundings. Nobody knows the age of the tree but it's surmised that the tree is at least 150 years old. The branches and aerial prop roots have spread out on around an acre of land, thus giving the impression of a forest. The temperature of the area surrounding the tree is also cooler by a few notches from outside.Guru Gujjala said, ""The tree is respected and no picnics or gatherings are encouraged near it to keep the sanctity of the place intact. However, every year, at the end of summer, some pujas are held in the hope of good rainfall in the monsoons. The tree covers nearly an acre of land and looks like a forest. During Cyclone Hudhud, there were some damage to the branches but thankfully, the tree was not uprooted and stood tall."""

The food available here is way cheaper than that of SMS Hospital canteen. Add to that, the food is tasty and hygienic, Soni explained.People buy lunch brought from the Annapurna Rasoi van at SMS hospital, in Jaipur, Rajasthan. (Himanshu Vyas/Hindustan Times)Part of a government-initiative just a week old, the word has spread and long queues are already beginning to form in front of mobile kiosks at various spots of the state capital. Named Annapurna Rasois, the scheme offers breakfasts at 5 rupees and meals at 8 rupees a plate.The menu offered is simple and the staple includes Besan Gatta Pulao, among other items. The kiosks parked at different locations will offer ready to eat food in 12 cities of the state.But the rush has also meant some disappointment. I wanted to have the meal but couldnt get it as the van ran out of food, lamented Ramnarain Bairwa. He has to wait his turn.Tamil NaduAmma Canteens  or Amma Unavugam in Tamil  are the best known symbols of former chief minister J Jayalalithaas largesse. But for them, we would have all starved, said Prem Ravishankar, a labourer.Much of Chennai and the state were crippled by Cyclone Vardah last week, but the 400-odd canteens meant the poor did not go hungry. Here, you can eat like a king for five bucks, grinned Ravishankar, referring to the average cost of a lunch.Amma Canteens  or Amma Unavugam in Tamil  are the best known symbols of late former chief minister J Jayalalithaas largesse. (HT Photo)The menu is uncomplicated: idli and pongal for breakfast, three varieties of pre-mixed rice dishes for lunch, and chapattis served with daal for dinner. The chapattis come for 3 rupees each with free daal.The canteens launched in 2013, and costing around Rs 300 crores every year, are hugely popular.I walk 3 km every day to have my meals here. They are a lifesaver for people like us, said Priya S, a daily wage earner.A pioneering welfare scheme, many states are now trying to emulate the Amma Canteens. A delegation from Egypt visited the state in 2014 to study the model.OdishaOdias love their dalma  a watery mixture of lentil and boiled vegetables  and the Ahaar centres serving them piping hot with rice at just 5 rupees a plate have proven to be a big draw.Though meant for the poor, the 111 centres serving lunch in all 30 districts of the state have even white-collar employees lining up before them. The rice may be a bit coarse, but the food is tasty, said Biswajit Sahoo, a corporate executive in the town of Bhadrak, who takes off his tie each time he goes to buy a token for a meal.From Balasore in the north to Malkangiri in the south, the Ahaar centres are also fodder for renewed political mudslinging. The opposition calls them a cheap gimmick, a charge rejected by the BJD of chief minister Naveen Patnaik. Its our most popular scheme, said Priyadarshi Mishra, a ruling party MLA.Andhra PradeshNTR Anna Canteens are to Andhra Pradesh what Amma Canteens are to Tamil Nadu.Launched in June, Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu christened the scheme after ex-chief minister and his father-in-law, N T Rama Rao. But the presence of Anna (big brother in Telugu) in the name suggests he too is eyeing an Amma-like status for himself.NTR Anna Canteens are already feeding hundreds of government employees who have recently relocated from Hyderabad to the states new capital Amaravati. The quality is good, though the taste could have been better, said Krishnaveni, a secretariat employee.Read | Inspired by Amma, Naidu launches Anna NTR canteens in AndhraTelanganaMeals for 5 rupees are available at 50 kiosks in Hyderabad since 2014. At present, they feed to 15,000 people daily and the subsidy per plate works out to 15 rupees, said Hyderabad Mayor Bonthu Rammohan Rao.The meal of rice, sambar and pickle is frugal, but the dividend, apparently, rich. The ruling Telangana Rashtra Samithis convincing victory in the municipal polls earlier this year, when it won 100 of the 150 seats, is credited to the subsidised meal scheme. It is, therefore, not surprising that the government is planning to start 100 more canteens in the next year.Hyderabad residents with a Rs 5 meal, a scheme being implemented by Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation. (HT Photo)But government staff is not exactly complaining. Yet to be built, Amaravati is still a cluster of villages and the canteens offer them a change of taste and cheap food. Breakfasts cost five rupees while lunch prices vary from 6.50 to 7.50 rupees.Government subsidy per plate comes to 40 rupees. It is , however, going ahead with plans to set up 35 such canteens in Guntur, Visakhapatnam, Tirupati and Anantapur.JharkhandThough not as well known as Tamil Nadus Amma Canteens, Jharkhands Mukhyamantri Dal Bhat Yojana (chief ministers dal rice scheme) has by far been the oldest of soup kitchens run in the country.Former chief minister Arjun Munda started 370 centres in 2011 to feed the poor in the drought-hit state. They mostly closed down some years later for want of money, but the government relaunched them in January this year.The food is cheap plus less oily, said Sunita Kumari, a middle-aged woman savouring a meal at the centre near a prominent Ranchi hospital. Around 22.5 lakh people are being fed and the government spends Rs 25 crore annually.Madhya PradeshChief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan is planning to launch his own version of subsidised canteens next year. Chouhan said healthy meals would be sold for Rs 5 under what is to be called Deendayal Kitchens."

On this day 1,500 will fly out of the Kathmandu airport bound for jobs mostly in Malaysia, Qatar or Saudi Arabia  jobs that are urgently needed by the people of this desperately poor country.But on this day, too, six young men will come back in wooden caskets, rolled like suitcases out of baggage claim on luggage carts.On the wooden lid of one someone has written in black marker: Human Remains, Balkisun Mandal Khatwe, Male  26 years  Nepali.Saros husband  another victim of a hidden and escalating tragedy.A coffin, which brought home the body of a Nepali migrant worker from Saudi Arabia, lies on the ground after cremation rituals at Swayambhunath stupa in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)The number of Nepali workers going abroad has more than doubled since the country began promoting foreign labour in recent years -- from about 220,000 in 2008 to about 500,000 in 2015. Yet the number of deaths among those workers has risen much faster in the same period.One out of every 2,500 workers died in 2008 while last year, one out of every 500 died, according to an Associated Press analysis of data released by Nepals ministry of labour and employment.In total, over 5,000 workers from this small country have died working abroad since 2008 more than the number of US troops killed in the Iraq War.The causes, in many cases, have been mysterious. Natural death, heart attack or cardiac arrest are listed for nearly half the deaths. Most families are notified that their loved ones simply went to bed and never woke up. Thats exactly what Saro was told.But now medical researchers say these deaths fit a familiar pattern. Every decade or so, dozens, or even hundreds, of seemingly healthy Asian men working abroad in poor conditions start dying in their sleep. It happened in the US in the late 1970s, in Singapore about a decade later and more recently in China. The suspected killer even has a name: Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome.Read: In-flight beer a rare treat as Nepali migrant workers leave families for jobsNext year, an international consortium will be launched to investigate and hopefully, offer solutions.For todays arrivals, theyre too late.Extreme conditionsNepal exports iron and steel, carpets, some vegetables  but mainly, Nepal exports men. It even advertises them.Nepalese workers are well known for their hard work, dedication and loyalty, boasts the Nepalese embassy website in Doha, Qatar, where a pre-World Cup construction boom employs about 1.5 million migrants. The Nepali workers are comparatively cost effective, says the embassy, and they are experienced at working in extreme climatic conditions.The unskilled workers fill a host of global demands: building highways, stadiums and houses in Gulf states and guarding shopping malls, sewing sweatshirts and assembling televisions in Malaysia. Anyone who has bought imported sportswear or electronics, or who plans to go to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar, may be using the products of their labour.A Nepali migrant worker with his son before departing for Qatar at Tribhuwan International airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)Nepali law bans recruiters and employers from charging fees. Qatar, where Balkisun was working, prohibits the fees too. But in reality, everyone has to pay for these jobs. The men borrow at 36% interest rates from money lenders or sell off family land to get the $1,100 stake needed for recruiters, airline tickets and more.Conditions vary by country and employer, but it is not uncommon for workers to find themselves living a dozen or more to a room, sleeping stacked on three-tiered bunks, working 10 to 15 hours a day, seven days a week, for years.If they are lucky  and some are  they can send home wads of cash, about $300 a month. Often, however, they are tricked or cheated out of their earnings.About 10% of Nepals 28 million residents are working abroad. They send back more than $6 billion a year, amounting to about 30% of the countrys annual revenues. Only Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan are more dependent on foreign earnings.Some come back maimed or disabled, like Salit Mandal, who rolled off a third-level bunk in Malaysia and smashed in his skull. He is in debt, partially paralyzed and lives with his parents.I have no idea what I am going to do or how I am going to raise them, because I cant move, he says, gazing at his three children. If my hands and legs could move I would do something, but I cant do anything.His family had pinned their hopes on him after he returned from an earlier stint in Qatar with enough money to build a five-bedroom house. Now his mom takes a visitor aside and says the situation is horrible  Salit cant squat by himself over the pit toilet, she says, and she has to clean him up afterward.His little brother Jamun Mandal, 24, is next in line. He has abandoned his aspirations of going to college and has paid the recruiting broker. He holds up a passport.I know it sounds weird to be planning to go, because people die, disappear, they come back in comas, he says, But what to do?Sitting behind her tidy desk at the department of foreign employment, spokeswoman Rama Bhattarai shrugs off the death toll.Im not trying to be insensitive but we have sent millions of workers to more than 100 countries, and so yes, sometimes people will die. They die as foreign employees, they die here when a bus goes off a cliff, she says.Others are more incensedKrishna Dawadee, acting director of Kathmandus one-stop work permit center, waves an arm at the hundreds of young men gathered at the service window seeking final work approvals. Outside the gates, life insurance salesmen grab at the prospective workers arms and sweaters, trying to pull them into their offices to sell policies.These are our youth, draining out from our country, Dawadee says. I am very much worried about these people.Six weeks after Balkisun Mandal Khatwe made the long journey from his village to the employment office, his wife travels back across the country to retrieve his body.His casket arrives on a 7 pm flight.

(AP photo)Finding transport is less complicated: The casket slides easily into a custom-welded coffin rack. The government of Nepal arranged to have 10 trucks equipped after labour exports  and deaths abroad  began to rise.The badly rutted and cracked road from the Kathmandu airport to Belhi village is closed after dark because too many buses have plunged off the narrow, steep, sharp curves. But under starry skies, the truck was waved past checkpoints by the police who spotted the rooftop coffin while warming their hands over small fires. After death, Hindu funerals must take place as soon as possible, hopefully by the next dawn.Saro and her son, just 3 years old, jolt around the backseat for a precarious eight-hour journey. They jounce in their seats as the truck bottoms out in potholes, jerk side to side as it races around corners.When the truck reaches Belhi, hundreds of women in traditional saris, men in their work clothes and children pour into the narrow dirt street, tears streaming down their faces. Everyone pushes and shoves to get close to the coffin. Some stand on rooftops. Others crowd a balcony.Nepal is one of the poorest and least developed countries in the world, and Belhi is one of its poorest places. The Mandals live eight people to a room in one of about 700 mud-and-stick homes set among dry, sparse rice paddies. A shared cellphone is passed from house to house. People are chronically hungry, living on less than $1 a day.The Mandals and their neighbours are marginalised in every way. Ethnically, they are from the untouchable caste, and they speak Maithili -- a language more common in India, just a few miles south.No options leftFamily members wrestle Balkisuns coffin off the truck. Mohammed Tohit, 28, watches from across the street, then looks at his hands, the cloudless sky, a distant mango tree. He wipes a wet cheek.I knew this guy, and the thing is when you see people coming back in a coffin like this, it is hard, he says.He adds quietly: Im leaving for Saudi in 10 days.Tohit is the envy and inspiration of the village. He worked in Malaysia for almost six years sewing clothes for Nike, Lacoste and Columbia Sportswear, saving more than $20,000. That was enough to build a sturdy, cement two-bedroom house with plaster walls and a brick foundation. He bought a piece of farmland and a television set. Theres a cow staked outside his woven fence, among the goats and chickens.

I have no choice but to leave again.Balkisuns brother Ramasis, 35, went for work to Dubai but returned three months later with a debilitating mental illness. Bidhya Nanda, 25, the youngest, is still in the Gulf, working as a janitor in Saudi Arabia. Another brother, 30-year-old Ramkisun, flew back from Malaysia, where he was working in factories making Sony and Panasonic products, when he learned of Balkisuns death.Their father, Kalaru, hates to see his sons go, but has no option: We are poor and we dont have any way at all to earn money in our village. The news of his sons death came in a morning phone call two weeks earlier.Balkisun was working for Habtoor Leighton Group in Qatar, loading trucks to build new highways. The highway was being built as part of broader infrastructure improvements for the 2022 World Cup, said his supervisor Ganesh Khang Mandal.Dubai-based HLG did not respond to requests for an interview. Australia-based CIMIC, a 45% owner of HLG, said in a statement that it did not want to comment.Saro had chatted with Balkisun through Facebook Messenger just the evening before his death.Although he confided to friends he was having a difficult time with his job, money and housing, he told Saro that everything was going well. He took a selfie in his yellow work hardhat, eyes grinning through protective sunglasses, his face covered in a blue scarf to fend off the harsh climate. He told her about a big festival that day.OK, Ill call you tomorrow morning  the last words her husband said to her.A woman breaks down after seeing the body of her son Balkisun Mandal Khatwe, a migrant worker who died in his sleep in Qatar, at Belhi village in Saptari district, Nepal. (AP photo)This is what happened, according to his supervisor: After work he went to dinner at 7 and bed at 10. In the morning we tried to wake him up but he didnt respond. We took the body to the hospital where they did an autopsy and said it was cardiac arrest.He had been in Qatar less than a month.A similar patternAuthorities in Nepal say their citizens seem to die abroad more frequently than their equally vulnerable Sri Lankan, Bangladeshi and Indonesian co-workers, but the explanation for the increased mortality has been unclear.Its usually sleeping disease, said Kumud Khanal, vice president of the Nepal association of foreign employment agencies, which represents more than 400 registered agents. We get the report that he was talking with friends in the evening, had dinner and went to bed, and in the morning he was found dead. The deaths are reported as a hypertension problem, he said, like a heart attack or cardiac arrest.But medical experts say there have been waves of deaths before among young, rural southeast Asian men working abroad in physically stressful conditions.Nepali workers stand in queues at the departure gate for migrant workers at Tribhuwan International Airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. About 10% of Nepal's 28 million residents are working abroad. (AP photo)I see some familiar patterns here with Nepalese workers, said Patrick Clarkin at the University of Massachusetts, Boston, who has written about the biology and epidemiology of Sudden Unexplained Nocturnal Death Syndrome. I suspect that there would be little harm in improving the diets and living conditions of these young men. Something as simple as a multivitamin could go a long way and with little risk.In rural Nepal, people eat rice, lentils and seasonal greens around 10 in the morning, and a second meal of rice and vegetables in the evening. Milk and eggs are almost always available as well.Abroad, Nepali workers also eat twice a day, but the mainstay is whole meal flour flatbread with some pickle or a vegetable, and once a day they have chicken. Some in the Middle East say they drink less water at their desert worksites than they do in mountainous Nepal because, as Hindus, they are not allowed to use Muslim bathrooms and are forced to wait for hours.No one has identified a single cause of SUNDS fatalities  medical journal discussions include genetics, infection and nutritional deficiencies. And in Nepal, the syndrome is not being considered at this point. Instead, Nepali authorities say it could be stress, even homesickness, brought on by physically demanding jobs in extremely hot climates.Utah State University professor Ron Munger studied heart scans of migrant workers in Thailand after hundreds died in their sleep in Singapore, where they had gone for jobs. He said the Nepali deaths sound like exactly the same thing.While the causes of the previous strings of deaths have never been pinpointed, the number of fatalities dropped in each case when workplace safety, housing and diet were improved.A Nepali man , 23, takes a selfie while he waits for his flight to Malaysia, where he will work in a warehouse as a cleaner, at Tribhuwan International airport in Kathmandu, Nepal. (AP photo)It is tragic and terrible, and for me this is personal, said cardiac epidemiology researcher Nirmal Aryal, a Nepali native at University of Otago in Wellington, New Zealand.He recently published a Call for Public Health Action in the Asia-Pacific Journal of Public Health, demanding with colleagues in the United Kingdom and Nepal that universal labour laws be enforced and accurate mortality records kept. He is forming a consortium to investigate migrant deaths across borders. Its first focus, in 2017, will be on workers from Nepal.It is critical we find out what is happening, he said.Last ritesArriving in their village, Saro steps out of the truck, sees the coffin and falls screaming onto the dusty road. Two sisters scoop her up and carry her, howling, into the family home.In Hindu mythology, if you dont see the face of a loved one, you will not believe they have died.

Eventually, with help, she received $2,777 from the foreign employment promotion board.Saro Kumari Mandal gives her fingerprint to receive compensation from the foreign employment promotion board in Kathmandu, Nepal after her husband died as a migrant worker in Qatar.

590a1bdf7be9e033fa42f8e4,"Pay more to farmers, up pulses production",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/588472/pay-more-farmers-up-pulses.html,2016-12-26,"Pay more to farmers, up pulses productionBy Pandurang Hegde, Dec 27, 2016, 0:04 ISTThe 68th United Nations General Assembly declared 2016 as the International Year of Pulses (IYP) to heighten awareness of nutritional benefits, to better utilise of pulses-based proteins and to increase the global production of pulses. Being the biggest consumer of pulses in the world, India plays a dominant role as a producer and importer.The pulses are a common source of protein either as combination of common mans food in north India as dal and roti, or as sambar and rice in the south. India has a tradition of using diverse pulses in the food chain like lentils, chick pea and beans of different kinds.How far have we progressed in achieving the goals of IYP? What policies have been initiated during the year to increase the production and consumption of pulses?The history of pulses cultivation in South Asia dates back to 9500 BC, even pre-dates to the centres of origin in West Asia. Thus, its cultivation has evolved through the millennia in which the farmers have developed diverse pulse varieties.Despite the ancient roots, the status of pulses production has stagnated over the years as the food security policies concentrated on cereals that were to supply carbohydrates while the protein providing pulses were neglected.The neglect of pluses is shocking in comparison with the cereal production in the country. For the triennium ending 2013-14, production of rice increased by 225%, wheat by 808% but the pulses production went up only a meagre of 47%!As a result of this lopsided policy, the per capita availability of pulses has drastically declined from 69 grams per person per day in 1961 to 43 grams in 2013. The persistent deficit in demand and supply has not kept pace with cultivation. The failure to provide the poor mans protein has adverse consequences on the nutritional status of the people.The cultivation of pulses has the multiple benefits of increasing soil fertility and provision of protein security to address the issue of malnutrition.Pulses contain almost twice the amount of portents found in cereals like rice and wheat. It is complimentary food for infants and children that ensures adequate of proteins, minerals and vitamins.Women, who form part of the poorer sections of society, can benefit a great deal by consuming pulses combining them with vitamin C. This results in absorption of high rates or iron that is essential at the reproductive age.Cultivation of pulses as a rotation crop after cereals provides opportunities for converting atmospheric nitrogen into nitrogen compounds that can be used by plants and improve soil fertility. This develops high resilience to diseases and builds the agro ecosystems.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), pulses promote higher rates of accumulation of soil carbon and they can contribute to improving the carbon sequestration.Growing pulses also reduces the use of synthetic fertilisers that help in mitigating climate change. It does not emit greenhouse gas in the process of cultivation.Pulses can be grown in diverse agricultural production systems like crop rotation, intercropping and ground cover. In most dry zones in India, pulses are part of multiple cropping systems that enrich soil fertility and provide food and nutritional security for human beings as well as livestock. The leftover of pulses is used as fodder after processing the final produce.Over the past three decades, our policy makers have been chanting the mantra of increasing pulses production. However, the failure in its implementation has led to a severe crisis in the supply of pulses.Domestic demandIt is estimated that the domestic demand for pulses will rise to 31 million tonnes by 2020 whereas the production is below 20 million tonnes (pulses production in 2013-14 was 19.8 mt which came in 2014-15 to 17.3 mt; imports increased from 3.5 mt to 4.64 mt during this period). Obviously, we do not want to pay higher prices for the farmer who is capable of growing pulses to meet the ever increasing demand.Our policy makers allow dumping of cheap imports which only helps the agri business. This year, the farmers are expecting bumper crop of pulses, but the prices have crashed below the minimum support price.Recently, the Indian government requested the BRIC countries (Brazil, Russia, South Africa and China) to cultivate pulses and ship it to India. Prime Minister Narendra Modi signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Mozambique to purchase pulses at an assured rate.It is ironical that our rulers do not want to pay farmers in India, but are assuring to purchase form these distant continents that adds to environment costs due to the increased food miles of shipping.The case study of Australia is illuminating as India gave 400 grams of pulse seed in 1970 and in 2000, it exported 9 million tonnes to India! If a country that has no culture of growing pulse can produce such record quantity, why cant we do it?"

Many of the ambitious schemes launched to enhance crop production are unlikely to meet the target. Going by the current situation, the outlook is dismal, said Minister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar.Palakkad worst hitThe worst damage has been reported from Palakkad where farmers lost crops in 7,027 hectares, followed by Thiruvananthapuram (4,714 hectares).Paddy crops in 13,170 hectares have withered away, while vegetable farmers have lost crops in 3,167 hectares. More than 5,65,000 banana plants and 76,000 coconut palms have been affected, according to the report.Most of the irrigation dams in Kerala are already down to 50 per cent of their storage capacity.Saline intrusionSaline intrusion is posing a problem in many areas. Many agriculture experts have pointed out that the poor maintenance of irrigation canals in many places has aggravated the situation.The government meanwhile has initiated a series of measures aimed at drought mitigation.A six-month moratorium has been declared on farm loans and steps have been taken to issue compensation for crop loss. A series of meetings has been convened at the constituency and district level to assess the drought situation and its impact on drinking water availability and the agriculture sector, Mr. Sunil Kumar said.The mitigation measures will focus on the protection of water sources, soil conservation, a shift to drought-resistant varieties of paddy, and promotion of non-irrigated crops like millets, pulses and lentils.Mitigation measures include shift to drought-resistant paddy and promotion of non-irrigated crops."

In my family  as well as in others, I suspect there is serious discussion relating to food as well. Over one such session, we discussed what we did when we got ravenous and the pantry was devoid of snacks.While one cousin was quite unabashed about unleashing her appetite on white bread spread liberally with salted butter and mixed fruit jam, another spoke of downing half a tin of condensed milk with cream crackers or bread. Many of us inare also very partial to milk powder and baby cereal! One sister carried it in her trouser pocket while travelling.For me, on a slightly chilly December evening, nothing beats a hot beverage and a warm spicy snack. My sister-in-law echoed my thoughts when she spoke about conquering hunger pangs at 4.00 p.m. with a slice of bread toasted on the tava and spread with a thick layer of home-made coriander thokku. Apparently she and my mother rustle this up whenever they are hungry. She said that it hit the spot and was just so delicious.While growing up, a slice of bread and the coriander thokku in question was mums favourite tea time indulgence and often our weekend one. The olive green chutney was spread on thick slices of bread and placed on a hot pan to which was added a drizzle of home-made ghee. The wet chutney sizzled and got a crunchy coating from the ghee. It was flipped over deftly a few times so that it did not burn or stick to the pan and then served. Ive forgotten how many times my mother and I have eaten this through my growing up years.Theres another reason why this chutney is special. My mother tells me stories of how, when she was at hostel and craving home-made food, she often received parcels from home that always had a a bottle of this coriander chutney. She says it was a lifesaver for her and her roomies.When I first started experimenting with the coriander chutney, I made a simpler (read healthier) version. I used lemon, lentils and other things as substitute for the traditional chutney, which I thought was far too oily. Naturally, my efforts didnt hit the mark. I had no choice but to turn to grand-aunt Sarojini who makes the most delicious kothumalli thokku.She taught me well and I realised that by following the right technique, the cold-pressed oil used acted more as a preservative than a cooking medium. Now, when I follow her instructions precisely Im rewarded with a bottle of intensely aromatic tangy spicy thokku. I never forget to set aside a bottle of it for my mother.For authentic home-made coriander thokku, Alamelu ammayi retails at 10, Biryani Mandi. Call 0422-2233444"
