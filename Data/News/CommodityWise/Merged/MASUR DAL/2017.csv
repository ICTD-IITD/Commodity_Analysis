Sunil Kumar being presented with a sapling, instead of a bouquet, as he arrives to open a farmers meet at Koottalida on Monday.HAND OUTMinister for Agriculture V.S. Sunil Kumar has said that the decline in agriculture combined with climate change is edging the State towards a crisis.Opening Urvaram- 2017, a three-day district-level farmers meet at Koottalida here on Monday, he said an agriculture action force would be formed in 500 panchayats with a State-level nodal officer to monitor them.Kerala required 40 lakh tonnes of rice a year, but the State produces only 5.5 lakh tonnes. The production of fruits, vegetables and lentils too is low, he said.Mr. Sunil Kumar blamed those who filled paddy fields and wetlands for their selfish needs. The arrogance of the people in Kerala that they could buy anything if they had money was the reason for the Malayali society turning into an unhealthy one so fast, he said.The Minister said the State government was making a data bank of barren lands in each panchayat to promote farming. Agriculture has to become a profitable enterprise. The government is doing whatever is possible to ensure best prices for the farmers, he said.Coconut processing unitThe Minister said the State government was planning to set up a coconut processing unit in Kozhikode district very soon with active participation of farmers cooperative societies.He urged the officials of the department to work towards making the Haritha Keralam project a successPurushan Kadalundi, MLA, presided over the meeting while Transport Minister A.K.

This was one of the hot topics discussed by experts on the sidelines of the Indian Science Congress as practitioners of traditional medicine rolled out a list of fruits, vegetables and herbs that will help people to age healthily and live longer by avoiding geriatrics woes.The 'dieto-therapy' is quite simple and easy to follow. It comprises a mix of fresh and dry fruits, root and leafy vegetables and honey and milk. At regular intervals one should consume certain herbs to prevent the onset of senility and trigger healthy ageing.According to a publication of the Central Council for Research in Unani Medicine, a healthy and nutritious diet in limited quantities will not only remove `wastes' from the body but also protects it from `hazardous extrinsic factors'.The do's list for longevity includes honey, milk, rice, dates, figs, walnut, almonds, grapes, mulberries, raisins and plum. For non-vegetarians a little quantity of chicken or go at meat will give the much needed protein. The recommended vegetables include garlic, onion, lettuce, beetroot, ginger, common mallow, gooseberry and chicory.One should avoid excessive consumption of tea and coffee. One should also avoid drinking water during and just after meals. Avoid bathing immediately after a meal. `Latedigesting' foods like dried and salted meat and lentils should be kept away from the menu.""A well balanced and healthy diet will not only give a disease-free life but also prevent a number of problems related to old age and ageing,"" said Dr Abdul Azeem."

An early morning dip in the pond followed by Thiruvathirakali (dance performance) are the other components of the festival.The traditional Thiruvathira Puzhukku made of tubers and green bananas are rare these days, as the ingredients are rarely available, especially in cities.

Of the three, the area coverage of wheat and winter maize has crossed all expectations.Wheat coverage in the state has been 93% of the target area, winter maize 101% and barley 65%, as per a report sent by the state government to the Union agriculture and farmer welfare ministry on January 5. The interesting aspect is that the farmers are adopting such crops which are yielding more monetary returns in the market, said agriculture department officials.Interestingly, rabi sowing season starts from November 15 and lasts till December 15. The note ban imposed on November 8 started showing its immediate impact from the very next day. ""We collect reports from the fields daily. Farmers continued to sow seeds of rabi crops till recently, because the land was still wet in some districts due to floods last year,"" said an agriculture department official.The drive to reap good harvests and matching monetary returns on sale also influenced the sowing of pulses. As an indicator, the overall area coverage of all the varieties of pulses during this rabi season has been 88% of the target.However, in the pulses category, the coverage of the 'chana' (gram) variety is 1.03 lakh hectares against the target of 1.15 lakh hectares. Incidentally, the area coverage by gram this season has been 359 hectares more than the last year. The increase is small, but experts feel that the drive for gram cultivation has picked up, because the market rate of its purchase and sale has increased, which has also jacked up the prices of its derivatives , like pulse proper and 'sattu' (grinded gram).In tune with the same, the coverage of the 'masur' variety of pulse is 2.10 lakh hectares against the target area of 2.20 lakh hectares - a fall of 2,286 hectares from the last year. The area coverage of peas is 31,853 hectares against the target of 35,000 hectares - a fall by 686 hectares. On the other hand, the coverage of other varieties of pulse like 'arhar' is 1.10 lakh hectares against the target of 1.45 lakh hectares.Among oilseeds, the total area coverage has been 90% of the target area - or 1.63 lakh hectares against the target of 1.82 lakh hectares. Incidentally, sowing of oilseeds last year was 1.61 lakh hectares."

The plea by an ex-serviceman, which is likely to be heard this week, has sought direction to the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) to submit a status report with respect to all paramilitary forces in India over allegations of the BSF jawan in his video, which went viral on social media on January 9.Petitioner Puran Chand Arya, in a public interest litigation (PIL) filed through advocate Abhishek Kumar Choudhary, sought direction to MHA and five paramilitary forces to classify what is the scenario of ration procuring and food preparing and serving food to all categories of ranks. The plea further sought directions to take serious action against the officers or authorities concerned into the incident so that the morale of the personnel and citizens is not affected.BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav had used his cell phone and social media to complain about the poor quality of ration. In the video(s) posted on Facebook which have since received over 10 lakh views, Yadav shows the meal box claiming that a watery soup-like dal, with turmeric, salt and without lentils, and burnt chapatti had been served. A tumbler of tea and an open tiffin case is shown in the background.The plea, claiming it has been filed for the benefit of the public to assert their fundamental rights conferred in the Constitutions Article 14 (equality before law) and Article 21 (right to life), urged the court that the authorities should not take any adverse action against the BSF jawan who has rung the bell for a genuine demand for food to survive. It also sought direction to depute the higher officers to supervise cooking of proper healthy food and its distribution.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Rich aroma of Aresalu is wafting into the streets. Bylanes are reverberating with the singing of Haridasus and kites of various desgins are soaring high in the sky.The enitre State is ready for the celebration of rich Telugu culture and traditions. It is Sankranti.Why it is celebrated?Makar Sankranti has a uniqueness to itself. Unlike other Hindu festivals which follow the lunar calendar, Makar Sankranti is probably among the very few festivals that is observed as per the solar calendar.This makes it the only festival to fall on a fixed date every year - January 14.The mode of celebrations has an agararian overtone and in Andhra Pradesh, being a major agrarian economy, it is arguably called the mother of all festivals. The harvest festival is celebrated for four days in Andhra Pradesh.Women playing kolatam during Sankranti celebrationsat A Convention Centre in Vijayawada on Friday | ExpressDay 1 - BhogiThe festival starts with the Bhogi, a day preceding Sankranti. People shed old and derelict things and welcome the new symbolising transformation.Before the day break, bonfires (Bhogi Mantalu) are lighted with logs of wood, other solid fuels and wooden furniture that are no longer in use.It stands for realisation, transformation and purification of the self by a change for the better.Day-2 Makar SankrantiOn Makar Sankranti, the second day of the festival, people wear new clothes, offer prayers to God, and make offerings of traditional food to ancestors who have died. Beautiful and ornate drawings and patterns are drawn on the ground with chalk or flour (Rangoli or Muggulu) in front of houses and these drawings are decorated with flowers, colours and small, hand-pressed piles of cow dung, called Gobbemmalu.Day-3 KanumaOn the third day, Kanuma is celebrated. Kanuma is very dear to the farmer community as it is the day on which they showcase their gratitude to cattle which are the symbolic indication of prosperity.The animals are given a bath and adorned with ornaments. Girls feed animals, birds and fish as a symbol of sharing.To ensure the happy gathering of the family members, any travel on this day is considered inappropriate.Day-4 MukkanumaThe fourth day is called Mukkanuma which is popular among the non-vegetarians. On this day, farmers offer prayers to the natural elements like soil, rain and fire for blessing them with good harvest. People in Coastal Andhra do not eat any meat (or fish) during the first three days of the festival and do so only on the day of Mukkanuma and the day following Mukkanuma call for celebrations with union of families, friends, relatives followed by fun activities, which include cockfights, bullock race and kite flying.The young damsels come together and put forward cute little dolls coupled with other things and narrate a scenario. Although this tradition of Bommala Koluvu is slowly fading, people of all ages love to see the display as friends and relatives are invited to have a look. In the olden days, local handicrafts like Kondapalli and Etikoppaka toys and dolls were showcased but now collection of handicrafts across the country are being displayed.HaridasusDressed in an attire unique to the art form, with an Akshaya Patra on the head, a Tambura, and Chidatalu, the Haridasu is the one who ushers in the festive spirit associated with Sankranti. Haridasu goes from house to house and ask for bhiksha. Haridasu says Krishnarpanam when he receives offerings from people.Lip-smacking delicaciesFor this festival, most of the families prepare Chakinalu, Nuvvula Appalu, Gare Appalu, Madugulu (Jantikalu), Bellam Appalu, Kudumulu, Ariselu and Dappalam (a dish made with pumpkin and other vegetables) to make an offering to God. The sweet delicacies include a sweet porridge like dish known as Chakkara Pongal which is made with rice, jaggery and mung lentils, flavoured with cardamoms and dry fruits. Symbolic of joy and festivity, Poornam Boorelu is the most popular sweet prepared in the homes of Andhrites.CockfightsCockfight is a tradition that has been followed by the people. It is a bloodsport between two roosters held in a ring called cockpit. It is the favourite sport of people living in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh.The fights are organised in sprawling fields with thousands watching. Three or four inch blades are attached to the cocks legs. Knockout fights to the death are widely practiced in the State.Different celebrations of Sankranti across IndiaIndia is known for Unity in Diversity and at the same time India is known as the Land of Festivals.

58f9c04da3d24b0b70c420c6,A wake-up call,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/A-wake-up-call/article17052654.ece,2017-01-18,"A flurry of videos has emerged in the social media in recent days showing jawans of both the paramilitary forces and the Army complaining against a host of issues from diet to colonial-era practices. While these are disciplinary breaches, they are a good reason to initiate a detailed study into the internal health of our security establishment. The present lot of videos began early last week when BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav posted a series of them complaining about burnt parathas and watery lentil curry served along the Line of Control. It was almost as if he was opening the floodgates. From the Army, Lance Naik Yagya Pratap Singh of 42 Infantry Brigade expressed his grievances against the sahayak system. He alleged that professional soldiers were being forced to wash clothes, polish boots and walk dogs for senior officers, and that he was being victimised with court martial proceedings for complaining against the practice. Nursing Assistant Naik Ram Bhagat of the Army complained in another video about their rations, that they were only getting about 40 per cent of the menu items allotted. He also complained about the buddy system in the Army, in which soldiers are deputed to be with officers and end up doing their personal chores. Yet another video of an Army jawan showed him singing about the difficulties they face and discrimination by officers. He spoke about leave being denied for 10 months, poor food and other issues.The videos quickly grabbed national attention. From the Prime Ministers Office to the Army chief, the senior leadership has been quick to respond. Both the PMO and Home Minister Rajnath Singh sought an immediate report from the paramilitary forces, while Chief of the Army Staff General Bipin Rawat ordered the provision of grievance and redress boxes. However, many of the responses, especially from the middle- and senior-rung leadership of the Army and the paramilitary forces, spelt almost outright denial. Without doubt the videos are serious disciplinary breaches, and they must be viewed keeping in mind the possibilities of such rampant access and use of social media ending up assisting the enemy. The resort to social media to air grievances could compromise national security, especially when the forces are in sensitive locations. But that should not take the attention away from the larger malaise reflected in them, and it is in tackling them that the senior leadership, both in the executive and the security establishment, must spend time now. The videos are a wake-up call."

Prices of tur and urad dals have also reduced, making not only the common man happy, but also restaurants and bulk food suppliers.The fall in prices is the result of large-scale import of pulses as explained by data shared by the India Pulses and Grain Association (IPGA). It shows that there has been an overall increase of 30% over the same period in 2015.Critically, the import of tur dal has risen by nearly three times from 2015 to 2016, which has ensured adequate supply of the variety in the market, thus helping to stabilise both wholesale and retail prices despite muted domestic production last year.The total importing of masur and moong dals was much lower in 2016 compared to the previous year, primarily because of a good domestic harvest and thus higher domestic stock. This also indicates imports are in line with the demand on ground.Statistics also reveal a significant jump in the import of yellow peas over 60%.According to IPGA officials, this increase is mainly because yellow peas are a cheaper yet equally nutritious substitute for more expensive varieties. ""If this trend continues, seasonal dal crisis may be a thing of the past as people seamlessly move to other dal options when one is in short supply,"" an official said.Wholesale traders said they don't foresee any demand-supply gaps this year.Kavish Dugad, a wholesaler operating in Market Yard, said, ""Not only are imports sizeable but the domestic crop too has almost doubled. We are also expecting more and a better crop of chana dal to hit the market soon.""Retailers estimate that the prices would fall further. P L Ojha of Shivaji Provision Store on Sus Road, said, ""Supply is more than sufficient in Market Yard, from where we buy our stock. Of course, as per the rule, we are buying at a little more than the minimum support price (MSP) to benefit farmers. Customers are happy and back to buying pulses in bulk. Prices of other commodities like poha and soyabean have also dropped significantly.""Customers like Aditi Mishra are elated. Mishra said, ""Monthly grocery expenses have now dropped significantly. While we did not really change our eating habits too much when the prices were sky-high, this respite in prices is welcome and gives us a margin to reorganize our expenditure."""

Last year, it was sold at Rs 170 per kg in wholesale and crossed even Rs 200 mark in retail.At grocery shop, it varies from Rs 65 to Rs 85 a kg, said Motiram Wadhwani , a wholesaler in at Hanumanganj grain market.Urad dal has gone down to Rs 75 to Rs 80 in wholesale market, which was sold at Rs 160 a kg. The price in retail market goes up from Rs 5 to Rs 10 per kg depending on variety of the pulse. Similarly, price of masoor has also gone down from Rs 80 a kg at wholesaler to Rs 55 to Rs 60.Good harvest has led to decline in prices of major pulses, Wadhwani said. After unprecedented increase in tuar rate last year, farmers covered more area under cultivation of pulses.In Madhya Pradesh, pulses cultivation went up by 50% from 4 lakh hectares to 6 lakh hectares last year.Agriculture department sources said, ""Area of cultivation of long duration tuar went up as many farmers opted for tuar instead of soyabean.""""Many farmers preferred pulses like urad, moong and even maize over soya in last kharif season. A good output has resulted into decline in prices,"" sources said. In fact, price of most vegetables mellowed and have come down much these days.Vegetables, including potato, onions, tomatoes and all green vegetables are being sold at low price because of good production."

The 74-year Meenakshi, Indias oldest woman Kalaripayattu exponent, said the honour was quite unexpected. I was surprised when the officers passed the news, she said. My family and students are happy to hear the news.They have already begun to celebrate, she added. Meenakshi started learning Kalaripayattu from the age of six under Raghavan Master for 10 years and at the age of 17 she married him. After marriage, she joined the Kadathanadan Kalari Sangam at Vadakara, which was started by her husband in 1949 as a teacher. The sangam has been imparting free training to Kalaripayattu enthusiasts since then. Now, around 150 students are learning the martial art at the sangam. We receive only gurudakshina (offering for teacher at the completion of training) from the students,she told Express. Nowadays, apart from teaching, I practise prior to performances, she said.K J Yesudas, Padma VibhushanKeralas celestial singer K J Yesudas has recorded over 50,000 songs in a number of Indian and foreign languages. He was honoured with Padma Shri in 1975 and Padma Bhushan in 2002. He won the national award for best male playback singer seven times and state awards 43 times - by the governments of Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal. Yesudas was born to the late couple Augustine Joseph and Elizabeth Joseph in 1940. His father was a well-known Malayalam classical musician and actor. His first film song was Attention penne attention which he sung with Santha P Nair. On special occasions, the musician renders his first song Jaathi bhedam matha dwesham, the famous lyrics of social reformer Sree Narayana Guru. Yesudas is the youngest person to head the Kerala Sangeetha Nataka Akademi in 1970.Nonagenarian Akkitham Achuthan Namboothiri could not initially believe that he was named a recipient of Padma Shri, Indias fourth highest civilian award. I now feel it was God that made it possible. All awards, whether small or big, give me immense happiness. If the younger generation works hard, accolades will surely come their way, said the Malayalam poet, popularly known as Akkitham. Although Union Government officials from New Delhi relayed the news to his family in the morning itself, it was only by 5.20pm that an official announcement was made.Born on March 18, 1926, Akkitham has written around 50 books and has several poems, short stories and essays to his credit. One of his prominent works is Dharmasooryan based on the life and works of Gandhiji. His anthologies include Idinja Polinja Lokam, Oru Kulla Munthirinja and Oru Kudunna Nilavu.He worked as an activist of Yogakshema Sabha to reform the Namboothiri community and also with V T Bhattathiripaad against the ill practices in the society. A recipient of Kendra Sahithya Academy award, Odakuzhal award, Ashan award, Vallathol award and Jnanapana awards, he has served as vice-president of Kerala Sahitya academy and Changampuzha Memorial Academy and as director of Kottayam Sahithya Pravarthaka Sahakarna Sangham.Akkitham, Padma ShriChemancheri Kunhiraman Nair, Padma ShriThough the national recognition has come a little late to Chemancheri Kunhiraman Nair, the 103-year-old Kathakali maestro seemed overwhelmed with joy on Wednesday. I am honoured. I am grateful for this acknowledgement. Its equally a recognition to the field of dance and Keralas own art form Kathakali, the elated maestro said. People from all walks of life flocked into his house at Chemancheri near Koyilandy to congratulate him after the declaration of Padma Shri awardees of the year.At the age of 15, Chemancheri left home to join a Kathakali troupe run by Guru Karunakara Menon. Later, he founded Bharatiya Natyakalalayam in 1945, the first school of dance in North Kerala. Determined to revive the dying art from, he opened several other dance schools down the line. In 1983, he established Cheliya Kathakali Vidyalayam in his native Cheliya village, about 30 km from Kozhikode. Even at 103, Chemancheri is full of energy and has a unassailable zest towards the classical art form.P R Sreejesh, Padma ShriWednesday turned out to be a day to remember for national hockey team skipper P R Sreejesh, 30. For, he became the first male sportsperson from Kerala to be bestowed with Padma Shri, Indias fourth highest civilian honour, and was also nominated in the Goalkeeper of the Year category of the International Hockey Federations (FIH) annual award. In 2016, Sreejesh - who is now playing for Uttar Pradesh Wizard in the Hockey India League - led the country to the quarterfinals of the Rio Olympics and helped it bag a silver medal in the Champions Trophy.He was also part of the team that overcame Pakistan 3-2 in the final to lift the Asian Champions Trophy in October. Anju Bobby George, who, along with K M Beenamol, received the honour in 2004, congratulated the Indian goalkeeper and said, It is a proud moment not just for Kerala, but for the entire country. Over a decade passed since a Kerala sportsperson won the award. It will boost the state and inspire our youngsters. As for Sreejesh, the honour will help him perform even better and achieve greater things for the country. Previous Padma Shri awardees from Kerala include M D Valsamma (1983), P T Usha (1985) and Shiny Wilson (1998).Carnatic musician Parassala B Ponnammal on Wednesday expressed her happiness at being selected for the Padma Shri award. I was resting when the call came from Delhi. By then, TV channels too began showing the news, seated at her home in Valiyasala, she said. Its all due to the blessings of Sree Padmanabha Swami, Chembai and Semmangudi, she said. She recalled how she had started her musical journey 76 years ago. I was part of the first batch at the Swathi Thirunal College of Music.And I got a teaching job before I was 18, she said. After the news of her selection broke out on Wednesday, friends, relatives, political leaders and the media thronged the residence, where she lives with her elder son Mahadevan and family. Ponnammal, born in 1924, has several firsts to her name; the first girl to study music in a professional institute, the first woman faculty of the Swathi Thirunal College of Music and the first woman head of the RLV Music College in Tripunithura (she joined in 1952 and retired in 1980), among others."

(Clockwise from top): Karuppu, a prized bull in the jallikattu circuit, takes on two young men; a memorial for a temple bull; M. Muniyandi, an agricultural labourer, with his Pulikulam.Photos: Shaju JohnThe setting sun and fading natural light probably hurried P. Karthikeyan; while trying to get Karuppu to pose for photographs, he found himself too close to the bull with no one to hold the nose rope. For once, Karuppu did not grunt a warning. His left foreleg bent, aiming horns at Karthikeyans belly. As he thrust himself at his owner, Karuppus horns came up in a clockwise arc. Karthikeyan ignored all his what-to-dos about avoiding being gored: he did not hit the dirt back-first and roll away. All he managed was a yelp, a quicker response than Karuppus that left the unsuccessful bull yanking at the taut rope tied to a stump, and a nervous laugh. Three years of no jallikattu and it seems I have forgotten how to control him, he says.It is a startling admission of memory erosion made by a man whose family has always had bulls, less than 15 km from the bull-taming sports most famous venue. Ever since the Supreme Court-imposed ban on jallikattu in 2014, Karthikeyan  a resident of Pudhupatti, which lies in between Alanganallur and his farm in Chellana Goundanpatti  has hired someone to take over the supervision of his four bulls, all indigenous breeds.Even as he doubted his abilities ahead of a delayed jallikattu season, Karthikeyan will not hear of questions about the bulls memory: He will remember once I apply the pottu (vermillion mark) and sandalwood paste on his forehead on the morning of the jallikattu. He refuses to eat after that.As jallikattu returns to Alanganallur shortly, the story of the bull  that commands respect, even devotion, from the fear it evokes  is also the story of humans who spend years loving it.Dry runs before D-DayKaruppu, a pulikulam breed, snorts when anyone except his handler approaches. He lets his body jerk violently with each snort, his tail hangs away from the body and he goes broadside. Raja hangs even further back from his 15-odd friends. He got me once about a month back, he says, raising his shirt to show a scar on his left lower abdomen. I was drunk. He was tied anyway and I thought I could hug him, he smiles sheepishly.It is daybreak on January 24, a day after police lathi charge and stone-pelting in Alanganallur. Fearing arrest, these boys from Pudhupatti had stayed overnight at Karthikeyans fields. Since the police were after them, no one gave surnames. Once morning tea was done, they decided to warm up for jallikattu.The boys fan into a semi-circle, eyeing the seemai karuvelam sapling to which Karuppu was tied. Ravi approaches the bull. Karuppu begins a brisk walk and breaks into a run. The boy, aged 18, retreats and Karuppu finds himself yanking at the rope. He then goes anticlockwise towards the others, sending them scampering. At this point, Karuppu stops, considers the boys and runs away as far as the rope would let him, to the other side. Karthikeyan sports a frown immediately. Karuppu has never been one to let go the opportunity to flip a human. In jallikattu parlance, he is a suttru maadu  instead of galloping to the finishing (collection) point like the pokku maadu , he dares his suitors to come at him.The more the boys try to approach, the more Karuppu tries to flee. At the end of one such dash, the seemai karuvelam sapling comes off, roots and all. Karuppu does not turn around. He stops about a hundred metres away and begins horning the ground, covering himself with dirt. Bulls that can do this make it difficult for us to escape by rolling on the ground. Some owners train them with a straw dummy. Some bulls get so good, they can target even a lemon kept on the ground, says a breathless boy. I think it is because of the nose rope. It is probably chafing at a wound he sustained recently, says Karthikeyan, now concerned. He asks the boys to back off and secures the animal, constantly conversing with it through grunts. Later, he feeds him a guava from the hand; one way to get reacquainted.From an embrace to chaseWe are very strict with rules these days. The bulls as well as the tamers have to undergo testing on the day before as well as the morning of the event, says Dr. Meril Raj, Veterinary Assistant Surgeon at the Government Veterinary Dispensary, Alanganallur. Among other things, both are checked for alcohol consumption, injuries and age; bulls should be between three and seven years old, tamers should at least be 18 years. I was once rejected at Alanganallur for being only 47 kg. They said I had to be at least 50 kg, says Sekar, a resident of the same village.There are some things that do not get rejected, though. Sometimes, owners spread ground glass on the bulls body and we wipe it off. We also make sure that sharpened horns are blunted, says a government official who has been part of four jallikattu preparations at Alanganallur for four years. Decorations  even vermillion and sandalwood paste  on the bull are not allowed anymore; tamers are required to wear organising committee-supplied uniforms.Bull owners and tamers are unequivocal in declaring that they do not harm the animals. The government official is sympathetic: You should see the care they show these animals. They are always wiping their face with a towel ahead of releasing them, as if the bulls are being readied for a ramp walk. According to him, pre-event injuries to the bull take place within the vaadivaasal (arena). Owners are given only 90 seconds to release the bull. Sometimes, when the bull sees so many people at once, it panics and refuses to leave. The owner gets desperate  his pride is at stake  and he prods it violently to get it to run.It may not merely be pride alone anymore. From a piece of cloth tied to the bull, prizes have grown to include consumer durables, gold coins, and now, cash. When they believe their bull is invincible, owners announce cash prizes of up to Rs. 10,000 on their own for those who tame their animal.The sport has changed along with the world it inhabits. From eru thazhvuthal , meaning embracing the bull, it became manju virattu , which means chasing an agitated bull. Jallikattu derives its name from the prize: a bundle of coins that would be tied to the bulls horns.Return of the indigenousLegislating jallikattu freezes it in time and risks subsuming the village-level variations of the game. The Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 2017 allows for manju virattu, vadamadu and eruthu vidum vizha . There used to be 200 jallikattu events during the best years for the sport. It came down to less than 25 before the [2014] ban. Right now, we dont mind the new rules as long as jallikattu returns, says Siva of Alanganallur. Why do you think we did not protest when ram-fighting, cock-fighting and rekla races were banned in the State? he adds, pausing for effect. This. Breeding. Jallikattu is the only way to save our indigenous breeds.With the government aggressively promoting the Jersey breed in these parts, farmers see breeding and jallikattu as the only reasons to have an uncastrated bull in a village. It has not helped farmers that the jallikattu ban coincided with five poor years for agriculture, with the current season being the worst in 20 years. Seemai karuvelams are invading lands left unploughed.I am unable to cultivate six of my 11 acres this year due to drought. I have managed only 12 bundles of harvested paddy from 1.5 acres; I should have got 40 from just one acre, says Karthikeyan. He has cut back on the area in which he has planted sugar cane and has instead pinned his hope on guava trees, which are ripe for harvesting for the first time.Karuppu stays and grazes in the open field, except for when it rains. Twice each day, he is given rice husk powder in water. A month ahead of jallikattu, Karthikeyan starts feeding him cotton seed in water in the evenings  some owners add chopped coconut. A flour of rice, ragi, green lentils, husk and sorghum, mixed in water, is sometimes given ahead of the cotton seed feed. Karuppus swimming  to help with his leap  also increases in frequency as jallikattu approaches; the ongoing drought means there is no water enough for a swim now.As far as farmers are concerned, the trouble with indigenous breeds is that they produce much less milk than Jersey cows. So, if the former gives you six litres a day, the latter manages 15 litres, says Dr. Raj. Thanks to higher fat content, milk from the indigenous breeds is paid Rs. 10 more per litre by procuring agencies and stands at Rs. 32. Farmers say the dung from indigenous breeds makes for good fertilizer. One animal can give me enough dung to take care of two acres. The Jerseys dung is unusable, says Karthikeyan.During the years in which jallikattu was not held, many farmers sold their bulls and villages donated theirs to goshalas (cow shelters). Ahead of jallikattu, bulls are making a return. I was in Tiruchi today to buy a bull for a friend. They wanted one lakh rupees for a five-year-old bull that would have otherwise cost Rs. 30,000. We didnt buy, says Karthikeyan. He attributes it to a demand-supply mismatch.A sacred bond, a spectacleSome soldiered on during the ban years. Karthikeyans uncle M. Muniyandi is an agricultural labourer now, having sold all his land to marry off two of his three daughters. Yet, Muniyandi has a Pulikulam, tied to the side of the road in front of his house. The bull, eight months old when bought, is six years old now. The 65-year-old owner emerges from his house with the trophy the bull won at Palamedu  he walked away with a milk cooker that day. At a jallikattu in Dindigul once, Muniyandis bull won a tiffin box and a packet of 10 jallikattu T-shirts.There is resolve in his answer when Muniyandi is asked how difficult it is to maintain a jallikattu bull: He is my son. He is brother to my three daughters. I talk to him like I would talk to a young boy and he responds.Jallikattu arenas are no places for bull whisperers, though. It is not even taming the bull. You hold on to the hump. Not too tight, because the bull then controls you. Not too loose, because youre then thrown off, says R. Kannan of Palamedu, who participates in jallikattu regularly. Winners are required to hold on to the bull for less than 20 metres.Like good guard dogs, bulls like Karuppu live in isolation. So does the bull tamer, a good fortnight ahead of jallikattu. Groups of boys go to the village temple and tie a yellow cloth, with a piece of turmeric wrapped within, on their right wrists. From then on, its like putting on the maala (garland) for [the] Sabarimala [pilgrimage], says P. Balasubramanian of Managiri village who used to participate in jallikattu.Like Karthikeyan, who too was a tamer, Balasubramanian stopped putting himself in harms way after getting married. In some cases, the whole point of participation is marriage itself. Pointing to a woman in Palamedu, Kannan says, When her husband was courting her, she said she would marry him only if he won at jallikattu.It turns out in the minds of the bull tamers, jallikattu is a team game. I always warm up and participate with my team members. There is a designated tamer for each bull. The idea is for the others to distract it enough so that one person can hold it, says Karthi, who lives in Alanganallur. Teams are also useful for their sheer numbers. Sometimes, a humiliated owner will try to pick a fight. Then, there are boys who go ahead and break the unwritten rule about not taming a bull from ones own village, just to spite the owner, with whom he may have a long-standing grievance, says Balasubramanian.Denied a bicycle last time jallikattu was held there because the bull he caught had ran out later than the allotted 90 seconds, Karthi was headed for an unapproved jallikattu, held at an undisclosed location, on January 24. A while ago, most of his friends had run away after hearing false rumours of police raids within Pudhupatti. We have not got enough practice because of the protests and uncertainty. But you need not worry. The bulls will be there, and so will we. Come watch us.deepu.sebastian@thehindu.co.inIt is not even taming the bull. You hold on to the hump. Not too tight, because the bull then controls you. Not too loose, because youre then thrown off - R. Kannan of Palamedu"

The second crop in the district, especially in the upland areas and dry plains, are chiefly lentil crops such as sesame, horse gram, black gram and other types of dal.""Though these crops are dry weather crops and require very little water support, they need to be watered at least once every 10 days on an average during the 80-day period and this year we believe that the water table levels have badly shrunk,"" said K Ram Babu , a farmer from Eti Gavirampeta, Narsipatnam division. Sources in the government agriculture department disclosed that almost 1,000 water tanks used for small scale irrigation have dried up and so have the hill streams feeding them.Badly hit by demonetisation, the farmers were hoping to make something out of their second crop this year. E Raman Prasad , a farmer from Uratla observed, ""Lack of water is a problem in the upland areas of Narsipatnam and Anakapalli divisions. Much of the agriculture in these zones is hence dry crop agriculture. Now, with the northeast monsoon playing truant, the farmers are in for trouble.""Officials said a vast majority of the farmers, however, would not be troubled too much. K Srinivasulu of the Krishi Vigyan Kendra said, ""Much of the land in the upland areas of Narsipatnam and Anakapalli plains is either under horticulture such as mango and cashew or timber (Casuarina, Acacia). Hence the loss of crop would be negligible."" He further added, over all not more than 10 mandals should be affected.The farmers, however, maintain that they would face severe losses due to lack of rains and further demanded that the district be declared drought hit. ""The authorities cannot claim that farmers will not be affected just because the mango and cashew are in bloom. They must understand that the second crop is equally important, especially for food security. They should at least identify mandals which will be very badly affected and declare them drought hit, if not the entire district, "" Raman observed."

On Wednesday, Mr Modi said that people should learn from Dr Singh how to bathe in bathroom wearing a raincoat, alluding to his blemish-free reputation while heading a scam-riddled government.The comment  not as acerbic as some of the ones that have been made against Mr Modi by the Opposition many times in recent years  led to the Congress stalling proceedings in the upper house and staging protests in the lower. The issue could lead to further disruptions when the House reconvenes on March 9: The Congress has said that it will boycott Mr Modi for rest of the budget session. The session is going into a recess in order to enable the standing committees to consider the demands for grants of ministries/departments and prepare their reports.Read | Remember what your mother called PM Modi, Amit Shah tells RahulIf we sift through contemporary political history, heres what Opposition leaders have called Mr Modi: A snake, a scorpion, and bhasmasur, the demon. After the surgical strikes along the LoC, Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi said: Jinhone Hindustan ke liye surgical strike kiye hain, unke khoon ke peeche aap chhupe hain. Unki aap dalali kar rahe ho. (You are hiding behind the blood of soldiers who carried out the surgical strikes for India. You are dealing in their blood).Speaking to reporters outside Parliament in November, Mr Gandhi referred to Mr Modis video-address at the Global Citizen Festival in Mumbai and said: He can speak on TV, he can speak in pop concerts, then why not in Parliament?In contrast to such derogatory expressions and strong attacks, Mr Modis description of Mr Singh was a sedate one, almost taking us back to those times when humour and wit  as opposed to caustic diatribe  was used in Parliament to needle the Opposition.Read | Oppn seeks apology from PM Modi for his remarks on Manmohan, disrupt Rajya SabhaReacting to the PMs comment, Mr Gandhi tweeted: When a Prime Minister reduces himself to ridiculing his predecessor  years his senior, he hurts the dignity of the parliament &the nation. In other words: Mr Modi should not have picked on Mr Singh just because, well, the former PM is senior in age. This is hardly a strong defence. Moreover, such an ageist parameter is unreasonable and detrimental to the basic nature of a democratic system.Disruption of Parliament on flimsy grounds only shows that the Congress is clutching at straws to win a political brownie point. Political parties must realise that every disruption costs money. But more than that it delays legislation critical for the voters who send them to the House."
58f5d3f57be9e01a357a8082,"Kolkata eats healthy, but works out less: Survey",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/city-eats-healthy-but-works-out-less-survey/articleshow/57069549.cms,2017-02-10,"KOLKATA: People in Kolkata eat the healthiest among eight metros, an analysis of 43 million food logs of 1 million urban Indians has revealed. The flip side, however, is that the average Kolkatan burns the least calories. Also, with families increasingly eating out, the advantages of a balanced diet that is inherent in Bengal's traditional recipes may soon not reflect on the people, warn nutritionists and dieticians.Data logged by mobile health and fitness firm HealthifyMe, which analyses self-reported information on what and how much people consume to work out the protein-fat-carbohydrate (PFC) ratio, shows a slightly higher protien and fat intake and a reduction in carbohydrate can make the average Kolkatan's diet perfect. Other cities, however, require substantial changes to their food habit to make it healthy.The National Institute of Nutrition under the Indian Council of Medical Research pegs the average Indian adult's ideal PFC ratio at 20%:30%:50%. From the 5.5 lakh food logs reported by 10,000-plus Kolkatans in 2016, the average PFC ratio of food intake is 16.9%: 28.6%: 54.5%, the closest to the ideal, says Tushar Vashisht , co-founder and CEO of HealthifyMe.Compared to the rest of the country, the percentage contribution of protein to energy is higher while fat and carbohydrate to energy is lower in Kolkata. ""The high protein intake from the regular intake of fish, meat and lentils put people in the city at a lower risk for conditions like diabetes, osteoporosis, stroke and obesity,"" remarked Mitali Palodhi, nutritianist-dietician and vice-president of Indian Dietetic Association.Consumption of vegetables is also higher in Kolkata than most other cities. Masoor dal, mixed vegetables and machher jhol are among the most popular meal items while muri or puffed rice is a very popular snack item.In contrast, consumption of fat is highest in Delhi that thrives on paratha, milk/butter and samosa. Such food habit puts them at greater risk of heart disease and hypertension. Chennai, Hyderabad and Bangalore, on the other hand, consume more carbohydrate through their diet of rice, idli and dosa makes them susceptible to diabetes.While the survey shows that Bengal's traditional food is balanced as they contain all nutrients, dieticians are worried that habits are fast changing. ""Increasingly, people are opting to eat out or order in. When one does that, one doesn't know the fat content. It is also disturbing to hear some parents brag that their children don't like rice or roti. One has to get children addicted to home food,"" said Ipsita Chakravarti, chief dietician of CMRI.The lack of balance diet is leading to micronutrient deficiencies like Vitamin D and iron and folic acid. ""These problems would earlier occur mostly among the impoverished people who could not afford a proper meal. But that is not the case now. High consumption of fast food is resulting in these problem across socio-economic groups,"" said Palodhi.Another major problem, says Chakravarti, is sendantary lifestyle. Analysis of HealthifyMe data shows the average Kolkatan burns minimum calories. While a Kolkatan burns 209 kCal a day, it is 232 kCal in Bangalore, 229 kCal in Delhi and 227 kCal in Mumbai."
58f55ab07be9e01a17c97fc7,Farmers hit hard as tur dal traders shut shop in Maharashtra,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/farmers-hit-hard-as-tur-dal-traders-shut-shop-in-maharashtra/articleshow/57117535.cms,2017-02-13,"MUMBAI: Even as the price of tur dal across the state continues to fall steadily below the minimum support price (MSP), many key pulse market yards across the state remain shut.The reason for the suspension of trade is the traders' demand that the government pay the farmers the additional relief grant of Rs 425 it had declared while the farmers were agitating for a better price for the crop. This has prompted the government to issue notices to the traders who are purchasing the lentil below the MSP.The imbroglio has resulted in huge losses and inconvenience to the farmers.Maharashtra is one of the major tur-producing states in the country and had a bumper crop this year. Tur dal production in the state is estimated at 11.71lakh metric tonnes against 4.4 lakh met ric tonnes the previous year. The area under tur also rose last year. A total area of 15.33 lakh hectare was under tur in 2016 against 12.37 lakh hectare in 2015.The MSP for tur dal is Rs 5,050 per quintal, but farmers are getting only Rs 4,200-4,300 per quintal, prompting them to complain to the government.The state government started taking action against such traders with market yards committees in Parbhani, Latur, Akola and Hingoli--key markets for pulses in the state--issuing notices to them.""Following notices to the traders, they stopped purchase of tur dal at the market yards. Farmers are being shortchanged despite having a good crop year. Another issue for keeping the markets shut relates to the additional grant,"" said a Latur APMC committee official.""If the government threatens action against the traders they hold us to ransom and stop the purchase,"" said Aashirwad Warpe, an affected farmer from Latur.Farmers say that when prices of tur skyrocketed last year due to low supply , the government came out with a subsidy scheme to promote sowing of the crop in 2016 and so farmers took to tur on a large scale, a decision they are regretting now.The government has also given free seeds and fertilizers to farmers willing to grow pulses.The state has begun market interventions by procuring tur at MSP rates to stabilize the prices.So far 9,000 quintals of tur have been procured by Nafed. "" At some places it has also come to light that traders have purchased tur at a lower price from the farmers and sold it to Nafed at higher prices,"" said a state government official.Even as there is a dip in the wholesale there isn't much relief for the retail consumer. The retail price hovers between Rs 100 and Rs 120.Demonetisation too is one of the key reasons why the crop didn't get a good price during the beginning of the season in December.""Not only Maharashtra, but other pulse-producing states such as Karnataka, too, had a good crop this year. Looking at the market situation with demonetisation in the backdrop, the Centre will have to start buying from the market to stablize the prices,"" said an expert."

The uniqueness of our cuisine is that we use 100-year-old recipes originally tried and tested by our mothers and mothers-in-law (smiles). Marwaris also experiment with new recipes, picking them up from the places we live in.The first dish I learnt from my mother-in-law was plain khakhra (thin wheat-based crackers) and when I tried, there was too much salt (laughs). A couple of years ago, my nephew tasted my theplas and asked me if I wanted to start a business selling my food to people. He convinced me and today, I am the Chief Chef at Gulabs, a hand-crafted snack manufacturing start-up.Romani AgarwalMarwari food is unique because of the seasonal ingredients and spices we buy from Rajasthan. In winter, we eat a lot of millet and warm, heavy dishes such as bhajre ki roti, bhajre ka dahliya (cracked millet) and gehu ki kheer (wheat porridge). This is to keep us warm on winter nights.We also use a lot of seasonal fruits. During mango season, we make a sweet mango pickle and mango gunda pickle. Mostly I use wheat because, that is the base for rotis and khakhras.Im not a great fan of fusion. When I decide to cook a particular dish, I stick to its speciality. For instance, while making a South Indian dish, I use podis and masala powders.Mogar ki roti, methi theplas, matar ka pulao, tava poori along with dal chawal or rasam chawal are my home meals speciality.During Diwali, we make this special dessert called laapsi with ghee and nuts; for Holi, its meetha chawal (sweet rice), and for Raksha Bhandan, its seviya kheer.Having been cooking for so many years, it took time for me to master moongadi khakhra (khakhras made with yellow split lentils). Yes, cooking has evolved itself over the years, but we are also getting back to our traditional recipes, ingredients and methods of cooking, which are more healthy. My fondest memories of cooking have to do with seeing my family and friends satisfied with what I serve them."

Former student Priya Ramkumar essayed the role of the Tamil poet.On Saturday, 17 students of Salangai Academy presented Bhasmasuramohini, a dance-drama based on the mythological asura-king who aspires to universal domination by gaining the power to burn people to ashes from Lord Siva.How he is thwarted in his ambition by the clever Mohini (Lord Vishnu in a female avatar), forms the crux of the drama.The climactic dance, when Mohini challenges Bhasmasura to match her step to step, that inadvertently leads him to his death, was the highlight of the evening.We wanted to show how power without self-control can lead to ones own destruction, said Vijaya Mukundan, who choreographed and directed Bhasmasuramohini.Both evenings saw an exposition of pure Bharathanatyam, accentuated by the silken costumes and sparkling jewellery of the dancers and the live musical accompaniment."

The local people said a Radha Krishna temple had been built at Debnagar in 2010 with the help of Chandana. In 2012, Chandana developed an old age home in association with another woman next to the temple. However, after some years, the other woman left Jalpaiguri following her husband's transfer. Soon, Chandana changed the accommodation to a destitute women's home. ""I have been working here since 2012 and get a monthly salary of Rs 6,700. But since July last year, I haven't been getting my salary. Other employees are not being paid their salaries either,"" Dipti Ghosh, the superintendent of ""Ashray"", said today. There are four employees and 21 boarders at the home now and two of them are pregnant. ""One of them is in advanced state of pregnancy,"" am employee said. But the principal problem is lack of funds. ""We do not have stock of food grains, grocery items and vegetables. Cooking gas can finish any time. On the other hand, the chairperson is behind the bars now. We don't know how we will run the home and provide food to the boarders,"" the superintendent said. According to her, the home spends around Rs 1,700 for an inmate a month. ""Even though we are not getting salaries, we are still doing our work. But if funds provided to run the home do not come, it would be tough for us,"" Mousumi Majumdar, a counsellor posted at the home, said. ""We do not have even Rs 400 that is required to hire an ambulance at any time, we might have to shift one of the pregnant women to hospital for delivery."" Some of the boarders also expressed anguish over the services provided at the home. For several months, they said, they have not been served with non-veg items. ""We are just provided with rice, lentil and occasionally, some vegetables. We have also come to know about the arrest and all of us are worried. We have no place to go and don't know what would happen,"" an inmate said. A senior administrative official in Jalpaiguri, when told about the state of affairs at Ashray, said: ""The CID is investigating the case. We are also keeping a strict vigil on the home as there are 21 women there. If the need arises, the administration will surely extend necessary assistance."""

The specimens consisted of seed samples for some of the worlds most vital food sources like potato, sorghum, rice, barley, chickpea, lentil and wheat.Speaking from Svalbard, Aly Abou-Sabaa, the head of the International Center for Agricultural Research, said that borrowing and reconstituting the seeds before returning them had been a success and showed that it was possible to find solutions to pressing regional and global challenges.Improving accessThe agency borrowed the seeds three years ago because it could not access its gene bank of 1,41,000 specimens in the war-torn Syrian city of Aleppo, and so was unable to regenerate and distribute them to breeders and researchers.The reconstituted seeds will play a critical role in developing climate-resilient crops for generations, Mr. Abou-Sabaa said.The newly deposited 50,000 samples were from seed collections in Benin, India, Pakistan, Lebanon, Morocco, Netherlands, the U.S, Mexico, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belarus and Britain. It brought the total deposits in the snow-covered vault with a capacity of 4.5 million to 9,40,000."

Trains ran from Panvel to Kurla and commuters were allowed to change to the CR main line. It led to massive crowding at Kurlausually jampacked at peak hoursand led to fears of a stampede. ""I've never seen such chaos at Kurla, there was no space to stand at 10am. I abandoned plans to go to work as the trains were overcrowded,"" said commuter Vaishali Sawant.The train disruption on the week's first working day was compounded by refusals by auto and taxi drivers and steep surge pricing of up to over three times the normal fare by aggregator cabs. As desperate commuters took to the roads, long snarls awaited those trying to reach offices in south Mumbai, especially along the Eastern Freeway. The evening saw a repeat nightmare.

Amazon Fresh , a business that owes its genesis to a 2007 move by the online retailer to offer Seattle area residents doorstep delivery of a limited selection of groceries, awaits Foreign Direct Investment approval before it can sell locally. Besides groceries, Amazon India will continue to invest heavily in the fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) business for a few more years, according to the Director, FMCG category management, Saurabh Srivastava.""We will maintain the entire supply chain directly and right sourcing will be the key. Such value was not possible to be delivered had the government not liberalised the FDI policy,"" said Srivastava. The company will source fresh produce and staples directly from farmers as part of the Amazon Fresh initiative, he said.Amazon Fresh has been the key vehicle the e-commerce giant has used to compete with the supermarkets, enabling it to sell fresh produce, dairy and bakery products in the US, UK and Europe. Last June, the company hopped across the Atlantic for the first time, offering services to London consumers.In India, the company already sells fresh vegetables, fruits and dairy products through its hyperlocal venture Amazon Now in Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad and Bengaluru. For this, it sources the products from the supermarkets based on through screening and packs them in special temperature-controlled boxes for delivery to the consumer household.""Our experience with Amazon Now is not satisfactory, especially on the quality of produce we source from the supermarkets. Hence, we have not yet started with fish and meat. Once we undertake direct sales and sourcing under Amazon Fresh, we would be able to add much more value,"" said Srivastava.He said the company will continue to invest over the next few years and is not looking at immediately generating profit: The company is instead seeking to drive a habit change for consumers buying FMCG and grocery products online. ""Our focus is on the long term. Of course, as our order volumes increase, we would drive economies of scale into the business. But we don't want to focus on just one city to make it profitable right now and would rather expand our offering,"" he said.On discounts on low-margin categories such as FMCG, Srivastava said discounts are passed on by the brands or sellers since they see e-commerce as one of the fastest growing channels. ""There are discounts in this category that are offered by neighbourhood grocers, supermarkets and even wholesalers, which they are not supposed to do. We have enabled access to all such discounts directly to consumers,"" he said.The FMCG category is one of the fastest growing at Amazon and the largest in terms of units sold. There are over 9,000 sellers for FMCG products at present and the business has grown by 165% last year over 2015. Amazon currently sells 1.9 million FMCG products across categories."

Do you feel fatigued and exhausted most of the time? Do you fall sick very often?If most of the answers to the above questions are yes then clearly you could have a weak immune system. A strong and well-functioning immune system is the cornerstone of good health that helps in fighting off diseases and infections and allows you to live a healthy life. There are a variety of factors that can result in a compromised immune system and the first step to fight against it is to identify the potential causes. Some of the basic factors that can weaken the immune system could include stress, unhealthy diet, inadequate amount of healthy water intake, lack of sleep and unhealthy lifestyles.1.Consume healthy drinking water  Healthy water which is enriched with essential nutrients, minerals and vitamins, is extremely crucial and plays a very vital role in building a strong immune system. It infuses energy into the body, controls bacteria, and stimulates brain function as well2.Reduce Stress & Stay Hydrated- Without enough healthy water, we fall prey to dehydration and other mineral deprived diseases which are linked to stress. Scientific research has drawn a link between dehydration and common problems related to anxiety that most urban dwellers face. Hydration is important for staying healthy and combating fatigue. When we are dehydrated, our cells feel it at the molecular level and communicate this to the subconscious as an underline subtle anxiety or threat to survival. By staying hydrated you will be better equipped to deal with everyday problems3.Choose water purifiers with benefit of instant cooling- Cold water stimulates the release of substances vital to immune function, such as cytokines that help in enhancing immunity. Opt for water purifiers which give healthy water with the benefit of instant cooling. These purifiers also eliminate the hassle of refilling bottles and putting them in the refrigerator4.Healthy protein diet  Deficiency of protein leads to reduction of immune cells. Make sure that you eat a diet high in fruits, vegetables and low in saturated fats. For like eggs, fish, vegetables and pulses like lentils, chickpeas and beans which are an excellent source of protein. Eating the right diet and getting the proper nutrition are the keys to a healthy immune system5.Opt for a reverse osmosis filter-led water purifier- It helps ensure that you are drinking safe water in places where TDS (Total Dissolved Salts) levels in the water is extremely high. However, in regions where the TDS levels are not so high, water can be harmful to your body in the long run as it does not retain the essential minerals required by the body, resulting in severe health problems. With the advancement of technology we are now lucky to be safe from dirty and unsafe water. There are purifiers available in the market with RO+UV Technology that can remove excess TDS, block impurities, chemical contaminants thereby making water healthy and provide dual protection6.Exercise  Regular exercise improves the blood flow in the body. This leads to the circulation of immune cells throughout the body and perform their job efficiently. Also note that too much exercise can have the opposite effect and reduce ones immune response7.Meditation  Meditation is another natural booster. It helps in reducing stress that tremendously weakens the immune systemStart giving your immunity system the priority and live a healthy and happy lifestyle.The writer is with Eureka Forbes Institute of Environment"

A shatranji - a thick woven cloth - tessellates its stone-paved flooring. Plates are arranged and soon over a hundred poor men and women are served rice and lentils The barefoot man serving them is Azhar Maqsusi , founder of 'Hunger Has No Religion' campaign.Azhar, who runs a small plaster of Paris (PoP) business, has a small office in Dabeerpura. It is from here he manages the campaign.""There are two places in the city, Dabeerpura and Gandhi Hospital , where we serve food for free,"" he says. Azhar keeps count on days of his campaign. ""It has been 1,731 days under the Dabeerpura flyover and 525 days at Gandhi hospital,"" he said.Azhar, who was featured on a popular television programme with superstar Amitabh Bachchan , is no stranger to poverty. He has felt the pangs of hunger. ""My father, who was an auto rickshaw driver, died when I was just four. With the sole breadwinner of the family gone, there have been several days when my five siblings, mother and I had no food or water. All of us lived in a cramped room in Bagh-e-Jahaan Aara ,"" he says.The idea to set up a daily free food camp was born after Azhar saw a destitute at Dabeerpura station writhing in pain. He later found she was hungry for several days. ""I still remember her name. She was Laxmi. That is when I decided to do something. Every day, I would feed the hungry,"" he said. He would often sell PoP raw material to buy rice to make food packets. Five years later, he feeds as many as 140 people under the Dabeerpura flyover and up to 250 near Gandhi Hospital. He's not alone. Azhar also gets help from Good Samaritans. ""A few years ago, an NRI who took a wrong turn chanced upon the camp. I was told he later made inquiries. After being satisfied, he started donating 15 bags of rice. This continued for many years."" His Facebook friends too have been of great help, so much so that Azhar claims the campaign could not have worked without them.His new 'Do Roti' campaign urges professionals, students and others to carry two rotis wherever they go and give it to those in need at traffic signals and other places. ""This is to discourage children from begging at traffic signals. Hopefully, it will have an impact,"" Azhar says."

A ritual held in most district headquarters is to organise a meeting, typically presided over by presidents of consumer redress forums who discuss how efficient they have been in giving judgements while quoting some obscure statistics. But reality is vastly different.Surveys have shown that consumer courts set up at the district, state and national level have not fulfilled the intended vision of the Consumer Protection Act (COPRA) adopted in 1986. The original objective of parliament was to provide speedy justice with minimum adjournments and without lawyers. Not one judge has dared to question why all these consumer courts have become more like civil courts or asked what can be done to better help consumers.Most consumer organisations concentrate on the use of COPRA but not on the original intention. Very few have the interest or capability to handle larger issues like improving the water supply, providing uninterrupted 24/7 power supply, efficient public transportation, corruption-free public distribution system or well-equipped government hospitals with competent doctors etc.Indias consumer movement has a long way to develop in order to meet the urgent needs of long-suffering people who are not receiving the services and protection they have been assured. If the consumer movement was really strong, a long-pending Consumer Protection Bill 2015 to replace COPRA would have been passed by parliament to provide speedy justice to consumers.There may be at best fewer than 2,000 consumer organisations all over India to serve 1.2 billion people. Most of these consumer NGOs look for government handouts to exist. By taking money from the government, they become subservient to officials and are often the ones who create problems to consumers directly or indirectly.Consider some of the important consumer issues that the consumer movement has failed to take up. The NDA government announced a policy recently to create a giant integrated oil company by merging all state-owned companies to compete with large multinationals. However, they ignored how such a behemoth will become a modern-day Bhasmasura and kill competition in the petroleum sector.A vibrant consumer movement would have risen in revolt against such an anti-consumer policy. But no consumer NGO protested. Fortunately, the petroleum minister has backtracked later, suggesting only a holding company by ONGC to buy either HPCL or BPCL. Even this is not a sound idea, but less harmful than the original mega merger.The suffering of people from various forms of food adulteration is a well-known problem throughout India. Food samples taken from different states in 2015 revealed that 20% were adulterated. This information comes to national attention only when people die of food adulteration, then it is quickly forgotten. On paper, India has one of the most potent laws to prevent food adulteration but implementation has failed abysmally. Again a vibrant consumer movement would take this issue seriously.For example, when people use tur dal, turmeric or sweets adulterated with metanil yellow (a carcinogenic chemical used to make food attractive) harmful effects are not experienced immediately. The result is cancer but by the time it is detected, it will be too late. Despite the dreadful impact of food adulteration, why has Indias consumer movement not taken up this issue on a war footing?Much has been written about how justice delayed is justice denied and how millions of cases pending in courts have prevented Indias development. This is a topic of critical importance to all citizens and not just to those litigants who have filed cases. Sadly our consumer movement has taken little or no interest in this issue.Digital worldThe theme of Consumer International (founded in 1960 with over 240 members in 120 countries) this year is Building a digital world consumers can trust. This is certainly relevant as we implement the mission Digital India and promote a cashless economy.However, when a significant percentage of Indians are below extreme poverty level, the consumer movement needs a more appropriate theme. We must think strategically about what different path Indias consumer movement can chart to reduce the extreme poverty that has remained even after 70 years of independence.What does the consumer movement have to do with poverty? A vibrant consumer movement has the power to force an all-round efficient economic system with minimum corruption that can result in rapid development. We know from Tenali Ramans story how a pond will haveonlywater if everyone thinks that others will pour milk for the kings bath. But few of us apply the moral of the story.Unfortunately, most of us who are actually aware of the problems are more likely to shy away from taking an active part in solving them. We expect others to do so while we stand by doing nothing. This same type of indifference from consumer organisations and from citizens is not acceptable.In the 1960s, nascent consumer organisations concentrated in buying goods in bulk to save money and create consumer awareness. Later they organised protests when consumers were cheated. When COPRA was adapted, they became immersed in promoting COPRA to obtain redress. The consumer movement must now take up critical systemic problems in order to promote rapid economic development and reduce poverty by involving every citizen.Time has come to reinvent the consumer movement in India. The World Consumer Rights Day and National Consumer Day celebrations are prime opportunities for us as a society to promote a vibrant consumer movement  a truly meaningful celebration by consumer activists and ordinary citizens with the involvement of educational institutions, large companies, government offices, public sector companies and civic groups interacting on consumer-related issues."

Those who go with him will be reduced to ashes. The JD(S) will face the same consequences if the party decides to join hands with the Congress leader in the coming days, he told reporters who sought his reaction to speculation in political circles that like-minded Opposition parties may form a coalition to check the surge of the BJP in the country.We have seen what happened to the coalition (Congress-SP) in Uttar Pradesh. Those who go with him will face the same consequences, he stated, referring to the debacle of Akhilesh Yadav-led SP in the recently held UP Assembly elections.He further said a section of the electorate in Nanjangud Assembly constituency was of the view that JD(S) willingly sent Kalale Keshavamurthy to Congress to fight BJPs V Srinivas Prasad in the upcoming byelection.

Nowruz , literally translating to ""new day"", is celebrated here by the Zoroastrian and Mughal Iranis alike, with equal fervour. And though the observances are largely familial, the day is welcomed with goodwill and hopes for the year ahead, inundated with interesting rituals and traditions...After the customary spring cleaning, restaurateur Rustom Irani 's house in Kondhwa wears a festive look. His wife Fauzia, sons Shahnawaz and Farheez, and their wives Rukhshin and Farzana bustle around the house, readying the ceremonial Haft-Seen table.The Haft-Seen is at the heart of the celebrations. Rustom says, ""Literally translating to 'the seven seens', the table comprises an arrangement of items (atleast seven) beginning with the Persian letter 'seen'."" He says that these elements represent key symbols of life. ""Sabzeh (wheat, barley or lentil sprouts growing in a dish  symbolising rebirth), Samanoo (a sweet, creamy wheat germ pudding  symbolising affluence), Seeb (succulent apples  symbolising beauty and health), Senjed (sweet, dried sea buckthorn fruits  representing love), Seer (garlic  representing good health), Sumac (a Persian spice  representing sunlight and light overcoming darkness), and Serkeh (vinegar  representing age and patience)  these are the key elements we place on the table,"" explains Farheez.Getting all this together takes days of preparation. ""Customs have changed with regional variations, but at the core, the table represents a gesture of thanksgiving to God for the year gone by and the new one,"" adds Shahnawaz.Myriad food preparations are associated with the new year, differing across the countries where Nowruz is celebrated. But Fauzia has laid out a real feast for the day. She suggests starting off with Kookoo Sabzi, a traditional Nowruz dish of fluffy Persian herb omelettes. Next comes the Sabzi Polo Mahi, a mildly spiced chicken or mutton pilaf infused with the flavours and textures of sumac, coriander, spinach, cranberries and dried fruits. ""This usually goes well with the mahi or fish,"" says Fauzia, who has smeared the fish well with a paste of rice flour, chickpea flour, fennel seeds and black salt, and steamed it to tender perfection. The meal can be ended on a sweet note with Baklava (a sweet pastry of filo layers enriched with chopped nuts and the flavours of orange blossom and rose water), traditional ice-cream Falooda and Samanoo, the traditional wheat germ pudding that's a must.Nowruz is a time of glad tidings for the community. At Ramtekdi resident Kashmira Irani's house, the day will begin with 'Jashn'. ""The priest will come over and perform the 'Jashn' or prayer for everyone's happiness,"" says Kashmira. She will prepare the auspicious 'khana' comprising Mora Dal Chawal, Kolmi no Pattia (a rich prawn preparation), Patra ni Machchi and Salli Boti. ""At Nowruz, an Iranian salad - potatoes, spring onions, egg and a whole lot of spices - is a must,"" Kashmira adds. The Iranian Gaz (a Persian nougat), Daal ni Pori and the traditional ice-cream Falooda will feature on the table as well.A similar celebration will ensue at the house of Dr SMM Irani of Taboot Street's Husseny Bakery. ""Today, it is customary for us to say a special prayer, wishing for not just the family's, but everyone's best in the new year,"" says Dr Irani. At his place too, Sabzi Polo Mahi will be prepared and enjoyed."

Rosewater is sprinkled on each member who later smile into a mirror and pray for a happy year ahead.Preparations for the day begin much in advance with Khouneh Tekouni, an activity of thorough cleaning of the house.Kashmira's day began with a prayer performed by a priest to ward off the evil. ""I served him falooda (sweet) and then started the feast, which included fish biryani. The traditional dish of mora dal chawal with Kolmi no Pattia (a rich prawn preparation) is cooked in most homes on this day. We invite friends and family to join the festivities. The scale of celebrations may have toned down a bit over the years, but continue to be as traditional and enjoyable as before,"" she said.The idea is to keep festivities as authentic as possible, explained Farheez Irani , a Camp resident. ""Most of us try to perform rituals as done in Iran. Adorning new clothes, people visit a fire temple in the morning. The table is readied almost an hour before the celebrations begin. Every year, I and my brother make it a point to visit my parents' house in Kondhwa,"" he said.The celebration of Navroz is as old as the Zoroastrian culture, said S M M Irani. ""It's a day for families to bond, eat and pray for peace and prosperity around the world,"" he said.Navroz is a combination of two Persian words. No, which means 'new' and rouz, which means 'day'.According to the Gregorian calendar, Navroz falls in the month of March. Observed on the day of the vernal equinox (day and night are of approximately equal duration all over the planet), it has been celebrated for over 3,000 years in Western Asia, Central Asia, the Caucasus, the Black Sea Basin and the Balkans.It usually occurs on March 21 or the previous or following day (depending on the region).In Pune, the community members usually attend their prayer sessions at Sir JJ Agiary in Camp to welcome the new year hoping for harmony and good health."

(Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) When it sets off from Howrah station, the Antyodaya is almost empty, but as it enters Vijayawada, almost every inch of space is taken. (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)From a 21-year-old fleeing the sea in Goa to a 54-year-old former bus conductor from Malda who is going to Kerala for the first time, the Antyodaya Express, a fully unreserved train between Howrah and Ernakulam, and its 20 coaches carry the shared burden of a thousand stories and dreams. The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

(File Photo) Prime Minister Narendra Modi. (File Photo)The government today allowed unrestricted exports of all certified organic agricultural products, a move that would help in boosting shipments. The decision in this regard was taken in the meeting of the cabinet committee on economic affairs (CCEA), chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The CCEA has given its approval for removal of all quantitative ceilings on individual organic products and allowed unrestricted exports of all organic agricultural and organic processed products irrespective of any existing or future restriction/prohibition on the export of their basic product (non-organic).However, the government said in view of acute shortage in the country, the quantitative ceiling on shipments of organic pulses and lentils will continue. But the ceiling was enhanced from 10,000 tonnes to 50,000 tonnes. The move will also result in increased adoption of organic agriculture by farmers.Removal of quantitative celling on wheat, sugar, non-basmati rice, organic sugar and increasing the limit on export of organic pulses is expected to contribute to the Governments objective of doubling the farmers income, an official statement said.It will lead to reduction in input costs in farming and gaining premium price for organic agriculture products and in the process resulting in increased adoption of organic agriculture by farmers.All organic products exports are certified by Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the National Programme for Organic Production (NPOP).It said the government is supporting the farmers and exporters to tap huge opportunity that exists within the country and abroad for organic agriculture products.A stable and consistent export policy relating to export of organic products would allow exporters to make long term commitment to the buyers and also establish linkages with the farmers.This is likely to result in enhanced realisation to farmers from organic production, it said adding a stable export policy on organic agriculture products would complement various government programmes like National Mission on Sustainable Agriculture, Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana,Organic Value Chain Development in North Eastern Region which have been taken up to encourage organic agriculture.

593790557be9e015d564bece,"Six years on, Somali pirates set to return home, with some Marathi and love for dal-chawal",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/six-years-on-somali-pirates-set-to-return-home-with-some-marathi-love-for-dal-chawal-4601421/,2017-04-05,"120 were arrested between January and March 2011, two died of tuberculosis. File 120 were arrested between January and March 2011, two died of tuberculosis. FileAmid the rough and tumble of life inside Navi Mumbais Taloja Road jail, far from the recent attacks on Africans in the national capital region, 118 Somali men have found companionship and hope. They have managed to learn English, Hindi and a smattering of Marathi, and begun to enjoy the varan-bhaat (dal chawal), even if the lentils are watery.These 118 were among 120 Somali pirates apprehended by the Indian Navy and the Coast Guard in four separate anti-piracy operations between January and March 2011 near the Lakshwadeep coast; two died of tuberculosis. Six years later, the trial against them is ending at a Mumbai court with the men having agreed to plead guilty, some to murder charges.It is arguably the most number of foreign undertrials in a single case anywhere in the country. Some of them expect to walk free, having already served their sentence as undertrials. Others could be sent home to Somalia to complete the remainder of their term, if convicted.Their clothes in tatters, some with bullets lodged in their bodies from past incidents, these men had earned the sympathy of other undertrials. They could not speak the language, they came from a poor country and had no family or friends here. So most prisoners offered them help, says a former inmate of Taloja.With no intervention from the Somali Embassy for the first few months, the men had to depend on others to buy basic supplies from the prison canteen, including soap or toothpaste. They began helping other inmates, washing their clothes or sweeping the premises, to get access to amenities, says the former inmate.Soon, the other inmates also began to teach the Somalis. For nearly a year, every day, we taught them. We began with A for apple, B for ball. Most had never had any formal education, says one inmate. Among the teachers were former Indian Navy officer Emile Jerome Mathew, then facing trial for the alleged murder of TV producer Neeraj Grover; some of the Malegaon 2008 blast case accused; and, the 1993 Mumbai serial blasts case accused.Many of the Somalis started playing football and volleyball in the open area of the prison. Recently, they performed a traditional Somali dance at a cultural programme in prison.During court appearances, they would constantly ask, Humko wapas kab bhejoge?, or Aamhala kadhi sodnaar (When will we be released)?, says Rajaram Yadav, former court officer at Mumbais Yellow Gate police station.When the Somalis were herded into Yellow Gate station for the first time, they were sent straight to judicial custody  there was no interrogation to be done. With no space at Arthur Road jail, where 26/11 terrorist Ajmal Kasab was lodged at the time, the 120 were transferred to the newly constructed jail in Navi Mumbai, with a capacity of 2,124 male inmates.There, the men struggled with the staple of rotis, sabzi, dal and rice, and senior jail officials had to intervene. A special tender was passed to order bread, though the rest of the diet remained the same. They love bananas, they eat the fruit with relish, says one jail staffer.The next problem was the logistical nightmare involved in transporting the men to the court in South Mumbai, 45 km from Taloja. Each man was accompanied by 1-2 police guards. At least 10-15 police vans would be deployed. A little over half of the Navi Mumbai Polices available escorts would have to be put on duty on a single case, says Yadav, the former court officer at Yellow Gate.Inside a small courtroom, lawyers and policemen found ingenious ways to accommodate the accused and the 180-200 police escorts. They were brought in batches from the police vans. In one case, there are 61 accused. A queue of policemen would stand on either side of the judge, one queue lined up between the lawyers and the accused, says special public prosecutor Ranjeet Sangle.At each hearing, the men would file up to 50 applications, seeking bail, release, expeditious trial or medical treatment.Mohammed Abdulahi Barre, for instance, filed multiple applications, one of them to be freed to contact his parents. Mukhtar Yusuf Ali told court he had been trapped by a private broker who had promised to take him to Dubai for $850 for a better life. Two years ago, after the Somalis reportedly created a ruckus, the court ordered that they be produced only through video-link.The prosecution would have interpreters, mainly Somali students from Pune University, two per hearing. They were paid a stipend of Rs 3,000 each per day. However, since student visas restricted their movement outside Pune, the Yellow Gate police had to approach the Security Branch in Pune for permission every time there was a hearing.These students were in India on grants of the Somali government. They were concerned that if they helped the Indian government against their countrymen, their grants could be suspended. I spoke to the then Ambassador, who assured us no such step would be taken against the students, says Sangle.Another hurdle the prosecution faced was in getting the victims of the four pirate ships to depose. There were in all 73 hostages  citizens of Iran, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Mozambique, Thailand and Pakistan. Before returning to their countries, at least 11 gave statements before a magistrate under Section 164 of the Criminal Procedure Code. However, they did not come to depose during the trial despite offers of remuneration for travel, food and stay. The 80-odd witnesses examined until now include mainly officials of the Navy and Coast Guard.At the start of the trial, the Somali Embassy did not engage a defence lawyer. The court appointed advocate Suraj Hulke as amicus curiae, who examined over 77 witnesses for the accused until August 2016. Then the accused suddenly told the court they wanted to plead guilty.Hulke claims the Embassy did not consult him on this decision. Last year, advocate Vishwajeet Singh representing the Somali Embassy told the court that the men were willing to give an undertaking that they would not cross-examine the remaining witnesses, nor appeal against the sentence unless it was the death penalty.Ahmed Mohammed, first secretary to the Embassy of Somalia in New Delhi, told The Indian Express that they expect an expedited trial after which a decision will be taken on taking the men back home. We are expecting the trial to end in the following months, he says.The reasons for the guilty pleas are not clear but today, the men are counting the days to when they return home. I read last week that over 100 people have died recently in Somalia due to drought. We do not know what the conditions for them will be when they return. But they are hopeful of going back to their families and not looking back at their criminal pasts, says one jail official.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Sports of minister Chetan Chauhan , who is also president of Kreeda Bharti, the sports wing of Rashtriya Swayemsewak Sangh, confirmed that government would support the traditional sports to be played as they had been in the past.Kreeda Bharti had been focusing on traditional games and has been averse to promoting games like cricket that originated in a foreign land. "" RSS has not been against cricket, it just wants to promote traditional Indian games,"" said Chauhan, who has 40 Test cricket caps to his name as an opening partner with legendary Sunil Gavaskar and added that Kreeda Bharti had been promoting games like kho-kho , kabaddi, lazium and malkhambh, a form of marshal arts originated in India.Students of RSS-backed schools run by either VHP or other off-shoots also teach games like Bhasmasur and Ganesh Chhu. ""I have not been to RSS shakhas, but have seen traditional Indian games being promoted at Kreeda Bharti and all these games are very good,"" said Chauhan, also the vice-president of the Delhi District Cricket Association (DDCA).These games are not being played any more, an official said and added that the idea is to revive these traditional games. ""We are probably the last of the generation that knew about traditional games like kho-kho, kabaddi, etc,"" a 50-year-old officer at the sports directorate told TOI.""I have asked district sport officers in UP to hold open tournaments even in rural areas to tap raw talent. Traditional games like kho-kho, kabaddi and akhada (wrestling and body building) should also be revived,"" said Chauhan, adding there was a time when people were seen at akhadas and dand-baithaks in villages. The directives were given at a meeting with all district sports officers of the state on Monday. But these activities are missing now, he said.Talking about his priority in the first 100 days, Chauhan said he would ensure that every coach comes to the field on time and doesn't just sit and watch students practising. ""I have instructed officials to ensure that all coaches are on the field instructing students,"" said Chauhan."
593c7a9b7be9e00e964d27fd,Centre opposes state Bill to regulate price of pulses,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/centre-opposes-state-bill-to-regulate-price-of-pulses-4609624/,2017-04-11,"The Centre has ruled that the states much-touted draft Bill on regulation of prices of pulses made no economic sense and goes against the basic principles of a free market economy. Last April, the Devendra Fadnavis government, which had come under criticism over spiralling prices of pulses, had publicised the fact that it was the countrys first state to adopt a price-control mechanism for pulses when it cleared the draft Bill. But the Presidential assent for the Bill hasnt come a year later. Documents obtained by the Congress under the Right to Information (RTI) Act now indicate that the Bill may stay in cold storage. The RTI documents, which were released on Tuesday, reveal that the Union agriculture ministrys Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare has raised strong objections to the proposed Bill.The department has commented, In a free market economy, prices of any commodity, including pulses, are determined by the market forces of supply and demand. The market prices provide a signal both to the producers (farmers) and consumers regarding the demand and supply situation. Accordingly, both the producers and the consumers take decisions on consumption and production of a particular commodity. The proposed Bill goes against the basic principles of the free market economy. Any artificial control on prices etc of pulses may create further distortion and parallel economy.While the states plan was to cap retail and wholesale sale prices for tur dal, black gram, green gram, lentils, beans, etc, across the state taking into account the availability of pulses, their demand and supply, the central government has opposed the states direct intervention.In case the Government of Maharashtra wants to protect the interest of consumers, it can provide pulses to the vulnerable sections at a subsidised price through the Public Distribution System (PDS). This will limit the distortionary impact on market prices and the market price signal for farmers will not be adversely impacted. Farmers will continue to have the relevant market signal to make investments in increasing production of pulses, the Centre has observed, while remarking that it does not support the Bill.Congress leader Sachin Sawant, who had filed an RTI application in this regard, alleged on Tuesday the state government had tried to scuttle the information to avoid public embarrassment. He said, I had filed an RTI in October. But was denied information twice. Official information was shared only after RTI commissioner Ratnakar Gaikwad stepped in and issued directives in this regard.Even when the Bill was passed, the Congress had reasoned that it did not make economic sense. The Centre has only reiterated our demand that the state government must procure pulses and distribute them under the PDS, he said.Cong attacks Sena, BJP on NDA meetMumbai: The Congress on Tuesday took a dig at both the Shiv Sena and BJPover Uddhav Thackerays decision to attend the NDA meet in New Delhi on Monday. It is not that long ago that Shiv Sena leaders were saying that those wanting to discuss Presidential polls should come to Matoshree. It is amusing to now see Thackeray himself travel to Delhi for the meeting and even endorse Narendra Modis candidature for the PMs race for the 2019 Lok Sabha poll, said Congress leader Sachin Sawant. He added, In the build-up to the BMC polls, BJP MP Kirit Somaiya had claimed to have evidence against Thackeray.

""What sterilisation was to the Emergency, Aadhaar seeding is becoming to your government,"" Ramesh said during a debate on Aadhaar in the Rajya Sabha. Ramesh, who has filed a petition on Aadhaar in the Supreme Court, challenged the government's claims of savings to the tune of Rs 50,000 crore from direct benefit transfer (DBT) linked to Aadhaar seeding. His contention was the purported gains had accrued by denying people benefits, not by plugging subsidy leaks. ""Seeding"" is the linking of payments to the Aadhaar numbers. Ramesh's point, and that of other Opposition leaders, was that because of a patchy biometric eco-system, nearly 40 per cent of the intended beneficiaries of several welfare plans were being denied their entitlements despite having seeded their Aadhaar numbers. While information technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad side-stepped problems arising out of biometrics in his reply, subsequent questions by Opposition members drew an assurance that the government would deal with them. But Prasad rejected claims that the insistence on Aadhaar for a slew of services violated a 2015 Supreme Court order. He maintained that since the Aadhaar law was enacted last year, it would hold good as it has not been stayed. Prasad described as ""very judgemental and not factual"" a CAG report challenging the government's claim that savings worth Rs 30,000 crore had come from direct benefit (subsidy) transfers to LPG subscribers. The CAG - which, according to Jairam, used to be the BJP's ""gospel'' when in Opposition - had said that 92 per cent of the savings came from falling international oil prices and had nothing to do with DBT. Initiating the discussion, Independent member Rajeev- who is the NDA's vice-chairman in Kerala - said: ""Aadhaar should be made mandatory after ensuring that it does not mean exclusion of any poor and needy from subsidies or services that the government provides."" Chandrasekhar expressed privacy concerns while making out a case for the evolution of Aadhaar from an unverified biometric database into a robust and reliable national identify platform. ""The current protection to consumers and citizens under both the Aadhaar Act and IT Act are skewed in favour of those who hold the data and places an extraordinary burden on the individual or the user to get justice,"" Chandrasekhar said, urging the government to take pre-emptive measures lest the courts step in. As both the BJP and the Congress face the issue of a role reversal on Aadhaar, Jairam had to contend with questions on why he had become a sceptic after being instrumental in its rollout as a UPA minister. Responding to one such observation that the Modi government was only ""taking care of a baby born to the UPA"", Ramesh replied: ""It is our baby, but you are turning it into a Bhasmasur (a demon)."" Trinamul MP Derek O'Brien said the Aadhaar biometrics often do not match in cases of the elderly and manual labourers who work with their hands, resulting in denial of benefits."

IMD issues another updated forecast in June.He said rainfall will be 96% of the long-period average with a margin of 5% error. India defines average, or normal, rainfall as between 96 percent and 104 percent of a 50-year average of 89 cm for the entire four-month season.There is a 38% probability that the monsoon will be better than 96%, he added.The forecast is critical to the governments hopes of achieving a projected growth rate of more than 7.5% as a good harvest could lift rural incomes and boost spending on consumer goods.Two-thirds of Indias population depends on farm income and nearly 60% of summer sown areas do not have assured irrigation. Summer crops account for nearly half of Indias food output, including rice, lentils, sugar, spices, mangoes and oilseeds.The monsoon rains arrive on the southern tip of Kerala state by around June 1 and retreat from the western state of Rajasthan by September-end.There are fears that an emerging El Nio could impact monsoon rains. The IMD, however, said a weak El Nio could emerge only towards the later part of the year.El Nino, or little boy in Spanish, is a weather glitch marked by an abnormal warming of the Pacific, whose effects ripple around the globe. Typically, it cuts rainfall in South Asia, including India, and triggers flooding in western US and South America.Skymet Weather, a private forecasting agency predicted a weaker than normal monsoon this year, citing the influence of El Nio.Even if there is an evolving El Nino it will impact the rainfall patterns, said Jatin Gandhi of Skymet which has forecast 95% monsoon rain.It is the same forecast, different only by a percent, Gandhi said. They (IMD) are saying normal with a 38% chance of moving towards near normal, I am saying 95% with a 50% chance of normal.If you are lucky you will hit normal, Gandhi said.A US government weather forecaster earlier this month projected the possibility of El Nio developing later this year.Forecasters in Japan and Australia also see a 40-50 percent chance of the El Nino weather pattern developing later this year.The IMD has a chequered record when it comes to predicting the monsoon. In the past three years, its initial forecast have consistently overestimated the average rainfall. However, the margin of the error has reduced.Last year, the IMD predicted 106% of the LPA in April though actual rainfall was 97%.We had very good rainfall and good agriculture output (in 2016), DS Pai, a scientist at IMD, said of last years monsoon.(With agency inputs)"

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, April 26: The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) today said the Narendra Modi government was creating issues like beef ban and Aadhar cards for cows to divert the people's attention from its failures. KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi told reporters here that after three years in power, the Modi government had not only failed to curb price rise but had also opened 40 public sector undertakings for foreign direct investment. Akhil said the government had hit the farmers and the underprivileged hard by withdrawing the subsidy on fertilisers and allowing the State Bank of India to charge customers who are unable to maintain a minimum balance in their bank accounts. ""Whenever someone raises his voice against these regressive policies, the Modi government hits back using the media and social media and brands the person anti-national. Under Modi as Prime Minister, the largest number of public sector undertakings have been opened for FDI without paying heed to anyone's opposition,"" he said. ""The average retail price of arhar dal has increased to Rs 11,000 per quintal in January this year from Rs 6,700 in May 2014. Similarly, during the same period, the price of masoor dal increased to Rs 9,100 from Rs 6,500 per quintal, mustard oil to Rs 102 from Rs 86 per litre and rohu fish to Rs 160 from Rs 115 per kilogram. These are only a few examples,"" he added. Akhil criticised the BJP for allowing the SBI to charge on the accounts which do not have minimum balance. #""After coming to power, the Centre forced poor people to open bank accounts saying those will need zero balance. The government has connected these accounts with various government schemes so that they cannot be closed. The tea garden workers have even been forced to take their salaries through bank accounts. Now, the SBI has decided to charge the accounts which do not have a minimum balance. The bank even decided to charge if someone withdraws his money more than three times a month. But the Modi government is silent."" ""The government has failed to issue Aadhar cards to the people of Assam. Now it is going to give Aadhar cards to cows. This is nothing but an attempt to keep people busy with such issues to cover the failure of the government,"" Akhil added. He alleged that the BJP in Assam had also failed to fulfil the promises it had made to the people of Assam. ""Before completion of a year of the BJP-led government in Assam, we will remind the people about the promises."""

(Source: Express Photo) Shahid Afridi in his column for ICC opened about his relations with Indian cricketers. (Source: Express Photo)Former Pakistan cricketer Shahid Afridi, in his column for the ICC, revealed about the bond he shares with Indian cricketers but said Gautam Gambhir remains an exception. Contrary to popular belief, India and Pakistan players get along very well. Of course, there are exceptions like Gautam Gambhir, who dare I say isnt the friendliest, wrote Afridi.Gambhir and Afridi had a heated on-field exchange during a India-Pakistan clash after which the relation between the two became sour, and have continued to be.We are unlikely to be found together at a coffee shop anytime soon. We had a heated exchange on the field some years ago and it made headlines all over the world. While I have moved on in life as I feel these things are part and parcel of the game, Gautam for some reason cant get over it. Good luck to him!The former Pakistan all-rounder also mentioned about the players in the Indian side with whom he shares some wonderful memories. Shahid Afridi mentioned Harrbhajan Singh, Yuvraj Singh and Zaheer Khan were some of the players with whom he used to get along well.The three are my good mates and we have some wonderful memories together from the times when both the sides used to play and tour each other on a regular basis.In the early days of our careers, we used to hang out together quite a lot and also spend time at each others homes. Now, all of us are married and, as such, responsibilities and the priority lists have changed. But whenever we catch up, we meet with warmth and love, and remember our good times together, Afridi added.Talking about the present players, Pakistans former skipper said that he admires Virat Kohli and hailed his fitness and batting abilities. Last month, the Indian team presented Afridi a jersey with Virats name and jersey number on it.Another player I admire and respect from the present lot is Virat Kohli. He has a fantastic cricket bat in hand and an even a better heart in his supremely fit body. I will always remember him for the gesture he showed when he gave me an India cricket teams signed shirt following our match in Kolkata in the World T20. This shirt sits prominently in my collection and will always remind me of not only my matches and visits to India, but my excellent relationships with most, if not all India cricketers, he wrote.Recollecting some fond memories with Indian team, Afridi remembered Indias tour to Pakistan. The Pakistan all-rounder mentioned about how he treated the Indian side at his place in Karachi.I recall during one of Indias tours to Pakistan. Invited the entire India team to my Karachi house. We prepared special Pathan-style rich food, full of lamb and mutton dishes. When the food was served, there was a complete silence in the room and my Indian friends were looking at each other. At that point, I realised that my honourable and respectable guests dont eat that type of food. Quite a few of them were vegetarians, and so, we had to urgently replace the food with Daal (lentils) and vegetables dishes. It was quite embarrassing for me to not know about the dietary requirements of the guests since our similarity of culture made me take many things for granted. That was a funny memory of my hospitality for the Indian team.Unfortunately, we dont meet each other that often now due to the prevailing relations between the two countries. But I miss the good times with my Indian cricket friends and I am sure they feel likewise. Hopefully, the situation will improve soon so that the old friends can reunite to relive old memories, he added.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

5922ccc67be9e01fe6dfb3bb,Rats! they did it again,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/editorials/2017/may/09/rats-they-did-it-again-1602735.html,2017-05-09,"The Bihar police claim that rats consumed several thousand litres of seized liquor from their maalkhanas, or record rooms, has led to much media mirth and merriment. Years ago, a police station in Kolkata had claimed that a hanuman had broken into their maalkhana and stolen a huge cache of jewellery recovered from robbery.While we might chuckle over such claims, rats do cause immense damage to police record rooms. Consider this: Hapless police in Karnal, Haryana reportedly hired a couple of domesticated white rats to scare away an army of rats merrily chewing its way through documents. The damage goes way beyond maalkhanas. Rats eat and contaminate thousands of tons of food stored in government godowns and trains. To the extent that a sub-clause in the Prevention of Food Adulteration (PFA) Act, 1954, says wheat, maize, jowar, bajra, rice, masoor, urad, moong, chana and arhar shall be free of adulteration, but with five pieces of rodent hair and faeces permitted (per kilogram). When challenged, the government said that a zero-rat-excreta/hair level would be impossible to comply with.Rats gnaw into the insulation of power lines, causing short circuits and fires. Field rats, apart from damaging crops, build burrows which weaken irrigation canal banks, causing unexpected floods. In 2001, after terrorist rats attacked the Parliament, India mobilised troops along the border. This involved laying and mapping minefields in sensitive locations to deter enemy incursions. In 2002, when we decided to stand down without a fight, the area had to be demined. But field rats had apparently shifted hundreds of small anti-personnel mines to their burrows. Fifty-eight civilians and a 100 soldiers were killed, while 310 others were hurt by these landmines between January 2002 and March 2004 in the three states bordering Pakistan. After causing so much death and destruction, can we really blame the rats in Bihar for wanting a drink?"

Around this time last year, the Modi government was scurrying for cover as prices of pulses, a key protein source, were on a steady rise.During his visits to Mozambique and Tanzania, Prime Minister Narendra Modi talked of enhanced exports and explored possibility of contract farming to meet the growing domestic demand for lentils.The biggest problem at present is procuring pulses grown domestically. We can think about import later, Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ramvilas Paswan told reporters here when asked about the status of the international cooperation in pulses sector.India had reached out to countries such as Mozambique, Tanzania, Myanmar and Malawi to explore long-term contracts for supply of pulses last year when the prices had touched Rs 200 per kg.But with the bumper production this year, the government has gone slow over imports and appears to be grappling with the glut in the market. It has already extended the last date for procurement of pulses by state-run agencies several times.We had decided to build 20 lakh tonnes of buffer stock of pulses  10 lakh tonnes from domestic producers and 10 lakh tonnes through imports. Now, we have cut imports to three to four lakh tonnes, Paswan said.Pulses production is estimated to be 22.40 million tonnes in the 2016-17 crop year, as against 16.35 million tonnes last year. This would reduce the dependence on imports to some extent as demand-supply gap is approximately three million tonnes.Another challenge before the government is disposal of the buffer stock as pulses have a relatively short shelf life of about two years.The Centre is planning to sell some quantities of pulses from the buffer stock to the Defence and para-military forces as also to give it to the states."

Pakistan has given Canada until November with similar conditions.AGT has shipped minimal volumes to those markets, but expects sales to gradually increase shipments leading into Canada's harvest period starting in August, Al-Katib said.""With uncertainty in the market, at times the best strategy is to pause and see how the chips fall,"" Al-Katib said on the sidelines of BMO's Farm to Market investor conference in New York. ""We remain cautious on India and Pakistan.""Lentils are a protein-rich food part of the pulse crop family. India imports some C$1.1 billion ($808.65 million) worth of pulses annually from Canada, the biggest exporter.Al-Katib said he soon expects a resolution from India, the world's largest importer of pulses, given its recent draft policy. Its plant quarantine authority on May 3 circulated a policy that includes monitoring Canada's system of pest-control as shipments go ahead.AGT's shares in Toronto have plunged some 16 percent in less than two weeks, after an analyst speculated that its quarterly performance would miss his expectations. The company hastily released its quarterly results early, including a fall in gross profit.""The first half of the year is going to be constrained (for AGT), but the rest of the year looks very positive,"" Al-Katib said, declining to quantify how the shipping slowdown may affect revenues.Part of the optimism is due to the fact that farmers in Western Canada have benefited from favorable lentil and pea planting conditions this spring, he noted, after earlier concerns about too much moisture abated.Sowings are expected to be sharply lower, however, after a big harvest last year weakened prices.

With its vast repertoire of ingredients, rich culinary traditions and regional influences, Indian cuisine has gained prominence in the world food scenario. And yet, now that we think about it, it seems bizarre that there's not one single day when we collectively celebrate any of our dishes! There have been occasional attempts in this area  like food communities trying to mark a World Undhiyu Day or a National Milk Day, but none of them have really taken off. Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal , a food consultant who has been organising international food days in Mumbai for some years now, was struck by this thought. And then she saw people from Odisha celebrating Pakhla Day in March this year to promote Odia cuisine. She did not need to look any further to take her vision forward. Says Rushina, ""India has such an interesting food calendar, so why not recognise and celebrate it? Our ingredients are specific to seasons. Their uses, cooking methods, combinations, all affect our yearly food habits. Indian dietetics and dining etiquette have all been built into a system of traditional practices with sound reasons behind them. We consume food according to the needs of our bodies which varies with different seasons. For example, we have rich food in the winter, but lighter and easy-to-digest ones in the monsoons. However, the science behind these traditions are fading from our consciousness and before we forget them altogether, I decided that we need to come together and reignite the discussion around them. We will cook food, click pictures, post them online and invite people to talk about them. It will help to spread the word. And an interesting format to pique people's interest is to designate specific days to certain dishes, when they can be celebrated.""The Indian food calendar is currently all spiced up. According to the Indian climate, summer is the best time to grind dry spices and turn them into tangy, peppery, piquant powders that are coveted around the world. And since pickles make extensive use of these flavourful spices, Rushina decided to flag off her vision with the Aam Achar Day (April 22). This way, it celebrated both the legend of Indian spices and the king of Indian summer fruit, mango. Given the success of the Aam Achar Day, Rushina followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day on May 13. The day was marked by a volley of information about papad and badi (dried balls of mashed lentils and spices) being shared on social media, not just by home-cooks but also from professional chefs and restaurateurs. At her studio, Rushina organised a potluck where food enthusiasts from Punjab, Uttaranchal, Gujarat and West Bengal came together and cooked regional dishes made from the regional varieties of papad and badis. Apart from being a learning experience, it also highlighted, once again, the richness of Indian food's variety. Said media professional Meghna Petkar , who took part in both the celebrations, ""I was never a fan of pickles since I felt that they are such a task to make. So, when I heard about this day, I wanted to join and see what goes into making achar. I realised I was scared for nothing. The preparation is simple. Also, it was a gathering of like-minded people who could interact with each other, share tips and masalas and cook too, while getting to learn new things from experts of different communities.""The Aam Achar Day, which was the first in a series of Indian food observance days that Rushina is planning, saw many reminiscing childhood memories, telling stories, sharing recipes, clicking pictures and going live on social media. All of it was curated with a hashtag #AamAcharDay . The result was that word reached a large number of people, and those numbers just grew when she followed it up with the Papad/Badi Day. She shared with us an interesting anecdote from the experience. ""City-based chef, Ashish Bhasin , who was on vacation in Indonesia sent me pictures of Indonesian papads! It was an interesting bit of information that made us realise, papads exist in all the South East Asian countries  just that they are not always made of lentils, but can also be rice and sago based,"" she quipped.From the Kashmiri spice, ver, to the sambhar masala of the South, from the methiyu no masalo of Gujarat to the panch phoron of Bengal, the hot summer month of May is when communities all over the country dry and grind spices to create the powders that lend regional cuisine their characteristic identity. So the next in the series is the Masala Day, which will be observed today, May 20. ""I have planned an Indian food day calendar for this year. Next, for the month of June, I am planning a Biryani Day,"" informed Rushina. It is not surprising that even kids have taken to this favourably, and are all gung-ho about joining their parents to celebrate their favourite dishes. And who can blame them? If there are specific days when we can show off our love for our favourite foods, like achar and biryani, we are all for it!"
59355a527be9e061b1736f06,"At refugee camp, Nikki Haley vows Trump's US won't abandon Syrians",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//world/middle-east/at-refugee-camp-nikki-haley-vows-trumps-us-wont-abandon-syrians/articleshow/58782342.cms,2017-05-22,"ZAATARI REFUGEE CAMP: His skull and jaw wrapped in bandages, the young Syrian refugee stared nonchalantly into a small black box at a supermarket in this sprawling, dust-swept refugee camp. The box scanned his iris to identify him, charged his account and sent him on his way.If the boy noticed US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley watching intently from just a few feet away, he didn't show it. But Haley would later tout the iris-scanners as a fraud-cutting tool boosting efficiency for the more than $6.5 billion the US has spent helping those whose lives have been upended by Syria 's harrowing civil war.Yet as Haley pledged Sunday that the US would increase support, her message was diluted by President Donald Trump 's own vow to put ""America First,"" his planned budget cuts and hardline position on admitting refugees.""We're the No. 1 donor here through this crisis. That's not going to stop. We're not going to stop funding this,"" Haley said. ""The fact that I'm here shows we want to see what else needs to be done.""It was a theme the outspoken ambassador returned to over and over in Jordan at the start of her first trip abroad since taking office. In her stops here and in Turkey _ another Syria neighbor _ Haley is witnessing first-hand the strains placed on countries absorbing the more than 5 million Syrians who have fled the Islamic State group, President Bashar Assad's government, or both.She climbed into the trailer of an 18-wheeler staged at the Ramtha border crossing less than a kilometer (0.6 miles) from Syria, inspecting boxes of peas, tuna and canned meat stacked shoulder-high. The truck was to join 19 others in a convoy into opposition-held territory in Syria, carrying supplies from U.N. agencies and other groups, many US-funded.""This is all in the name of our Syrian brothers and sisters,"" Haley told aid workers in a nearby tent, swatting away flies in the summer heat. ""We want you to feel like the US is behind you.""The US president's message to Syrians couldn't be more different.Trump, who was in Saudi Arabia on his first overseas trip, once called his predecessor ""insane"" for letting in Syrian refugees. As president, he tried to bar them from the US, describing them as a national security threat. A court blocked that move, but the number of Syrian refugees admitted has nonetheless dropped, from 5,422 in the four months before Trump's inauguration to 1,566 in the four months since, US statistics show.And Trump has called for drastic cuts to US funding for the United Nations and its affiliated agencies _ such as those aiding people still in Syria and those who've fled. Trump plans to release his budget blueprint Tuesday, but his initial proposal in March called for a one-third cut to diplomatic and overseas programming while boosting the US military by $54 billion.Haley told reporters accompanying her to Jordan that the US was ""not pulling back"" and was in fact ""engaging more."" She cited Trump's stepped-up action to try to hasten a political solution to the war, including a strike punishing Assad's forces for using chemical weapons that the Syrian opposition and its backers have enthusiastically applauded.She echoed Trump's defense of his plan to temporarily halt refugee admissions from all countries - which was also blocked in court - by saying the US needed to protect Americans by first improving its refugee-vetting capabilities. And she pointed to a group of women in the camp who'd overwhelmingly told her their hope was to return to Syria, not relocate to the US""So our goal is how do we get these people back home to a safe place?"" Haley said.Still, the situation in Zaatari Refugee Camp - like in others in Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and Iraq - tell the story of Syrians who see no quick resolution to their plight.In Zaatari, half of the 80,000 refugees are children, and a dozen babies are born here per day, according to UNICEF , the UN's child welfare agency. Thirty-five percent of marriages involve a child under 18, a reflection of the economic hardships families in the camp face.Many of the younger children wander unsupervised through the camp, where gusts of dust occasionally reduced visibility to just a few feet as Haley's motorcade rolled through the streets, passing sparse, white-corrugated buildings accorded a bit of cheer by colorful murals painted on their walls.As ambassador, Haley plays a key but only partial role in the Trump administration's decision-making on Syria, refugees and humanitarian aid. But her role at the U.N. puts her at the center of the debate about how the global community takes on the crisis. After all, it's successive U.N. Security Council resolutions that created the legal framework for aid groups to send aid into Syria, with or without Assad's consent.At the Marka military airport in Amman, Haley went aboard a cargo plane to get a rare look at high-risk operations to airdrop wheat, lentils and cooking oil into Assad-controlled territory in Deir el-Zour, which is completely surrounded by the Islamic State group. In a sign of Moscow's outsize influence in the Syria conflict, both the aircraft and the company that flies it on behalf of the World Food Programme are Russian.""It's smiles, and tears,"" said David Beasley, WFP's executive director. ""It really is."""

The minister also stated that India is on course to become self reliant in the productions of pulses.While India registered a bumper crop of pulses, which touched 22 million tonnes, the government was able to check the prices of lentils, which in 2015-16 had run away over the roof.The minister claimed that the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojna (PMFBY) has been a successful initiative, as almost 30 per cent of the farmers have come under the crop insurance cover with low premium rates.He added that earlier crop insurance used to be availed only by those farmers who used to take loans, but now the non-loanee farmers have taken the benefits in a large number.Singh also stated that the flagship programme of the Pradhan Mantri Sinchai Yojna has brought about 8.50 lakh hectares of land under irrigation in the current financial year."

593bc9387be9e04956d788b6,Worth going ‘Fidahh’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/worth-going-fidahh/article18587550.ece,2017-05-27,"As Iran elected its president, I was reminded of a band of young Iranian friends I had way back in time. In those days when Jawaharlal Nehru University was where all rebels gathered  though I cant say it has changed much since then, despite all efforts to tame it  they studied in JNU and were greatly critical of the Shah of Iran. As Hassan Rouhani was re-elected, I thought of them, wondered where they were, and decided that we would have an Iranian meal in their memory.So I trotted off to the Food Court in the Nehru Place Metro Terminal, in search of an eatery called Fidahh, where I heard you get good Iranian food. I went there and found that the food is essentially Lebanese (of course, theres a shared culinary heritage in the region), but there are quite a few Iranian dishes, too. There is, for instance, something called jujeh kabab, spiced chicken kababs served with rice and a dip.This is a food court, so you order your dishes and eat at a table at the centre of the court, which has a large sitting area. I asked for some lamb chelo kabab (Rs. 340), which I have often eaten in a restaurant called Peter Cat in Kolkata, a chicken shawarma roll (Rs. 219) and, hoping to be healthy, a fattoush salad (Rs. 185). The chelo kabab was to have come with a bed of rice, a red chilli dip and warm pita bread. There was no pita bread  warm or otherwise  but the kabab was excellent, as was the long grained rice, mildly sweet and spiced.I enjoyed the salad, a mix of lettuce leaves, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions, flavoured with zaatar, a mix of spices often used in the region which lends a tart taste to a dish, mint, olive oil, lemon juice and sumac (a much used herb). This was to have been served with crispy pita bread, but I dont think it was my day for bread, for there was no pita with my salad.Deliciously crunchyWhat I really enjoyed was the chicken shawarma, a roll of chicken and iceberg lettuce, served with hummus. The chicken was excellent, lightly spiced but well flavoured, and the roll itself was deliciously crunchy. I bit into it, and the juices oozed out, giving the dish just the right bit of moistness that it needed.Fidahh sells dips, toothere is the garlicky chickpea hummus, the yoghurt dip tzatziki and the grilled eggplant dip, babaghanoush100 grams for Rs. 160. You can try out the hummus bil lamb, the dip prepared with chickpeas, garlic, tahini and olive oil, served with marinated lamb chunks and pita bread. If you get the pita, that is.The region loves its meat, but they have a great many vegetable dishes too. So Fidahh has quite a comprehensive vegetarian section. Paneer, alas, figures prominently there, thanks to a demand for it, no doubt. The Fidahh special vegetable roll (Rs. 220)  a meal in itselfconsists of red, green and yellow peppers with paneer wrapped in a pita bread. There is spinach and cheese kabab (Rs. 265) and tabulleh wrap (Rs. 199) with tomato, onion, parsley, mint, lentils and pomegranate seeds). There is even something called falafel chaat for Rs. 200.There is a harissa (hot chilli pepper paste) chicken steak with summer grilled vegetables for those who want something substantial. And there are stews for those who like their gravies  lamb, chicken and fish stew that costs between Rs. 300 and Rs. 320.The food is delivered to the neighbourhood. The official address is TDI South Bridge, Shop No 6, Food Court, Lower Ground Floor, Nehru Place Metro Terminal, and the phone numbers are 9911166951 and 9971166951.I liked the look of the place, and the food. Its light, but not bland. And its flavourful but not drowned with spices. I felt sated after my semi-Iranian meal. I thought of friends long gone from my life, and wished them peace, wherever they are."

That is why it is very important for an individual to know about some of the common blood disorders that may affect their life cycle.According to hematologists, people may be affected by different types of blood disorders and blood cancers. Common blood disorders include anemia, bleeding disorders such as hemophilia, blood clots and blood cancers such as leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma.Anemia is the most common blood disorder. A large number of teenagers are anaemic due to poor eating habits. For women, anemia is more precarious with the condition causing complications in pregnancy and even maternal mortality, they pointed out.Iron deficiency anaemia is the commonest medical disorder in pregnancy, which will adversely affect maternal and foetal health. Hemoglobin below 10.5g/ dL can be regarded as anemia regardless of age, said Dr M Ravi Kiran.The main cause of anemia in obstetrics is iron deficiency which can be prevented by eating a well balanced diet that include good source of iron, vitamin B12 and folate, he added.Another common reason for iron deficiency anemia is recurring or small ongoing bleeding, for instance from colon cancer or from stomach ulcers.Depending on the severity of the anemia among the patients, blood transfusion or plasmapheresis may be necessary. Plasmapheresis is a type of blood-filtering procedure. In certain cases, anemia can be detected by a simple blood test called a complete blood count cell (CBC), he said.Symptoms of anaemiaFatigueWeaknessPale or yellowish skinIrregular heartbeats, Shortness of breathDizziness or lightheadednessChest pain, cold hands and feetHeadacheCausesAnemia occurs when your blood doesnt have enough red blood cells. This can happen if:Your body doesnt make enough red blood cells.Bleeding causes you to lose red blood cells more quickly than they can be replacedBody destroys red blood cellsTips to prevent anaemiaEat foods with high iron and vitamins C and B12 content.Take cold baths twice a day to improve blood circulation.Cook your food in iron pots to get increased iron content.Expose your body to early morning sunlight for 10 minutes daily.Include lentils and whole grain cereals in your diet.Include more fresh fruits and vegetables in your diet.Do not have tea, coffee or cocoa with meals.Enjoy a warm water bath mixed with Epsom salt a few times a week.Exercise regularly and include some strength training to increase muscle mass and fight fatigue."

Head chef Cyrus Irani says that this time round they have added layers and more textures with slaw fillings, nachos and crispy onions.First the cocktails; these are generous with beer and summer flavours. Love is in the air is delicious with five spirits, red wine and a hint of lychee. Bulldog Margarita is a cascade of beer thrown into a frozen margarita and Hangmans Blood has dark rum, whiskey, brandy, gin, red wine, and a sweet and sour mix all of it topped with beer.The Quesadilla Burger - MexicoThis was the best among the three veggie burgers. The filling had the right blend of spices and vegetables, but what made it stand out was its tangy enchilada salad. The layers were with polenta slabs made from maize flour, sweet corn, avocado and nachos. The Swiss cheese gave it a creamy finish.The New Delhi BurgerInspired by the capital, this burger has fresh ingredients and bold spices. Even the rocket lettuce, which has an edge of bitterness and peppery hotness, was spiced. It has two patties  golden-fried, spiced veggie patty and herbed lentil patty  layered with marinated tomato, a sharp sauce and the spiced rocket lettuce.Tango Salsa Burger - ArgentinaThis is smoky with hints of sweetness, much like Argentinas tango. Who wouldve thought of putting a fruit in? There is smoky spiced and grilled chicken, laced with honey mustard sauce and topped with cheddar cheese, green apple and rocket slaw. The green apple goes well with grilled chicken.Lebanese Burger - LebanonThis has the diverse flavours from Lebanese cuisine: shawarma-spiced chicken patty, garlic hummus aioli, kofta-spiced onion, mushroom, peppers and creamy feta crumble.The Tennesessee BBQBurger MemphisThis is for a day when you are planning a day outdoors -- when you need to stay full for hours and dont mind smelling of onions. Theres plenty of good meat. It has a juicy beef patty, BBQed soft chicken and a fried egg. The layers are of fried onion, cheddar cheese and the zippy sauce. In all, it is mildly hot.The Riviera Burger - Nice, FranceFood experts and cookbook authors adore the Mediterranean cuisine. This burger embraces all that the coast has to offer -- there is the herby chimichurri cream laced with spicy mango aioli, cheddar cheese and fresh slaw. The cheese evens out the zing of herbs and garlic.The Sucker Punch -Las VegasThe star here is the grilled beef patty oozing cream cheese, cheddar and jalapeno. It has been paired with coleslaw, perfectly pulled pork, bacon and a sauce that has the final say. The sauce is an acquired taste, much like that feisty friend who talks the loudest."

NSS volunteers of Government Model Boys Higher Secondary School, Attingal have added another attribute to the qualities of a good pen. An eco-friendly pen. A pen that doesnt pollute the environment once the ink finishes. Today everyone uses ball point pens, which are made of plastic. The amount of pens discarded every second is alarming and so the importance of eco-friendly alternatives gain strength.Ezhuthu (vithu) vidya is the answer to environmental problem posed by the plastic pens. The cover and cap of the pen are made of paper and has a seed at the bottom. The seed at the bottom is likely to grow into a plant when the pen is discarded, says Abhin, who is in charge of the pen making.The volunteers wanted to make the eco-friendly pens besides providing employment to women at Karichayil village which the NSS unit has adopted. The two production units in the villages employs 10 women.The students trained the women. They procure the raw materials including the seeds from the market. Seeds of papaya, ladies finger, lentils, amaranthus and cucumber are mainly used. Each pen costs Rs 10. A nine-member team comprising Malavika, Reshma, Ragendu, Pournami, Abhin, Chandu and Sharat Mohan are behind the pen making team.The pens made by the NSS unit have become a hit and are being ordered in bulk by the organisers of workshops and conference in the city. We got an order for 1,000 pens from Milma for their annual meeting on June 14. Similarly, Secretariat Employees Association has ordered 3,000 pens, said Programme Officer Manoj C V.Recently the unit held a sale in front of the Secretariat and managed to sell 250 pens in a single day. They money collected was donated to the Regional Cancer Centre here, said Manoj.As the World Environment Day(June 5) approaches, the NSS team and their production units have become very busy. Orders are pouring in from schools and other educational institutions.The stock of 1,200 pens have been given away to various schools for their environment day celebrations. The NSS unit plans to launch a district level training programme in pen making next week."

To start the Telanagana Bhojnam we were served a cool drink, Salla charu, prepared with sour curd, fresh mint leaves and condiments.Not only was it soothing, its taste was perfect for a hot summer afternoon I.e,. the spices added the flaavour and didnt burnt the stomach or the tongue.For the starters we had Gudaalu, Sakinalu, Karam Billalu, Chanaga Pappu Garelu, Sarva Pindi, Kodi Fry, Chepa Fry, Mirchi Bhajji, and Kodi Koora with puris. The mirchi bhajji was quite a hit even with expats as we saw them savouring a mouthful from their plates. Kodi Koora was nice cooked as the chicken pieces seemed to have taken nicely to the hot spices and tasted perfect with the soft freshly-fried fluffy puris.The real spicy food items were served for the main course. Chef Srikanth and Yadiah had curated the menu. They shared, The state food uses a lot of locally grown vegetables and curd to minimise the effect of spices. The famous chilis of the state put our tongues on fire as we tasted Oori Koodi Koora, spicy country chicken cooked the way it is prepared in rural pockets of Telangana. The heat was balanced when we tried it with steamed rice.Adding Mamidikaya Pappu, lentil soup prepared with raw mangoes gave a feel as we were dining at somebodys home. In the vegetarian section one can try Vankaya Tamata, brinjal and tomato curry and Chikkudukaya Koora, broadbeans curry.After a heated delicious food trail we tried the dessert platter comprising Bakshalu, jaggery filled stuffed flat bread, Parvannam and Rava laddu. Bakshalu was so delectable that we had more of it. Charges: Rs 1,486 for lunch."

Another specialty here is the Chicken Hakimi (Rs 500), essentially tandoori chicken soaked in a thin liquid concoction of buttermilk, chaat masala and butter.Bheja, Kaleji or Gurda MasalaBa-Barkat, Nagdevi StreetHere, your choice of meat, bheja (lamb brain), kaleji (lamb heart) or gurda (lamb kidney; Rs 180), is pound with some oil, tomatoes, onions, chillies and lemon juice to form a dish that has the consistency of egg bhurjee.Bhel Bara HandiSurti, Bohri MohallaLocated a stones throw away from Tawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Surti is famous for its Bara Handi, and sees huge crowds during Ramzan. The dish acquires its name from the 12 vessels that traditionally have different types of pulse-based gravies, each containing a different cut of mutton or tenderloin. The one served at Surti, however, is a banquet of seven gravies. While each of the gravies can be had by itself, a dish called the Bhel (Rs 150), which combines all the different gravies, is also served here. The ensuing gravy is a union of mutton, dal and garam masalas.Aab GoshtCafe Nizari, Bhendi BazarDunk some pillowy and slightly sour pav (Rs 7) into a bowlful of rich fiery mutton stew (Rs 70) primarily prepared with gram lentil, tomatoes and onions.Baida RotiMastan Talao, Nagdevi StreetA meal in itself, the Baida Roti (Rs 100) found at Nagdevi Street, is an Iftar must-have. A thick layer of minced keema or chicken is sandwiched between two hot and fluffy flour-based rotis that are coated with egg.Chicken TandooriTawakkal Tandoori Chicken, Nagdevi StreetThe Chicken Tandoori (Rs 110) served at the buzzy stall located on Nagpada Street is another local legend. Juicy and tender pieces are coated with a marination of your choice. The three varieties of tandoori are chicken malai (marinated in creamy yoghurt, ginger, garlic and chilli), hariyali (coated with a paste of coriander, mint leaves, ginger, garlic and lemon juice) and the regular chicken tikka masala.Reshmi Special MalpuaBadri Mithai, Nagdevi StreetWatching Reshmi Special Malpua (Rs160) being made is almost hypnotic. Batches of dough, prepared with maida, sugar, saffron, milk, cardamom, semolina, etc., are dipped in a vessel of hot oil and fried till the outsides of the dough turn golden brown and crisp. The resultant is a steaming hot pancake that leaves you with a saccharine aftertaste the entire night.

The state goes to polls next year and analysts and political commentators feel the current turmoil might turn the farming community against the ruling party.The BJP is keeping up a brave face for the moment, saying the crisis will pass. This was completely Congress sponsored violence. In such a situation the Congress will not gain anything politically. The state government has fulfilled almost every demand of the farmers in the past over 10 years, insisted former MP and veteran BJP leader Kailash Sarang.But many others disagree. Congress has really benefited in the short term, but it remains to be seen if it would be able to cash in on the situation in the long run, said political commentator Girijashankar.In a state where farmers account for a sizable chunk of the 50 million electorate, the political ramifications of the farmer deaths could be huge. A nervous state government initially attempted to deny the complicity of the police after news broke that farmers agitating for better crop prices had been fired on in Mandsaur on Tuesday. Through the day, chief minister Chouhan and home minister Bhupendra Singh went on record to say, Police didnt fire at the farmers.By evening however, the tone and tenor of party leaders had turned defensive. The home minister admitted that the police personnel fired in at the crowd in self-defence. The government also increased the compensation to the families of the deceased farmers from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 1 crore, the largest ex-gratia payment in Madhya Pradesh so far.Farmers torch trucks at Mhow-Neemuch Highway in Mandsaur district of Madhya Pradesh on Wednesday. (PTI Photo)Many, including those even in the administration, are blaming the chief minister. First, he had reportedly refused to acknowledge the agitation when it began on June 1, and then dubbed the protesters as anti-social elements after the demonstrations turned violent.Rather than engaging with the farmers, the chief minister is also accused of seeking to divide them by ignoring their leaders such as Shivkumar Sharma and Anil Yadav. Instead, he struck a bargain with the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), a farmer body associated with the Rashritya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). The BKS immediately announced its withdrawal from the agitation on Sunday evening, further angering the farmers across western Madhya Pradesh.To make matters worse, state BJP president Nandkumar Singh Chauhan said the farmers affiliated with the BKS would felicitate the CM for defusing the agitation by marginally raising the procurement prices for onions and lentils. The statement alienated the farmers more, even forcing the BKS to distance itself from the planned felicitation.A state of farmersThe tragic events in Mandsaur have given fresh ammunition for another round of political slug fest.Congress, the principal opposition party in the state, is trying to seize the opportunity and punch holes in the state governments claim of successfully turning around the agrarian economy.Accusing the government of betraying the farmers, Congress spokesman Bhupendra Gupta said chief minister Chouhan spoke of farmers welfare all these years but did precious little. Gupta has also been quick to add that the Congress was a real well-wisher of the farmers.The party is hoping that following the Mandsaur violence, the perception would grow that economic benefits have bypassed the farmers.State BJP spokesman Rajneesh Agarwal, however, defended the state government and maintained that Congress plans would come to a naught, pointing to the Central-governments Krishi Karman award that Madhya Pradesh won five times in a row and the states annual agricultural growth of about 20%. These figures, he said, spoke of the prosperity of farmers in Madhya Pradesh."
5a05dfa79855b76bf13c1857,With love from Hyderabad,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/with-love-from-hyderabad/article18953100.ece,2017-06-10,"This is one of my favourite times of the year. Not because of the promise of rain, but because of the promise of haleem.In some parts of the country, haleem  a superb dish of mashed meat, cracked wheat and a mix of dals  is prepared only during Ramzan. You get it through the year in Delhi, and I do have it at all times, but I always look forward to getting my haleem from Hyderabad, where it is a Ramzan special.Ever since I got to know, a few years ago, that Hyderabads Pista House was couriering haleem to places outside the city during these four weeks, I have been getting my haleem from there.Pista House is a well-known restaurant and bakery in Hyderabad. Though largely known for its sweets and biscuits, its haleem is special.This time, too, I placed my order on an online service for a tub of haleem from Pista House  or I thought I did. Last year, my haleem came in a green tub; this time it was a white bucket. So I looked at it and closely and discovered it was not from Pista House, but from Shah Ghouse, another Hyderabad eatery. I called Pista House and learnt that they werent sending out their haleem this year.But I am not complaining at all about Shah Ghouses haleem. In fact, I thought it was outstanding. The mash was just right  not chewy or stringy, but just thick enough to come up easily on a spoon. I garnished it with fried onions (fried on low heat), slivers of ginger and chopped green chillies. On top of that, I squeezed some lime juice  and it became mouth-wateringly good!I often come across people who ask me how haleem is cooked. So let me give you a basic recipe for the dish (cooked with 500 gm boneless lamb, 1-1/2 cups cracked wheat, 1 tbsp channa dal, 1 tbsp moong dal, 1 tbsp masoor dal  roughly for four people).Rinse and soak the broken wheat and the dals. Let it soak for five hours or so and then drain the water. In a large pot, fry sliced onions in oil or ghee. Add cardamom, cinnamon and clove and fry some more. Add the meat and a pinch of red chilli and turmeric powders. Fry till the oil rises to the top. Now add water and cook till the meat is tender. Once done, mash it well. Now add garam masala, coriander and cumin powders, mint leaves and curd (and a bit of ghee if you wish to) and let it simmer for 10 or 15 minutes. Meanwhile, in another pot, boil the dals and the wheat in 10 cups of water, along with salt, peppercorn and turmeric powder. When done, turn off the heat. Add the meat mix to the dal mix. Now mash it really well with a ladle till its nice and mushy. Put this back on the fire, and let it simmer, stirring now and then, till the dal and meat have really mixed well  say, 45 minutes to an hour. Take it off the heat, and serve with the garnishing of your choice.If you dont want to go through the trouble, just order in! I like my Hyderabad haleem for two reasons. One, it is indeed delicious. The other reason is the ease with which I get it. I log on to gaticonnect.com. There is a band right on top, and I click on haleem (ignoring such attractive lures as jewellery and pearls and health and wellness). It takes me to the haleem page, and I place my order. A kilo is for Rs. 799 (its Rs. 599 if you buy it in Hyderabad).There have been occasions when I have got the consignment on the same night, roughly around 10 or 11 p.m. This time it came a day late, but I did get a notice from Gati to say that it had been delayed. The haleem comes well-packaged. You take it out of the container and its ready to be demolished.Just heat it  and eat it."

(File Photo) Earlier on Saturday, Madhya Pradesh CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on an indefinite fast at Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal for restoration of peace. (File Photo)The wholesale agriculture market in Mandsaur, one of the largest in Madhya Pradesh, wore a deserted look as agitating farmers stayed away from it for the 10th day on Saturday, leading to losses running into several crore rupees. The Mandsaur Krishi Upaj Mandi, spread over 30 hectares of land on the outskirts of the town, saw a sharp dip in the arrival of farm produce on June 1, when the farmers stir, demanding better price for their produce and a loan waiver, began in the state. The mandi normally attracts about 5,000 farmers everyday from several districts of Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan and records an average daily turnover of Rs 4 to 5 crore.Since June 2, trading activities have come to a complete halt and the market remained empty, causing losses of several crore rupees, said M S Muniya, the secretary of the market committee.The market mainly deals in wheat, garlic, coriander and lentil.The mandi committee, which collects a levy on the sale, has suffered a loss of Rs 10 lakh so far and its 400-odd traders too have incurred huge losses.The stir has hit us badly. There has been no business for the past 10 days. But we have to pay our employees and workers, said Bablu Agarwal, a trader.Another trader, Narendra Anna, echoed Agarwals views and expressed hoped that the situation will become normal soon.Scores of daily wagers too bore the brunt of the agitation. With no income, they had to struggle to make ends meet.The market committee secretary hoped that once the curfew was lifted, farmers will return to the market with their produce.A curfew was imposed after five people were killed in police firing when the farmers agitation turned violent on June 6. Later, another farmer Ghanashyam Dhakad (26), died in Badavan village in the violence-hit Mandsaur district.The villagers alleged that the local BJP MP and MLAs have not visited them yet.The Mandsaur-Neemuch region, about 300 km from the state capital Bhopal, was the nerve centre of the stir. Later, protests spread to some other parts of the state.Earlier on Saturday, Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan sat on an indefinite fast at Dussehra Maidan in Bhopal for restoration of peace. He has appealed to farmers to come to Dussehra Maidan and have a dialogue with him.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

After luscious dates and cool water, the first delicacy during Ramzan, anyone in the city gorges on, is a steaming hot bowl of haleem topped with spoonfuls of ghee, finely chopped coriander and mint leaves along with crushed ringlets of fried onions.But why Ramzan? The dish, similar to porridge, is known to be a complete meal in itself given it is cooked with a variety of lentils, broken wheat, a handful of rice, mutton and is cooked slowly on wood-fire for at least 12 hours to get that near-to-perfect paste like texture. In almost all the restaurants and even in roadside eateries of the city, you get this silken meat delicacy.The least modification that one gets in it is the inclusion of chicken, which is equally sought after. Imagine, while there are just two varieties of haleem, what happens when one gets to savour 11 types of the dish whose meat choice ranges from turkey, fish, prawn, and even duck.Haleem, especially the Hyderabadi version itself, is a refined version of what it used to be. Several soldiers from the Central Asia came to Hyderabad to serve in the Nizams army.City-based historian Sajjad Shahid shares, The dish was originally introduced by migrants from Arab countries. It was Saif Nawaz Jung, an Yemeni Arab chief the erstwhile Nizam state who popularised haleem. In fact, it was harees that was introduced to the princely state of Hyderabad.The dish is still available in its original form at Barkas. Later the cooks in the city added their own condiments, and modified the dish which is now the haleem that is so lovingly relished. And mind you, Hyderabadi haleem is the first non-veg dish to get a GIS (Geographical Indication Certificate) certification which means the dish has to meet the standards set for it otherwise it is disqualified as haleem!Now given the regal prestige haleem holds on a Ramzan dastarkhwan (tablelcloth), a few food snobs might turn into food Nazis and discard any other meat other than mutton with their stiff upper lip. But it will be interesting if they try the 11 flavours we are talking about.It took a Parsi and Bombay street food cafe to introduce the 11 variants of haleem and surprisingly the same didnt come from the traditional restaurants and eateries of the city. The not-so-old SodaBottleOpenerWala cafe has a treat for the devotees this Ramzan. Its not just chicken and mutton theres more to this Gyarah Handi Haleem. You get to taste Turkey Haleem, Prawn Haleem and even Duck Haleem. Then theres Special Chicken Haleem, Special Mutton Haleem, Anaidas Original Persian Haleem, Chicken Haleem, Mutton Haleem, Fish Haleem and something for the vegetarians as well: Roasted Corn Haleem and Veg Haleem.One of the best from the selection is Special Mutton Haleem topped with Talawa Gosht. Anaidas Original Persian Haleem has singer Anaidas own secret Persian recipe which stood out with its balanced taste and silken texture. Duck Haleem is worth trying. One mustnt miss Roasted Corn Haleem.Despite being a hardcore non-vegetarian, I loved the dish which tasted more of a comfort food for me with the delicious corn kernels and hot paste it consists of. Shaaz Mehmood, one of the partners of the cafe summed it up, Nowhere else you get such variety of the dish. To make it complete they are going to serve shirmal along with the steaming hot bowl of haleem(s). Bon apetit Hyderabad!Price: Rs 200-450 for non-veg haleem, Rs 150 for veg haleem"
593dce347be9e00ed19a378c,Growing supply glut threatens worse to come for restive Indian farmers,http://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/growing-supply-glut-threatens-worse-to-come-for-restive-indian-farmers/story-37XdpVzg3oQTxBRxTK4BgO.html,2017-06-11,"Bountiful monsoon rains are unlikely to lift Indias rural economy this year, and may instead compound the woes of millions of debt-ridden farmers who are struggling with low prices amid a glut of produce such as lentils, oilseeds and cereals.India is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last years record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments.Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week.Three years into his term, Prime Minister Narendra Modi remains popular and has no credible challenger. Yet unrest has flared in states ruled by his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), catching regional leaders flat-footed and providing a reality check on Modis promise to double farmers incomes over the next five years.The next year will be challenging for the government in ensuring farmers get decent realisation, said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra are demanding better prices for their produce and billions of dollars in debt relief after the new BJP government in Indias most populous state, Uttar Pradesh, recently announced a $5.6 billion loan write-off for farmers.Yet experts say such loan waivers amount to quick fixes that cannot compensate for flaws in farm policies, which have encouraged higher production of crops previously in short supply but offered scant protection on prices.Many farm commodities are trading below support prices set by the government. That is because the government only commits serious sums to buying wheat and rice, but not other crops that enrich the diet of Indias 1.3 billion people.Prices will fall further unless exports are revived, said Galipelli, adding production has jumped but local demand hasnt risen in the same proportion. Ample world supply is likely to persist, predicts agribusiness giant Cargill Inc.There is no export parity right now. Even after the recent correction in oilmeal prices, Indian supplies are expensive, said B.V. Mehta, executive director of the Solvent Extractors Association (SEA), a Mumbai-based trade body.Indore: Farmers stage protest at Indore-Bhopal highway on Friday. (PTI)Indian grains production reached an all-time high of 273.38 million tonnes in the latest crop year, on record output of rice, wheat, oilseeds and pulses. But exports failed to revive, depressing local prices of corn, wheat, soybean and turmeric.Exports of key farm commodities fell by a quarter in 2015/16 to $16.07 billion due to drought, and failed to revive in 2016/17 despite the recovery in output.Rural distressA rising population, shrinking farm plots and increasing indebtedness among farmers have all hit Indias vast rural hinterlands. Farming accounts for 14 percent of gross domestic product - down from 47 percent at independence 70 years ago.Nearly a third of rural households are in debt, owing an average of more than 100,000 rupees ($1,560). Many farmers lack access to formal credit, forcing them to borrow dearly from money lenders or relatives.To mitigate this distress, state and central governments have ramped up purchases of red chilli, turmeric, corn, onion, sunflower, pigeon peas and groundnut from farmers.Still, farmers such as Sanjay Shinde from Maharashtras Nashik district are unhappy. If Uttar Pradesh can waive all farmers debts, then why not Maharashtra? he asked.Reserve Bank of India Governor Urjit Patel has warned that such loan waivers - forecast by BofA Merrill Lynch to reach $40 billion - would weaken already-strained state finances. It is a path that we need to tread very carefully, he said this week.Analysts and traders say good monsoon rains - forecast at 98 percent of the long-term average - will only complicate matters unless supplies are adequately managed.There is an urgent need to restrict imports and promote exports. Thats how one can bring down the inventory level of food grains, says Nitin Kalantri, a miller at Latur in Maharashtra.Otherwise in the next season we will have much a bigger problem. And much bigger farmers protests."

He put a demand for 2,000 metric tonnes of red lentils, black gram and chickpea on an e-commerce site.Police said a trading company based in Kimberley offered him supply at lowest rates. Rahul said he contacted its officials and he was told 1 metric tonne would be supplied for 150 dollars.The process was initiated in middle of January this year and he was told to make advance payment. He immediately transferred money to their account with a bank in Johannesburg, police said.After a few days, they sent Rahul samples of pulses through courier from Johannesburg. Rahul and his father were given documents of the shipment, which were later found fake. Rahul started inquiring about the delivery of shipment but they kept asking for money, said superintendent of police (city), Arun Kumar Singh.Police said that from January end to March 22, Rahul allegedly transferred Rs 60 lakh to the trading company on the demand of its co-director, identified as one Raymond.But Rahuls order never reached him. He contacted them again on April 30 and they told him his shipment will reach by May 3. The delay made him suspicious and he searched the phone number on Google, which showed it was spam.On April 30, I called them again and inquired about the shipment. I was told on May 3, the shipment will reach a port in Mumbai. The man identified as Oliver told me that I have to pay Rs8 lakh to their man in Mumbai for its release from the port. I did not make any payment and told my father about it, said Rahul.Rahuls father Raj Kumar Anand took up the matter with the Uttar Pradesh police on its official Twitter handle on May 3. Within 20 minutes, Raj Kumar Anand was contacted by the officials of Cyber Cell Noida and he went to them and explained the sequence of events.We received all details and sent him to Phase-3 police station where a case was registered. Subsequently, a team started working on it. A team traced the location of the man who was told to take Rs8 lakh from Rahul. His location was Nala Sopara in Maharashtra and he was arrested on May 8, Arun Kumar Singh said.The man was identified as Charles Naemeka alias Devon, 37, a Nigerian national. He was brought on transit remand to Noida on Sunday for the investigation of the case.Police said Naemeka had come to Mumbai in November 2008 on a 30-day tourist visa. Phones, laptops and SIM cards were recovered from his possession.Singh said, The process has been initiated to freeze the amount in the bank. This matter will be taken up with the embassy for redressal. The complainant is also planning to take up the matter with home ministry and external affairs ministry so that investigations are initiated by Interpol.Rahul told cyber cell officials that Naemeka was not ready to meet him face to face and had a chat with him on Skype for the payment. Cyber cell officials said Naemeka had given him two bank accounts for the transfer of Rs 8 lakh.The details of chats had been taken by the cyber cell and investigations are going on into the matter.Raymond was my friend on Facebook for two years and I do not know him personally. We have two mutual friends and he texted me on Facebook to take money from a client. I do not know that he was doing an illegal business, Naemeka said."

The officials captured nearly 20 birds and a handful of guinea pigs from these fortune tellers.The fortune tellers were charged under Section 4 of Wildlife Act 1972, said Forest Ranger P Murugesan, who was involved in the operation. These birds are locked in tiny cages and abused in the process of training and are left with chopped wings, he said. He added that while birds are being intimidated, even clients are manipulated and cheated.Around 100 fortune tellers make a living out of these birds in Marina beach alone, estimate Forest Department officials. Some fortune tellers even use guinea pigs to pick up cards.The Parrot Astrologers, commonly known as kili josiar, have a different story to tell.Rose-ringed parakeets or pachakili have been an integral part of Chennai beaches. When the clock strikes 4pm, one fortune teller after another step into the beach. They pace around the beach with tiny wooden boxes swinging in their hands.The single opening in the front of the box is lined with vertical metal bars. A parakeet or sometimes, even a guinea pig peeps from between the rods. Their fast footsteps falter when they see a couple crouched in the shades of unopened food stalls.Their face lights up if they see a group of noisy youngsters laughing and making fun of one another. These are hot spots of business. Catchy one-liners grab attention of these curious customers.Aana porakka vendiyava, penna poranthutta! (You have the soul of a man, but born as a woman), You will get a husband like lord Ram! and others that either invoke curiosity or humour. Once theyve sold their pick-up lines, they sit down and set the cage on the dune and spread a small cloth or rubber mat. Jakkamma! Amma Mahalakshmi, Ayya Manickam, they summon the parakeets calling their names, from the cage as they set a deck of cards on the mat.Enter parakeet. After waiting a while, the bird simply walks back into the cage. The fortune teller summons the bird again, only this time, he twirls a grain in his hand. With its eyes glued to the grain, the parakeet picks up one card after another and drops it on the mat. He drops the grain and it finally holds one up signalling a hand-over.He mutters a prayer to God Muruga and asks the parakeet to pray too before giving a few shards of grain. The bird after eating her fill, steps back into the cage.""They grow with us like our children. We wake up together and eat rice thrice a day. We keep water in a bowl because we also feed them grains,"" he said. ""Manickam eats Sambhar rice, lentil rice and curd rice. How do you think he got through this summer without curd rice?"" he asks. During the day, the birds are said to flutter freely around the house and in the evenings, they are packed in their cages and go with their 'parents' for work.""This is the only profession I know. Now my Manickam has been taken away,"" rued Muthukumar. 'Manickam is the Tamil equivalent of Ruby and the gem stone is supposed to bring prosperity to its owner. ""My uncle sells clothes in whole-sale.

Farmers in both states have held protests demanding better prices for their crops and for crores of rupees of their debt waived off. Farmers unions threatened to intensify their agitation if the government did not heed their requests by next week.Read the story here.2) Growing supply glut may stoke more discontent among Indian farmersBountiful monsoon rains are unlikely to lift Indias rural economy this year, and may instead compound the woes of millions of debt-ridden farmers who are struggling with low prices amid a glut of produce such as lentils, oilseeds and cereals. India is still carrying a huge inventory of food grains from last years record harvest as exports were hit by an appreciating rupee, falling global prices and restrictions on overseas shipments. Another bumper harvest could accelerate the price slide and stoke discontent among farmers that has triggered protests in the big agrarian states of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where police shot dead five protesting farmers this week.Read the story here.3) GST Council lowers tax rates for 66 items, including insulin, printers and incense sticksThe GST Council lowered tax rates on 66 items such as pickles, incense sticks, some movie tickets and printers after industries and states complained that the goods will become too expensive when the new indirect taxation system kicks in from July 1. The panel, chaired by Union finance minister Arun Jaitley and consisting of his counterparts from all states, had divided almost all goods and services into four tax brackets when it last met in Srinagar in May. But a number of industries opposed the tax classification, and Jaitley said that the panel had received a request to review the levies.Read the story here.4) Congress leader apologises after gali ka gunda remark against army chiefCongress leader Sandeep Dikshit on Sunday withdrew his controversial statement made on army chief General Bipin Rawat and tendered an apology for the same.

A controversy erupted after Diskhit asserted that General Rawat shouldnt make statements like a sadak ka gunda (a road-side goon).Read the story here.5) Strike call: Darjeeling tense as GJM, Bengal govt head for showdownThe stand-off between the West Bengal government and the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM) over an indefinite strike called by the regional party from Monday is showing no signs of abatement, with both sides refusing to back down. The Mamata Banerjee government on Sunday issued an order mandating all government offices across Darjeeling and Kalimpong districts to remain open, making it clear that there should be no disruption of life on account of the strike. The GJM leadership challenged the order, stating that any repressive tactic employed by the state government would be met with more intense agitations.Read the story here.6) Want to step down as attorney general, return to private practice: Mukul RohatgiAttorney general Mukul Rohatgi has told the government that he wants to step down as the countrys top law official.

The irony is that while the availability of clean water is coming down drastically, huge quantities of waste water generated by growing population is polluting the water bodies.It poses a two-dimensional challenge of conserving clean water and recycling the used water. Otherwise, humanity is going to pay a price for their complacency, which brings in the sensitive issue of assessing the value of water.It is akin to the saying of an ancient mariner that there is water, water everywhere but not a single drop to drink.Experts in water management expressed their opinion in the CII Summit here recently on the Sustainable Water that since the poor cannot afford to pay for it, an appropriate price has to be extracted from others to instil a sense of discipline among the users. According to them water, like a fragile object, should be handled with care. The question is who will do the pricing and on what basis. It is a topic everyone would like to talk about for the sake of rhetoric but who will bell the cat?Chopping trees on Environment DayWhile the world celebrated the Environment Day by planting saplings, organising seminars and awareness programmes on June 5, it was observed in Vijayawada by cutting trees.Many big trees were chopped off along the Bandar Road on the pretext of widening road. The government has taken up the laying of a six-lane road from Vijayawada to Machilipatnam a few days ago and several trees were slayed.Hundreds of trees hit the road in the last two years and green pastures disappeared after the government had announced the State capital in this region.Trunks of the trees were found on either side of roads on the city outskirts and the officials are not bothered to use technology of relocating trees.A surefire recipe for successThe city is brimming with temporary bhattis (cauldrons) to dish out the seasons most sought-after dish -- haleem.The gooey goodness of haleem, originally an Arabic dish and introduced to the Hyderabad State by the Chaush people during the Nizam rule, have found many takers in the city over the years.So popular is this meat-and-lentil meal that in the past, many youngsters would travel all the way to Hyderabad to relish the ubiquitous delicacy, which is one of the many good things Ramzan brings every year.Though the number of counters serving haleem has increased this season manifold there is crowd everywhere and so none is complaining.Sporting wide grins, owners of eateries talk of how they are running out of stock much before the closure of their shops. But ask them for the recipe they become tight-lipped. Interestingly, each one has developed our own secret recipe that cant be shared.As long as it is delicious and connoisseurs polish off cans full of the delicacy, who cares about the secret recipe, says a foodie.Every rice ball bumpsVideos of rice ball bumping when hit on the floor fuelled the plastic rice news reported by many news channels.And everyone started believing that every rice ball that bumps is made of plastic rice. But a look into basic properties of rice that has a high content of starch will debunk the goof-up made by a few and blindly believed by many. According to experts, rice balls made of cooked grains upon being compressed attain a certain amount of elasticity due to the presence of starch. When the ball is hit against a surface it reacts. The harder it is pressed, the bumpier it becomes. One can try this at home.V. Raghavendra, Rajulapudi Srinivas, P. Sujatha Varma and Tharun Boda"

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"
5a5312af9855b770e037d03b,Problem of Plenty: How a Bountiful Harvest Brought Farm Sector to Its Knees,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/problem-of-plenty-how-a-bountiful-harvest-brought-farm-sector-to-its-knees/story-8lfrrhXToi3WR8KeCzCxTK.html,2017-06-13,"Duty-free imports and a plentiful harvest caused a near-50% dip in food item prices in the wholesale market and by 14-20% in retail, data released by the government shows. This phenomenon gave rise to violent protests by farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The death of six farmers in clashes with the police in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur district brought the farm crisis into national focus, uniting the Opposition against the National Democratic Alliance government. The Centre, for its part, reiterated its promise of doubling farmers income by 2020.The indicators of how farm produce prices crashed this year became clear on Monday, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released. One can understand the reasons for farm distress in a bumper crop year by comparing CPI prices with the latest wholesale prices of pulses and vegetables in agricultural markets.The index showed that vegetable prices fell by about 13.5% in May, as compared to the corresponding month last year. The dip in the price of pulses was even higher, at 19.5%. This led to an overall deflation of 1.05% in food prices for the first time since 2012.The fall was higher in wholesale markets, where farmers offload their produce, with pulses and vegetables selling at nearly two-thirds (or 63%) of last years price. It was a sad year for farmers despite having a bumper crop after two tough years (of drought), observed T Haque, former head of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP).MANDI REPORT Main produce of each state suffered as prices crashedMain produce of each state suffered as prices crashedIn many states, the farmers have not even been able to recover the input costs, he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the states to ensure that agriculturists are provided with a price cushion.Highs and lowsIndias farm sector production grew by 8% this year, the highest ever.According to agriculture ministry data, the production of pulses amounted to 22.14 million tones  50% higher than 2014-15. Horticultural products, for their part, witnessed a growth of over 40%.However, the high production caused an unprecedented glut in farm markets already loaded with imported food items  including pulses. The government imposed 10% duty on these items in May, after prices crashed.In 2015-16, the Centre had allowed the import of pulses such as pigeon peas (tur dal) and lentils (mosur) to check rising prices even as the Opposition accused it of failing to control food inflation. The resultant glut in the market caused prices to come crashing, and the dip was as low as 80% for commodities such as onions and pigeon peas.I could not find a buyer for my produce for two whole days, said Mandsaur farmer Rakesh Patidar, who was finally left with no option but to sell his onions for Re 1 per kg in mid-May.Many farmers like Rakesh started growing onions after their prices skyrocketed in 2014, leading to a significant increase in its area under cultivation. Pigeon peas witnessed a similar trend in 2015 owing to crop failure.It seems like farmers were not looking at anything else, said a senior agriculture ministry functionary on the record production of onion and pigeon peas. They thought onions and pigeon peas would fetch them a good price, but they lost money instead.Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs violence-hit Malwa region, who have been growing onions since 2015, are now witnessing a dip in prices for the second year in a row. The situation is similar in many parts of Maharashtra, where the state government has now announced loan waivers.India is not the only country to have witnessed a steep fall in prices of pulses and vegetables this year. According to agriculture ministry officials, there has been an over 50% dip in prices across the globe due to a demand crunch. However, unlike India, farmers in other countries have the requisite infrastructure to store their produce and sell when prices stabilise."

Janarthanam, secretary of Vellore Navathaaniya Mandi Vyabarigal Sangam, the rate of pulses has been dipping since demonetisation as traders were apprehensive of stocking up pulses.Nobody is keeping stock as of now. If there is less supply, the price is shooting up, if the supply increases, the rates are dropping. It has become like a daily market scenario, he said.He noted that the production of pulses was more last year.The rates have been reducing after the demonetisation of Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes. It has not increased. The demand for pulses is also poor for the last two months, he added.In the wholesale market, a kilo of toor dhal (thuvaram parappu) costs Rs. 55 to Rs. 65, while Bengal gram (kadalai parappu) is priced at Rs. 70 to Rs. 75 a kg. A kilo of urad dhal (ulatham parappu) costs Rs. 80 to Rs. 86, while green gram dhal (paasi parappu) is priced at Rs. 65 to Rs. 72, and masoor dhal (pink lentil) costs Rs. 50 a kg, he said.As a result, business was dull in the wholesale market.The price might increase by Rs. five if the government procures pulses. Though the government had announced that it would procure pulses, it was not doing so, he added."

The booklet recommends hanging ""good and beautiful pictures"" on bedroom walls, which, it says, will also have a positive impact on the foetus.""People can have their dietary preferences but there is no reason why one should deliberately avoid non-vegetarian food and eggs. They are good sources of iron and protein.""For example, fish is a rich source of omega-3 fatty and docosahexaenoic acid which helps in the development of the brain of baby,"" said Loveleena Nadir, senior consultant at Fortis Hospital.But if a woman is vegetarian, then they should supplement their meals with enough sprouts, lentils, paneer and milk products, Nadir said.Professor of Gynaecology at AIIMS, Neerja Bhatla said there was also scientific study which says that women during their pregnancy should abstain from sex and or should control their sexual feelings and behaviour.""It is true that there are some high-risk pregnancies in which the women may be advised not to indulge in intercourse but otherwise in normal cases there is no such restriction,""As far as controlling lust is concerned, Bhatla said sexual behaviour is a part of normal life and therefore such recommendations have no ""rationale"".Supporting Bhatla, Dr H P Anand from Safdarjung Hospital said that such recommendations were irrational and without any evidence.Bhatla, however, supported the recommendations like avoiding tea, coffee, fried and oily items during pregnancy and said it is always advised that the pregnant women should control their anger and live in a positive environment, think positive and remain happy and peaceful."

Why should we have to wait here in this long queue to get aid?We used to have a dream life and weve fallen all the way down to the bottom, said the 38-year-old mother of two, declining to give her full name for fear of reprisals against family members left behind in districts still under jihadist control.IS seized the northern city of Mosul in June 2014 and imposed a brutal form of Islamist rule and a regime of terror on its inhabitants.Life has been made even harder since the battle launched last October by Iraqi security forces to drive out IS. East Mosul and a large part of the west is now back in government hands.In their no-holds-barred defence, the jihadists have used civilians -- caught in the crossfire and already the victims of food, water and electricity shortages -- as human shields.I break the (dawn-to-dusk Ramadan) fast with whatever I can find. Sometimes we even find sand and worms in the water we have to drink, said Umm Mohammed.She was among the women, children and the elderly standing in line amidst the rubble of pulverised buildings and the carcasses of burnt-out cars, many of them protecting their heads from the blistering sun with towels or rags.- What sort of life is this? -Another mother, Umm Yussef, stood nearby in tears, having failed to add her name to the list compiled daily of those entitled to the aid packages of rice, lentils, milk, sugar, tomato juice and cheese.I have 10 children. We break the fast just with water from the well and tomato juice. What sort of life is this? she asked, her voice tinged with both sorrow and anger.Umm Yussef said she would celebrate the Eid feast that follows the Muslim holy month -- at the end of next week -- only once her daughter Leila and their family are freed from Daesh (IS) control.All they have to eat is grass and sand, she said as a passerby handed a biscuit to one of her children.Young volunteers last week handed out 2,000 modest aid packages to inhabitants of areas of west Mosul recaptured by Iraqi forces.We try to meet a modest part of the needs of needy families, said 21-year-old Mohammed Dilan, one of those distributing the aid raised from donations by businessmen and other individuals.For those displaced from Mosul and forced to take refuge in overcrowded camps outside the city, life can be even more treacherous.A mass food poisoning this week at one such camp, Hasansham, left hundreds requiring urgent treatment, officials said Tuesday.Health ministry spokesman Seif al-Badr said around 100 of those affected required serious treatment after the iftar meal which breaks the fast.More than 800,000 people have been forced to flee their homes since the battle for Mosul erupted."

The meat-based delicacy, which is sparsely available throughout the year in the city, is found in abundance during the fasting season. So, what is Haleem , and why is it such a big deal during Ramadan? We find out...Haleem is a paste-like stew composed of meat (mutton, beef or chicken), pounded wheat, lentils, ghee, ginger-garlic paste and turmeric. It also contains spices such as cumin seeds, caraway seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, cloves, black pepper, saffron and jaggery, and dry fruits such as pistachio, cashew, fig and almond. It is served hot, topped with a ghee-based gravy, pieces of lime, chopped coriander and fried onions as garnish.It is made by soaking wheat, barley and gram lentil overnight, and a spicy meat gravy is prepared to make the meat tender. The wheat, barley and gram are boiled in salt water, and then mixed with the meat gravy and blended with heavy wooden paddles or hand mashers to obtain a sticky-smooth, paste-like consistency. The cooking procedure takes about 6-7 hours over a low firewood flame.At the Ramadan pop-up food stalls in Frazer Town, Johnson Market, Koramangala, Tilak Nagar and Bannerghatta Road.Haleem is a high-calorie dish that gives instant energy, as it contains slow-digesting and fast-burning ingredients. The dry fruits that are rich in anti-oxidants add to its nutritional value. The meat and dry fruits make it a high-protein food.The origin of Haleem lies in the popular Arabian dish known as Harees, whose first written recipe dates back to the 10th century, as part of Kitab Al-Tabikh (Book of Recipes)  the world's oldest surviving Arabic cookbook compiled by Arab scribe Abu Muhammad al-Muzaffar ibn Sayyar. It was introduced in India by Arab soldiers of the Hyderabad Nizam 's army to the city.It is known as Hareesa in Arabia and Armenia, Daleem in Turkey, Iran , Azerbaijan and northern Iraq, and Khichra in Pakistan"

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, June 16: The trustees of Panchkanya Dham near Basistha temple and Sri Sri Bhrigu Giri Maharaj, who established it in 1966, today claimed that it was the real Bheemashankar jyotirlinga and the one at Pamohi is a upalinga or associate jyotirlinga. The assertion was made following a dispute after the jyotirlinga at Pamohi was renamed as the Bheemashankar jyotirlinga. The Bheemashankar jyotirlinga is one of the 12 Jyotirlingas ( jyoti means radiance and linga the symbol that represents Lord Shiva) in the country. These 12 jyotirlinga have nine upalingas in different states of the country. They are considered to be spiritual energy centres where the spirit of Lord Shiva resides. The Puranas mention these shrines in detail and are held in great reverence by devotees. The Jyotirlinga here is surrounded by several spiritual sites like the Basistha ashram and several caves named after deities and sages. According to legend, Lord Bheemashankar (an avatar of Lord Shiva) killed Bheemasur at Dakini Parbat, which was burnt and destroyed due to the rage ( kshob) of Bheemashan-kar and came to be known as Kshobak Parbat in Basistha. In the fit of rage, legend says, fire balls emerged from Lord Bheemashankar's body and one of them landed on Varaha parbat at Pamohi, which was the capital city of Bheemasur. This place became the Bheemeswar or Bhimeswar upalinga and the tribal people worshipped the deity as Bhimeswar or Dimbeshwar Swami. One of the trustees, Pankaj Das, said, ""The place is considered to be a Shakti Peeth as the Kumari form of goddess Kamakhya is supposed to have cooled the rage of Lord Bheemashankar here. The shrine inside the temple has an ancient rock on which a linga has been placed. The Archaeological Survey of India is carrying out an investigation into the period of time to which the rock belongs. The area has many ancient shrines and these have to be studied also"". ""The renaming of the Bheemeswar upalinga as Bheemashankar has been carried out by some people with vested interest. Sadly, the tourism department has also included the place in its publications, website, road signs and also put up an information board there. They are misleading the pilgrims and tourists and they have to be corrected,"" Das added."

Ironically, we had already restored the connection by the time he charged at us, says Kumar, a lineman who is a contractual employee of the Haryana electricity board, the Dakshin Haryana Bijli Vitran Nigam (DHBVN), and employed in Gurgaon.Over the years, he says, he has grown immune to insults from disgruntled residents and occasional physical assaults such as the one on June 7.He says the judge allegedly threatened to kill the men, before going back to his house, only to re-emerge with a pistol. We thought he was making empty threats, but then he began firing at us We had to run into the park nearby to save our lives, says Kumar. Although there were no injuries, police have registered a case and a local court has sent the judge to 14-day judicial custody.The community of linemen, however, believe this wont be the last such incident, especially in summers, with rising temperatures and the increased pressure on the existing power grids in cities. In summers, wires tend to get overloaded because of multiple air conditioners and fans running at the same time. As a result, our work increases and so do the altercations, says Kumar. People get annoyed because they have to endure the heat for a while but they do not realise that we have to work in the same heat to restore their comforts, says the lineman.When Kumar left home in Bihars Begumpur village and arrived in Gurgaon as an 18-year-old, he had little education and no skill(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar) When Kumar left home in Bihars Begumpur village and arrived in Gurgaon as an 18-year-old, he had little education and no skill(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar)Kumar says that in 1999, when he first left home in Bihars Begumpur village as an 18-year-old and arrived in Gurgaon, he had little education and no skill. But he managed to get this job through a fellow villager who worked in Gurgaon.Everything I learned was on the job, from watching my co-workers and people with more experience. I was initially afraid of getting electrocuted, but I could not afford to be scared. I needed the money to support myself and my family, he says.In the nearly 18 years since, Kumar says, he has worked every single day of the week through the year, except for an annual, month-long trip home to spend time with his wife and 12-year-old daughter.His work day starts around 7 am, when Kumar wakes up in his rented accommodation on Basai road that he shares with four other linemen. At quarter to eight, he leaves his home and walks down to the DHBVN complaint centre in Kadipur. For the next eight to ten hours, Kumar is on duty.According to sources, DHBVN is severely understaffed and, in several places, has hired private contractors to handle complaints and maintenance work. Kumar works for one such contractor in the Kadipur area where, sources say, there are only 20 linemen for 15-16,000 electrical connections.There are so few men and so many complaints and issues that there is no way we can resolve everyones problems as quickly as they expect. As a result, people often call us up or come to the office and hurl abuses. We have even had instances of violence, says a staff member at the office.Kumar, however, no longer handles complaints. Around 10 years ago, he graduated to maintaining and servicing outdoor electrical wiring  work that, he says, can take anywhere between two and five hours, depending on the magnitude of the problem.Our work is not concerned with attending to complaints, but it is determined by the number of complaints. For example, if an abnormally large number of complaints are received from a specific area, say, about electricity outages or transformer issues, we have to determine the problem and find a long-term solution, says Kumar.With his colleagues at lunch(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar) With his colleagues at lunch(Express Photo by Manoj Kumar)At noon this Tuesday, Kumar and a handful of other linemen are preparing to make a trip to Shivaji Nagar, where electricity outages have been a common occurrence over the past few days. The linemen had conducted a recee of the area a day earlier and ascertained that an old wire needed replacing.The lineman have settled on a 150-metre-long wire as a replacement and have coiled and tied it up, along with a couple of others of lesser lengths to be carried as backup. Four men roll the wires out of the offices veranda and load it onto a cart, which is to be attached to a jeep. The wires are secured to the cart through multiple ropes, before the men take a break for lunch at half past one, anticipating at least three hours of work, in the scorching sun, ahead of them.Seated in the verandah of the office  some on rusted steel chairs and others on a single bed  under a rickety fan, the linemen eat chapattis, vegetables and lentils from steel tiffins they have carried from home.Usually, the evenings are the riskiest time to cut off electricity for our work. The men are back home and so are the children and so, there are more people in the area. If any situation develops, it aggravates quickly and can turn against us in no time, says Kumar, sipping tea ordered from the store opposite the office.Lounging on a bed with his back against the wall after his meal, as he waits for the others to finish their food, Sanjay Kumar, Kumars colleague, says, There was a time when we were scared of people in Old Gurgaon or in villages, but now it feels like we are equally at risk everywhere. Take the case of the judge. He was a well-educated man who would have expected him to shoot at us? People are becoming more aggressive and intolerant.It is 2 pm by the time the linemen finish their lunch. Of the group of eight, two stay behind while the remaining six either get into the jeep or board the cart, making their way to Shivaji Nagar, some 2 kilometres away.Residents passing through the area on cycles and bikes stop to enquire about the work and the time for which electricity will be cut off.If only we are left alone to work, we could finish half an hour earlier at least, laughs Kumar as he reassures a middle-aged resident that the connection will be back within a couple of hours.The linemen spend half an hour untying and uncoiling the replacement wire until it snakes around the streets of the neighborhood. Once this is done, the power is cut off, ladders are taken off the cart and set against a transformers pillars. As the linemen begin their work, residents begin to emerge out of their homes, some lean out of windows and balconies, to watch the men at work  and urge them to restore the electricity.People think we are being slow or lazy, but finishing the work quickly is in our interest as well. The sooner we finish this, the sooner we can escape the sun and heat, says Jitender, another lineman.It is almost 5 pm by the time the wire is finally replaced, and by now, most residents have returned to their homes, leaving behind children riding cycles and playing games on the street. The linemen must now wind the old wire and load it onto the cart so it can be taken back to the office, where it will either be repaired or discarded.According to office bearers of the Haryana State Electricity Board Workers Union, confrontations between linemen and residents turn violent at least once or twice a month. The situation, they say, has improved ever since they have been allowed to take along a police escort but it rarely helps when tempers are frayed.We are given police escort when we go to raid areas and nab people who steal electricity, but this doesnt always guarantee our safety, says Satish Kumar, Sub Divisional President of the union. It is the worse for employees who have to conduct a raid in the very area where they handle complaints because people already know and recognise them. After the police leave, there is nothing that stops a mob from beating them up.The solution, he says, lies in changing the system. People posted in an area should not conduct raids there Residents too must become more sensitive and realise that these are just men doing their job  working in the sun, rain, and cold  all through the year.Linemen such Kumar have, however, resigned themselves to the fact that their job is riskier than they had bargained for. Initially, I used to be surprised when people got angry or violent. Now we are used to it, says Kumar, But it is still disappointing. At the end of the day, the work we do is for the public and, instead of appreciating it, they misbehave with us.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a0493af9855b76bf13bdee3,Chatur Baniya and chaturvarna: Caste slurs are hurtful but it’s also true that caste stereotypes aren’t unidimensional,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/toi-edit-page/chatur-baniya-and-chaturvarna-caste-slurs-are-hurtful-but-its-also-true-that-caste-stereotypes-arent-unidimensional/,2017-06-17,"Well before films glamourised movie stars as giant killers, almost every caste, in old fashioned India, claimed some kind of martial status. The link between Kshatriyas, muscle tone and weaponry is well known, but it is not as if other castes dont claim a similar profile. For instance, the Baniyas are frequently presented as crafty, chatur, peace-seeking merchants, but many of their origin tales spin a different story. In these legends (or, jati puranas) Baniyas come through as heat-seeking warriors; brave and fearless, never dodgy peddlers.This is actually to be expected, and had it been otherwise that would have been quite unusual. For some reason, humans everywhere want to be remembered as fighters. Like our Ranjits and Vishwajeets, some of the commonest European names, such as Vladimir, Ludwig, Louis and Richard mean conqueror, brave, vanquisher, and so forth. Once we factor that in, it becomes easier to accept the Baniya version of the self as ruler and warrior, prone, on occasions, to recklessness too.As almost everybody aspires to be a warrior, king and conqueror, it is hardly surprising that there is no consensus in Indias four caste model (or chaturvarna) on who is a true Kshatriya. From earthy Jats and Marathas, to princelings and their hangers on, such as the Rajputs and Thakurs, a wide range of castes call themselves Kshatriyas, but without a shred of mutual admiration. The chaturvarna model has cushion enough to absorb all this, but it begins to wobble once Baniyas reject the Kshatriya tag and yet claim battle readiness.The Khandelvals and Maheshwaris, two major Rajasthani Baniya castes, notwithstanding their claimed Rajput ancestry, found the Kshatriya practice of animal sacrifice a real turn off. Their sensitivities were so repulsed that many of them went the distance and dumped Hinduism to become Jains. Yet, through all this they held on to their identity as rulers with high-order kingly qualities. In retrospect, they were probably the first to imagine non-violent leadership.Many origin tales of North Indian Banyias also assert that they were once kings, and that too of civilisational hubs like Ayodhya, Kaushambi and Mathura. The Agarwals have a similar origin myth. They trace their descent from King Agrasen, hence Agrawal. This view received a contemporary fillip when the famous 19th century poet Bharatendu Harishchandra endorsed it and by the fact that in the early 1800s Jaisalmer actually had a Baniya king.The Subornobaniks of Bengal consider themselves to be more Aryans than the usual Brahmins or Kshatriyas, because they once walked over the fire with Goddess Anayaka. Burnished thus, their skin colour became way lighter than the darker people in the neighbourhood, inspiring their enmity and ill will. In the west, Khandoba, the principal God of the Marathas, is always represented on horseback with both his wives. Of the two, the one in front is more valourous, and she is a Baniya.It is roughly the same in South India too. The Kaikkoolars (also known as Segunthar Mudaliyar), who are otherwise identified as merchants and weavers, see themselves as creations of Shiva, with Murugan as their specific God. Legend has it that from the anklet of Parvati (Shivas consort) nine jewels broke free out of which came the original nine Kaikkoolar warriors. They were blessed with such powers that even Shiva depended on them to tune out his arch rival Suurubatman. Incidentally, Murugan, the Kaikkoolar chief deity, was a reputed hunter, lived dangerously in the hills and possessed the rajasik, or Kshatriya, trait, of keeping a large retinue of women.From all of this it is very obvious that Baniyas find the chaturvarna classification unacceptable as it places them after the Kshatriyas and Brahmins. But subscribe to the Vedic hierarchy and the association of merchants with cunning is as commonplace as lentils and rice. On the other hand, if we were to seriously consider how Baniyas view themselves, then a completely different set of qualities will have to be served up. Why, in the South Gujarat district of Sabarkantha, the term shahukar does not signify a mean money lender (another caricature), but a large hearted, honest person.Nor is it always a big deal to be a Brahmin either. From Punjab to Travancore, many communities consider this caste to be inauspicious. For example, Kuricchans, of West Kerala, had an established protocol to ward off evil should a Brahmin ever enter their homes. In Punjab, even minor misfortunes, like a tractor engine seizure, spontaneously leads one to a memory check. Was there a Brahmin somewhere along the way to the farm? The Anavils of Gujarat believe that their ancestor was Chanakya, the instructor-in-chief of Kshatriyas, and this places them well above the garden variety priests, who often pretend to be superior.We should take serious offence when caste stereotypes degrade Dalits, but that ought to alert us to many other forms of community slurs that are routinely in circulation. This is why any reference to the chaturvarna system is bound to put off somebody. Imagine coming out of the barbers chair with short hair standing up everywhere and there is nothing you can do about it  caste jokes hurt much more.At the end of the day, consider this: was Gandhi, the Baniya, a crafty merchant or a noble ruler? Does the answer lie in some sacred text or should a persons life be an open book?"

Every evening during the holy month, the streets around Minara Masjid are heaving with iftar food stalls and with people  those who are breaking their fast and those looking to just relish the meaty delicacies and sugary specials. There are some essential pit stops such as Noor Mohammadi Hotel (shami kebab and Sanju baba chicken), Bismilla (offal dishes), Janta Fast Food (quail tandoori), Noorani Milk Centre (malpua) and Suleman Usman Mithaiwala (phirni), not to mention the myriad kebab stalls and the famous khichda vendor at the end of the road.When I came to Mumbai for the first time in 2007, I went to Mohammad Ali Road (for iftar). When I joined [Sofitel] in 2015, I thought why not bring the experience of that street food here during Ramzan, says chef Shadab Ahmed Qureshi of Jyran  Tandoor Dining and Lounge at Sofitel Mumbai. The restaurant has launched a Mohammad Ali Road food promotion, which will continue until Eid later this month. This is the restaurants third edition featuring iftar food. On the menu are several Mohammad Ali Road favourites, albeit with a five-star twist.Tried and testedWe began with sherbets, essentially fruit juices spiked with masala. While the watermelon sherbet was refreshing, the pineapple one was cloyingly sweet. Theres a long list of appetisers, including cutlets, kebabs, and rolls of all kinds. The chicken achari tikka was a standout for its spicy pickle marinade and the succulent chicken perfectly cooked in a clay oven. The roti pe bhuni roti sounded great on the menu  lamb cooked on griddle, flavoured with red chillies and served on Indian bread. Though the lamb, served taco-style on a tiny roti, was well-cooked, it struck a single flavour note paling in comparison to the other dishes. The macchi tawa fry made with tilapia was competent enough. We tried both the vegetable and chicken cutlets, and the former one far outshone its meaty counterpart; indeed it was our favourite amongst all the appetisers. Not only was the patty juicy and flavourful, the semolina-encrusted top gave a crunchy texture to the cutlet, something that was sorely lacking in the chicken version.The gloriously meaty main course features bara handi, khichda, kheema pao, and a couple of offal dishes. We picked the gurda kaleji pao  a finger-licking delicious mix of lamb kidney and liver cooked till the organs turn pleasingly soft but not mushy. The fluffy mini paos on the side were warm and glistening with a dab of butter  perfect companions to mop up the spicy kidney-liver preparation. The menus pice de rsistance Khichda, the slow-cooked dish of lamb and mixed lentils with its mildly spicy flavours, is bound to be a crowd-pleaser. Khichda is more popular than Haleem in Mumbai, and if youre looking to try just one dish, I would recommend this, says Qureshi. There are biryanis and pulao on offer as well, but we left them for another day.Desserts galoreVegetarians have limited options, though the vegetable cutlet is far superior to most we have had in the city. After fasting the entire day, the body needs energy and protein, so meat is the best option, says Qureshi, explaining the paucity of vegetarian dishes in an iftar spread. Apart from the food, the restaurant has also gone to lengths to create the right ambience, with servers dressed in salwar-kurtas and skullcaps, and qawwali songs serenading us while we eat. The dessert menu has all the iftar specialities, from sheer korma and phirni to kulfi falooda and malpua-rabdi. The last item really stole the show: a scrumptious mini malpua topped with creamy rabdi; we may have groaned with pleasure.The Mohammad Ali Road Food promotion at Jyran, Sofitel Mumbai BKC is ongoing till June 26 and is only available at dinnertime from 7 p.m. onwards"

Owner of 10 cows and 14 sheep, Kamble is now planning to focus on milking these milch animals to support his family.Sarjee Kamble (70), a small farmer from Solapurs Khole village, is not too excited about the much-applauded loan waiver recently announced by the state government.Owner of five-acre land in Madha taluka, Kamble cultivates maize, jowar and onions. He said his primary concern is to fetch good rates for his produce. Will my onions fetch a decent price, this year at least?, he asked.Kamble is just one among hundreds of distressed farmer warkaris (pilgrims), who are leaving the city for Pandharpur on Tuesday, as part of the annual Sant Tukaram and Sant Dnyaneshwars palkhi procession.This is for the first time, in over a decade, that I have not been able to make any money from my produce. I have been investing at least four times more than what I earn. How will I feed my family? he asked.Owner of 10 cows and 14 sheep, Kamble is now planning to focus on milking these milch animals to support his family.Distress among warkaris was evident as many pledged to consume minimum food and water till they reach Kolhapur on Ashadhi Ekadashi.Ramabai is a marginal farmer from Bhigwan whose livelihood depends on cultivation of onions and lentils. I had borrowed some money but my produce has not been appreciable. I have barely been able to pay back the sum. I am worried that the bank will soon take action, said Ramabai, who has come on her maiden wari this year.Pointing out that she was aware of the loan waiver proceedings, she raised doubts on its benefits for small and marginal farmers. Several promises have been in the past, but how many of the farmers have actually been asked to not repay their loan? asked Ramabai.Nagnath Shirsat (65) said he works for around ten days in a month, as farming is losing sheen due to unpredictable climate conditions. I am not skilled to do any other work. Given my age, I dont know for how many years I can work, said Shirsat, who hails from Pimplegaon.Having no permanent accommodation, Shirsat, along with his five-member family, simply migrates from one place to another in search of odd-farming jobs. When there is work, I earn about Rs 200. I can barely make ends meet, he added.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Sources said that the arrival of chana in mandis is less and there are indications that farmers are holding back their produce in anticipation of getting a better price.An assessment done by National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India ( NAFED ), government's main agency for procurement of pulses, the present prices of chana in mandis is more that the MSP of Rs 4,000 per quintal. ""Currently, chana is selling at mandis at Rs 52-53 per kg while last year farmers sold the commodity at Rs 90 per kg. So, now we have less arrival in the mandis. Farmers are waiting for better price,"" a government official said.Nafed has so far procured about 50,000 tonnes of chana, though it can get as much as 1.5 to two lakh tonnes."

Therefore, timely announcement of minimum support prices (MSP) for pulses prior to the sowing season is of great importance, according to a study conducted by the M S Swaminathan Research Foundation . ""Announcement on MSP for pulses ideally in June-July can have a significant impact on farmers' choice of crops,"" it said.India produced over 106 million tons of rice and over 95 million tons of wheat in 2013-14. This is about 10 million tons higher than the demand for each of these crops. In the same period, we produced just about 19 million tons of pulses which reduced to 17.5 million tons in 2014-15, although there is annual demand of about 24 million tons of pulses. ""This deficit situation in pulses exists, because there is a much more efficient system for procurement and a lucrative MSP for rice and wheat. India currently has a policy in place for five pulses only - tur, moong, urad, lentil and gram. Further, there is need to ensure that the MSP actually reaches the farmer and is not exploited by middlemen. State governments could explore special schemes for pulses in respective states,"" the study said.Recent analysis by the multi-country LANSA consortium project led by MSSRF showed that as per the National Sample Survey 61st and 68th rounds, only Himachal Pradesh met the daily requirement of 40 grams of pulses.States like Jharkhand, Rajasthan and West Bengal , did not even meet 50% of the norm set for daily protein intake. In a country, 34 per cent of children are underweight (NFHS-4), pulses are important to address malnutrition.The study further recommends ensuring availability through Public Distribution System and increasing consumption of less popular but more nutritious pulses.""Since pulses need less than one-fifth the water rice requires, they are also water-smart. Getting farmers to grow pulses is important to increase income, reduce water for farming and improve nutritional status. In the current year, we may face a deficit monsoon. So announcing a remunerative MSP for pulses may be the way ahead. It is time to make this announcement now,"" it said."

(PTI) During the protests in Mandsaur. (PTI)How money reached themWhen five protesters died on June 6 in alleged police firing near Mandsaur, the epicentre of the farmers unrest, the government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and later doubled it to Rs 10 lakh. But with anger spreading to other parts of the state and the import of its political damage sinking in, by the end of the day, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan announced an unprecedented compensation  Rs 1 crore and a job to a family member of each of the victims.Opposition parties accused the BJP government of bidding over dead bodies and the district collector, since transferred and later suspended, publicly expressed his inability to pay the compensation, saying anything more than Rs 4 lakh was beyond his mandate.A week later, as Chouhan travelled to meet the family members, his secretariat ensured that the money was electronically transferred to the bank accounts of the families. Citing exceptional circumstances, the secretariat sent a note-sheet with the CMs signature to the General Administration Department (GAD) to clear the money. The GAD, in turn, sent a formal sanction letter to the collector, who later transferred the money from the local treasury.Officials in the CMs secretariat said there was no limit to the amount that can be sanctioned under the CMs discretionary fund. By its very definition, its the CMs discretion and the process is not bound by rules. The amount can be Rs 10,000 or Rs 1 crore, a top officer in the secretariat told The Sunday Express.In normal circumstances, the process is rigorous and requires verification.The CM had doled out huge amounts in the past, but that was restricted to players such as P V Sindhu, who got Rs 50 lakh from the discretionary fund after she won the silver medal at the Rio Olympics. Soldiers from the state who die in the line of duty usually get Rs 10 lakh.The BJP high command was reportedly unhappy with the hefty compensation, fearing it could set a precedent. When the sixth death, allegedly in police custody, took place in Mandsaur a few days later, family members and relatives of Ghanshyam Dhakad said they would not cremate his body until they were compensated with Rs 1 crore and a job. Since then, the Congress has demanded that every suicide by farmers be compensated with Rs 1 crore.To put things in perspective, a look at compensation packages announced in the past: On September 13, 2015, the day after an explosion left 80 people dead in Petlawad town, Chief Minister Chouhan announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and a job to a family member. A farmer who was killed in police firing in Bareli, Raisen district, in 2012 got a compensation of Rs 2 lakh. The farmers were protesting against the delay in procurement of wheat caused by a shortage of gunny bags. In 1998, when the Congress was in power in the state, more than 19 farmers were killed in police firing in Multai town of Betul district. The victims families got Rs 2 lakh in compensation from the state government and Rs 50,000 from the Prime Ministers fund. The compensation for those who died in the 1984 gas tragedy was hiked to Rs 10 lakh in 2010.Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment.

(Photo: Oinam Anand)Satyanarayan Dhangar, 30,Lodh villageSurvived by:Parents Mangilal Dhangar and Bhanwari Bai, brothers Kanhaiyalal and Raju, and their wives Nirmala and Manju Bai.Debt: Approximately Rs 4.5 lakh, of which Rs 3 lakh is against a tractor Satyanarayan bought  he paid instalments of about Rs 60,000 every six months; a bank loan of Rs 50,000 under the Mukhyamantri Aawas Yojana to build their house; and Rs 60,000 for the purchase of manure and seed. The family owns five bighas, of which two bighas stand mortgaged for Rs 40,000 (the land deed is shared by the extended family), along with about 300 grams of silver and a gold-plated necklace for Rs 7,000.The Family: Having studied till Class 10, Satyanarayan was the most educated in the family; Kanhaiyalal studied till Class 2 and Raju till Class 5.Satyanarayan used to take care of all the household finances, says Kanhaiyalal, He was charming so he would convince people that he would pay off his debts later. Satyanarayan never married.The brothers, their wives, and the parents occupy a room each. The family grows wheat and alsi (flax) on their land. Last season, they also grew potatoes and peas. When not in the fields, the brothers work as labourers and are said to be good at reinforcing wells.Satyanarayans father, Mangilal Dhangar, prefers to sleep outside. The day The Sunday Express met the family, he was on a cot in the open, crying out in pain. He finally slips off the cot onto the mud floor. As he keeps groaning, the brothers call an ambulance and he is taken away. He was fine until now, says his wife Bhanwari.Whats in the house: Three cots, a ceiling fan, a table fan, lots of utensils and a tractor.That day: He had joined the protests because he was frustrated with falling prices, says brother Raju. Our debts kept rising and the returns from farm kept declining.Rs 1 crore: We will pay off our debt, though the Chief Minister told us he will get it all waived, says Raju. Some money might also be used for their fathers treatment. With the rest, they plan to buy some land.Its worth: Over 22 times their total debt.He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand) He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand)Kanhaiyalal Patidar, 44,Chillod Piplya villageSurvided by: Wife Sumitra, daughter Puja and son Jitendra.Debt: None, says wife Sumitra. He bought seeds and manure with help from the cooperative society. The interest on the societys loan is zero per cent for the first year and seven per cent from then on, so he avoided the interest, says wife Sumitra.The Family: Kanhaiyalal lived with his wife and children in a small, two-storey unplastered and unfurnished house, next to the homes of his two brothers, Jagdish and Ganpat, and other relatives.Like each of his brothers, Kanhaiyalal owned six bighas, on which he grew wheat, soybean and garlic. With the rate of wheat hovering between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,200 a quintal, and that of garlic between Rs 800 and Rs 2,000 a quintal, each of us made only around Rs 30,000 last year, says Jagdish. Kanhaiyalal also had a cow and a buffalo and sold some of the milk. Milk sells for Rs 20-22 a litre, the price of water, says his mother, Debu Bai. The brothers also worked as daily-wage labourers.Whats in the house: Of the two rooms in the house, one is on the ground floor, and the other on the roof, which doubles up as a kitchen. There is a storehouse which has a few sacks of produce, an agricultural weighing machine and Kanhaiyalals motorcycle.That day: Kharcha nahi baith raha tha (Expenses exceeded our earnings), says Sumitra. Isiliye andolan mein gaye thhe (Thats why he joined the protest).The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the bank accounts of Sumitra and the children. Bank officials have told us that we cannot withdraw money from the childrens accounts yet and need permission from the bade sahab (big boss), says Laxmi Narayan, Sumitras father. The children say they are inspired by a relative, a doctor uncle in Ratlam, and want to be doctors too. While daughter Puja managed 50 per cent in Class 10, son Jitendra scored 70 per cent in Class 7.Sumitra says the childrens share of money will be saved as fixed deposits. Kanhaiyalals brothers also indicate they will be given some money to continue farming on his land. We will hire labourers to till his fields. All of us will also move to a better place within this village, says Jagdish. Then there are the villagers who have donated to set up a bust of martyr Kanhaiyalal in the middle of the village.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore is 625 times Pujas annual school fee of Rs 16,000, which Kanhaiyalal could not afford; his father-in-law, Laxmi Narayan, would pay the childs fee. Kanhaiyalal took care of his sons education, which cost him Rs 12,000 a year. Masterji in school told me I wont be allowed to take my exams if I didnt pay the fee. My father always somehow paid, says son Jitendra.The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand) The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand)Ghanshyam Salitra, 30,Badwan villageSurvived by: Wife Rekha Bai, four-year-old son Rudra, month-old daughter Himanshi, father Durgalal Dhakad, sister Shamu BaiDebt: The family owes Rs 3 lakh to two banks and another Rs 2 lakh to a cooperative society. The loan goes back years. Almost all of it was to buy seeds, manure, pay for labour, hire machines, says father Durgalal.The Family: Ghanshyam never saw his daughter Himanshi. He was at the protest site on June 8, when his wife, Rekha, returned from her maternal home, where she had delivered her daughter. He left hours before I arrived, she says. His four-year-old son Rudra jumps around the house before coming back to play with his sister.Ghanshyam had enrolled Rudra in a private English-medium school, where the annual fee is Rs 10,000, says Ghanshyams wife Rekha.The family owns four bighas on which they grow wheat, garlic and fenugreek. Soon after Ghanshyams Class 12, he started working in their fields. The chief minister came and assured me Rs 1 crore. I told him to bring back my husband. I asked him who will take care of my children. He said the government would bear all their education expenses and give me a job, says Rekha.They killed my only son, says Durgalal.Whats in the house: A bedroom, another for the produce, and a third that doubles up as a kitchen and temple. Two cows, two buffaloes, a bull and a calf, and a dog, Kalu, in a fenced enclosure. Also, three fans and a television.That day: He and other men from the village were protesting and chanting Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan! when police caned them. He tried to run but got stuck in the fence. Police took him to the station. I later came to know they hit him on his head and throat till he fell down, Durgalal says. They came home around 3.30 that night and claimed he was injured. They told us to reach the police station at 9 am, but by then they had taken him to a hospital in Indore. By the time my father-in-law got there, he was dead, Rekha says.The Rs 1 crore: Our father went to Mandsaur to open accounts in the name of the children, says Ghanshyams sister Shamu. Some money has been transferred into the accounts but we dont know how much.Its worth: Zero. This crore is not worth my husband, says Rekha.Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand) Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand)Abhishek Dinesh, 18Barkheda Panth villageSurvived by: Parents Dinesh and Alka Bai, brothers Madhusudan and Sandeep, grandparents Bhanwar Lal and Lakshmi BaiDebt: None. But this January, the family sold off 6 of their 29.5 bighas to cushion their expenses.The Family: Most mornings, Abhishek would assist in the fields before leaving for school around 11 am. He would then return to the farm by 5 pm, finally getting home late in the evening. He would also skip schools when there was a lot of work at the farm, says brother Madhusudan.In the just declared results of Class 11, Abhishek had scored 47.2 per cent. He wanted to do an agriculture course once he was done with school, says Sandeep, who is enrolled in a BBA course.The family grows soybean, wheat, bajra, corn, lentils. Over the past four to five years, the price of soybean has halved from around Rs 5,000 a quintal to around Rs 2,500 now. We also sold 52 quintals of onion for Rs 6,500 at Rs 1.25 per kg. How can a household run like this? asks father Dinesh.Whats in the house: There are logs of sal, about 1.5 feet in width, overhead, going across the roof of the rooms. Above them are bamboo poles, which hold a bamboo mat and the mud roof. Thats how the roof has been in this house since 1957, when we built it, says Abhisheks grandfather Bhanwar Lal, in his early 90s. The house has four rooms and a large hall which was renovated about three years ago, apart from a kitchen.That day: He had gone to the protests as he was curious others from the village were also going, says mother Alka Bai. Everyone goes to protest if the cause is genuine, adds grandfather Bhanwar Lal.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the accounts of Abhisheks parents. They first plan to buy back the land they sold earlier this year. They also want to buy more property and reinforce their well. Brother Sandeep will get the government job. Relatives have also been turning up frequently. I learnt of Abhisheks death today (a week after the incident) and came running, says Ramesh Chand Patidar, a relative.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore can cultivate their 23 bighas nearly 72 times over. It takes Rs 6,000 roughly to cultivate a bigha of land, says Dinesh.Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand) Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand)Poonamchand Patidar alias Babloo, 23Takrawad villageSurvived by: Wife Anita, mother Durga Bai and sister GirijaDebt: Rs 4 lakh in unpaid home loans and about a couple of lakh more in agricultural dues for labour, seed and manure purchase, and tractor rent, among others. The family also paid Rs 50,000 for a hysterectomy operation that Babloos mother had over a month ago.The Family: With their savings and some loans, Babloos father Jagdish Ram and uncle Bala Ram built the two-storey house that Babloo lived in with wife Anita, mother Durga Bai, uncle Bala Ram and cousin Dasrath. His father had passed away in January last year, after which he dropped out of college and married Anita. The house, with eight rooms, was built two years ago, when the family enjoyed better times.Babloo inherited his fathers eight bigha on which he grew wheat, coriander, garlic and chickpeas. He also helped out on his uncles farm. We sold a quintal each of wheat for Rs 1,100, coriander for Rs 4,000, fenugreek for Rs 1,500 and garlic for Rs 3,000. Over a year ago, the rates were Rs 2,000, Rs 7,000, Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000, says Bala Ram, who too owns eight bighas. So while he spent Rs 96,000 on the farm, he made only about Rs 60,000 last year, he adds. Moreover, the cheques against payments take over a month to be cleared, says cousin Dasrath. When not in the fields, Babloo used to repair vehicles, especially vans, to make ends meet.Whats in the house: The house is mostly empty. A crib dangles in the middle of one of the rooms.That day: Around 150 youth from our village went to protest. Police shot at a few of them from close range. He was among those hit. Villagers told us police shot him on the road. The villagers rushed him to a hospital in Mandsaur on a motorcycle but he died on the way, says Babloos uncle Bala Ram.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred to a joint account opened in the names of Babloos mother and wife. The heavy dose of drugs after her operation has left Babloos mother with mental troubles, says Bala Ram. Babloos wife Anita has left for her maternal home and will return soon, he says. Sister Girija Bai too shows little interest in money matters and so, it for Bala Ram and his son Dasrath to decide. We still get notices from the bank. So we will pay that off first, says Dasrath, who dropped out of school after Class X and will get the government job.Then there are the relatives, who have not left the home since Babloos death. Will we get money? And when? Everyone only comes and takes down our names, says Babloos aunt Lakshmi. His mother Durga Bai sits expressionless.Its worth: The compensation money is 200 times the cost of his mothers operation.He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand) He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand)Chainaram Patidar, 23Nayakheda villageSurvived by: Wife Pushpa, parents Ganpat Lal and Manju Bai, younger brother Govind, sister PavitraDebt: Only Chainaram kept a record of the expenses, so the family has little idea if they had any loans, though they say he used to borrow from the cooperative society. If there is any debt, they dont know about it as no one has approached them yet.The Family: Chainarams two-room house is one of about a dozen small houses  mostly of his uncles and cousins  that lie on either side of a narrow lane within Nayakheda village.The family owns two bighas on which they grow wheat and soybean. When not on the fields, Chainaram would, like his daily-wager father, go looking for work.Keen on joining the Army, as a couple of village youths are in the forces, Chainaram began applying around five years ago, after he turned 18. He had good height and could run quite a bit. He cleared the physical test thrice but would always be ruled out in the medical tests; his left eye was weak, says father Ganpat, 43. On April 29 this year, Chainaram married Pushpa. She is still dazed and barely speaks.Whats in the house: A cooking stove and gas cylinder, an earthen pot and utensils. The family sleeps on the floor under the only ceiling fan in the house, which has to be prodded with a stick for it to start rotating.That day: The family says he had gone to the protest, but just to look. Villagers said he had been hit on his leg. It was only the next day that we were told he was hit on his head, says sister Pavitra.The Rs 1 crore: The money will be divided among 4-5 people, says Ganpat. There are Ganpats brothers  Rameshwar, Balu Ram, Paras Ram  and his cousins, all of whom, he says, will receive a share of the crore. Also, neighbours Mangilal, 61, and Phool Chand, 72, who have lent a shoulder. But Ganpat doesnt know how it will be divided. I am uneducated. Chainarams uncle Bharat does all the work, he has all the documents. We will all sit and divide the money soon, he says.Its worth: The compensation is 376 times the value of his familys wheat production. Last year, they produced 19 quintals of wheat and sold half of it for Rs 1,400 a quintal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

5a04a1029855b76bf13be3eb,Sarah Todd - the model who became a master chef!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/sarah-todd-the-model-who-became-a-master-chef/articleshow/59354149.cms,2017-06-28,"After being a model for 10 years, Sarah Todd discovered her true passion, and it was something that took her in an entirely new direction  cooking. She became popular as a contestant from season six of MasterChef Australia, and is now a restaurateur who is focused on ethical food. Sarah was in Chennai last weekend, and spoke to us on how she discovered her passion, the emotional aspect of food, hosting cricketer Yuvraj Singh 's wedding party, her love for dosa and more...During her entire modelling career, for 10 years, Sarah says she kept trying different things because she knew that while she was lucky to have become a model, it actually wasn't her passion. Nothing ever stuck, until she started cooking. ""I just fell in love with it,"" she gushes.And it was because of her son that she started taking cooking seriously. ""I used to cook earlier, but I was a quick cook. I'd cook healthy food, but it'd be quite plain. And when I started feeding my son those, he would just spit them out. I realised that in addition to being nutritious, food has to be flavoursome because kids do not lie when it comes to food. So, I had to experiment, and started cooking different types of dishes. I realised that there is more to food than just fuelling your body,"" she recalls.She became obsessed with cooking and went to Le Cordon Bleu, where she'd be studying how to cook, and after coming home, in the evenings, she'd be watching cooking shows and taking notes and writing recipes. She knew then that she had found her passion. And once she got into MasterChef, she completely quit modelling. ""I said to myself that I'm going to give it a year and try and make food my career; if I can, I'll continue with it, and if not, I'd just go back to modelling. Now, here I'm, in India, cooking and running a restaurant,"" she says.The confidence that she gained was crucial in her pursuing cooking, she says. ""Especially, when we used to do the mystery boxes, we had to become creative and think on our feet. For instance, when one is cooking at home, you research a recipe, see what all you need and make that dish following the recipe. Whereas, while cooking from the mystery box, you would lift off the lid to find just some ingredients. You have no recipes and have to make something up, on the spot. Now, I can go into any of your houses, open your fridge  it would be like a mystery box to me  and make a dish,"" she says.But is it possible for people at home to plate their food just like how fancily the food is presented on the show? And does it even matter? ""Of course,"" feels Sarah, and adds, ""I believe we eat with our eyes first. So, no matter what dish I'm cooking at home, I'll make an effort to make it look nice. I won't just slap it into a bowl; I'd, maybe put some fresh herbs or plate it nicely. In Le Cordon Bleu, we were scolded every day. Say if you were using your chopping board to chop some herbs, you'd have to wipe it clean before you moved on to the next thing. That way, when I'm cooking, I'm finishing every step, and can start again quick, if I need something else. If you put a little bit of thought into the whole process, it shows in the final dish. And you are savouring the dish with your eyes. The first thing you see is the dish. If the same dish is plated sloppily and somewhat nicer on another plate, you are going to pick the latter. It's just a natural reaction. I like food to look nice and look like you have put effort into it as well.""Food is also emotional, she thinks. ""A dish could taste horrible, but if it reminds you of your childhood, say a dish that your mom cooked for you when you were down with cold and which made you feel warm and cosy, you would love it. So, if you can create emotions with your dishes, that's what counts. It might sound kind of stupid and crazy, I know, but if you do put more love into a dish, you can taste it,"" she says.Sarah decided to come to India after she got 50,000 followers on her Facebook page almost overnight when she was on MasterChef. ""I was like, 'Is that spam?' To just see if there are as many fans for the show in India, I flew over here. All along, people were recognising me  on the plane, at the airport once I got off the plane. I thought, 'Oh my God! It's real. People are indeed watching the show here,'"" she says.She already loved Indian cuisine, as her son is half-Indian, and had learnt to make some Indian dishes. And at a cooking demonstration, a couple invited her to Old Delhi. She describes the place as ""chaos"". ""You wouldn't go there unless it's for a special reason. The day we went there happened to be a holiday, so there was three days' worth of people there. You couldn't walk past without brushing another person. It was people's jam! But I was loving it. Everyone was really welcoming me, and I fell in love with this country straightaway,"" she says.Sarah chose to have her restaurant in Goa because it is tropical, like northern Queensland where she hails from. ""Goa has the same kind of climate, lots of beaches, lots of seafood. I love the water, having grown up near the beach, so Goa was amazing to me. And this property, in particular, made me go 'Whoa!' It was the ultimate place to have a restaurant, with the beach and hills,"" says the chef, who decides on everything  menu, interiors, staffing, and also cooks there.Her restaurant hosted cricketer Yuvraj Singh's pre-wedding party and she calls it a bit intimidating, but fun. ""It was five days of celebration. They flew in on their jets and came straight to our place from their previous party. We had a beautiful event and they absolutely loved it, and had a lot of seafood. It was amazing,"" she says.This is her second trip to Chennai. She had come here earlier this January, and stayed for a few days. ""So, yeah, I've seen a little bit and eaten a lot of food here,"" she quips. During that time, she had went to the Kapaleeswarar temple. ""It's really beautiful, with a lot of colour. And I went to a little store (Kalathi News Mart) down the temple street, and had rose milk there. I also went to the restaurant (Karpagambal Mess) that is a couple of doors away, with hopscotch colours on its floor. I had south Indian food served on the banana leaf.""She says she loves south Indian food because it's very different. ""My son's grandparents are from Punjab and the food here is unlike the food in the north. This time, I had lunch at the Dakshin restaurant and the food was amazing. I had the thali, and I tried everything on it. I found the banana fritter-type food, made using raw banana, amazing. It was quite strange to taste banana as a savoury. And the vegetable kurma was also very good. And dosa is my favourite food. Every time I come to India, on my first day, I have to eat dosa. If I don't, I feel like I haven't entered India,"" she says.It was in Mumbai that she had the dosa for the first time, and it was love at first sight. ""It was long ago and I instantly fell in love with it. The flavour was different from anything I had tasted before. I love having rice-based dishes, and the dosa is rice and lentils, so I found it amazing,"" she recollects. She says she had tried to make it in Australia, but couldn't then because the weather was not hot enough to ferment the batter. ""I'm actually contemplating sneaking in a bag of batter from here to Australia with me,"" she laughs.India, she thinks, is the number one place for showcasing the new trend in food  the produce. ""In this country, I find that every cuisine in a city or a region or a state is built around the ingredients produced in that area and that is how everyone has started to look at food today,"" she signs off."

The passenger has submitted a written complaint to the railway authorities. In his complaint to the authorities, the passenger, Vikrant Sharma, said he was very disappointed to have found a fly in the lentil served to him and demanded that the vendor be changed immediately for putting the health of commuters at risk.The fly was literally visible in the food. I have made a complaint because we do not expect this. This is monsoon season and unhygienic food can make one prone to diseases. The vendor should be held responsible for the low quality food, said Sharma, who works in a private company in the city.It is not the first time that such a complaint has been received from people travelling by train. Passengers travelling by the Shatabdi frequently report about the improper food served to them.A senior railway official on Thursday said that once the railways receives complaint from the passengers about poor food quality, strict action is always taken against the vendor. They are penalised for poor services, said a Northern Railway official.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

(File photo) Apart from the low hubbub over Modis visit, silence of a timbre that is deafeningly familiar to us in India has descended over the White House. (File photo)The picnic hamper for best headline on the Trump-Modi meet goes to Al Jazeera for: Steak meets dahl (lentils) for US-India first date. There are no gau rakshaks yet in Doha, London or Washington, where the channel has its offices. But as George W Bush said so memorably, The future will be better  tomorrow.Indian television media was saturated with Prime Minister Narendra Modis US visit  quite naturally, since it is an opportunity to leave behind the H1B visa issue and rekindle the bonhomie that NDA2 enjoyed with the Obama administration. But the programme advertising was a little bizarre: Watch Modi win America again, or words to that effect. And more than one channel claimed that Modi was the first leader of a major country to gain entry into the Trump White House. Through the door, presumably, rather than the chimney. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan must be mortified. His much-publicised February visit  which featured a famous handshakeapparently does not count.The US press has been less enthusiasticjust as naturally, because America has much less to gain. On the day the Indian headlines celebrated the elevation of the Hizbul chief to the status of globo-terrorist, The New York Times did not have a story about the visit on the front page of the internet edition. A couple of days earlier, though, it had written about the two world leaders, both of whom swept to power as media-savvy political outsiders pledging to revive their national economies. The trail boss of LK Advanis rathyatra in 1990, and chief minister of an important state from 2001 to 2014, is a political outsider? Thats news to us.Apart from the low hubbub over Modis visit, silence of a timbre that is deafeningly familiar to us in India has descended over the White House. The daily briefings are now off-camera and press secretary Sean Spicer has declared, in essence, that it is more important to get together with the press and discuss politics than to be seen to be discussing politics. However, it has been noticed that while officially discouraging the use of television cameras, Spicer and his boss have been appearing regularly on one channel Fox. Its the seasons flavour.CNN retaliated by sending courtroom sketch artist Bill Hennessy to Spicers briefings. Its competitors have dismissed the strategy as a stunt, but CNN feels that Hennessy brings the White House briefings to life, like he did for the hearings over Guantanamo Bay detainees and Bill Clintons impeachment. Though he did generate some controversy because his sketches showed one TV camera focused on Spicer. Presumably, its the shade of the camera that was banned.But CNN is on the back foot on another issue. To maintain its credibility, three top investigative reporters put in their papers this week over a story concerning Trump ally Anthony Scaramucci, based on an unnamed source. He has disputed it, providing an opportunity for the White House to see the story as evidence of an ongoing media conspiracy. Trump tweeted: They caught Fake News CNN cold. And deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders exhorted the press corps to see a video in which a CNN employee criticises the network. Rather than evidence of a media conspiracy, this is a warning to media to take especial care of gatekeeping operations at a time when it is under intense and hostile scrutiny.The Indian news is entirely about lynchings. Which is a misnomer, a Wild West Americanism. Indian lynchings happen on national highways and in thickly populated neighbourhoods, not in some 18th century wilderness. As India Today has pointed out, Indian penal law recognises no such crime. And yet, the word has become central to the discourse, and the media and civil society have accepted it. Logically, it can only summon up that wonderfully toothless legal device, the FIR against persons unknown. Calling the crime by its commonly understood name, premeditated murder with malice aforethought, might produce better deterrence.But never mind the nomenclature, the protests against lynchings in several cities on Wednesday evening appear to have been more successful than the organisers had anticipated. Not in My Name elicited a statement against cow vigilantism from the prime minister within 17 hours. After more than a year of echoing silence. If a TV channel had organised the event, they would have instantly claimed Not in My Name effect.The event was widely covered by television and print, including international media like Al Jazeera and the BBC, and will prove to be extremely long-tailed on social media. The only channel which splashed about resolutely against the current was Republic TV, which ran Arnab Goswamis most direct Yogi interview at the time. The term direct in the banner was rotated with fiery and newsy. These words meant nothing. The most remained constant, naturally. Arnab is the mostest.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5a05d14e9855b76bf13c1150,Price ups and downs on GST Day 1,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170702/jsp/calcutta/story_159693.jsp,2017-07-02,"Friday, 8.30pm. The Dalhousie outlet of an electronic home appliances chain is bustling with people. Saturday, 4.30pm: The same outlet does not even have five customers. A group of employees is seen watching a film on a smart phone. July 1: The shopping frenzy that had marked the run-up to the implementation of GST fizzled out a day after the tax structure came into force, the contrast most evident at shops selling electronic goods. Several traders, unsure of the effect the new tax structure will have on prices, are waiting for old stocks to clear and charge GST on fresh products. Customers who had thought that essential commodities would become costlier overnight were relieved to find the prices of their preferred brand of spice or shaving cream unchanged. At Janbazaar near New Market, the cheapest variety of rice sold at Rs 35 a kilo today, same as yesterday. The price of masoor dal, too, remained unchanged at Rs 60 a kilo. ""I cannot charge more till old stocks are cleared,"" said the owner of a grocery store. The drop in footfall was most evident at stores selling electronic home appliances. Shops where there was not an inch of space and employees struggled to handle the customer rush yesterday wore an empty look today. Employees at most shops said they had run out of stock on almost all items because of the buying spree over the past week. Piles of TV sets stood packed on the pavement outside the Dalhousie store of Great Eastern Trading Corporation. ""All these are sold items. They will be delivered today,"" said an executive. The section selling TVs will remain shut for customers till Monday. ""We are waiting for the companies to update us on the modified MRP. We can sell goods only after that,"" said a senior employee of the store. At the Esplanade outlet of KC Das, a singara cost Rs 13 today, a rupee more than yesterday. ""Calculating a 12 per cent rate, the price would have been Rs 13.40. We have rounded it off,"" said Dhiman Das, one of the directors. Balaram Mullick & Radharaman Mullick put up a notice at its Bhowanipore shop, announcing that GST would be charged on all items. ""We have learnt that there will be a five per cent tax on sweets and 12 per cent tax on savouries,"" said Sudip Mullick, one of the owners. Balaram's signature Baked Rosogolla, which sold at Rs 15 per piece till yesterday, is now a rupee costlier. Prerna Sharma, a Caf Coffee Day regular, was greeted with a pleasant surprise when she dropped in at the Bentinck Street outlet of CCD with her colleagues today. ""Earlier the total tax, including VAT, service tax and other cess, would come to 21 per cent. Now we are charging 18 per cent GST,"" said the manager of the store. Her favourite Cappuccino was two rupees cheaper at Rs 112, while the price of Smoked Chicken Sandwich (Rs 158) dropped by nearly Rs 10."

But I do not want to lose the whole land as it was owned by my grandfather and my brothers grave is also on the said land.I am growing organic vegetables and lentils on my land and making a living, he said.G Linga Murthy, deputy commissioner (Land Acquisition) BDA said that though the land has been notified, it is yet to be acquired.According to BDA rules, the land loser has to voluntarily hand over his land to us. Though the site has been notified in the final notification, it still belongs to Kiran. We have offered him compensation under 40:60 scheme, where the land looser gets 40% developed land in the same layout. But he does not want to accept it. He had even approached high court. The court directed BDA and state government to consider his case. We do not have the powers to denotify land, so we have asked the state government to look into the matter, he said.Another official from the BDA said that there are many residential plots coming up beyond Jakkur and it could be that Kiran too wants to sell his land to a realtor for a higher price and wants it to be denotified by the BDA."

It is a three-day mission meant to get the feet dirty, the sort of which was prescribed by Shah to all Union ministers when they assembled in Bhubaneswar for the BJP national executive back in May. That was where the booth-level offensive to capture frontiers hitherto unconquered - such as Odisha - was unfurled, and Shah is here to lead by example.As is par for the course for Amit Shah atmospherics these days, a poor man was found whose meal the BJP boss would partake in sight of popping flashbulbs. That man this time was Benu Swain, a 50-year-old farmer of Hugulapata village in Kukudakhandi block in whose hut Shah and his missionaries sat down to a suitably spartan meal served on plantain leaves.The meal of rice, dal, ghaanta (a mix of greens and lentils) and fried vegetable may have been simple for the guests - Shah, Dharmendra Pradhan and retinue - but princely for Swain, a widowed man with four sons to provide for.As a backdrop for the point Shah is trying to make here in Odisha, the house was perfect. With gaping holes in the roof and walls with their entrails showing, Swain's house is crying out for repairs but he has no money. The local administration has not been able to help him out.Yet, the rural housing scheme is Naveen Patnaiks pet tactic to beat off the BJP advance in his state. So just 20 km from pampered Hinjili, this poverty lunch provided ideal ammo for Amit Shah.It even had a huge lotus painted on the wall.The meal provided the fuel for Shah to go on all day long in his busy trip to Odisha. At a public meeting at Hugulapata village, he declared forth, ""The BJP is going to form the next government in Odisha with two-thirds majority in 2019.""The BJP boss said as a Gujarati he welcome Odiyas who go over to the west coast in search of livelihood. But should they have to? ""It will be better if the youth of Odisha find jobs here, and contribute their mite to the development of the state and take care of their parents, he said.Amit Shah said he owed Odisha. I have not come here as president of the BJP, but as a vistarak (propagator). I became president of the party after becoming an active primary member from Odisha, and it is my job to strengthen the party here like any other BJP worker."""

This is all people are talking about,"" said Elazar Ashtivker, owner of the Maharaja restaurant in the city of Ramla, south of Tel Aviv.""It's historic,"" he said.The fast-talking 33-year-old's parents, who were born in India, opened the restaurant in its first incarnation in the 1980s because they felt ""the community was in decline"".Initially, the restaurant served the Indian community nearly exclusively.But in the 1990s the trend of Israelis travelling to Asia after completing their military service became wildly popular, and many returned home with a taste for the Maharaja's spicy delicacies.The restaurant serves what Ashtivker calls ""mainstream Indian food"" but also sells peppers, vegetables and imported spices.The wording on the poster is in the colours of the Indian flag and invites members of the Indian community, in Hebrew and English, to a July 5 meeting with Modi in Tel Aviv.""There's a lot of excitement,"" Ashtivker said. ""Everyone has signed up and everyone is going.""""If you looked for Indians in Israel on the 5th you won't find any. They'll all be at the convention centre,"" he said with a laugh.- 'Invisible Jews' -Estimates put the number of Jews of Indian origin in Israel at about 100,000, according to Eliaz Dandeker, a historian and author documenting the community.Even those of Indian origin born in Israel maintain a ""deep connection"" to their ancestral homeland, said Dandeker, including through music, cinema, food and cultural events.Events in Israel have featured appearances by Indian actors.Jews made their way to India over the course of the last 3,000 years, and by and large have not suffered religious and racist persecution in the country.They began coming to Israel en masse in the late 1940s and early 1950s for religious and other reasons.Many of them settled in rural communities to become farmers, while others moved to peripheral towns throughout the country.In the first years following the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, many Indian immigrants abandoned their names and traditions as part of the era's ""melting pot"" ideal.READ MORE: Can India, Israel relationship go beyond the 'arms' distance?""There's more openness today"" to Indian culture, the 34-year-old Dandeker said. ""The younger generations want to know more.""- 'He's special' -In his spice shop near the Maharaja, Shaul Divekar, who emigrated from India as a child, scoops red lentils from a sack into a plastic bag, chatting from behind his counter with two customers.The conversation fluctuates between the goods that arrived from India and the prime minister who is about to.Divekar proudly notes he is in charge of one of the seven buses taking Indian Israelis from Ramla to Wednesday's meeting with Modi.""He's special,"" Divekar said of Hindu nationalist Modi, a Bollywood music video playing on a laptop behind the cash register.""He likes Jews,"" proudly offers a tall bearded man in his 30s standing nearby the Indian DVD collection in Divekar's store, his Hebrew heavy with an Indian accent.Dandeker, the historian, notes that Jewish Indians in Israel have been called the ""invisible Jews"" since they are neither Ashkenazis from Europe nor Sephardis from Africa and the Middle East.While members of the community have reached prominence in Israel in fields including medicine and the military, ""a lot of them don't stress their origins"".And with many of them having changed their last names to sound more Israeli, ""it's hard to spot them,"" said Dandeker.Modi's visit and its potential to generate interest among Israelis in Indian culture could help raise the profile of the Indian community.""We expect it to help advance our community,"" said Ashtivker, the restaurateur. ""We're a small community here and don't really stand out."""

Only if one takes a car across, a permission from the Nepal police becomes mandatory and, that too, can be managed without any hassle. Hundreds make journey of some 30km, crossing over the porous border, to reach the town to buy groceries ranging from rice and lentils to whiskey and soft drinks.""Every day, hundreds from Darjeeling come to buy goods such as rice, lentils, vegetables, meat and even liquor bottles and crates of soft drinks,"" said a Nepali police officer posted at the border. Usually, there is a bar on the amount of goods one can carry past the border, but given the prevalent crisis in Darjeeling, the cops are being lenient, he said.Kalyan Lepcha (name changed), who runs a homestay in Ghoom, was found buying groceries the Pashupatinagar market. While he bargained over the price of tomatoes and brinjals at the market, he was also carrying a crate of beer. ""This is the only place where I can get my daily essentials. Before the strike, we used to visit Pashupatinagar only on weekends for recreation or to buy cheap jackets and shoes,"" he said, adding, he got there in his friend's milk van and would hide his goods in the milk drums while returning.There were many like Lepcha shopping and crowding the local liquor shops.

Maharashtra government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the APMCs to enable them to earn higher profits.The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) to enable them to earn higher profits. The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to usher in sweeping reforms, which would be long-lasting and provide an alternative to the present regulated Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, sources in the ministry of agriculture told The Indian Express.Preliminary reports indicate that present markets cannot cope with the challenges of farmers striving to double their farm production and seek higher remuneration. Reforms that would be discussed in the Monsoon Session of the state legislature commencing from July 24, include deregulation of food grains from the APMC to provide more private and direct markets operating between farmers and consumers. The model suggested would be similar to the reforms in the vegetable and fruit markets where farmers have been provided with freedom to sell their goods outside the APMCs.While the government is not going to intervene in existing the APMC structures, it is trying to provide freedom to farmers to explore larger markets outside to fetch higher returns. According to a cabinet minister, a competitive food grain market on the lines of the vegetables and fruits markets would set the process for generating higher returns for the farmers.While acknowledging that the government would not shed its responsibility of procurement of food grains, the minister said: To begin with, we will bring the legislation to make non-implementation of MSP (Minimum Support Price) by traders a punishable act. Almost three farmers organisations that are in discussion with the government on the MSP have also demanded reforms in the APMCs, which often force farmers to sell crops at lower prices.There is a move to raise the number of vegetable and fruit markets from the present 48 to 100 across 36 districts of Maharashtra. Similarly, a larger network to channel the food grains to private markets in larger quantities is high on the government agenda.Today, the MSP is confined to foods grains and pulses. The list (MSP/quintal) is as follows: paddy (Rs 1470), jowar (Rs 1625), wheat (Rs 1625), maize (Rs 1365), bajra (Rs 1330), gram (Rs 4000), tur (Rs 5050), moong (Rs 5225), udit (Rs 5000), sunflower (Rs 3950), soyabean (Rs 2775), groundnut (Rs 4220), cotton (R 4160), safflower (Rs 3700), masoor (Rs 3900), ragi (Rs 1725), sesam (Rs5000); nigerseed (Rs 3825) and mustard ( Rs 3700). The prices of all the other crops, vegetables and fruits are driven by demand and supply, as per the markets.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

In a recent discovery at King George's Medical University, physiology department has created Omega Life a cooking medium it claims will help bring down blood pressure level of CVD and hypertension patients.Leading a joint research, Dr Narsingh Verma, secretary general of the Indian Society of Hypertension along with scholar Kshitij Bhardwaj, they found that growing number of cases of CVD and hypertension were related to imbalance of necessary Omega 3 and Omega 6 fatty acids in our bodies, coming from the oils we consume.""Fish is a great source of Omega 3 but changes in our diet have cut out that source and besides, the nutrients in fish have also reduced in recent times because of the inferior feed it gets,"" said Bhardwaj, adding that for vegetarians, flax seed with 58% Omega 3 is major source.""But flax seed is preferred mostly among rural population given its sour taste and short shelf life, while urban population mostly uses other forms of edible oil with high quantity of Omega 6,"" added Bhardwaj.It was then that Omega Life was born by mixing flax seed oil along with two other oils as natural oxidants giving it a better taste and shell life of eight months. ""We have already applied for the patent. It was an important finding that against the required ratio of 1:1 for Omega 3 and Omega 6, our bodies have the ratio of 1:27, which is harmful and generated mostly because of other edible oils we consume,"" explained Verma.Research on 150 KGMU patients (100 of CVD and 50 of hypertension) was conducted over a one-and-a-half year span. The patients were kept on a single dose of Omega Life oil (no other edible oil used in their food) for six months to see result. They were asked to mix one spoon of the oil in their lentils and pulses and use it for mild frying. ""Their health condition got better and for patients with 170 to 210 blood pressure level, it came down to 130-140 units,"" added Bhadrwaj."

Located in a gorgeous old-Bengaluru house with the soft sounds of Malyalam songs playing in the background, the ambience makes you forget that theres a busy main road right outside.This outlet recently held a Syrian Christian food festival, focusing on the traditional food made in the homes of the Syrian Christian community. On hearing this, anyone familiar with the cuisine of this community, would expect the festival to be a meat lovers paradise. The festival menu, although vast and mouthwatering, stood out for being in the form of a black-and-white newspaper, filled with little nuggets of facts on the cuisine and the community.To start the meal, we were served a refreshing drink comprising tender coconut water, mint leaves and honey. Next came the starters, and though the menu has several options to chose from, we were served the Aattirachi Cutlets (mutton cutlets) accompanied with beetroot chutney and the all-time Kerala favourite, Erachi Ularthiyathu (beef fry). Both dishes were splendid  while the cutlets were melt-in-mouth, and beef fry had the right dose of spices and cut pieces of coconut. We also tried the Kanava Peralan (a dry squid dish prepared with onions and tomatoes) - this was slightly disappointing as the masalas hadnt mixed with the squid well, and lacked flavour overall.For the main course, the Meen Pattichathu (fish curry cooked in an earthen pot) was what we tried first. The fish was tender and fresh and the gravy was just the right consistency, with a heavy dose of coconut and kokum. Served with Kappa Vevichathu (tapioca cooked and mashed with onions, garlics and green chillies), it was mild (despite the bright red colour) and flavourful at the same time. Next, we had the appams with Chicken Ishtew (chicken stew). The appams lacked the crispiness one usually expects, and the centre was lumpy rather than fluffy. The stew on the other hand, was comfort food at its best - rich, coconut-y and with a generous dose of pepper. In fact, the stew was so good that we were able to forgive the rather disappointing appams. Amid all this meat, what we really enjoyed was the pairing of the popular Puttu with a thick lentil gravy, the combination, which we were told is ideally a breakfast dish, was surprisingly good for such a simple dish.For dessert, we were served a tender coconut payassam. This was a miss personally, as the taste of coconut was far too overwhelming. While we wanted to try some of the other desserts on the menu, especially the fried bananas served with a scoop of ice cream, we were told that none of the other desserts were available. Even when it came to the seafood dishes on the menu, a lot of them were unavailable, which was disappointing to say the least, especially after teasing us with such a vast menu.The Syrian Christian food festival got over yesterday, but several of the dishes are available on the regular menu as well.Cost for two: Rs 1,000 (approx)"

Some came from Delhi, some from far-off states. This was a growing tribe of professionals, moving to this Delhi suburb that was fast becoming a corporate hub and a melting pot of identities and culture. It would take a while before a new identity would get forged, a Gurugrammer identity that we see today. But what was it like in those early days? And who were the first Gurugrammers? In the eleventh part of our weekly series, TOI turns the spotlight on the early settlersIf the spaces that first came up in New Gurgaon felt like the back of beyond, then Palam Vihar resembled another country altogether. Such was what Manjit and Saresh Lohiya felt when they moved from Delhi in 1990. ""There was less population and more cycles. And for 4-5 years, the power never went out - we thought, 'Doesn't it ever go?!"" recalls Manjit. Out at the back of their house passed a railway track, and the silences were punctuated by the train's whistle. From nothing, they built a life of contentment for themselves, nurtured by the camaraderie of their neighbours. In 2006, the Lohiyas (including a son) swapped their nest in 'H' block for one in C-2. And even the memory of their neighbourhood being terrorised by dacoits, one December night in 1992, fails to dim their Gurgaon experience.The pioneers of PalamIt was very quiet when we moved here, lots of space. Back then, there were 11 blocks in the colony ('A' to 'K'), and between 300 and 350 families living here. A family here, another there - we were far away from each other. All of us had come from Delhi, and it felt like we had arrived in a new land! But we were all in the same boat, and understood the struggles newcomers faced, so we tried to be there for each other.The breeze that callsWe would leave all the doors and windows open, at the front and back of the house. And because the surrounds were open, and the environment was clean and unpolluted, you'd know the wind is blowing, because you'd feel that vibration in your ears.Figuring out how to travel (and shop)One DTC bus would come to the border, near Bijwasan, which we would reach on scooter or on foot, a distance of some 2-3kms. Then there was one shared three-wheeler, sometimes so packed with passengers that it would struggle to move! There was no local conveyance, no rickshaws, and we were very much dependent on our own vehicles. So, the challenge was always there - how to get to Delhi, how to get back home. Vyapar Kendra in Palam Vihar had a chai-pani shop and a store selling groceries. Mostly, it was just property dealers who would sit in that market. Then, items like flour, grains and lentils were cheaper in Gurgaon but we would end up buying stuff from Delhi.Their wild companionsWe have seen snakes as long as 20-25 feet! I remember, early on, just outside our house, spotting a monitor lizard, its long tongue sticking out. And there were many grasshoppers. And birds  lots and lots of them! Sparrows came in big numbers, a few who would build nests inside our house. And peacocks and pigeons  the place was filled with them. Once, at night, even a scorpion found its way in.That brush with dacoityIt was all very dramatic, but fortunately everyone survived. Next day, the commissioner of police visited and promised more cops. He said that if anyone wanted to get a license for a revolver, he'd sign the form then and there.

A look at how Darjeeling is coping: Long marches Hill residents are walking the extra mile, literally, to keep their hearth burning. A vegetable trader who didn't want to be named said he woke at 4.30am every day and walked 10km to Jorebungalow, and then walked back carrying 30kg to 40kg of vegetables to sell in Darjeeling. ""At night, villagers from various places bring vegetables that are stocked at Jorebungalow,"" he explained. ""Earlier, all we did in the morning (in Darjeeling) was unload the vegetables from the trucks. Now, with no transport, we need to do a lot of legwork. It takes us between one hour and 90 minutes to make it from Jorebungalow with the load."" Today, the trader and his friends carried back cabbage and squash. The shortage has raised vegetable prices by Rs 10 to Rs 20 a kilo. But it's not just the traders - almost every Darjeeling resident is walking a lot more. It's become an unwritten rule that at least one member from each family should attend the Gorkhaland rallies being held every day. ""Attending the rallies is the least we can do for the cause,"" said Sharmila Tamang, a regular. Once the rallies are over around noon, the hunt for vegetables and other rations begins: which means some more walking up and down the hills. Almost every third woman one sees on the town's streets is carrying a shopping bag. ""The bag is always with me these days - who knows when I might chance upon some vegetables?"" a woman said. A resident of Darjeeling's Raj Bari neighbourhood said: ""How long can one watch TV or stay indoors? After the rallies, my friends and I often walk as far as 10km to the town's outskirts, searching for vegetables, mutton and any other edibles."" Rare bird Chicken, most of which used to come from the plains, has virtually vanished off the tables. ""Mutton, pork and beef can be sourced from the countryside but chicken, which used to be the most easily available meat in town, is a struggle to find,"" a resident said. An official at the Padmaja Naidu Himalayan Zoological Park said: ""We need 70kg to 80kg meat every day for the animals. While we are getting mutton and beef, there's no chicken; so we can't rotate the menu like we did."" Among vegetables, the choice is limited to squash and its tendrils, watercress, cabbage and potatoes. ""I have occasionally been able to find beans. My family wasn't too fond of watercress before, but nowadays they don't grumble much,"" a woman said. New nightlife Darjeeling was known to sleep early and silent. Now it's making a beeline for the markets after dark. The night is when food stocks mostly reach the hills, clandestinely - eluding what many allege are the authorities' efforts to stall food lorries at Siliguri to spite the agitation's spearheads. ""The moment the rations come and we open our shop, the stock vanishes,"" a shopkeeper said. Samaritans Hardship has kindled the spirit of humanity. ""With likeminded friends, I have formed a loose group called the Darjeeling Initiative (DI). We are distributing free rations in the villages,"" said Arbin Subba. Pooling their own money with donations from the well-off, Subba and his friends are buying food stocks from the plains, where they have contacts, and distributing packets containing 10kg rice, 500gm lentils and edible oil in hill villages. ""Since July 5, we have reached 224 households covering 14 villages in Okayti, Durpin and Thulung Gaon in Mirik subdivision. Today, we reached out to at least 100 households in Nagri,"" Arbin said. A Darjeeling district court lawyer who lives in Lebong, around 7km from town, said: ""I come to court with my bag full of vegetables and other foodstuff for my friends and acquaintances in Darjeeling every day. Sadly, I have run out of petrol for my two-wheeler from today."" Disconnected The Internet ban imposed since June 20 - officially, to prevent rumour-mongering; allegedly, to prevent mobilisation of agitators - has virtually cut most hills people off from the outside world. ""I can't connect with friends and family members outside the hills. I even have to ration my phone calls; who knows when I might have the next chance to top up my phone credit?"" a college girl said. ""Outstation friends have recharged my credit but you can't ask them to do it again and again."" The Internet ban and lack of transport has left many students struggling to apply for admission to colleges outside the hills. Even local TV channels have been barred from airing. Local news is a trickle now, adding to the day-to-day frustration. Some are attempting to beat the Internet blues. ""Sikkim and Nepal are helping us cheat the Internet ban, but we need to climb up the hills to vantage points to receive signals from Sikkim towns. The data speed is slow and, today, we had no signals from these towers, either,"" said Akash, a college student. On the plus side, social bonding is improving. ""People are now stepping out to socialise. We all gather at one of our neighbours' place in the evening, discuss the agitation and share meals,"" a resident said. ""This is a spirit Darjeeling had lost but is reviving now. Our neighbourhood is turning out to be one big family in this hour of crisis. 'Class' divide The children are probably the happiest lot. With the schools (and colleges) closed since June 15, it's been all play for them, with just a little studying at home. Darjeeling, which hardly offered children any open spaces, has turned into a vast playground, with cricket and football having free run of its streets. The parents are worried, though. ""My son will be taking the ICSE exams next year: I'm concerned how long this strike will last and whether his school will be able to teach the full syllabus,"" a parent said. A group of 11 teachers and some local youths are holding classes for 150-odd students at Takdah. ""Since June 18, we have been teaching them free of charge at the Sirigaon forest community hall and the Tiny Angels School, from 10am to 2pm every day,"" said Trideep Basnet, a teacher. Silver lining A homemaker said the shutdown had opened a window of opportunity for her. ""Every morning, my milkman now delivers not just milk to me but also vegetables, cereals and other foodstuff from his village,"" she said. ""I have begun selling them in front of my home at a small profit. My stock of ginger, garlic, tomatoes and chillies sold out in no time today."""
5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

It is a three-day mission meant to get the feet dirty, the sort of which was prescribed by Shah to all Union ministers when they assembled in Bhubaneswar for the BJP national executive back in May. That was where the booth-level offensive to capture frontiers hitherto unconquered - such as Odisha - was unfurled, and Shah is here to lead by example. As is par for the course for Amit Shah atmospherics these days, a poor farmer was found whose meal the BJP boss would partake in sight of popping flashbulbs.Shah and his missionaries sat down to a suitably spartan meal served on plantain leaves in th house of Benu Swain, a 50-year-old farmer of Hugulapata village in Kukudakhandi block.The meal of rice, dal, ghaanta (a mix of greens and lentils) and fried vegetable may have been simple for the guests - Shah, Dharmendra Pradhan and retinue - but princely for Swain, a widowed man with four sons to provide for.As a backdrop for the point Shah is trying to make here in Odisha, the house was perfect. With gaping holes in the roof and walls with their entrails showing, Swains house is crying out for repairs but he has no money. The local administration has not been able to help him out.Yet, the rural housing scheme is Naveen Patnaiks pet tactic to beat off the BJPs advance in his State. So just 20 km from pampered Hinjili, this poverty lunch provided ideal ammo for Amit Shah. It even had a huge lotus painted on the wall.The meal provided the fuel for Shah to go on all day long in his busy trip. At a public meeting at Hugulapata village, he declared forth, The BJP is going to form next government in Odisha with two-thirds majority in 2019. The BJP boss said as a Gujarati he welcomes Odias who go over to the west coast in search of livelihood. But should they have to? It will be better if the youth of Odisha find jobs here, and contribute their mite to the development of the State and take care of their parents, he said.Shah said he owed Odisha. I have not come here as president of the BJP, but as a vistarak (propagator). I became president of the party after becoming an active primary member from Odisha, and it is my job to strengthen the party here like any other BJP worker, he said."

Federal agriculture officials have labeled as poor or very poor more than half of Montanas 2017 crops of spring wheat, lentils and durum.A punishing drought that stretches across much of the U.S. Northern Plains could cause farmers to lose 64 million bushels of wheat production this year, according to federal officials. That dire projection comes as northeast Montana experiences the worst drought in the country, with similar dry conditions in neighboring North Dakota and South Dakota. The federal government has declared numerous counties in the three-state region to be disaster areas and authorized haying and grazing on land meant for conservation to help alleviate the conditions.Federal agriculture officials have labeled as poor or very poor more than half of Montanas 2017 crops of spring wheat, lentils and durum. Combined, the three crops were valued at more than $600 million in 2016. A scant 1.2 inches of rain have been recorded since April 1 in the small town of Nashua on the edge of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.Ranchers also will lose in this drought, said Ed Hinton, an auctioneer who drives down from Scobey for the weekly sale at the Glasgow Stockyards. Ranchers turn up every Thursday to sell off an animal or two, usually a heifer who didnt get pregnant, or a belligerent steer not worth the trouble, or the hay now selling for $180 a ton. Theres nothing like crop insurance for livestock. In times of drought, the U.S. Department of Agriculture opens up grasslands previously off limits for conservation. After that, theres low interest loans.The Thursday sale the week before the Fourth of July brought a thousand cattle to the stockyards, Hinton said, at a time of year when a few hundred cattle at a sale is respectableFor all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The Centre has exempted cereals, pulses, atta, maida and besan from the GST , which was rolled out from July 1, claiming that these items would get cheaper by up to 5%; however, noticing no change in the prices of some of these items, the state government in a letter to the directorate of agro marketing and agro foreign trade stated that instead of getting cheaper, these items were being sold on older prices.According to data for the second week of July available with the state government, the prices of all edible items, except a few, have been fallen. Wheat, rice, maze, barley, gram, lentil, moong and urad dal, onion, apple and banana have become cheaper after the GST implementation, it says.Agro marketing director Dhiraj Kumar said, ""It is observed that the prices of 17 agro products have fallen to the tunes of Rs 9 to Rs 374 per quintal after July 1, but there is no visible change in the prices of these items in the retail market.

It also directed the principal secretary of the state's co-operation, food and consumer protection department to file a counter to the case filed against procurement of masoor dal and adjourned the case to August 28.The department on March 6 last passed a government order giving effect to various tasks including permitting the TNCSC to procure masoor dal to supply it to fair price shops (ration shops). Acting on it, former deputy director of animal husbandry Aasthi Jaganatha filed a public interest litigation (PIL). The court gave an interim injunction on July 10.On Wednesday, when the PIL came up for hearing before the division bench headed by justice KK Sasidharan, the petitioner pointed out that masoor dal was used in government's noon meal scheme in schools and noon meal centres decades ago. As it was alleged that the dal was harmful to human beings, Karur district collector took steps and found that toxin was present in it.The collector requested the government to stop the supply of masoor dal to the noon meal programme. The social welfare department on March 1, 2007 passed a government order prohibiting its supply to noon meal programmes.However, the co-operation, food and consumer protection department on March 6 passed a government order enabling the TNCSC to procure masoor dal to supply it to the fair price shops, the petitioner said.The government submitted the counter filed by managing director of TNCSC, K Gopal. In that, he justified his procurement by saying that masoor dal is not harmful to mankind. Also, some people who applied for taking tender to procure masoor dal wanted them to be added as parties in the case.The petitioner said that the principal secretary of cooperation, food and consumer protection was supposed to file a counter. Following this, the court dismissed the pleas of private people who wanted to be impleaded in the case by saying that they had no locus standi to file such pleas and directed the principal secretary to file a counter.The court adjourned the case to August 28."

Gopal filed a counter affidavit stating that masoor dhal, being grown at present was safe, unharmful and highly beneficial to health, a Division Bench of Justices K.K. Sasidharan and G.R. Swaminathan ordered that the Principal Secretary of Cooperation, Food, Civil Supplies, Consumer Protection and Price Control Department should file a separate counter affidavit by August 28 enunciating the governments stand.In his counter affidavit filed in reply to a public interest litigation petition, Mr. Gopal said the government had stopped procuring and supplying masoor dhal for noon meal programme in 2007 following a letter written to it by the then Karur Collector. Relying upon a chemical analysis report, the Collector had stated that the dhal contained Beta Oxalyl Alanine, a neurotoxin which on sustained consumption could cause neurolathyrism.Claiming that the toxins were due to presence of kesari dhal in masoor dhal since most of the farmers used kesari dhal as an intercrop while cultivating masoor dhal , the TNCSC MD said such intercropping had been banned now. He further said pure masoor dhal was a good source of cholesterol-lowering fibre and it had high protein nutritive value, besides being economical and having the ability to reduce chances of breast cancer.Informing the court that high-end facilities for quality checks were available at present and that the presence of kesari dhal in masoor dhal could be easily detected through machines, Mr. Gopal said a notification issued by the TNCSC on June 24 calling for tenders for supply of masoor dhal had clearly said presence of even 0.01% of kesari dhal in the supply would not be tolerated.He had also urged the court to vacate the interim stay imposed by the court on July 10 on procuring masoor dhal for PDS, but the judges adjourned further hearing in the case till August 28.They also refused to entertain applications filed by some individuals, including a tenderer, to include them as respondents to the PIL petition."

""On the basis of a false CBI case against my son Tejashwi, Nitish withdrew from the alliance and sat on the lap of the BJP. Nitish never asked my son to resign from the ministry,"" he said. ""I trusted Nitish and, in turn, he stabbed Bihar in the back,"" Lalu said, repeating what he said yesterday in Patna. Lalu arrived at the Jharkhand government guesthouse at Morabadi at 6am and asked for coconut water and gram for breakfast, said sources. He was there till the beginning of the oath-taking ceremony, which he saw briefly on television. "" Ye kitna rang badlega ji? Kitna partner badlega? Kitnon ke god me baithega ji?

Contrary to popular belief, Dubai offers a delectable treat to vegetarians as well. Kusdhari, an Egyptian dish made of rice; macaroni and lentils; and charcoal lemonade are just some of the various delicacies that Dubai has to offer.Given the large Indian population in Dubai, it is only fitting that India gets a proportionate representation in Dubais cuisine. Michelin Star chef, Atul Kochhars restaurant, Rang Mahal at JW Marriott Marquis at Business Bay overlooks the Dubai Canal and serves up authentic Kerala style chicken among other dishes such as sweet and tangy aloo chaat and tawe kee champen (pan-grilled lamb chops in pepper marinade) that are cooked to varying flavours based on the customers preference.Dubai is also home to the samboosa, a dish available with beef or spinach filling and served with pomegranate chutney, which is the predecessor of the Indian samosa. The vegetarian menu at the rich-in ambiance restaurant included Saag Paneer, it is winter spinach and Masala Paneer grilled together. Badam Aur Shatavari Ki Tikki, which is almond and asparagus galette spiced with fennel and ginger. Malai Kofta Curry in Delhi style. A Kerala delicacy Kadambam Varuval was Kerala style vegetable masala with shallots, curry leaves and home ground Kerala spices. As a south Indian, it felt home on taste-buds.The desserts included chocolate delice, pistachio ice cream and poached pears.The Dubai Food Festival saw immense participation from food vendors and foodies alike. Among the most popular stalls was Kaak Al Manara, a Lebanese joint on Jumeirah Road. Its most sought-after dish was Kaak, a bag shaped, dairy free, vegan bread made of wheat flour and sesame. Its founderZiyak Ayaz was the first to introduce Kaak in Dubai two years ago at the Ripe Market and has diversified the simple bread into various flavours of which the authentic pickle and spread salty cheese topped with sumac was our favourite.Other dishes on demand include Polish sauteed mushrooms on a bed of tomato sauce topped with cheese. Not to be bowed down, the Emirati dishes were making their presence felt during our journey with servings of lugaimat, a sweet delicacy with soft filling inside and a crisp doughnut like crust on the outside, and a master class by Queen of Arab Kitchen, chef Manal Al Alem, who took us through the preparation of fireed (vegetables cooked in meat broth), majboos (rice and chickpea with a whole chicken fillet), and a deep-tasting shrimp soup namedrubiyan and of course fruit salad with custard. Apart from showing us live on how those delicacies are cooked, she also made us take part in cooking the same."

Gopal filed a counter affidavit stating that masoor dal , being grown at present was safe, unharmful and highly beneficial to health, a Division Bench of Justices K.K. Sasidharan and G.R. Swaminathan ordered that the Principal Secretary of Cooperation, Food, Civil Supplies, Consumer Protection and Price Control Department should file a separate counter affidavit by August 28 enunciating the governments stand.In his counter affidavit filed in reply to a public interest litigation petition, Mr. Gopal said the government had stopped procuring and supplying masoor dal for noon meal programme in 2007 following a letter written to it by the then Karur Collector.Relying upon a chemical analysis report, the Collector had stated that the dal contained Beta Oxalyl Alanine, a neurotoxin which on sustained consumption could cause neurolathyrism.Claiming that the toxins were due to presence of kesari dal in masoor dal since most of the farmers used kesari dal as an intercrop while cultivating masoor dal, the TNCSC MD said such inter cropping had been banned now.He said pure masoor dal was a good source of cholesterol-lowering fibre and it had high protein nutritive value, besides being economical."

More than 20 months have passed since 921 Indians, who used to stay in Indian enclaves landlocked within Bangladesh, stepped into the Indian mainland, with the hope of a better life. But now, they want to return to Bangladesh. ""We were assured of a proper rehabilitation package, including job opportunities for a member of each family. But in the past two years, there has been no initiative from the government. I used to sell medicines in Bangladesh but ever since I have come here, I am sitting idle and forced to do odd jobs to run the family.... I want to go back to Bangladesh,"" said a disenchanted Osman Gani, sitting at the camp built for them at Krishimela Ground in Dinhata. Koushik Saha, the district magistrate of Cooch Behar, said he had no information that a section of the enclave dwellers wanted to return to Bangladesh. Thirty-five year-old Gani used to stay at Chotogaraljhora - II, a former Indian enclave located under Kurigram district of Bangladesh. His family is among the 58 families which stay at the same camp since crossing over to India on 22, 2015. Each family has been provided with a tinned-roof hutment, a small kitchen and an electric connection. Also, there are general connections for water supply and toilets at the camp premises, which has been developed as a part of the rehabilitation plan. Foreign ministry officials are conceding that there is some disenchantment among the about 920 Indians who came across the border after the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) was implemented, in particular because local authorities have taken time to process the documents they need to be able to access social services. But they haven't heard, they say, reports of people preparing to return. What has happened though - according to the joint secretary in charge of ties with Bangladesh, who visits the enclaves frequently - is that the Bangladeshi enclaves that became a part of India though the agreement have turned into hotbeds of Trinamul versus BJP politics. ""There is some political tussle and that's why the discontent quotient is high,"" said a state government official. But the enclave dwellers said they were shattered because the promises made to them were not fulfilled. Asked what prompted him to consider returning to other side of the border, Gani said:""The Bangladesh government is carrying out infrastructure development in these areas and have made arrangements to provide employment to the residents of former enclaves. ""While we are living at these hutments now and lack any permanent source of earning, our former neighbours are being provided with different assistance in Bangladesh. That is why some of us are thinking of returning back to Bangladesh."" State minister Rabindranath Ghosh, who is from Cooch Behar, however, claimed that elaborate work was going on for rehabilitation of the erstwhile enclave residents. He, however, was silent over the issue of providing employment to these families. ""Locations have been identified where multi-storied buildings would be constructed and each family will be provided with a flat. Also, work of community halls is going one. Electricity has been provided in the camps and all other basic infrastructure would be made ready in due course. Simultaneously, the state is also carrying out development in the erstwhile Bangladeshi enclaves which have merged into Indian mainland now,"" he said. He also pointed out that other than shelter and basic amenities, each family has been provided with 30 kilos of rice, five kilos of mustard oil, five litres of kerosene, five kilos of lentil, 1.50 kilos of salt and one kg of milk powder every month."

Airy and green, it is quite different from the stereotypical images often shown in movies. Many of the inmates perform a number of activities such as reading and gardening during their free time. Running in between their feet, and getting in the way, but inviting no ones ire is a four-year-old boy, who along with his mother, has been languishing in the prison for over a year despite her getting bail.One year and ten days exactly, said 21 year-old Gomathi*, as she stroked her childs head, while sitting on the pavement outside the cellular block of the prison. We have been here that long. I feel bad for my child. He is here only because of me, she said.A year ago, Gomathi was arrested on charges of breaking into a house in Anna Nagar, along with nine others. Her accomplices have reportedly been let out on bail. Gomathi continues to remain in prison because she has not been able to produce any sureties.Her son is the darling of the prison complex. He is cosseted by everyone, including prison officers. One of the prisoners dropped by to give him her share of lentil vada , Tuesdays special in the kitchen. He immediately grabbed it and began playing with it. His mother then patiently took the crumbs away from him, and fed him. After he was fed, the boy began crying.I am really worried about him, she said. It will soon be time to admit him in a school. I do not want him to be known as the boy who lived in prison. He is here only because of my fault, she said.Prison officers said that they tried to trace her family, but in vain. She has no personal bond or sureties, and we need those to send prisoners out, said a senior officer. There are currently 12 under-trial prisoners in the womens prison and Gomathi is one of them. Officers pointed out that there are many like her.The Law Commission, in its 268th report, highlighted this issue and made recommendations to make it easier for all those awaiting trial to obtain bail. It was noted that 67% of the current prison population is made up of under-trials, which shows inconsistency in the grant of bail.The Supreme Court too noted that poverty was the main reason for incarceration of many persons, as they are unable to afford bail bonds or provide sureties.The report also pointed out to Section 436-A in the Criminal Procedure Code, (Cr.P.C.), 1973 which states that under-trial prisoners who suffered detention during the period of investigation, inquiry or trial for one-half of their maximum imprisonment should be released by the court on personal bond with or without sureties. Sudha Ramalingam, advocate, Madras High Court, said that it was the duty of the prison authorities to inform the Legal Aid Counsel about the inmates situation, who, in turn, must take steps to release her on her own bond.Prison officials expect Gomathi to be released soon.* (name changed)We tried to trace her relativesbut our effortswere in vainPrison officer"

He needed to clock 150 km on the final day on Sunday, after falling behind schedule through illness.But the 44-year-old could only complete 114 km, falling agonisingly short of his target  which was the equivalent of about a quarter of the Earths circumference.He was plagued by gastro-intestinal infections and contracted viral fever but has run 9,964.19 kms in 100 days, said Vikram Bhatti, who handled Mr. Singhs campaign.Dressed in a blue sports vest, Mr. Singh started each day in the early hours from the northern Mumbai slums and headed to the business district in the citys south.Untiring spiritMy journey of running 100 kilometres per day is very challenging but I wanted to show the endurance limit of human spirit, Mr. Singh said ahead of the final run.Friends mocked the man from Madhya Pradesh for taking on the challenge, but it became an attempt that caught the public imagination.I survived without a job for the last nine months and people have come forward and supported me with donations, shoes, clothes and equipment, Mr. Singh said.He had a GPS watch, a basic mobile phone for emergencies and Rs. 200 a day. The runner said he particularly enjoyed his meal of rice and spicy lentils, after every run.The five-time ultra-marathon winner lost 16 kg during the challenge as his exertions took their toll.I have focused on my goals with determination and nurtured my dreams despite cracked heels, fractured joints and legs, Mr. Singh said.He was spotted one day by Mumbai documentary-makers Vandana and Vikram Bhatti, who named him The Faith Runner.We met him on the 47th day of his challenge and were taken aback by his story. So, we have been running a Facebook campaign to create awareness and generate funds for Samir, said Vandana Bhatti.Fans joined him for several stretches of his run each day.Mr. Singhs run was longer than the Great Wall of China (5,500km) and further than the distance from Mumbai to London (7,200km). He went to a temple to pray on Monday, giving up a plan to complete the last 36 km.Mr. Singh said he would now rest, and then starting mapping out a new challenge  this time over 40,000 kilometres.I have not met my mother for a while as she would be heartbroken looking at my sunken face. But I am happy so many people are invested in my story right now, Mr. Singh said."

The government must ensure strict compliance of tender condition that the stock (masoor dal) supplied should be free from artificial colour and presence of kesari dal, conform to current season's crop, be in sound merchantable condition, sweet, dry, clean, free from moulds, living insects, obnoxious smell, discolouration and admixture of deleterious substances and all other impurities.""On March 6, the government issued an order permitting the Tamil Nadu Civil Supplies Corporation to procure masoor dal for supply to fair price shops. It, soon after, prohibited the supply of masoor dal to noon-meal programme on the basis of Karur district collector's report that it was unfit for human consumption. It was then that the present PIL was filed by former deputy director of animal husbandry, Aasthi Jaganathan.Granting conditional permission to authorities now, the bench said samples of masoor dal must be sent to accredited food analytical laboratories for testing, and it must be sent for distribution through ration shops only after ensuring that it was free of kesari dal and that it was fit for human consumption.The bench said, cautioning the government that it must comply with its undertaking given in the counter-affidavit filed by cooperation, food and consumer protection department principal secretary Pradeep Yadav, said: ""TNCSC must adopt a strict protocol and the masoor dal shall be brought to the supply chain only after quality check to rule out the presence of kesari dal.""In his counter, Yadav said: ""The government has never banned consumption of masoor dal by the public in the state. The presence of BOAA (Beta-N-Oxalyl Amino Alanine) in the dal sample was only due to admixture of kesari dal. It is also evident from the tests recently conducted on randomly-collected masoor dal samples from market by food analysis lab of King Institute and other private labs under food safety and drug administration department, which clearly reveal the absence of BOAA.""Masoor dal is grown in more than nine states including Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Bengal and Rajasthan and the overall production is around 10 lakh metric tonnes. Sufficient measures have been put in place to rule out presence of kesari dal in masoor dal. There are facilities of modern technologies - grader and colour sorter for pulses, through which the presence of kesari dal in masoor can easily be identified and segregated. Besides, National Accreditation Board for Laboratories accredited food analytical labs are also available in Tamil Nadu for testing, the secretary said."

But, down here in Chennai, the German International School has traded in the sausages for the lentils and the salami for the broccoli.The school, located in Palavakkam , has declared itself completely vegan from this school year, serving its students breakfast, lunch and snacks that are only plantbased.The school was inspired to cut out all animal products after it began throwing open its gates to injured and abandoned animals. As Thomas A Pallushek, advisor for international schools, Asia Pacific, puts it, it became tough to eat mutton with a pet goat on the lawns nearby. ""We felt it was ethically not right. We wanted to reduce the human impact on the environment and eating less meat is the simplest way,"" he says, adding that turning vegan is also healthier.So from the middle of 2016, the school that had been serving chicken, beef, fish and cheese, decided to first cut down on the consumption, even while increasing awareness among students. ""We watched a couple of informative documentaries on veganism with the students and also included it in our ethics classes,"" says Pallushek. Parents were informed and invited to a vegan buffet in December last year. ""They were very surprised to find it both delicious and nutritious,"" he says.The school, now 100% vegan, makes its own mock meat, produces vegan cheese from cashews, and bakes its own bread. Care is taken to see that nutritional requirements are met, by substituting animal products with protein-rich food such as quinoa, lentils, seitan, beans and hemp seeds. The menu ranges from cucumber avocado toast, zucchini bread and apple sauce, to ratatouille, flavoured rice with dal curry, pumpkin spice muffins and fruit smoothies.Neha Banerjee, whose daughter Tishta, 9, studies in the school, is happy that she is being introduced to healthy fare. ""We are a nonvegetarian family. At home, I can't get her to eat vegetables.

This was informed by Vice-Chancellor (VC) of the agriculture university, SN Pasupalak on Thursday.Addressing a gathering on the occasion of 56th Foundation Day of the institution, the VC said NRSC will provide farmers under OUAT exact information on farm land status and water availability besides, conducive weather condition to help them plan agriculture works and water resource management.This apart, the Centre would train young scientists from different disciplines of the university for follow up satellite data for integrated use of geospatial tools with crop models and in-situ observation network for timely crop production forecast, drought assessment and monitoring.Addressing the gathering, Governor and Chancellor of Universities SC Jamir said, agriculture has largely been seen as a development sector, for managing poverty, not for creating wealth. For agriculture to move away from being seen as just a billion mouths to feed, it must start modernising agriculture, from farm to the table and with supporting agro-industrial development, he said. Jamir also inaugurated a rooftop solar plant of 815 kw and a water harvesting system on the OUAT premises.Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout stressed upon using indigenous seed varieties and technologies for development of a sustainable agriculture system.Pasupalak informed that OUAT will soon set up Atal Incubation Centre to foster budding agri-entrepreneurs in the field of agriculture and allied areas and steps have also been initiated to establish community radio stations in each of the 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs) of OUAT to disseminate real time information within 1,015 km radius.

Its our fate that this government too has become insensitive it just triggers hope but delivers nothing, not even in the time of crisis, Sudha Devi, sitting under a tatty awning, says.Life on an embankmentStretched over 10 km from Dumri to Buddha Nagara Radha to Rajwara, the embankment is the lifeline for the flood-hit villagers, mostly poor and daily-wage agricultural labourers. The devastating floods having snatched away almost everything, they took refuge here clutching their meagre belongings. Some managed to rescue their cows, buffaloes and goats, now tied to a bamboo keel by the side of their shanties. Blank wooden cots, torn plastic mats, a few utensils and earthen stoves make up the rest of their possessions. Land is scarce and the first one to reach gets the right to erect a tent. Latecomers frantically vie for vacant spots. We waited till we lost everything now life is on loan, says Dinesh Thakur, an agricultural labourer.More than 50,000 people have taken shelter on this embankment built in 1954. If this had not been here, imagine our fate, says Subodh Kumar Suman, a primary school teacher of Roshanpur Chakki. His village and school are under water but he has been helping fellow victims settle down on this embankment.Suman offers us a ride on his motorcycle from one breached place of the embankment to another. At both the breached places  Rajwara and Rohua  villagers are scrambling to get on the motor boats run by two different teams of the National Disaster Response Force to cross the river. It is a stampede-like situation but there is little one can do to bring order. An NDRF man helming a motor boat appears helpless as he ferries more people beyond the prescribed capacity of eight. Yes, its a risk of life but what are our options? he says.There is no sign of government or non-government relief reaching out to those taking shelter on Buddha Nagara Radha embankment. The electricity in the entire area has snapped and no official has bothered to visit. Their meagre food ration has run out. The survivors talk about how they eat snails, fish and rats anything they can lay their hands on, and drink the floodwaters, use mobile phones as torches and wait for days for help to reach them from somewhere. No one comes here wholl come to this death trap surrounded by floodwaters on all sides with the bund breached at two places? says Lal Babu Rai of Manika Chand village, which shares boundaries with the embankment.At several places on the embankment the flood-hit new settlers crowd around us mistaking us for government officials. The government has not given us the black tarpaulin sheets to cover our heads which people of other flood-affected areas have got what to talk of food or anything else! Were left at the mercy of the elements, says Ram Pravesh Kumar. His father Sivan Bhagat is ill and had taken to the only cot the family has. Life for us here is hellworse than hell, Bhagat says in a hushed broken tone. He has been suffering from diarrhoea for the past two days.The squalid, filth-ridden narrow pathway on the embankment is marked by open defecation and a fetid stench filling the air. Stray dogs scuttle through the crowded settlement while men and women lounge listlessly under the plastic-covered shanties seeking shade from the oppressive heat and humidity. The swollen floodwaters furiously lap against the walls of the embankment. The dwellers complain of snakebites and swarms of insects who have also made their home here. Diseases like diarrhoea and viral fever have gradually started surfacing.The other challenge is arranging fodder for the cattle. Cows, buffaloes and goats can be seen munching, almost mechanically, without fodder in their mouth. They are starving earlier we waded through the floodwaters to get something for them to eat but now everything is submerged, says Janak Sahni, adding, its a battle to save either our life or our cattle.The government records put animal deaths in the State at 192; compensation of Rs. 30,000 for the loss of every milch cow and buffalo and Rs. 3,000 for a goat has been announced. Its allbakwas(nonsense) when they cannot reach us, how do they know our cattle have died? The government officials make money in the name of relief and compensation to flood victims, complains Thakur.The flood in Muzaffarpur has left the villagers marooned in misery. Even the relatively well-off could be seen queuing for relief food packets distributed by a social organisation named Sant Nirankari Charitable Foundation at Rohua. Nobody is sure how long the flood will take to recede... we had never seen anything this big before, says Mahendra Manjhi while taking a packet ofchhura(beaten rice) andgur(jaggery). His family will have to make do with this and a few packets of Parle-G biscuits for the night; tomorrow is another day.Politics of tokenismThe floods in Bihar have rendered 12.6 million people homeless in 21 districts with recorded deaths of over 370 people till August 24. The State government claims to have evacuated over 7,76,000 people. It has also been running 1,385 relief camps and 2,569 community kitchens. Overall, over 4,21,000 people have taken shelter in 1,385 relief camps and around 4,23,000 people are eating in those community kitchens. Altogether 28 teams of NDRF with 118 motor boats, 16 teams of the State Disaster Response Force with 92 boats, and seven teams of the Army with 70 boats and two helicopters have been pressed into service for relief and rescue operations in the flood-affected areas. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is scheduled to make an aerial visit of the flood-hit areas of north Bihar on Saturday and hold meetings with Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who has regularly been making aerial surveys of the marooned districts and inspecting relief distribution operations. Opposition parties, Rashtriya Janata Dal and Congress, have demanded that the Central government declare Bihar floods a national calamity.The tragedy behind this recurring narrative is best explained by flood expert Dinesh Mishra, convenor of Barh Mukti Abhiyan, an NGO challenging top-down flood control policymaking: Unlike the British, our elected governments do not keep records of movement of rivers they just believe in raising embankments, levees, roads and highways to stop flood and, above all, nobody is held accountable for the floods. Today, floods in Bihar ironically mean distribution of food packets, compensation, aerial surveys by leaders, and misuse of government funds in the name of raising heights and plug-ins of embankments, highways and roads, he says. But what is the solution? Were so centrally surrounded by rivers that we cannot escape floods, but we can minimise destruction to life and cattle, says Mishra. Veteran RTI activist Mahendra Yadav, who has been working for the welfare of victims of the 2008 floods in Madhepura, Saharsa and Supaul, says, Nobody cares for the flood victims except providing them the customary 1.5 kg packet ofchhura-gurand setting up these unhygienic relief camps. He rues that forget the government, even NGOs distributes relief materials to places where they can reach conveniently.Highway to despairThis looks true as we travel on National Highway-57, which connects Muzaffarpur to Purnea. Hundreds of thousands of flood-hit people have taken shelter near Darbhanga on both sides of the highway under black tarpaulin-covered tent houses. Here, theyre not as unlucky as those living on the Budha Nagara Radha embankment in Muzaffarpur. Someone had come to distribute this black polythene to us, says Garbu Ram, who along with his family of eight members took shelter here after torrents of floodwater gushed into his village Kumarpatti, 15 km from Darbhanga town. Until a fortnight ago Ram had a thatched house, three goats, a cow and Rs. 4,000 in hand, but today he is penniless, living with his family under a temporary canopy of black tarpaulin. Most of the areas in Darbhanga-Madhubani districts are flooded this year. Like Ram, over 50 other families of his village too have made NH-57 their home for the past 10 days.Just inches away from the speeding trucks, lorries, luxury coaches, vans, cars and SUVs passing on the highway, the flood-affected families live in constant danger of being crushed. Their buffaloes, cows and goats loitering around are at greater risk. At night it becomes dark and the speeding vehicles light blinds us momentarily our cots shake as they whizz past, says Ram Bhajan Sahu, who, along with his family of 12, has taken shelter on NH-57. All the time we hold them tightly to our chests, he says of the children in his family.Pointing towards their submerged thatched houses in the nearby Shobhan village, the NH-57 residents say that only three things have been on the rise in the last 10 days: our hunger and debt and the floodwaters. Most of them are daily-wage agricultural labourers who make 50-60 rupees a day, but ever since the floods, they have been unable to find any work.A week ago, Manoj Mallick and Ramesh Kumar saw a helicopter dropping food packets at some distance on the highway but before they could reach there, the food was claimed by some passengers on a bus. The government declares that relief camps have been set up for people like us but can you direct me to any of those camps nearby those camps in faraway villages have basically been usurped and controlled by upper-caste, well-off people, says one, adding, They sell the relief stuffs to ration shops and we buy them from there, paying money borrowed from well-off people on heavy interest.On National Highway-77, which connects Vaishali to Sitamarhi, the flood-hit families are living in rows under black tarpaulin sheets near Basaitpur bridge of Runni Saidpur block, badly affected by the swirling waters of the Bagmati and Lakhandayee rivers this year. There is just one handpump half a km away for drinking water. About 500 families have taken shelter on the highway but no one has come to take notice if it persists for a few more days, well die of hunger one by one, says Sanjay Ram. His newborn baby is sleeping just few inches away inside the tent from the speeding tyres of vehicles on the highway. A child aged nine met with an accident a few days ago with a speeding bus but survived miraculously. As a precaution, the highway dwellers have put cement boulders, bricks, banana stems and logs outside their dwellings to keep the speeding vehicles at bay.The condition of Sanjay Rams neighbours on the highway, Shambhu Manjhi and Ramesh Manjhi, are quite similar. They have been surviving on a handful of chhura-gur and snails and fish caught from the floodwaters. In 2004, there was a similar flood that hit Sitamarhi. At that time, the highway was in a poor, dilapidated condition. But the restoration work on this stretch in the intervening years has now helped those fleeing the floodwaters. At least here we can hide our head and wait for someone to come with a packet ofchhuraandgur, says Ram. He and other families also fear the dark for another reason: antisocial elements are on the prowl.As darkness falls, silence descends on NH-77. Suddenly, a van materialises laden withkhichdi(a mash of rice and lentil). The highway dwellers quickly surround it, but the van suddenly picks up speed and vanishes into the darkness. Life has been a cruel joke for us, says Sanjay Ram as another hungry night beckons and they all trudge back to the tarpaulin tents they call home.This government too has become insensitive it just triggers hope but delivers nothing, not even in the time of crisisSudha DeviFlood victimWere so centrally surrounded by rivers that we cannot escape floods, but we can minimise destruction to life and cattle.Dinesh MishraConvenor of Barh Mukti Abhiyan, an NGO challenging top-down flood control policymakingAt night it becomes dark and the speeding vehicles light blinds us momentarily our cots shake as they whizz past.

Telegraph picture Bhubaneswar, Aug. 27: The Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) will promote and support production of nutrition-rich crops in seven districts to check problem of malnutrition in the state. ""Malnutrition rate is high among kids and health status of women in our state is also poor. We have selected seven districts that are most affected where we would promote cultivation of nutrition-rich crop varieties such as green crops, pulses, millets, leafy vegetables and so on,"" said vice-chancellor Surendra Nath Pasupalak told The Telegraph on the sidelines of the OUAT foundation day event. The seven districts identified are Boudh, Kandhamal, Koraput, Rayagada, Gajapati, Nuapada and Jajpur. The varsity has partnered with voluntary organisations, which will monitor the improvement in health indicators after one year. According to sources, 34 per cent of the total children below five years age in the state are underweight. The varsity has also decided to expand its research across the state. The research will be done in districts to provide quality seeds of pulses, paddy, maize and wheat to the farmers. ""The aim is to double the farmers' income in the state by 2022,"" said Pasupalak. The varsity is working on developing cold and weed resistance pulse varieties. Under the project, five varieties, including green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans, will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest is done. ""By doing the dual crop of both paddy and pulses, the farmers' income will be increased substantially,"" he said. The government has sanctioned Rs 2.25 crore for research on developing new varieties of pulses. The OUAT has decided to increase the number of pulse seed hubs from seven to 11 districts where the varsity will provide technological inputs and support to the farmers to grow quality pulses seeds. The varsity will buy these seeds to distribute among farmers. ""We are also working on developing a high-yield variety of aromatic rice with the use of genomics,"" he said."

Amid conflicting reports of whether the warden had called up sadar hospital at 2am today for an ambulance which did not arrive, Khunti DC Manish Ranjan claimed the woman had not called up the hospital at all. Instead, she called a local auto driver who refused to go. Deceased Champa Nag of Garamara village of Khunti thana area had enrolled at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya at Kalamati panchayat 17 days ago and was healthy right till last evening, when she played and danced with other girls. Champa complained of stomach ache and then chest pain a few hours after last night's dinner of rice, lentils and potato curry. Whether the hostel warden called up an auto driver or the sadar hospital for an ambulance is not clear as the employee could not be contacted personally. But, what is clear that Champa's condition deteriorated progressively and by early morning, the warden contacted the local mukhiya who took the ailing girl in his car to the nearby health centre, where the nurse on duty advised she be immediately rushed to a hospital. The mukhiya took her to sadar hospital where she died while being treated. Her post-mortem report said she died of cardiac arrest. Khunti civil surgeon Vinod Oraon could not provide any detail of the case, including the girl's age. DC Ranjan claimed they were not at fault as the warden called up an auto, who refused to go at the late hour. However, local sources claimed the warden had called up sadar hospital for an ambulance, which didn't arrive, claiming that drivers tended to steer clear of the hour-long drive through the forested rebel hub at night. However, this claim could not be substantiated. DC Ranjan added that he had ordered a senior nurse be deployed every night at each of the six Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas with immediate effect. The nurses will be given dinner by the respective schools. ""We have only two lady doctors in our district. It is practically not possible to provide ambulances and doctors to each school. There are nearly 260 girls' hostels in my district,"" he added."

Picture by Ali Fauz Hassan Guwahati, Aug. 30: The speakers at the North East Rural Conclave, organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) in association with the North Eastern Council, today focussed on identifying opportunities in agriculture and allied sectors in the region. The seminar at NEDFi House, Dispur, was held in concert with the Centre's target to double farmers' income by the end of 2022. The conclave comprised three sessions - Opportunities and challenges in agri and allied sector in the Northeast, Upscaling the non-farm sector in rural northeastern region and Rural services for livelihood promotion and imparting skills, empowering people. The deputy general manager of Nabard, S. Samantara, said: ""We are aiming to double the income of farmers in nominal terms by 2022. Agricultural growth should be increased to more than four per cent. To achieve this, a double-edged strategy of increasing production and raising prices is being contemplated. Ninety per cent of farmers in the region are small and marginal farmers. The farmers' income comprises 45 to 50 per cent from the primary sector, 20 to 30 per cent from the allied sectors and the rest comes from other activities. Nabard envisages enabling opportunity in agri investment. The physical infrastructure and institutional infrastructure need development."" Samantara also stressed development of post-harvesting facilities and warehousing to add value to agricultural products. ""Innovation in mission-mode provided by Nabard through innovative products such as Kisan Credit Cards, is required,"" he added. North Eastern Council member C.K. Das said: ""To improve the economy of the Northeast, focus should be more on agriculture and allied sectors. In order to realise the vision of our Prime Minister to double farmers' income by 2022, specially in the Northeast, per hectare-productivity has to increase; multiple crop farming is needed and farmers needs to get involved in allied sectors. Other potential areas in the region include fishery and piggery. Farmers should consider cultivating products in high demand like lentils, coconut, black pepper, sugarcane, among others, in the Northeast. Due to small land holdings among farmers in the Northeast, formation of cooperatives is required"". ""There is an urgent need for packaging and processing of agriculture and horticulture products in the Northeast,"" project director, Assam Skill Development Mission, A.P. Tiwari, said while delivering the special address at the inaugural session of the conclave. He said products like betel nuts are being exported from Assam but there is no processing and packaging facilities. He also highlighted that banana cultivation in the Northeast needs to be popularised and should be marketed as in Bihar, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. ""The Northeast has human resources but no industry. This is leading to exodus of human resources from the region. Industrialisation of small-scale products which are unique to the Northeast should be started to cater to the local market with indigenous and locally produced goods in order to restrict import of similar items,"" Tiwari said. ""Mechanisation will increase production and lead to better quality control. In Assam, there are entrepreneurs in bell metal products, but it is still being imported from Moradabad to the Northeast. There is a scope for big industries in areas like dairy which has huge potential."""

I am under the debris and am having trouble breathing, was all Haleem could say.Saleem and his three siblings were staying in the six-storey Husseini building on Pakmodia Street near JJ Hospital. Saleem had stepped out to buy milk when the building collapsed, trapping his siblings. Fortunately, all three were among the first to be rescued within 10 minutes.The ground floor was occupied by commercial establishments like a caterer and a tailor's shop. A sweets supplier adjacent to the building, Tawakkul Sweets, employed five workers, who were sleeping when the building collapsed. Three were rescued alive, while the others died. The tailor lost his life, while his daughter is injured, said locals.The collapse, which claimed 22 lives, left many families broken. Like the Zafar family. Reshma Zafar, who lived on the third floor, was injured, while her husband and son were killed. Similarly, all members of a family on the fifth floor died with the exception of a young boy, who had gone out to buy bread.I woke up early and had started cooking when the walls started shaking. I rushed out. When I turned back, the building came crashing down in front of my eyes. My two brothers, and three other colleagues all died under the debris, a numb and grieving Mohammed Sartaj said while standing at the spot, hoping to recover his monthly salary of Rs. 14,000 from the rubble.Makeshift kitchenResidents of the lane poured out on the streets within seconds of the tragedy, rushing to help anyone they could rescue. Eateries in the area came together and cooked lentils and rice in large quantities, and a makeshift kitchen was set up across the lane from the site of the collapse by Thursday afternoon. Residents went from person to person, be it firemen, policemen, NDRF personnel or even locals pitching in with the effort, informing them that food was available whenever they needed it. Other residents contacted local social worker and political workers, and carton after carton of bottled water was rushed to the site."

Hidden outpourings of love, revelations of decade-old crushes, and spiteful messages were passed through the app.However, I remained oblivious to it all. I know that behind every Hey, youre cute, there are a hundred Babzz ur a sexxy. I recognised Sarahah for what it is - a fad. One that would create a storm for a while and then move on like a gentle cloud.But something else about fads struck me. Over the years, the lifespan of fads has gotten shorter and shorter. Our fads lasted for years. Trump cards, friendship bands, and Add Gel pens consumed a good part of a decade. For me personally, fads had their own superlative degree - fad, fadder, fathers slap.Which makes me think. Our parents probably had to endure fads for whole decades. Imagine playing marbles for 20 years of your life! No wonder my father turned into Bhasmasura every time I asked him money for marbles. It also explains why Shatrughan Sinha wore a leather jacket for 20 years. Why Jeetendra wore white shoes, inadvertently playing a tennis player in every movie.Which is not to say that Yours Truly has been immune to fads. No, sir.My entire life is a dark memory lane of fads. I wore the Salman Khan - Tere Naam hairstyle to school. The opposite gender, including our school cow, ignored my existence. I wore bell-bottomed jeans and embroidered woollen T-shirts that Sohail Khan wore in the movie I: Proud to be Indian.But the icing on the cake was when I decided to get myself coloured streaks. Three of us best friends bought ONE pack of hair colour (burgundy - because why not?), and applied it on our hair. We forgot that the three of us always hung out together, went to the same college, on the same bike. We ended up looking like the Mirinda Men on methamphetamine. Which is why I have become immune to fads.For eight years, my Facebook DP was a pair of worn out chappals. I only changed it when I realised I hadnt been getting any Tinder matches for three years straight. I didnt fall for Pokemon Go either. I had the app, and it showed a creature sitting right in my balcony. But my 2G connection didnt let my Pokemon go anywhere.Which is why I didnt participate in the brouhaha over Sararah. I lay down on my bed of arrows like Bheeshma, and watched my Kaurava friends fall for the hype one after the other. I dont need Sararah. If I need honest opinion, I merely need to ping one of my exes.

5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."

It is a duty from a Muslim brother to another to help in distress.""Bangladesh already hosted at least 300,000 Rohingya refugees in squalid camps along its border with Myanmar before this latest influx, offering sanctuary for more than three decades to civilians fleeing violence and persecution in neighbouring Rakhine State.But this fresh wave is unprecedented in its magnitude, pushing conditions at the camps to the absolute limit.Charities are warning of an unfolding humanitarian crisis as Bangladesh pushes for a diplomatic solution to close the floodgates.Prices soaringAt the congested market near Kutupalong refugee camp, where children bang on the windows of passing cars pleading for food, Bangladeshis are helping out with whatever meagre resources they have.Some of these freelance relief efforts are shambolic, with tremendous crushes and children knocked down as donated supplies are tossed from moving trucks.As the crisis enters its third week, patience is also running thin among some Bangladeshis living near the border, where many earn little.Prices for food and other staples have soared in local markets, which have become choked with chronic traffic and large numbers of beggars.Kuilla Mia, a tea seller working a street corner amid a chaotic swirl of refugees, said he had nothing to spare.""I would like to give them a discount, but I cannot because the price of sugar is high,"" he told AFP.Bangladesh -- which initially ordered border guards to turn back newcomers before the effort became futile -- has been praised for taking on the burden despite its own pressing challenges as one of the region's poorest countries.The plight of the Rohingya, who are reviled and denied citizenship in Myanmar, has particularly roused emotion across the Islamic world.On Tuesday, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina toured Kutupalong, one of the biggest camps, where she was seen consoling a young Rohingya boy.""I can't hold back the tears in eyes as I look at this scene... Why should people suffer such pain?"" she said, according to private news portal bdnews24.com.Bangladeshi authorities have said they will register all new arrivals, setting up booths in the camps to collect fingerprints and family information.Hasina wants the Rohingya returned to what she has labelled their ""ancestral homeland"" in Myanmar.""Myanmar has created the problem and it will have to resolve it,"" she told parliament on Monday.Dhaka has pointed to a deal with Yangon in 1992 that saw more than 236,000 Rohingya repatriated as ""members of Myanmar society"".Mohammad Hussain, a lentil vendor, said he was giving away what he could, but Bangladeshis alone could not be expected to care for all the refugees.""If aid doesn't arrive from abroad, then these people will be in serious danger,"" he told AFP.But for young Hassan, the experience has been moving""I feel great helping them, and I want to do more,"" he said."

Thats how at Firdaus, Taj Krishna, the ongoing Gujarati Food Festival focuses on a variety of items from the state with tastes that are slightly sweet and flavoured with coconut and sesame seeds roasted ground and added to the dishes for that exquisite taste and aroma. The star hotel has partnered with Gujarat Tourism for the food promotion.We began with Hondvo, Methi Na Muthiya and Petis Corn Tikka. We liked the muthiya as the besan batter was nicely mixed with spices like Shepherds Purse, black salt and dry fenugreek leaves. Petis Corn Tikka was crispy and at the same time filling because of potatoes. To go with the starters, were an array of pickles such as green chilies pickle, mango pickle both in sweet and sour variety. In the main course, what we liked was Sev Tamatar: a preparation of tomato curry to which crispy crunchy sev was added. It tasted really well with Bajre Ki Roti and Thepla. We also tried Gujarati Kadhi with Bardoli Ki Khichdi. Gujarati Daal was a bit sweet like other dishes. Executive chef Nitin Mathur from Ahmedabad along with few other chefs curated the menu.For the desserts we recommend Moong Daal Ka Sheera and Mohanthhal: a halwa of yellow lentils with fried nuts. Mohanthhal was a sweet besan cake. The food festival is on till September 30. For dinner and lunch. Price: For one thali `2,300++"

What followed, however, was nothing Gaurav or Era Golwalkar had ever expected. Her succinct, practical and descriptive instructions, alongside little doodles of veggies, swept the imagination of the online world so effectively that the list went viral.With the post trending at the top of Reddit India's list on Sunday, and gaining over 10 lakh retweets on Twitter and over 30,000 shares on Facebook, the young couple residing in Balewadi has been enjoying the surprising affinity pouring in for their personal ritual, not just in India, but also from abroad.""Since I have spent a lot of time in hostels, I am generally quite bad at ingredient shopping. I don't really understand the difference between various lentils or leafy vegetables, and often end up paying more than the required price,"" laughed 31-year-old Gaurav, who hails from Bhavnagar and is partner-promoter at an education technology company. While the duo was married in 2014, Era had to leave soon after for a stint in the US. ""Even when she was there for a few years, Era often ordered vegetables online for me, or even called the vegetable vendors she was familiar with in this area,"" he added.Era, on the other hand, professed that she is rather particular when it comes to grocery shopping. ""I returned from the US in January this year, but we can't always go shopping together due to time constraints, so we divided the task between the both of us every alternate week. I made lists for him right from the beginning, but I soon realised they were not quite working,"" elaborated the 29-year-old IT analyst, who hails from Indore. ""So, I decided to make them easier to understand.""Initially, Era used at least seven or eight buying parameters per vegetable, but the lists started getting much too long  the couple then decided she would just tell him the three most important parameters for each instead. And, that's how it has been going for the last five or six months.Gaurav initially decided to upload the list on LinkedIn to catch the attention of online grocery store brands  but it took off to an unexpected scale. Now, hordes of digital denizens, who don't quite have the gift of being able choose the freshest produce, have been zeroing in on this pragmatic solution. A friend of Era's in the US even sent her the list when it was forwarded to him online, asking if it was her.""The question I've been asked the most by strangers online is whether I fulfil these shopping criteria now,"" chuckled Gaurav, as Era nodded an amused affirmative. ""The best part has been the lack of negativity or trolling about the post  everyone has taken it so positively,"" Era summed up."

He was 85. The funeral will be held at his native village in Honnavar taluk on Wednesday evening.Hegde was admitted to hospital on September 29 after he complained of breathing problems. Hospital sources said the artiste was suffering from lung disorders and his condition became critical on Tuesday evening and he died at 9.30 pm. Fondly known as Chittani Ajja, Hegde hailed from Guddekeri village in Honnavar taluk of Uttara Kannada district. He is survived by four children and fans all over the world. Chittani Ramachandra Hegde was known for his negative roles in Yakshagana art form. He belonged to the Bada-Badagu school and had been performing for the last six decades. His last performance was on September 21 in Bangarmakki village of Honnavar during the Dasara festival.Chittani was awarded the Padma Shri in 2012 and he was the only Yakshagana artiste to be honoured with the award. He toured throughout the world performing prasangas and popularising the art form. He was known for his acting through his expressions, but had to face the wrath of critics for bringing changes in the traditional art form. But for Chittanni, there was no stopping. Though he belonged the art form of Uttara Kannada, he was loved by Yakshagana fans of Badagu and Tenku styles.With his performances, he drew a fan following which included Kannada stars like Dr Raj Kumar, Uday Kumar and Sreenath. Uday Kumar, who was known for his negative roles, would attend all-night Yakshagana performances at the Town Hall in Bengaluru to study Chittanis expressions. Some of the expressions enacted by Yakshagana artists are known after Chittani.He is popularly known as Chittani Ajja for many in Karnataka. Chittani was a legendary Yakshagana artist and his expressions in the act of Nava Rasa are very popular, said Prof G L Hegde, who has written Nimma Chittani, a biography of Chittani Hegde. Yakshagana was in Chittanis blood and he breathed the art form. He entered the Yakshagana scene after dropping out from school at the age of 10. Till his death, he was active and ready to perform any character in Yakshagana art form. He gained popularity for negative roles liek Keechaka, Bhasmasura, Dushtabuddi and Kaurava to name a few, he added.During his school days, he was discouraged from practising Yakshagana by his family, but support came from a relative. After leaving school at Class 4, he used to go Yakshagana rehearsals without the knowledge of his family members, G L Hegde recalled. He was a simple man, but when it came to performances, no one could compete with his Chittani.

Jamdar said notwithstanding how beautiful the States roadmap for tribal development is, the fact is that children were still dying of hunger and malnutrition. The observations came after the court was informed that 180 children had died of malnutrition and related illnesses in tribal areas in the last two months.The Bench said, Stop boasting. Have you been able to prevent a single death? If you indeed follow the welfare state model, then you should be able to say that there are no deaths [due to malnutrition]. It also sought to know if the government was aware of food and nutrition supplements being provided to tribal children and to those at anganwadis. The children in anganwadis are being given masoor dal. Is that enough for their nutrition? You receive funds. Where does that money go? Should the public begin to keep track of such funds?.The court was hearing PILs on the rise in malnutrition deaths and illnesses among those living in Vidarbhas Melghat region, and other tribal areas. The HC has passed several orders over the last two years, directing the government to ensure tribals get adequate nutrition, healthcare, sanitation, and education facilities.Chief Justice Chellur noted that the State government had done little to implement the orders. The court has now scheduled weekly hearings of all matters pertaining to tribal welfare."

JOTHI RAMALINGAMTwo years on from October 2015, when toor dal was selling at Rs. 200 a kg, the Union government is now struggling to dispose of its buffer stock of 18 lakh tonnes.The Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ministry has charted out three ways to reduce seven lakh tonnes first and 10 lakh tonnes ahead of December, when the new crop hits the market. The lentil is now selling at Rs. 50 a kg.Twin aimsFor the first time, the government last year decided to create a buffer stock of pulses to ensure better prices for farmers and use the stock to augment local supply when prices rise.We still have a buffer stock of 18 lakh tonnes in our godowns. We have decided to dispose of some quantity to the States and also use in welfare schemes, Union Minister for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public distribution Ram Vilas Paswan said. Out of this buffer, nearly four lakh tonnes is one year old and needs to be taken out of the godowns immediately.The Group of Secretaries on Wednesday decided that 3.5 lakh tonnes would be diverted to Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and another State at subsidised rates. They will get the lentil at a subsidy of Rs. 18 to Rs. 15 a kg. They will be distributing it through the public distribution system.Another 1.5 lakh tonne will be reserved for welfare schemes such as the mid-day meal scheme. It will also be sent out to Defence messes and jails."

The condition of 40 farmers from Akola, Nagpur and Buldhana districts is critical.In the past two months, 19 people have died of pesticide poisoning in Yavatmal. Twenty-five farmers admitted to the Government Medical College in Yavatmal have lost vision, while 800 have been hospitalised with complaints of dizziness, diarrhoea, vomiting, stomachache, among others. Most of them are farm labourers, who take up the hazardous job of spraying pesticides to earn extra money.Pesticide poisoning deaths have also been reported in districts of Akola, Amravati, Buldana, Nagpur and Bhandara.Locals, farmer leaders as well as the opposition blamed the Maharashtra government for failing to act in time.Devanand Pawar, a farmer leader from Yavatmal, told HT, Two farmers are in the intensive care unit (ICU) in critical condition.Kishore Tiwari, from the Maharashtra government-run Vasantrao Naik Sheti Swavlamban Mission (VNSSM), said, Many patients are in critical condition in the Nagpur Medical College and Akola Medical College. The death toll in these districts could rise.Yavatmal district is part of the drought-prone Vidharbha region that registers the highest number of farmer suicides.Dhananjay Munde, leader of Opposition in the Legislative Council, visited Yavatmal on Sunday. Despite hailing from Vidarbha, chief minister Devendra Fadnavis neither visited Yavatmal, nor did he offer condolences to the family of the farmers. Is he so busy, Munde asked.The Maharashtra government recently ordered the additional chief secretary (home) to carry out a probe into the incident and submit a report within 15 days, in addition to another probe into the quality of the pesticides. The companies that marketed the unauthorised pesticides will be booked, Pandurang Fundkar, state agriculture minister, told HT.Fundkar last week admitted the district administration had failed to inform the state government about the cases in Yavatmal. Navnath Kolapkar, superintending agriculture officer, Yavatmal, said the pesticides were regular compounds and not a new brand.Farmers in Yavatmal, 670km from Mumbai, primarily grow cotton and lentils and use a highly potent mix of pesticide to save the crop from pests. These pesticides are both in liquid and powder form. The farmers dont use gloves or goggles to protect themselves while spraying pesticides, said Narendra Fulzele, residential deputy collector, Yavatmal.According to Fulzele, last year too there were six deaths owing to pesticide poisoning.The extreme heat in the area could have made the pesticide more lethal this year. When the pesticide is sprayed, it comes in contact with skin. It enters the body, as it mixes with sweat, Kolapkar said."

The eight-month pregnant first-time would-be mother has been waiting for her husband Vinod to respond to treatment for the last one month.Vinod, a farm labourer, developed respiratory problems on September 17 after he returned from the farm of district BJP leader Raju Dange where he had sprayed pesticide. Admitted to hospital, he has been on life support since.Bandu Sonule (48) of Monali village was not as lucky. He died two days after being admitted on September 19, leaving his wife Geeta, two children and mother distraught. He too had sprayed pesticide at the farm of Shankarrao Chowdhury.Around 50 farmers or farm labourers  22 in Yavatmal  have died and nearly 800 have been hospitalised due to an infection, caused by spraying of a pesticide on cotton crops in Vidarbha region, known for farmer suicides. At least 20 have lost vision too.While chief minister Devendra Fadnavis-led Maharashtra government has ordered probe by special investigation team and announced compensation of Rs 2 lakh to the kin of the dead, district collector Rajesh Deshmukh directed free treatment to the affected.The District Agriculture Development Officer (DOA) Dattatreya Kalsai was suspended on Wednesday for alleged negligence.The district authorities booked the local agro-input centre, Jalaram Krushi Kendra, for violation of the Insecticides Act 1969.However, the owner of the agro-input centre, Shantilal Raja claims he is clueless about the cause of the deaths as he has been selling pesticides to all farmers in the area, and no one was affected.Farmers in Yavatmal, who mainly grow cotton, soybean and lentils, say they use a highly potent mix of pesticides, both in powder and liquid form.They also cultivate a genetically modified variety of cotton, which is supposed to be resistant to bollworms, a pest that attacks cotton crops. But that has not happened this year, farmers say, which led them to increase their use of pesticides.Chairman of the state-run agriculture mission, Kishore Tiwari highlighted the unregulated sale and use of pesticides/insecticides, failure of Bt cotton in reducing dependence on chemicals, collapse of public health department, lack of alertness on part of agriculture department and wrong agriculture policies implemented in the country in the last 30 years as causes of poisoning.Vinod Kamble, a landless farm labourer, has been on life support since September 21 at Yavatmal medical college and hospital. (Sanjib Ganguly/HT)Dr Vilas Bhale, vice chancellor of Panjabrao Agriculture University, noted that farmers were not following precautions while spraying pesticides like wearing gloves, goggles and special clothes.He said his university has engaged its teachers and post-graduate students for a public awareness campaign in the region in this regard.For doctors in the area, the task is an everyday battle as they cant wash the stomach to remove traces of ingested poison. Inhaling pesticides also affects the respiratory system.For Geeta, the issue raises several questions. For how long will the compensation last? Will it bring back the light of our lives? Will lives continue to be lost? Will farmers meet the same end? she asks.Sangeeta Fulmali (45), who lost her husband Gajanan (52), to pesticide poisoning on October 1, life has to move on. Yes. I am afraid of working on the farm. There are risks, but what else can I do to feed my children?"

5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

A new machine has helped us to pinpoint diesel as the chief source of lead and there is no ambiguity in the findings, Dipayan Guha, director of geochronology and isotope geology division of GSI told HT.The outcome of the study, conducted by project director Dipayan Guha and a team of six scientists, was published in Environmental Science and Technology and Environmental Science and Pollution Research. The studies began in 2014 and continued till March 2016.Read: How indoor air pollution is leading to stunted growth in Indias childrenIn rice the presence of lead was a minimum of seven times (of the limits for adults) to a maximum of 30 times. It implied a level that is 36 times to 149 times of the safe limits for children. The presence of the element in chicken is as high as 38 times the permissible limit for adults and 191 times of that for kids.Samples of rice were found to contain lead that was 58 times more than the permissible limit for adults and 287 times of the ceiling for children. (HT Photo)The maximum Pb concentration in rice was 14.39 mg/kg in the Khidirpur sample from west Kolkata. Vegetables sold in the sampled markets had a Pb concentration ranged from a low of 3.28 mg/kg to a very high value of 145.47 mg/kg, read a GSI statement.The GSI team collected samples of polished rice, red lentil (masoor dal), chicken, fish (without scales), spinach, biscuits, spices (cumin seeds) and tulsi from 12 roadside markets from north, south, east and west of Kolkata.Even if one washes the items in water, one can get rid of 50% of the lead, said Guha.Read: Killer in the air: WHO says polluted environments kill 1.7 mn children a yearThe maximum concentration of lead was found in the soil at and near Dhapa, the citys principal dumping ground.The GSI team also found the lead content in the street dust alarming. The mean concentration of Pb found in the 29 sites was 383.2 mg/kg with a range from 23.82 mg/kg to a very high value of 2,697.24 mg/kg at Amherst Street in north Kolkata, a GSI release said.The GSI spokesperson told HT that they chose samples from the roadside markets since common people buy from these.Since much of the contamination is caused by exposure to air, one can expect that packaged items sold in closed conditions will have less lead, said the spokesperson.Kalyan Rudra, chairman of the state Pollution Control Board, told HT there was no immediate relief in sight. CNG is not available in Kolkata and is only expected to reach here in 2020. Even after it reached the city, it will take a lot of time for the commercial vehicles to switch from diesel to CNG. The autorickshaws, however, have already to LPG, said Rudra."

This was mentioned in the State Vulnerability Index, issued by the Maharashtra government based on the variabilities in temperature, rainfall and humidity levels projected for 2030, 2050 and 2070, as studied by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI).As part of improving its efforts under the existing Climate Change Adaptation Policy of 2010, the government is furthering its scope in works undertaken in improving the overall forest cover, identifying water scarce areas and initiating water conservation measures along with studying the feasibility of switching to alternate energy sources like solar and wind power.It is a well established fact that climate is changing, with 2015 and 2016 seeing some of the record-breaking heat recorded at several places in India and elsewhere.According to scientists at city-based Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), the rainfall variation over Marathwada has been observed on a yearly basis and no major decline observed in the overall rainfall has been observed for a period of nearly 150 years.Marathwada typically receives anywhere between 600mm and 650mm rainfall annually. Though there are annual and inter-seasonal variations in the rainfall observed, the overall rainfall has not shown any decline in the last 150 years, said Ashwini Kulkarni, senior scientist at the Centre for Climate Change Research at IITMHowever, Kulkarni highlighted the warming trend observed over minimum temperatures over Maharashtra. She said, While the maximum temperatures are rising, what we have also found is that the nights, too, are rapidly warming.Some of the other districts, which will have poor resilience to climate change as mentioned in this index, include Dhule, Buldhana, Jalgaon, Hingoli, Nashik, Jalana, Gondiya, Washim and Gadchiroli.The TERI report has projected rising humidity levels during 2030s, 2050s and 2070s, posing adverse effects on agriculture. Some of the crops most likely to be inflicted by pests include pomegranate, grapes, orange, banana and mango.According to R Balasubramanyam, senior scientist at Agrimet division of India Meteorology Department (IMD), Pune, there are various mitigation plans that can be undertaken to minimise the crop damage.With the rising temperature and humidity, the chances of standing crops falling prey to pest and other diseases are higher. The rising threat is hailstorm and the union government has directed the formation of a mitigation plan in this regard, he said.Cotton, lentils, grapes, groundnut during both kharif and rabi seasons are some of the most cultivated crops in Nandurbar, Dhule, Jalgaon and Nashik districts.The renewed plan is hopeful of improving peoples participation, especially in forest conservation under the special sensitisation programme titled My forest, my water.One of the proposed ideas is to plant more trees at the source of all rivers, thereby helping in their replenishment.Yet another suggestions is to build bunds at fixed distances from river banks, similar to the ones built in Kolhapur district.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5a525a6c9855b770e0376077,Formula to determine import duty on agricultural products soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/formula-to-determine-import-duty-on-agricultural-products-soon/articleshow/61428812.cms,2017-11-02,"NEW DELHI: The government will soon come out with a formula to increase or decrease import duty on agriculture commodities and to allow export or restrict it by fixing a benchmark price.If wholesale market price goes below that, import will be restricted by hiking the duty and export will be allowed. Similarly, if the wholesale price goes above the benchmark price then export will be restricted and more import will be allowed by lowering duty, along with fixing stock limits for traders to check hoarding.The decision for finalising the formula was taken at a meeting of an informal group of ministers headed by Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday, which was attended by agriculture minister Radhamohan Singh , consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan and top officials from Prime Minister's Office and finance ministry. The departments concerned will prepare the formula, said officials who attended the meeting.An official said the group agreed that the benchmark price would be 20% more or lower than minimum support price ( MSP ) for any agricultural commodity. Any breach of this by wholesale price will call for intervention by the government in terms of import or export restriction.MSP, which is assured by government to farmers, is fixed every year for 24 commodities and main items are rice, wheat, pulses and oilseeds. Data presented before the panel on oil seed prices showed how the prevailing market prices of ground nut, soyabean, sunflower and mustard have been below MSP. But, there has been substantial increase in import of crude palm (15%), refined palm (23%) and crude sunflower (58%) in January-July, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Similarly, import of soyabean seed has increased by 64% in the same period.""In such case, import duty should be increased to protect domestic farmers. It's no different in case of arhar and masur dal where market prices have crashed below MSP and import of peas, chana and masur have gone up,"" said an official. Sources said representatives of PMO suggested to officials of other ministries that they need to balance the interest of consumers and farmers as well, while making policies."

MMTC has been asked to float tenders. Sources said government agencies have stock of more than 1.5 lakh tonnes of moong dal and these need to be sold off quickly since the shelf life is less in comparison to arhar.""The agency will find if moong can be exported to countries, which have more NRIs.Hardly people from any other origin consume moong dal. Only Nafed has already procured fresh tranche of 40,000 moong dal. We are also taking a number of steps to dispose off arhar, which is in huge quantity,"" said an official.The government has identified government agencies including IRCTC, defence forces, central paramilitary forces and Safal to together lift about one lakh tonnes in a year. Moreover, plans for disposal of another 10 lakh tonnes through government agencies, open market sale and providing the lentils at subsidised rates to states have been planned. The government has also allowed export of arhar and urad.The issue of crashing pulses prices due to bumper supply and also import of cheap yellow peas (matar dal) came up before a group of ministers, which met on Wednesday evening. ""There was almost an unanimity among all those present in the meeting that import duty on yellow peas should be increased substantially. A decision is likely soon,"" said an official.The group also suggested agencies allow export of masur and other pulses so that farmers get a good price."

This will leverage investment worth $5 billion, benefit two million farmers and create more than half a million jobs.""Rather than being a mere food festival, World Food India is a business event where equipment manufacturers, packaged food experts and suppliers, organic food exponents, beverage majors and boutique sauce and syrup makers will exchange ideas and views. The exhibition zones have stalls of FMCG majors and family-run enterprises from various countries. Almost every Indian state has a kiosk lined with its prominent food products.The participants will naturally take the event as an opportunity to showcase their commitment to organic and natural produce. ""From frozen products to concepts like farm to plate and our vegetarian initiative, Sattva, we will exhibit our food processing and preparation prowess to the visitors,"" said Chef Manisha Bhasin of ITC Maurya , emphasising that an exhibition of this magnitude was precisely the sort of platform they were seeking to demonstrate the ideas they had been working on for years to a global audience Rachel Berliner, co-founder of Amy's Kitchen, the American family-owned organic food brand, was upbeat about the prospects.""World Food India will help us connect with retailers, farmers, government and consumers, all in one place.

All great national enterprisesfrom the Roman Empire, Austro-Hungarian Empire, Napoleons France and the Britishreared client states to maintain the geopolitical balance and tilt it when the occasion arose. Pakistan is Chinas vassal state now, just as it was of the US in the 1970s-80s during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan. China has once again blocked a joint effort by the US, France and the UK to list Pakistan-resident Jaish-e-Mohammed chief and Pathankot terror attack plotter-in-chief Masood Azhar as a global terrorist by the UN.The diplomatic travesty underlined Chinas support of Islamic terrorism and its most defined face, Pakistan. The Islamic Republics ultimate aim is to impose Sharia all over the world. Fat chance, but right now, it seems to be a step ahead frustrating Western powers, which are sick of its unabashed support of IS, al-Qaeda and jihad. Since everythings the economy, stupid, China may be only protecting its investments in Pak. In the process it is protecting radical Islams biggest investmentPakistan.Strategically important small nations become subservient to their imperial masters. Some, however, become a successful parasite like Pakistan. Lacking a developed economy, governed by feudal warlords and political satraps, it trudged along until the Noughties, suckled by Americas munificence. Meanwhile, Afghanistan, infected by the Pak-supported Taliban became Pakistans vassal. Islam was the sustaining link between both the rogue nations. It is an implacable historical force, which has used violence and fear to spread its ascendency. Its aim is to annihilate Western and Asian civilisation and emerge from the ashes to impose its puritan rule. Too late have the naive Western countries realised that faith wages war by deception. The US, which supported the Arab Spring in idealistic foolishness, saw the IS destroy Iraq, Libya and Syria and unleash terror across the US and Europe.Cold War opponents, America and the USSR, fought a proxy war in Af-Pakboth lost. The Chinese urgently need to read up a bit on the Mujahideen, who defeated the Soviets with the help of the US-supplied Stinger missiles and CIA training. Ironically, Osama bin Laden, too, had received the same training. Two decades on, the US was rewarded with 9/11. By identifying itself with Pakistan, China has laid the ground for its own 9/11.China has its own separatist Islamic rebellion in Xinjiang province, clandestinely supported by Pakistan. Battle-hardened Chechen, Arab, Afghan and African jihadis are operating in the region. Chinese jihadis are fighting in Syria with IS, and could cause the same crisis terrorists from Europe do in their home countries. Chinese police recently ordered Muslims to turn over all copies of the Koran and prayer mats or face harsh punishment. It believes violent Islam can be defeated with state force, like Russia did in Chechnya. In its foreign policy, it perceives Islam as the lesser evil, like Rambo did in Afghanistan. The only gainer in the endgame will be Pakistan. Chinese mythology is one of the richest in the world.

5a1518099855b76bf13eaeb2,Branding the humble Khichdi cooks up mishmash of a debate,http://www.newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/2017/nov/05/branding-the-humble-khichdi-cooks-up-mishmash-of-a-debate-1692210.html,2017-11-05,"New Delhi: Its not often that a common mans food becomes fodder for debate on social media and the Internet. But thats exactly what the humble khichdi has done these past few days.A day after union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal christened khichdi as the Brand India Food on November 1, it began topping Twitter trends and became a much-searched word on the Internet, according to Google Trends. Heated debates started on the elevated status summarily thrust on the dish as well as the point of doing so.But as this khichdi was cooking, The Sunday Standard was left wondering whether an over-ambitious attempt had been made to define India, a land of over 1.3 billion people with widely varying taste buds, by a single dish.Harsimrats announcement set off a flurry of heated debates, unending speculation and conflicting opinions over the culinary identity of India and the unilateral attempt to define its food by one dish. Regardless, khichdi basked in new-found glory as the Prime Minister inaugurated World Food India on November 3, a three-day event aimed at attracting $10 billion in investment.Alongside, naysayers had a field day lambasting the minister for her announcement while supporters acknowledged the importance of making the dish a brand ambassador. In the last few days, khichdi has possibly been spoken of more than it has been eaten.While I enjoy khichdi, to make it a Brand India dish is an overestimation. It is a certainly a comfort food, but not Indias favourite comfort food. Such generalizations are inaccurate and take away from our pluralistic essence, said Gaurav Pathan, a rice mill worker whose factory is on the outskirts of Delhi, near Sonipat.Social media, meanwhile, went on overdrive. Khichdi to be national dish. Why? Is the nation ill? said one. Do I have to stand up when I eat khichdi now that it is a national dish? was another. Why khichdi? I would want aloo methi to finally get its due, said yet another.But between wit and humour lies a deeper narrative of how fundamentally undemocratic such decisions are. Raju Mohapatra, a diamond sorter in Karol Bagh, said, I dont understand how one person in power suddenly gets up and starts deciding things on behalf of the country. Was there a poll, a study done to conclude that khichdi is the most-liked comfort food?Piyush Jain, chef at Molecule restaurant, said that if khichdi was popular, so were biryani, pulao, chicken curry and dal tadka. So, to say that khichdi is the only dish that can represent Indias food tradition is incorrect, he said.Two days after elevating the khichdi from a sick mans food to a national delicacy, Harsimrat said her intention was to replace the curry with khichdi as the quintessential Indian dish.But isnt replacing one dish by another fatuous? In a few years, khichdi will become the new curry. Will we once again think of something new? asked Santosh Kumar, a sales representative with an electronics company.He is exasperated at the remark that khichdi is a neutraliser. I lived in Telangana for 13 years where I was working at a light manufacturing company. There, I was introduced to the regions famous kheema khichdi. Its a rich rice dish made with basmati rice, lentils, meat and chicken stock. Are these ingredients affordable to the poor?It is important to understand that the dish doesnt remain in its humble form in every region, and therefore, cannot be the staple. Besides, has everyone forgotten that dal, a main component of khichdi, is often out of the reach of the poor? asked Kumar.Master chef Sanjeev Kapoor, who has been curating Food Street, an experience zone within World Food India 2017, begged to differ. Khichdi has been celebrated and relished for years in India. From khichuri in West Bengal to Ven Pongal in Kerala, khichdi has united India in geographical expanse with its flavour and recipes through dynasties.It is definitely one of the most loved dishes in India and the world record only aims at making it popular on an international level. Therefore, its declaration as the Brand India food is fair, he said.Indias distinctness has always been its diversity. Flavours from the North, South, East and West have all contributed to create its globally loved cuisine. So, was it inappropriate to grant a single dish such exalted status?"

Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor.On Saturday, when chef Sanjeev Kapoor answered Union Food Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badals call to position the khichdi as gourmet fare, he was performing a feat that many khansamas in Mughal kitchens were required to accomplish for their livelihoods. The 17th-century text, Khulasat-i-Makulat u Mashrubat notes how the one-pot rice and lentil dish had to be adapted for fine dining. Fry garlic, onion rings, cinnamon and cumin. Remove the mixture from the fire and set it aside. Fry mung dal in ghee. Add rice and mix well. Add the spice mixture along with ginger and hot water. Finally add ghee and slow cook to finish, describes a recipe in the cookbook written during Aurangzebs time. The sixth Mughal Emperor was so fond of the dish that he gave it his name  Alamgiri khichdi.There is food that marks opulence and indulgence and there are dishes that denote simplicity. Despite its association with royalty, the khichdi remained a quintessentially unostentatious fare. In the 16th and 17th century, writes food historian Lizzie Collingham, the staple food of the rural peasants and also of the urban artisans and labourers was khichdi. Every region had a variation on the recipe, according to which grain they grew. Thus millet sometimes replaced the rice or chickpeas were used instead of lentils.Historically, in much of the world, kingly kitchens set the standards of high-class cooking. The khichdi too wasnt impervious to social differentiation. But despite the embellishments by the royal chefs, it was its simplicity that made the khichdi the favourite of Mughal emperors. Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor. Akbar  unlike Aurangzeb in almost every other manner  was an even more frugal eater than his great-grandson. Abul Fazl, his minister and biographer, notes that the emperor would fast on certain days, avoid eating flesh and usually eat khichdi.For Akbars son, Jahangir, the dish was almost therapeutic in his long-battles against alcoholism. It is not devoid of flavour and it suited me well. I ordered that on days of abstinence when I partake of dishes not made of flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichdi, the fourth Mughal emperor wrote in his memoir, The Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri.The food historian Colleen Taylor Sen writes that Jahangir had acquired the love for the dish during his campaigns in Gujarat. A food that is particular to the people of Gujarat is the bajra khichdi, a mixture of split peas and millet boiled together, Jahangir writes in The Tuzuk. His chefs though had to devise a more spectacular version, lazeezan  lamb, nuts and saffron were combined with rice and moong dal  when the emperor was in a mood to indulge.In modern times, Michelin-starred chefs have tried to tread the path of their predecessors in kitchens of Mughal emperors. There is a Black Olive Khichdi served with Rosemary Chilli Tikka and Chilli Pipette. There is a broccoli khichdi and a lobster khichdi. And there is a version that has almost 50 ingredients. But some dishes seem at odds with restaurants. They evoke the warmth of homes, aromas of kitchens and the fraternity of shared meals. The decorum of fine dining might not have any place for the unhinged licking of fingers after a meal of khichdi and brinjal fritters  or fried fish.It remains to be seen if the food ministrys enterprise turns the one-pot rice and lentil dish into the countrys culinary brand. But the dish may still hold its own in restaurants. After all, people eat less regularly at homes today. However, there is very little chance that the modern-day eater seeking comfort food will enjoy her rice and lentil meal like the 17th-century soldiers who the French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier found making khichdi more luxurious by dipping their fingers in bowls of melted ghee as they ate.kaushik.dasgupta@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Despite repeated pleas of the farmers, the traders didnt listen to them. The farmers finally approached the district administration, which ordered the mandi secretary to conduct an investigation into the matter.Farmer Rajaram Parihar from Sagars Achalpur village said he and his elder brother Rajkumar had gone to Rehli Krishi Upaj Mandi for selling their Kharif crop.After negotiations over purchase rate we agreed to sell our crop to two traders. We sold Soybean and masoor dal to the traders. Citing financial constraint they told us that the payment of Rs 2 lakh would be made on October 25. When Rajkumar met these two traders on October 25, they gave us kachha bill (informal receipt ) and cash amounting to Rs 1,98,000 and verbally told that 1% had been deducted against GST, he said.Parihar said, We argued and protested with these traders but they did not listen to us and told that this rule started with GST. We even complained to krishi mandi officials but even they did not listen. Later as the last resort we complained to Rehli SDM.When contacted, MLK Khare, Rehli SDM told HT that a complaint was received from farmers side over charging of 1 % GST by grain traders.It is illegal and I have ordered Rehli mandi secretary to inquire the matter and submit a report at the earliest. Strict action will be taken against the guilty. Farmers need to be vigilant and report such issues to us, he said.Rehli Mandi Secretary Dinesh Khare told HT that a show cause notice had been issued to the traders."

Not just as a dancer, scholar and teacher, but also as a leader, an activist and a citizen. She is ubiquitous in a number of ways and her transparent personality has always permeated her choreographies. Most of us find it difficult to master one art-form and hold it in place, and here is Mansingh who breezes through the lasya and bhava of Bharatanatyam and Odissi, among the other Indian classical dance and music forms. Years ago, eminent Bharatanatyam dancer Navtej Johar spoke of Mansingh, She is an observer. She sees. She is in touch with reality, and the pulse of what she feels is rendered through her work.As often as the phrase art for a social cause is misused, the gap between real and the artistic representation of the real is rather deep. Perhaps, in a highly digitalised world, bhavas and gestures dont speak as much. And moreover, one ponders if one is an artiste first and then a citizen or vice versa? Or do they both go hand in hand? But, as a country that dances its philosophy, as Mansingh would put it, we still have hope. The rasa exists in the mind of the audience, but it emanates from you, the dancer. The dancer leaves something that the audience takes home.It is important to connect to the society. You cannot keep away for long. The artiste has to be true to the art. I had the wisdom at a young age to figure how far to go or not go. It is not a sacrifice I made, but knowing what appeals to me and is right for me and sticking to it. I am not rigid, I think I am mature. I have a self-drawn Lakshman rekha which I do not cross. That has been my middle ground. I have carved out my space which I do not let anyone to impinge on, even if it is simply watching the clouds or sitting idle. I am not answerable to anyone, a candid Mansingh observes.As part of the annual choreographies presented by her institute, Centre for Indian Classical dancers, Mansingh along with nine of her dancers will present Divyalok  Abode of Divinity, a production dedicated to the ongoing Swachh Bharat Mission. As the title goes, Divyalok... will present three episodes from the Puranas  Devi begins her Creation, Asura and the Enchantress and Kaliya Mardan.An eminent Sanskrit scholar, who was one of the first artistes to include texts in languages other than Telugu or Tamil in her dance, Mansingh constantly goes back to the Puranas for inspiration. The root of the word div in Sanskrit means light or prakash. How do we achieve that in our own mundane life? Art works with symbolism. We are trying to work with the symbolism of swachhta. Does it only mean cleanliness of the environment? To me, it is also the cleanliness of thoughts, speech, heart and, therefore the interaction with others. If we bring all of this together, we see some amount of beauty and light everywhere. That, to me, is the alok or prakash, says Mansingh.Extremely relevantDrawing from the Puranas, 'Devi' is a concept. Different people conceive it differently. It may be something we see or not see in reality, but it is the Shakti that rules the universe. When the darkness becomes overpowering, we take charge and clean it, Mansingh says. The story will follow that of Bhasmasura's, who turned into ash all that he touched. The third episode is of Kaliya Mardana, one that is extremely relevant today and symbolic of the current ordeals of the river Yamuna. Kaliya poisoned the river and Krishna had to save it. My question is, who is Krishna today? The polluted river is also symbolic of the polluted mind, speech and thought, Mansingh adds.The music, which was conceived by Mansingh herself, has been composed by Shubhendra Rao, Saskia Rao and Ariane Gray Hubert. (Divyalok... will be staged on November 7, Stein Auditorium, India Habitat Centre, 7 p.m.)"
5a155a079855b76bf13ed83b,Should you follow the Hadza diet?,http://www.hindustantimes.com/fitness/should-you-follow-the-hadza-diet/story-8FVWPvL55HOWGAevHv6McM.html,2017-11-08,"A recent study conducted by Stanford University found out that the gut bacteria of the people from Hadza tribe in Tanzania were healthier compared to their non-tribal counterparts.The research compared the microbiomes in individuals from the western countries with those of the tribe. It was found that those belonging to the tribe have remarkably healthy microbiomes, which means they have remarkably healthy guts, explains Dr Keyur Sheth, consultant gastroenterologist, K J Somaiya Hospital Superspeciality Centre, Sion (E).The new study reinforces the results of an older study conducted on the same topic. A study by Stephanie et al in 2014 proved that the faecal matter of the people from Hazda tribe lacked bifidobacterial and comprised of various other bacteria, which makes their gut stronger, says Dr Pooja Thacker, nutritionist, Bhatia Hospital, Grant Road (W).Ultimately the stronger the gut, the better is the immunity. Also, their immunity gets developed over a period of time because of which they are able to digest such high fibre, adds Thacker.A man of Hadza tribe shares honeycomb with other people in the bush near Lake Eyasi, Tanzania. (Istock)The Tanzanian Hadza tribe is one of wandering foragers and their diet typically follows the cycle of nature and the resources available in the geographical boundaries of where they live. They eat only the food that they find in the forest, such as berries and fruits.NOT WELL-SUITED FOR INDIANSIndians normally dont eat such high fibre food. Our regular diet  even by increasing fruits, vegetables, husk, complex cereals, lentil and pulses  does not have the bandwidth to digest fibre intake beyond a point. The capacity to handle sudden change in diet varies from person to person based on their past dietary habits. But generally, it is hard for the gut to digest a new food item. So, such high fibre diet is practically very difficult to digest and get used to, particularly for us, says Thacker.Sheth too agrees, and says, From an Indian perspective, it must be mentioned that we have not yet reached the level of eating processed food as the western countries. India has a rich tradition of eating healthy natural diet as per each state and its weather. One must keep in mind that diets of tribals must not be emulated blindly as they also have a different lifestyle as compared to that of developed communities. Part of their ability to digest high fibre, for instance, could also be due to the active lifestyle they pursue.The take away is that one should focus on eating natural foods that are free of chemicals and as per the climate and within the geographical limits of the place. That is the simplest and appropriate dietary method to be followed for a healthy person.Zoya Fakhi, nutritionist, Bhatia Hospital, Grant Road (W) lists how one can pick the positives of Hadza diet to tailor-make a food chart that is better adaptable to Indian bodies:1. Include high fibre foods such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, pulses and legumes.2. Avoid processed and packaged foods.3.Try including organically produced foods.4. Modify the recipes as per the ingredients and availability.5. Try to include the foods as per availability during the season. For example, meat and tubers in dry season; berries and honey in wet season.Some negative effects of Hadza diet:1. Since there is less water and high fibre in it, people following this diet can face problems of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, bloating, abdominal cramps and pains.2. There are chances of hypoglycaemia, since this diet has less of simple carbs.3. It eliminates the legumes, lentils, whole grains, good fats, essential salt and other vital essential nutrients, which are very important for a healthy lifestyle.With inputs from Sheela Tanna, dietitian and fitness consultant, KLS Memorial hospital, Vile Parle (W), Pallavi Srivastava, fitness nutritionist, Q-Slim Fitness Studio, Andheri (W), Kejal Sheth, nutritionist, Nutrivity.in and Kanchan Patwardhan, clinical nutritionist, Arogya Hospital, Thane.Follow @htlifeandstyle for moreThe author tweets @iamsusanjose"

(File photo) Thomson Reuters 2017As farmers in India struggle with dwindling incomes and soaring costs, with huge debts triggering a wave of suicides, experts said one solution may be to only work part-time on the land.About 60 percent of people in India make their living from the land, but earnings from agriculture have plunged to one-third of a farm family's income from two-thirds in the 1980s.""There is a strong case for part-time farming: when opportunities arise elsewhere, they must go there. And when there are new opportunities on the farm, they can return there,"" said Michael Lipton, a development economist.""That is what makes most sense, rather than have the farmer tied to his land all the time,"" the professor from Britain's University of Sussex told the Thomson Reuters Foundation on a visit to Hyderabad.Over the past decade, tens of thousands of farmers have killed themselves across India, with debt or bankruptcy cited as the main reason.Problems usually stem from failed monsoon rains or low prices due to a supply glut in produce like lentils and cereals.Deadly protests by farmers in states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, this year have led to assurances of debt write-offs of some defaulting farmers Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farmers' incomes over the next five years amid growing discontent.Employment in agriculture shrank by 26 million jobs between 2011 and 2015, according to McKinsey Global Institute, the research arm of the consulting firm.Seven out of 10 rural households in India are landless or own plots of less than 1 hectare or 2.5 acres.Although landless farmers do not qualify for government loans or insurance to protect against crop losses, they earned more than land-owning farmers when there are other job opportunities, HSBC India said in a report earlier this year.Common alternative sources of income are the government's rural jobs scheme, which is often road-building work, and earning daily wages in cities, such as on construction sites.""After a good monsoon, there is increased demand for labour. As a result, real wages rise; this has largely benefited the landless class, given that a majority of their income comes from wages,"" HSBC India's chief economist Pranjul Bhandari said. ""On the other hand, the landed, who pay these wages and are more directly dependent on income from cultivation, have taken the brunt of falling food prices.""(Reporting by Rina Chandran, Editing by Katy Migiro)"

(PTI Photo) Traffic policemen wear masks to protect themselves from heavy smog and air pollution while manning the traffic, in New Delhi on Wednesday. (PTI Photo)Nasas satellite pictures of north India wreathed in smog make it abundantly clear that its a regional disaster. The hot zone stretches from the Indus in Pakistan to Patna, and Geo TV reported that the GT Road from Lahore to Rawalpindi was closed. If you drove up the GT Road into Punjab on the Indian side of the border, you would see exactly the sights that the capital is famed for in this season  murky air, spooky landscapes and the sun no brighter than a five rupee coin in a leaden sky. Punjabs schools have also closed down. And yet the non-stop TV coverage we saw in the early days suggested that this is Delhis problem, and only chief minister Arvind Kejriwal could solve it, if only Captain Amarinder Singh, his counterpart in Punjab, would let him.The story of subcontinental smog has even reached USA Today, which is generally not captivated by distant events, and Karachis Express Tribune reports that Islamabad will borrow the electricity generation model which Beijing uses to reduce smog. Since smog does not respect borders any more than nuclear holocaust does, it might consider reaching out to its neighbour, as well. As a Dawn editorial suggested, the erratically eternal India-Pakistan talks need one more issue on the table  smog diplomacy. A look at the satellite images would also convince you that smog covers lots of areas with almost no vehicular traffic, suggesting that traffic controls like the odd-even scheme would only remove incremental effects, not the cause itself.One imagines that ancient neo-literate cultures were convulsed every time some wise guy deepened or rationalised the alphabet. Imagine the war of words that must have broken out between the haves and have-nots when circumflex consonants entered the Indian languages. Most humans still cannot pronounce circumflexes, like the d in tadka, the secret ingredient which transforms lentils into food. They are highly divisive characters.But those language wars are long-forgotten, and the world had been at verbal peace until Twitter doubled its character limit to 280. Users like JK Rowling mourn the end of the 140 character limit, which had imposed textual discipline and creativity. Emotional outbursts followed, and some people registered their protest by filling up their tweets with a single string, like 280 repeated 70 times, or number repeated 40 times. Since 280 is not divisible by a square, the resulting tweets are all unsatisfactorily rectangular.The most interesting offering of the week from a TV station is satisfyingly retro and textual. Its an essay for the BBC by Nobel laureate Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, in which he contemplates the sweeping changes wrought by change in the last 100 years. Just three or four generations ago, no one understood the mechanics of biological inheritance, and now we are almost ready to play God with genes. How stars and planets are formed was barely understood, and the atom and its contents constituted a mysterious locked room.Unfortunately, Ramakrishnan only hints at the wider issues which concern us today  the interplay of science and technology with cultural, economic and political factors. Something must be wrong if you Google technology news and get pictures of the latest Chinese smartphones. And the rising and falling tides of faith, which was the chief explainer of things that matter just a century ago, is the most interesting political phenomenon of our age. The scientific method explains it most inadequately.Celebrations of the demonetisation anniversary have been marred by a minister rashly claiming that the intervention caused the Darwinian elimination of those unfit to re-skill, and that it has dealt a body blow to prostitution. Questions are being raised about his analytical methods. How much GST does a bawdy house pay? How is the value-add computed? Anyway, it is never a good idea to celebrate an event that produced distress, while flashing moral imperatives and figures of fatter tax receipts to strengthen claims. Other figures, long forgotten, have re-emerged. Prone figures, sprawled figures, clearly dead figures, and figures in helpless tears in interminable queues at banks. As celebrations go, this ones gone off the rails, even without the critical stories appearing in media overseas, such as The Wall Street Journal, and Rahul Gandhis surprisingly measured oped in the Financial Times. But the very fact that the question of demonetisation is still in the news suggests that busted economics makes good politics.

(Illustration: CR Sasikumar) Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. (Illustration: CR Sasikumar)In the last decade of the 19th century, the food aficionado Bipradas Mukhopadhyay compiled what was then regarded as the definitive list of Bengali sweetmeat recipes. Mishtanna Pak (cooking of sweets), Mukhopadhyays two-volume magnum opus, goes into copious details while giving instructions on preparing sweetmeats, many of which are obscure today. It lists more than 25 varieties of the sandesh. But Mukhopadhyay  whose more famous work, Pak Pranali, has been described by the sociologist Krishnendu Ray as the first truly popular modern Bengali cookbook  is way less effusive about the rosogolla. It finds a mention only in the discussion on sugar syrups.Rosogolla is prepared by mixing one ser (equivalent to 933 grammes) chhana (cottage cheese) with one ser sugar syrup. Small amounts of cardamom and rose water are added. One ser rosogolla requires four times of its quantity of syrup so that the chhana balls can float easily. The sugar syrup should be prepared very carefully so as to prevent it from becoming concentrated. The chhana should be fresh and absolutely free from moisture. It should be kneaded properly to squeeze the water out of it, notes the Mishtanna Pak. The West Bengal government cited this discussion in the 19th century cookbook as evidence for rosogallas origin in the state when it applied to the Registrar of Intellectual Properties for the Geographical Index (GI) tag for the sweetmeat.By most accounts, the Bengali passion for sweetmeats made from chhana is less than three centuries old. Food writer Chitrita Banerjee believes that confectioners in the state may have been trained by Portuguese colonists in the use of cottage cheese. But even into the mid-19th century there is no mention of the sandesh or rosogolla, Banerji writes in her classic, Life and Food in Bengal. She believes that these sweets were probably devised by professional sweat-makers during the latter half of the 19th century. However, its also well-known that in about a century, the two sweets had become emblematic of gastronomy, so much so that a ban on chhana sweets in 1965 by West Bengals then chief minister, Prafulla Chandra Sen  to deal with a milk shortage  evoked strong protests from Calcuttas confectioners. According to contemporary accounts, the artisans employed by the confectioners did not know how to make sweets other than sandesh and rosogolla.In their recent gastronomic kerfuffle with foodies from neighbouring Odisha, Bengali rosogolla buffs often extol the skills of these sweetmeat artisans. Crafting a spongy rosogolla does require dexterity. The chhana balls should be soft but firm enough so that they are not broken while coming in contact with each other, cautions the Mishtanna Pak. Judicious addition of different agents in measured quantity is a major responsibility of the experienced artisans, notes the West Bengal governments GI application. It likens the role of the artisan to the conductor of an orchestra, who knows how to direct it to a flawless conclusion.Bengals upper-caste sweet aficionados have, however, had an ambivalent attitude to the sweet meat artisan, the moira. According to Banerji, tradition pictures the moira as a huge immobile mountain of flesh sitting in front of his stove or in front of a huge platter which he manipulates with the ease of long practice. He is utterly oblivious to all else in the world and so satiated with his products that he never touches them himself. Other accounts are at odds with such benign imagery. Historian Utsa Ray writes that confectioners, who generally belonged to the lower castes, were an object of disgust for the middle-class. She quotes a petition to the Bengal government in the mid-19th century which describes moiras as men more concerned with their own interests than the health and lives of their buyers. Moiras were also accused of being dirty and unhygienic, by R.C. Day, a physician writing in the 1920s.It was one such moira who is credited in numerous accounts as the creator of the rosogolla  as the Bengalis know it. According to the Oxford Companion to Sugar and Sweets, The story goes that Nobin Moira belonged to a family of gur traders that had fallen on bad times. After at least one false start, he opened a shop in the Bagbazaar district of North Kolkata. Two kinds of sweets were popular at that time, sandesh and sweets made of lentils. An account written much later notes that patrons were bored and demanded something different. So Nobin came up with the rosogolla.But like most items, pinpointing rosogollas origins is a difficult  and as the Odisha-West Bengal contest over the sweetmeat shows  and fraught endeavour. Even in Bengal, there are several accounts about the rosogollas origin. Food historian Pranab Ray believes that the sweet was introduced a few years before Nobin Moiras creation by a confectioner who traded his wares in front of the Calcutta High Court. An early 20th century account, Nadia Kahini, quoted by Utsa Ray claims a rather fortuitous origin for the syrupy sponge balls: Rosogolla is not more than 50/60 years old. Haradhan Moira used to make sweets for the landlord. His little daughter was crying. In order to pacify her, Haradhan dropped some cottage cheese in the sugar syrup that was boiling on the stove. The result was a fine product. The zamindars named it rosogolla.In her work on American cheese-making, anthropologist Heather Paxson argues that cheese artisans have a tradition of inventing. The different, and contesting, accounts of rosogollas origins testify to such ingenuity  of Bengals moiras and Odishas sweet makers. But a GI tag runs counter to inventiveness. It binds artisanal production to strict standards of authenticity  and origin. A 2006 paper by trade economist Ben Shephard argued that the strict GI standards were making it difficult for French wine-makers to cater to tastes of New World Consumers. It will be a pity if such a fate befell Nobin Moiras successors.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Teachers begin the day with morning study, an hour of fresh study materials and test papers.Many teachers feel that morning is when the mind is the most active. Students can focus better and can solve new problems. This is a productive time, says V. Suganthi, a teacher from a government school in Melur.After-school revisions are done until 5.30 p.m. every day. Special training will be given to students who are not academically inclined or identified as slow learners. Heads of other schools in the district say that they follow a similar system too.Schools like Corporations Kasturba Gandhi Matriculation Higher Secondary School that have regularly produced toppers say that focused training and special classes will help a lot those falling behind.We have made many failures pass the final exams. They have gone on to study successfully after that, said A. Veeranan, Assistant Headmaster.All HMs from Corporation schools in Madurai regularly distribute lentils and a small drink for energy. While the Corporation funds most evening snacks, teachers often pitch-in and buy students groundnut burfi, etc. Since they have all been given yoga training, students from Elango Government Boys High School regularly practised yoga.Counselling through teachers and private agencies is done regularly to prevent student suicides. Children are urged to approach their respective teachers and heads, says Chief Education Officer of the district N. Marimuthu.A. Amutha Rani, a counsellor at Childline, says that stress and anxiety therapy are provided to students. Teachers at M. Kallupattis Government High School say that they also provide counselling to parents too.Students at Pandian Nedunchezhiyan Corporation Higher Secondary School say that utilising the library on their premises and playing in the ground are the greatest de-stress acts, they say."

Though ISM doesnt produce extra yield, being able to cut down crop loss due to bacterial blight results in additional yields, said Dr Ramesh Sonti chief scientist, CCMB.The ISM rice has been developed by CCMB and Indian Institute of Rice Research over several years of research, while testing was conducted by National Institute of Nutrition. It found ISM to have one of lowest GI of 50.99, thus having the potential to revolutionise the organic food market as well. Foods with GI value below 55 are considered highly suitable for consumption by a diabetic patient as they release glucose in the bloodstream slowly, thereby reducing the ill effects of diabetes.Thus ISM, in addition to possessing desirable attributes like high yield, fine-grain type bacterial blight resistance, premium market price, also has the unique advantage of low GI, enhancing its market potential, said Dr Rakesh Kumar Mishra, director CCMB.CCBM and IIRR picked up a donor variety of samba masuri from Punjab that was low in quality and taste and was not easy to cook but was extremely resistant. Traditional breeding method of this variety with other variety of the rice was done and with the help of advanced biotechnology tools, the ISM was developed."

He also attacked Congress leader Kapil Sibal for stating in the Supreme Court that hearing on the Ram Mandir issue be deferred till Lok Sabha elections in 2019.I remember those days during Congress rule when out of 365 days, Ahmedabad city was curfew-bound for 200 days, Shah said.In Congress rule over decades, our enemies used to infiltrate into our land and behead our soldiers. After PM Modi came to power, he stood behind our army and they could give a befitting reply in a surgical strike. It is said that after the US , only India could achieve such a feat, Shah said.Shah then trained his guns on former Congress minister Kamal Nath, who accused Modi of touring the world and not concentrating on affairs at home.When we began collating the travel history of Manmohan Singh and our PM Modi, we found that Singh had travelled more. The only thing was not many in our country took note or knew of Singhs foreign visits, where he would take two sheets of paper carrying his English speech and return home, said Shah, adding, PM Modi is welcomed by thousands at the airport across the world, wherever he goes. He addressed the UN assembly in Hindi and everybody stood up in respect.He then took a dig at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who recently questioned BJPs contributions during its 42-month rule. I carry here a list of 106 schemes that were declared, Shah said.He added, We declared a scheme every 20 days.He then urged Patan voters in Kheralu to vote for BJP. After we came to power we have toppled Congress in Maharashtra, then in Haryana, Jharkhand , Haryana, Kashmir, Assam , Manipur, Uttarakhand , Goa and finally UP. People of Gujarat are progressive and will chose a government that works for them and the BJP continues to be dedicated to the states development, Shah said.BJP president Amit Shah tweeted on Thursday that the Congress in the past has called PM Narendra Modi names. Shah tweeted, Yamraj, Maut Ka Saudagar, Ravan, Gandi Nali Ka Keeda, Monkey , Rabies Victim, Virus, Bhasmasur, Gangu Teli, Goon  these are some words or phrases Congress has used for PM Narendra Modi in the past. Not much has changed. We wish them well. We will continue to serve 125 crore Indians."

Why are you obstructing the disposal of the Ayodhya case? They (Congress) are not replying but he (Kapil Sibal) is saying he is not the advocate of the Sunni Waqf Board. Then clarify whether you (Kapil Sibal) are the advocate of Ram Temple or Babri Masjid. If you can't speak the truth, ask your new leader (Rahul Gandhi) to speak on this,"" he said.He was in turns emotional and combative as he asked Gujarat voters to avenge the ""plethora of abuses"" heaped on him by the opposition with their votes. Modi referred to suspended Congr ess member Mani Shankar Aiyar 's remark - he had called Modi a ""neech kism ka admi"" - and exhorted the electorate to ""punish"" Congress by voting heavily in favour of BJP.

""Mani Shankar Aiyar had gone to Pakistan and plotted to remove Modi from the way. What is the meaning of 'elimin ate Modi from the way'?"" Modi asked. ""You had gone to Pakistan to give a contract to eliminate Modi. I am being protected by Maa Amba."" Modi said Congress' abuse for him amounted to insults for all members of backward communities, Gujarat and the civilised society itself.After listing more than a dozen instances where Congress members had criticised him, Modi said, ""I was called a monkey, a mentally retarded person, Ravan, Yamraj, Bhasmasur and even 'napunsak' (impotent). Is this the language used in a democracy? Stop challenging our decency in public life.""Modi asked people what they would do if they were abused like this. He urged the people to teach Congress a lesson in the elections. Earlier in the day at Himmatnagar, Modi, who belongs to the OBC, made a specific appeal to OBCs and Dalits to avenge Congresss neech insult. People from Bakshipunch (OBCs) must be here. Has anyone become neech if he takes birth in a particular caste? Frustrated at seeing defeat, a desperate Congress has stooped to calling a son of Gujarat neech. Brothers and sisters, take revenge on December 9 and 14, Modi said. He insisted that such an insult could not be tolerated and such offenders do not have the right to remain in public life."

He is free to represent anyone, that is his prerogative. There are lawyers who get cases from good people and there are some who get cases from bad people. This is not our issue.

5b2e848d9855b72640116098,Culture shocks and cucumbers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/651710/culture-shocks-cucumbers.html,2017-12-12,"Last month, the research group I joined recently, got together for the annual Christmas meal or 'Julefrokost' as they call it in Danish. As per tradition, the newest member of the group (me) was in-charge of the cooking. Of course, I decided to cook traditional South Indian food. I had already stirred their curiosity with the food I took for lunch.A month after eating raw vegetables and boiled potatoes everyday (yes, I am a vegetarian, and no, I don't consider fish as vegetarian unlike my Danish colleagues nor fried bacon a spice), I decided to wake up 30 minutes earlier than usual to prepare a tastebud tickling South Indian lunch. This led to another exercise. I had to explain to my colleagues what it is that I was eating every single day. ""Sambhar is a lentil-based vegetable curry cooked with a tamarind broth and a 'secret' spice mix,'' I told them after thinking all morning about it.I took rice and sorekai thovve or lauki dal one day. ""Bottle gourd and split lentils cooked with whole and powdered spices with a tempering of cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves,'' I told them confidently. They looked at me baffled. Bottle gourd! Asafoetida! Curry leaves! It took me the rest of the lunch break to explain to them what these were. Thereafter, I was careful what I made for lunch. It is one thing making rava idli (from the ready-mix that I made sure I packed while leaving home) and another thing explaining it to someone who has never seen or tasted anything like it before.On the day of the Julefrokost, I expected them to be surprised by the okra, snake gourd, spluttering mustard seeds or at least when I mentioned that they had to eat with their right hand only. But the culture shockwaves swept through the room when I asked the person in-charge of the cucumbers why he wasn't milking it first. He was aghast ""Milk the cucumber?!"" There was silence in the room as everyone wondered if they had heard it right. In a matter-of-fact way, I repeated the question and then realised that this concept wasn't as universal as I thought. I then demonstrated it only to have a few people laughing uncontrollably, few others taking videos and the rest thinking that I was playing a prank.An Italian colleague entered just as I was defending the process of milking the cucumber to get rid of the bitterness and was trying to use some kind of logical reasoning for it. He casually added that in Italy, even zucchinis are 'milked' and I heaved a sigh of relief that it wasn't just me. He, too, was asked to demonstrate it and obviously he did it the same way you or I would. Then, two bowls were passed around - one with slices of a 'milked' cucumber and the other with an 'unmilked' one - and everyone was asked to identify which one was milked. But how can you tell the difference if the cucumbers are not bitter? I learned one thing that day - there are no bitter cucumbers in Denmark."

We are impressed by Indias infrastructural growth and the services the country can offer us, Samuel Baasil said. He had a meeting with NEXT Techno solutions at Tidel Park on Friday. The company supplies IT and solar and energy solutions, and medical equipment to Papua New Guinea. Its director G Karthikeyan told TOI that they were looking to increase their exports to Papua New Guinea, besides looking at more business options.We are looking at machinery for cement mixtures, vehicles, toilet rolls, envelopes, bulb making, sugarcane juice machines and other agricultural machinery. Presently, we import them from Australia and New Zealand and it is very expensive. We can buy these products from India and even Coimbatore, Samuel Basil said.He said Papua New Guinea already enjoys several ties with the city.

In our country, 80% is rural area and power is a major issue. Apart from that we also want to offer our land for agriculture. We have a population of 8.3 million and our density is 17persons per sqm. So we have ample land that India could use for growing its lentils and other crops, Sam said.The delegation has met the vice-chancellor of TNAU, K Ramasamy.

The rebels are also holding the police responsible for one of their injured women cadres who is missing since the encounter on December 12 at Kamasur village.Though the Naxalites bandh was a damp squib with security remaining alert across the southern part of the district, the Naxalites are learnt to have tried to distribute pamphlets in places like Damrancha, Laheri and some others. In the pamphlets, the Naxalites have tried to draw attention of the tribal towards the so-called police atrocities.Aheri area committee secretary Sunil had, in a pamphlet found earlier in south Gadchiroli, claimed that police have dragged away two of their injured cadres after the encounter at Kamsur village. Sunil, who is also a divisional committee member (DVC), has claimed that police have eliminated Karan who was already injured.In the pamphlet, Sunil has also mentioned about his wife Amsubai Talandi, alias Swarupa, who too was taken away by the police in an injured condition and is still untraceable. The Naxalites have now demanded police should present Swarupa before the court.The C-60 commandos had cornered a formation of the Naxalites at Kalled village on December 6 where seven rebel cadres were killed. Several others were injured. The injured Naxalites had later taken shelter at Kamasur village where security forces once again ambushed them on December 12.It was from here that the security forces had claimed to have gunned down yet another male Naxalite who is yet to be officially identified. The Naxalites have now come out with a pamphlet where they had identified the slain male Naxalite as Karan.DIG of Naxal range, Ankush Shinde said the slain male Naxalite had a .303 rifle with him when his body was recovered. The Naxalite was firing upon police from behind a rock. He got hit during the exchange of fire, he said.Refuting allegations of taking any woman cadre into custody, Gadchiroli SP Abhinav Deshmukh said the police would only be too happy to announce her name if it was a reality. There is no question of having any woman cadre in our custody illegally. If DVC Sunils wife would have been arrested then it would have been an achievement for security forces and not a matter to conceal, he said."

It entails stern punishment for those trying to dislodge the government forcibly or violently.The Opposition members were of the view that there was no need for such a legislation as there were sufficient provisions in the IPC and the CrPC. They called it a black law.The Bill is likely to be taken up on Friday in the Legislative Council where the ruling BJP does not enjoy majority.Initiating the debate, the Chief Minister assured the members against any possible misuse of the proposed law.Security without biasEver since the day the draft of the Bill was approved by the Cabinet, I have noticed that the Opposition parties are against it. I can give the guarantee that the BJP has never misused any law and will never do so. We have come to bring development and give security without any bias, he said.The Chief Minister compared the Bill with similar laws in Maharashtra and Karnataka and said it will create terror in the minds of those who have made crime a trade.Seeking the Oppositions backing for the Bill, he cited its salient features and said it was unfortunate that they wanted to support those who were indulging in organised crime by opposing the proposed law.The Chief Minister said that another Bill is on the anvil through which about 20,000 political cases will come to an end.Earlier attemptTarring the Bill as a black law and an undeclared emergency, Leader of the Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary referred to an earlier attempt by the then Mayawati government in 2007 which had got a similar Bill passed but it failed to get presidential assent.Mr. Chaudhary even read the previous speeches of BJP leaders Hukum Singh, now an MP, and MLA Suresh Khanna, who is the Parliamentary Affairs Minister, and stressed that both had opposed the measure expressing fear that it will be used against the Opposition parties.All rights have been given to the administration and to the police in the Bill. The government which had promised to establish Ram Rajya is making provision for capital punishment, he said and stressed that the basic ethos of the Constitution are that no innocent should be punished.I request you against creating a Bhasmasur (self-destructive demon)... having the feeling of autocracy in a democracy is not good, Mr. Chaudhary said.Lalji Verma and Sukhdev Rajbhar of BSP, SP leader Azam Khan and Ajay Kumar Lallu (Congress) alleged that the Bill has been brought to crush the voice of politicians, farmers, social workers and journalists and is against the constitutional right of freedom of expression."

Almost 49,000 children are affected by malnutrition in the district. The district which adds immensely to the overall sugarcane produce has been lagging in production of cash crops like pulses and vegetables, forcing the farmers to procure it at higher rates from the market.In the new scheme of things, department will promote mixed farming with impetus on farming of vegetables and pulses in tandem with sugarcane. On pilot basis, 22,000 hectare has been identified where mixed farming is being practiced.According to statistics, provided by district programme office, there are around 3.39 lakh children in the district. Of these, while 49,000 are malnourished and around 20,000 children are acutely malnourished. These kids are from 0 to 5 years old. Besides this, women are also suffering from anemia.According to official, it is because of increase in sugarcane cultivation area. In west UP, including Bijnor , farmers had almost sidelined other crops. Most of the farmers are growing only sugarcane.The district cane officer OP Singh said, We have assigned a target of sowing 22,000 hectare intercrop in sugarcane. Earlier, Bijnor district is a hub of sugarcane crop. Farmers have adopted it as a main crop as it is a cash crop and does not require much labourer. On our suggestion, the farmers have started growing some crops like cauliflower, bringal, tomato, capsicum, radish, salgum, gram, ourad, mong, masoor with sugarcane crop.Director of agriculture department, JP Chaudhary , said, The initiative will help improve the health of malnourished kids and women in the district. We are holding meetings in every village and motivating the farmers. Efforts will start bearing fruits soon."

The objective is to ensure Hindus are prepared to defend themselves against aggression from members of other religious communities, besides helping the army in the case of external aggression, said Kushal Kundu, the VHPs assistant secretary for south Bengal who was in charge of conducting the week-long Yuva Shaurya Training Camp for 156 volunteers.At the camp, trainees can be seen undergoing a variety of exercises such as crawling through a narrow, muddy trench covered with a heap of leaves, and then using a rope strung across two trees 30 feet apart to move from one tree to another. They then had to climb a 30 feet-high bamboo structure before having to walk on a single bamboo pole placed horizontally 15 feet above the ground. Apart from this drill for a week, there were sessions on defending oneself with sticks and dummy swords, loading and unloading of rifles, and using the nunchaku  a weapon used in martial arts.Volunteers undergo training at the camp.

The house torched. The cows stolen.More than 650,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar fleeing a military crackdown have entered Bangladesh since late August, one of the most rapid exoduses in history. This month, the United Nations human rights chief suggested that the Myanmar military deliberately targeted civilians belonging to the minority Rohingya in ""acts of appalling barbarity"" that may have included ""elements of genocide.""The ordeal began Aug. 25, when Rohingya militants attacked Myanmar police posts. Five days later, the boys' village was inundated with soldiers who - human rights groups allege - killed, raped and burned villagers in their homes. Shamsul, 8, and Jafar, 11, followed a stream of people to Bangladesh, two of about 1,800 children who made the terrifying days-long journey to safety without their immediate caregivers, according to UNICEF. Many have been taken in by neighbors or extended families, authorities say, but face dangers such as child traffickers, diseases and malnourishment.By early December, the brothers had learned the physical landscape of the sprawling camp - which fishmonger sells the best dried fish, which adults should be avoided, which empty stretch of dirt is best for kicking a ball.But their grief is harder to navigate.""Everyone has parents but us,"" Shamsul often says out loud, part in pain, part in wonder.- - -On that August morning, soldiers came to their village toting automatic rifles and shoulder-fired rocket-launchers and sprayed the air with gunfire, according to witness accounts.The villagers scattered, some fleeing into the jungle for safety. Jafar said he took refuge on a small hill overlooking his house and watched as soldiers beat his mother, Monira, and three of his siblings, Somuda, 15, Khurshid, 7, and Shalida, 3 months. They pushed them into the house, barricaded the door and set the structure on fire. His family was burned alive inside, Jafar said.Villagers who escaped Tula Toli, a small community of rice farmers also known as Min Gyi, said local boys and men, including the boys' father, were summarily executed on a riverbank. An October report from Amnesty International said the violence at Tula Toli ""appears to be one of the worst atrocities of the Army's ethnic cleansing campaign.""Myanmar's military leaders and its civilian government, led by Aung San Suu Kyi, have consistently denied that security forces in the Buddhist-majority country have targeted the Rohingya.In Tula Toli, escape for Jafar meant crossing a fast-moving river. He had been separated from Shamsul when the soldiers came, but he spotted the little boy, who cannot swim, riding in an old dinghy with others. He dove in. The current was strong, but the sight of the back of his brother's head made him swim harder.""Shamsul, Shamsul!""Jafar swam with all his strength, calling out to his brother.""I was afraid I would lose him,"" Jafar said. Several others drowned while attempting to cross.Jafar made it out of the river and onto the bank, where he embraced Shamsul. A fellow villager who saw the two boys during the chaos said he could not believe they lived.""They are only alive thanks to Allah,"" said Ali Mia, a local leader. ""God saved them.""The boys then followed a stream of people, including some of their neighbors, on a two-day journey on foot to the Bangladeshi border - without food, through burning villages, hearing distant gunfire. Jafar tried to comfort his younger brother. ""I kept asking him not to cry,"" he said.At the river crossing on the border, a grizzled smuggler refused to take them unless they each paid about $120, the boys said. A neighbor finally agreed to put up the money, and they followed the others to the refugee camp on the Bangladesh side.Word of Shamsul and Jafar's plight reached Kamal Hossein and his lost-and-found booth, a small kiosk that offers hope for separated families. In September, Hossein, also a refugee from Burma, spent his month's salary to rent a microphone to call out names of lost children, reuniting more than 700 children with relatives and garnering support from the United Nations refugee agency.After about two weeks, Mohammed Junaid heard of the announcement about his nephews and rushed to the camp to be reunited with them - learning then that his brother was dead.He and his wife, Jorina, began caring for the boys along with their own six children, ages 1 to 12, in their small bamboo-and-tarpaulin tent, with bags of rice and piles of kindling stacked in the corners and a mud oven to cook meals.""They are my brother's sons,"" Junaid said. ""I have to look after them. There is no other way.""- - -For the boys, being reunited with extended family has provided some refuge. But it has not staved off the hunger, or grief.Morning comes early at Thaingkhali, part of a group of camps that has grown to be one of the most densely populated refugee settlements in the world, with more than 800,000 residents. The first call to prayer echoes just after 5:30 a.m., the moon a silver disc still hanging in the sky. It's so cold that Shamsul's lips turn blue, and he shivers in the dawn light, wearing only a thin jacket.Most days, the boys trudge from their shelter home down the mud steps that have been cut into the hill, and then up again to the small mosque for morning prayers, and perhaps a few Koran lessons at the madrassa.It had been days since either of the boys had seen the inside of one of the cheerful learning centers set up by UNICEF - just yards away from their tent. Their uncle thinks the madrassa lessons are enough. The brothers roam with no supervision, dust from the dirt pathways caking their bare feet. In the afternoons, the warm sun makes them lazy and they lie around the tent.Daily soccer games are their only joy. They find flat ground, set up lumps of dirt as goal posts and kick the $2 soccer ball they pooled their coins to buy. Both Shamsul and Jafar smile, chasing the bouncing ball.Jafar said he misses his school in Tula Toli, which had its own soccer field, not far from the river where he and his brothers used to fish. He's hungry a lot of the time now. The 10-member family gets an allotment of rice, lentils and vegetable oil from the U.N. World Food Program every two weeks, and the uncle's work as a day laborer allows them to buy a few vegetables or dried fish.Back home, Jafar said, ""we had peanuts, green chilies, eggplants. We had everything growing in our own lands. We had so many vegetables to eat, and fresh fish.""Jafar brightens describing the flat river fish, as long as your hand to your elbow, that his mother used to fry with chili and turmeric on top.He said, he often doesn't feel like playing. His aunt and uncle say he and his brother are often depressed. Jorina, the aunt, said she struggles to find the words to console the two.- - -The boys face an uncertain future. In the evenings, the fading light casts long shadows from the palm tree leaves, and the air darkens with smoke from thousands of campfires. Men gather in the lanes and around the chai stalls to talk about the latest development - an agreement between Myanmar, also known as Burma, and Bangladesh that would allow them to return home, if they can prove their residency. Many say that the idea of returning home is unrealistic now, with villages still burning and refugees trickling into Banglade"

The demonetisation drive surprised the farmers that it was taking place during the winter sowing time, when they usually start to cultivate onion, garlic or lentils.By Antje StiebitzIn a small village called Jagdishpur Sokha in Uttar Pradeshs Bahraich district near the Nepal border, things have never been easy. But in the year since prime minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive turned their lives upside down, villagers are still coming to terms with their new wages of existence.Arfa Begum tightens a bright green dupatta around her head before she starts to speak. We had money at home, but we were helpless because we couldnt use it. Her eyes stare into emptiness. It was impossible to purchase raw materials and to pay the labour, says the 75 year-old woman. She owns land and runs a brickyard as well as a school and her family is the largest employer in the village.Most of the villages 450 inhabitants live on produce from their patchwork of fields which grow wheat, rice, bananas, lentils and maize. The district is considered backward, the level of education is low, living conditions are harsh and young men leave as fast as they can to earn their bread and butter somewhere else.The light of a small shop illuminates five women sitting on a barren wooden bed. They talk across each other, complaining badly, their eyes mirroring their grim lives. We were so hungry because we couldnt purchase our daily groceries,says Makki, adding, Everything came to a halt. Betuka remembered that they couldnt water the fields because there was no money to pay for the tubewell pump.The demonetisation drive surprised the farmers that it was taking place during the winter sowing time, when they usually start to cultivate onion, garlic or lentils. At this time they need money to buy seeds, pay hired labour who help with ploughing and irrigating the fields. But the lack of cash in the market meant that the sowing got irrevocably delayed. Losses, especially from wheat and lentils, were substantial.Social worker and founder of the NGO Developmental Association for Human Advancement (DEHAT) Jitendra Chaturvedi put the loss into perspective. While the general yield of one acre is about 15 quintals, the notebandi drive diminished the yield per acre to 9 quintals, he said.In Jagdishpur Sokha, for example, at least 25 per cent of the population doesnt own land, which means they depend on daily work. While MGNREGA wages guarantees each family 100 days of work per year, these monies are directly sent into their bank account. During demonetisation, the people of Jagdishpur Sokha, like elsewhere in UP, spent a lot of time standing in queue to get their money out of the bank in the nearby town of Risia  walking took at least an hour, while standing in queues took at least two hours  which meant that they hardly had any time to earn any money from labour. It was too costly to go to Bahraich, even though it has many more banks.All five women sitting in front of the small shop in Jagdishpur Sokha look at each other gloomily. Each of them have a bank account, but no ATM card through which they can withdraw their money. So they must fill a withdrawal form. The truth is that nobody has seen rich people waiting in front of banks, says one of the women to nobody in particular.Down the road a water pump squeaks. Ramkala shouts at a goat. In this period, we ate chapati with salt. We suffered so much all these months, she said. Ramkalas husband is very ill and cannot work, so her son works in the local brickyard. But even the brickyard stopped production because the owner could not buy raw materials or pay the labour he had hired. Ramkalas two cows bailed them out, by giving them some milk to drink, while her work as a care-giver at the nearby Global School of Learning gave the family some income.Arfa Begums family was almost completely incapacitated for three months and continues to suffer from the consequences of notebandi.Azim Khan, a social scientist, pointed out that in Jagdishpur Sokha, the major economic activity after agriculture is construction in which 100 men are engaged, besides 14 men in masonry work. Before demonetisation they had about 24 to 30 days work a month. After demonetisation, this has come down to 12 to 15 days a month. All oft hem have lost almost 50 per cent of their wages in the last year, he said.DEHATs Chaturvedi adds that the impulse to digitisation has been slow, at least in these parts, because few people even have access to electricity. In one hundred households, only one rich man will have electricity. The rest of the village has to depend on his mercy, he said.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
