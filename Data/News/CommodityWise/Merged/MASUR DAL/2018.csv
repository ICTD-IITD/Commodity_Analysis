5aeb2a149855b73f522c7788,Corporatisation of food,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/corporatisation-of-food/article22340375.ece,2018-01-01,"The World Food India conference in Delhi in November informed us as much about the urban bias in development in India as about the disregard for public health and natural agriculture.PepsiCo Leads Rs. 68,000 Crore plans for Food Sector read one media headline during the conference. Hundreds of corporations vend food, indiscriminate consumption of which creates digestive disorders, hypertension, heart disease, diabetes and even cancer.Processed and packaged food can be especially challenging to our health as these also contain, in addition to chemicals like fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides, excessive amounts of sugar, salt and oil. Our government would outsource food to these corporations fully if left to themselves, instead of establishing ecosystems for family farmers to grow food without chemicals and undertaking the hard work of pushing and incentivising peasants to diversify their production from wheat and rice to a range of rapidly disappearing traditional foods (like millets) and more lentils, fruits and vegetables.Food processing to be major growth area: consumer choices to fuel change, says FM , read another media headline. Arun Jaitley has said the farm to kitchen chain is going to change in India, with increased agricultural production  and changing consumer preference. The consumer he refers to isnt the marginal and small peasant, the landless dalit, the adivasi in the forest or the urban poor.These corporations, with little interest in the health of consumers, are going to change preferences to more sugared beverages, more potato chips, more chocolates, more fried snacks. If outsourcing the change of consumer preferences to corporations isnt a recipe for a public health disaster, what is?Private Sector Must Invest More in Contract Farming: PM , announced yet another header. Companies are evaluating India as a market to sell their products and as an outsourcing hub.This is farcical in a nation where a vast proportion of the population is malnourished and nutritionally challenged. Prime Minister Modis speech was targeted at corporations and their ease of doing business with the consuming classes, and holds little hope for the poor. Each of these marks his unique approach to development where agency lies with mass-producing, machine-driven companies and entrepreneurs, not peasants and consumers.The purpose of development is forgotten. All political parties are complicit in equating development with GDP growth and FDI.Not much of this will reach the farmer in the form of higher procurement prices; much will instead flow to corporations as profits. Few new jobs will be created in heavily automated food-processing factories. By their very nature, global corporations will import sophisticated machines and labour-eliminating attitudes from their home economies to run these factories.Inequitable distributionNo small farmer will benefit; instead, already wealthy, large farmers in well-irrigated parts of prosperous regions of India will make money from these factories: the kinnow farmers in Punjab and potato farmers in Haryana. What is smothered by the development discourse is the critical issue of health sovereignty; we are ceding our rights to eat healthy, fresh, chemical-free, unprocessed foods to corporations.The urban, educated consumer demands organic retailers undergo stringent checks and penalties for misrepresentation, and rightly so. These same people, however, are eerily silent about the absence of labeling on 99.9% of all food today that is grown with overdoses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides, preserved with chemicals, sugars, salts and fats. These hold no warning that consuming them over a lifetime will destroy our health.The larger picture is quite bleak with little hope of redemption; therefore, all the more reason that individuals must act for themselves.We and our children must beware of food or drink that comes in a package, and we must be mindful of who benefits from our purchases.We must ask difficult questions of a system that produces the chemically poisoned food we consume, and of a government that outsources public health to corporations who package and process unhealthy food.Finally, we must commence our very personal journey of discovery by engaging with a neighbourhood organic farm.(The writer, once a corporate warrior, is now an organic farmer)"

Photo: AFPNew Delhi/Mumbai: India has extended by six months an exemption to its policy for crop cargoes to be fumigated with methyl bromide, a gas once widely used as a pesticide but now banned or restricted in most parts of the world, two government officials said.The countrys plant quarantine authority had earlier said that after 31 December India would only accept cargoes fumigated for pests with methyl bromide at the country of origin, threatening to disrupt supplies of pulses from Canada and wheat from Europe and the Black Sea region.India is the biggest importer of pulses, protein-rich crops that include peas and lentils.For the first half of the year India will accept cargoes not fumigated with methyl bromide in the country of origin, said one of the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity because he is not authorised to speak to the media.Methyl bromide has been banned or restricted by many countries because it is considered an ozone-depleting chemical.

5aeaa9ff9855b7179ad6d367,That's soooo Vegan!,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2018/jan/04/thats-soooo-vegan-1744306.html,2018-01-04,"Thushara Ann Mathew ByExpress News ServiceImagine having a plate full of your scrumptious meal without your daily bowl of curd or buttermilk. Would you be up to avoid dairy products from your diet especially if you could get the right amount of proteins without them? Though the concept of avoiding any kind of animal products was officially established more than 70 years ago in the West, it took some time to become a trend in India. And in Chennai, particularly, veganism has been gaining popularity in the last couple of years.The city even witnessed a completely eco-friendly vegan wedding recently! I attended the wedding a few days back. And they served the yummiest butterscotch ice cream. It was made out of cotton seed milk, recalls Anu Vidya M, who runs the Instagram account @Chennai_vegan_ foodguide.Vegetarian vs Vegan Although many people tend to confuse vegan and vegetarian, veganism is basically an extension of vegetarianism, wherein the diet includes no food or products from animals. People tend to eat more of beans, lentils, tofu, etc, Basically no meat or poultry. It is just like how vegetarians do, but also we say no to dairy/ honey/ eggs, point out Roshni Sanghvi, body transformation specialist. Minal Agrawal who administers the Facebook page Veganennai, says that veganism is popular only in the metros and that too because of social media. Veganism is yet to reach smaller cities and town.Whether youre non-vegetarian and vegetarian, youre being cruel to animals. Veganism is against all the cruelty towards animals, she highlights. Indianised cuisine Food, in general, can be made vegan. It can have anything except for any product derived from an animal. So dairy products, eggs and meat is a complete no-no, says Sarmishta Baliga, head pastry chef, Ashvita Bistro. The taste and flavours still remain the same as any other cuisine.Is there a specialised Indian menu in terms of vegan food? Traditionally, most Indian cooking, especially south Indian vegetarian cooking, is vegan. Barring the popular curd rice and use of a little ghee while tempering for most dishes and desserts, most south Indian food is vegan in itself, explains Sruthi Harihara Subramanian, owner, Ashvita. Benefits Vegan food has several health benefits, including no risk of heart problems and cholesterol.Roshni points out that unlike meat and egg, which leads to higher levels of cholesterol and heart diseases, a plant-based whole-food vegan diet has almost no cholesterol. Dairy has been linked to indigestion, acne, headaches, diabetes, cancer, and a whole range of lifestyle diseases and disorders.A plant-based diet is also lower in calories and much more nutritious, she adds. Vegan food also promotes a healthy environment. You are reducing your carbon footprint, hence reducing damage to the environment, says Anu.Feasibility Minal, who became a vegan in 2011, says that cutting costs is easier if youre a vegan. People think it is not feasible; in fact, it is the opposite. Its easy and affordable to make dairy and meat alternatives at home. Roshni concurs and adds that most food we eat is accidentally vegan and almost everything can easily be customised. For instance, vegetarian Asian food is almost 100% vegan since they use tofu instead of paneer and no other dairy products. Abroad, the options are much more compared to India, but the Indian market is changing, she adds. Though awareness and acceptability is growing, its slow, claims A Mohamed Zakaria of Veganer restaurant, who had to shut down a couple of places, due to the same reason. We had formally opened the restaurant in September 2014.Since the awareness of vegan food is less in Chennai when compared to other cities, we couldnt get much response as we had expected. Hence, we decided to close the outlets in Anna Nagar, Ascendas Food"

(AP Photo/File) A Bangladeshi health worker injects vaccine to a Rohingya Muslim boy, who crossed over from Myanmar into Bangladesh, at Balukhali refugee camp, Bangladesh. (AP Photo/File)A new UN study has revealed that over 90 per cent of the recent Rohingya refugee arrivals in Bangladesh are under-nourished despite receiving emergency food assistance. The World Food Programme (WFP) Rohingya Emergency Vulnerability Assessment and food security sector partners study in November and December 2017 raised concerns over limited access to a well diversified and balanced diet, deputy UN spokesman Farhan Haq announced on Friday.As a result, he said, the WFP will scale up its e-voucher programmes in 2018 to reach new arrivals in Coxs Bazar district, reports Xinhua news agency. Some 90,000 people are enrolled in WFPs e-voucher programmes where they receive a monthly amount on a pre-paid debit card which can be used in allocated shops to buy 19 different foods, including rice, lentils, fresh vegetables, eggs and dry fish, Haq said.The e-programmes contrast with WFPs food distribution program for new arrivals which include rice, vegetable oil and lentils. Its an emergency ration designed to provide basic calories, but lacking in dietary diversity, the spokesman said. The study also recommends the scaling up of a livelihood support programme within host communities prioritising especially women who have no income, he said, adding that the WFP is providing food and food vouchers to more than 700,000 refugees.More than 650,000 Rohingyas have fled Myanmar for Bangladesh since August 25, 2017, when rebel Rohingya militia launched deadly attacks against security forces in Myanmars Rakhine state. The action allegedly triggered retaliation attacks by Myanmar vigilantes and government troops, forcing Rohingyas to flee into Bangladesh. There already were about 300,000 Rohingyas who had fled earlier into the neighbouring country.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Before the onset of the current biting cold spell, he, along with other farmers of the village, was a worried lot due to relatively warmer weather for this time of the winter.A short spell of cold spell is conducive for the healthy growth of the wheat, gram and masur crops. Look at the wheat crops now! cold weather has infused a new life in the crops. Otherwise, our wheat and other crops were on the verge of being destroyed due to unusual warm weather this time of the year before the severe cold set in, Shyam Bihari said with a beaming face as he has only one acre land and the yield from it is the only means of sustenance for his family of five members.Standing beside him, Raju Ojha and Jeetu Kumar, comparatively richer than Shyam Bihari, also said the current cold spell saved their crops.Not only farmers, but traders of room heaters, blowers and immersion rods are also happy with the sudden chill. Back in Ara, the authorized dealer of reputed brands of electrical appliances in the Kamla Market at the Chitra Toli Road said, In just four days since the severe cold conditions started, all my room heaters, blowers and immersion rods have been sold out. All our worries have vanished now as the sale was very poor before the onset of the current cold spell.The biting cold is also sending the woollen garment sellers laughing all the way to the bank. A gloves and woollen caps seller at Bichli Road said he had to place fresh order as his stock was sold out in the last few days."
5aeaa7839855b7179ad6d25c,Australian Agriculture Minister to visit India soon to resolve pulses trade issue,http://www.newindianexpress.com/business/2018/jan/11/australian-agriculture-minister-to-visit-india-soon-to-resolve-pulses-trade-issue-1750925.html,2018-01-11,"By PTIMELBOURNE: Australian Agriculture Minister David Littleproud has announced that he is likely to visit India soon to negotiate a better deal for the country's farmer after New Delhi imposed higher tariff on imported chickpeas and lentils.Last month, India had imposed 30 per cent import duty on chickpeas (chana) and lentils (masoor) to protect domestic farmers from falling local rates in view of higher output.Littleproud said that an estimated 2 lakh tonnes of Australian chickpeas and lentils were on transit when the India announced the tariff.First, the Australian government wants to take a strategic approach to resolve the long-term trade issue with India besides looking at alternative markets to dispose of its pulses, he was quoted as saying by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation news.""I intend to make a trip to India in the coming 10 days to go and engage with my counterparts over there, as well as industry...,"" he said.The efforts will be made to ensure the tariff issue gets resolved and at the same time make sure that ""we reinforce the need for a long-term sustainable free-trade agreement with India,"" Littleproud said.Noting that the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India was a high priority for Australia's farm sector, the Minister said the government was acting in a ""sensible and responsible way"" to ensure the issue does not become an ""impediment"" in the long term of progress of an FTA with India.""What we have to understand is we have a USD 2.7 billion trade surplus in the agriculture sector with India, so we have to be sensible about how we negotiate with India and we are doing that in a sensible way behind doors,"" he said.Since a billion-dollar industry of Australian producers has been affected, the Minister said that the Australian government was working hard behind the scenes to negotiate a better deal for its farmers.The Australian government is also looking at other markets such as Nepal, Iran and the UAE for its pulses sale. It is trying to make representation in those nations where the cargo is in transit now, he said.Stating that the 'Megaphone diplomacy' doesn't always work, Littleproud said, ""We have to be sensible about this. We have to play a long game about what will get us the long-term benefit that our producers want."" Last month, Australian Trade Minister Steven Ciobo had made representations to the Indian government on the pulses issue. Ciobo is likely to raise the issue with Indian trade minister Suresh Prabhu at the World Economic Forum in Davos this month.During 2016-17, chickpea exports to India were valued at USD 1.14 billion and lentils were worth USD 196 million."

Much-loved dishes include not only roast mutton, fish tikka, garlic toast and honey-and-fig ice cream, but also something called Ghar Jaisa Khana. True to its name, the special platter offers strictly home-like fare  kathal ki subzi, aloo tamatar, masoor dal, and plain dahi were served to us the evening we dined there. The thali really looked as simple as the one at home, except for the fancy bread basket for flat rotis.The platter was introduced in the dining hall before I started working here more than a decade ago, the waiter told us in a hushed whisper  one is not supposed to raise ones voice here.The IIC patrons consist of Delhis important people, who are more interested in conversation than the menu. Heres where political alliances are rumored to be considered and sometimes created.While forking their way through Spinach Florentine, one might learn the real dope about inside deals, author Ranjana Sengupta, an IIC regular since the 70s, once told us. Its even suggested that the premiership of one prime minister was hatched here.Only political insiders know for sure whether the IIC is favoured by the current rulers.A longtime member complained that the ham and beef sandwiches had been phased out of the menu many years ago. She complained that as people became more rigid in the world outside, the non-kosher dishes inside went off one by one and today we have a platter called Ghar Jaisa Khana.But the homely platter doesnt deserve such censure. Perhaps no other Delhi restaurant offers such a light touch with their Indian selections. There is judicious use of oil and spices, and no attempt whatsoever is made to make ordinary dishes complicated.Indeed, if art is defined as the celebration of ordinary life, then ordering Ghar Jaisa Khana at the IIC is surely the act of a true snob.Note: If, like us, you have long been denied IIC membership, just latch on to friends who happen to be members."

Well, in that case you may want to head to Park Hyatt for their Goan Food Festival which begins from today. If you are thinking whats so special about this food promotion then think about the blend of Portuguese and Konkani flavours. Chef Tanuja from Park Hyatt, Goa presented an eclectic feast of Goan delights that are available both for lunch and dinner for a price of `1,500+ taxes.The reason why most of the dishes by Tanuja seemed much like the way you prepare at home is that she learned the recipes from her mother. Thats how Goan Dal Fry prepared with coconut, red lentils, onions, curry leaves and mustard seeds which tasted really well with steamed rice and succulent pieces of Mutton Vindaloo cooked in a red tangy curry.The Chicken Cafreal won our hearts with its green marination of coriander and mint cooked with other spices. The condiments had seeped into the chicken pieces making them succulent-juicy. We recommend Caldo Verde: the potato soup with baby spinach in which the addition of green olives is very Portuguese. Cap your meal with Mangane: lentil and sago pudding prepared in milk with jaggery and coconut. The festival is on at The Dining Room till January 21."

5b2e7bc59855b72640115e46,Reimagining the way we celebrate,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/653980/reimagining-way-we-celebrate.html,2018-01-15,"Our country rejoices in the various festivals that dot its almanac. India with many 'countries' within it, celebrates state, community-specific and national festivals which revolve around nature, harvest seasons, and events in our epics, legends, and the lives of gods and goddesses.Thus, Onam, the state festival of Kerala coincides with the harvest season and the legendary annual visit of its benevolent king, Mahabali from the netherworld. So, too, Pongal of Tamil Nadu. While Ganesh Chaturthi celebrates the arrival of Ganesha on earth, Deepavali (a row of lights) marks the killing of demon Narakasura; and in the North, it symbolises the return of Lord Rama to his kingdom after a 14-year exile (vanvas).The Sanskrit word ""utsava"" (causing growth) comprises various activities like worship, charity, fasting, feasting, vigil, offerings etc.Hinduism being a way of life, our customs, rituals and festivals are in sync with thankful co-existence with nature and surroundings. The Deepavali spring cleaning of the house is a pest control and cleaning measure and the ritualistic oil bath, a symbolic beauty treatment for the winter skin, while the ""panaka"" (jaggery-spices drink ) and ""kosambari"" (cucumber-lentil salad) distributed during Ram Navami, a coolant during the summer months.Time has aberrated our festivals like all other aspects of society. As ostentatiousness and splurge replace their fervour and spirit, festivals are more of community affairs than the sweet, simple family affairs they were, spilling them literally into streets, cities, star hotels and resorts.Festival pandals mushrooming everywhere block traffic for days, the waste generated litter the place for weeks together and the loud music pollutes the locality. Thanks to migration, today we celebrate not only our region-specific festivals but those of our neighbours, too.While our festivals are fascinating, their aftermath not really so! They add up 1,000-4,200 tonnes of daily garbage with 15-20% of it constituting flowers, coconut fronds, leaves, banana saplings, plastics etc. Immersion of the worshipped idols pollute water bodies with their chemicals and choke the marine life they support.Garbage disposal, a simple daily household routine in our backyards has now shifted to the front. Under the household's inbuilt garbage management system, overripe fruit and vegetables went into kitchen gardens, extra food was consumed by domestic help or beggars, garden waste was turned into fuel, kitchen waste was fodder, and the rest was taken care of by birds or turned into compost. Festival waste was 'sacred' and dumped under trees, which eventually turned into manure.India topped the world with 25 lakh pollution deaths, (18 lakh due to air pollution) in 2015 and has the worst average ambient (outdoor) pollution level. Yet, fireworks are synonyms for our festivals. Besides respiratory and other ailments that are caused by the air that they pollute, the ear-splitting noise causes misery to animals (as it magnifies manifold for them), the sick and the old.Responsible celebrationUnder the present scenario, a redefinition of the way we celebrate our festivals is imperative where the keyword should be 'responsible celebration'. Here are a few suggestions.The prohibitive cost of eco-friendly idols keeps people away from them. A family that shaped its own eco-friendly clay festival idols is worth emulating. Crash courses in clay modelling would encourage many more.Immersing household idols in small tanks, drums and vessels and using this water for gardens.Worshipping metal idols and ceremoniously cleaning them.Vermiculture and composting deal with festival waste productively. A temple helps turn out agarbattis with used flowers providing livelihood to some.A few open spaces in every locality allotted for fireworks display would reduce its ill effect on society. Light displays practised in foreign countries are alluring as well as a cleaner way of ushering in festivals. Several Tamil Nadu villages have been celebrating silent Deepavalis since decades to protect the bird sanctuaries and bats around. The recent Supreme Court decision made Delhi support and observe clean festivals, too.Exchange of sweets and visits with neighbours and friends were very much a part of festivals in the past. Bring back human warmth into your interactions and the lives of the unfortunate, sick and lonely by reaching out to them."

5aeb11629855b73f522c68e7,The Unfailing Companionship of Dried Bhakri,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-unfailing-companionship-of-dried-bhakri/story-tMye4hdGRNzdtRPz2ZvZjO.html,2018-01-18,"Between the camel bazaar and the donkey sellers, in front of the giant loudspeakers of the tamasha tents that are all lit up by night, the blazing afternoon sun beats down on rows of bhakris set out to dry. This sea of brown is actually flatbread made from wheat, bajra, and jowar. It reflects the sun, speckling the faces of former chief minister Ashok Chavan , BJP leader Pankaja Munde, and of less recognisable netas adorning refurbished political posters.Foraging is an age-old practice. In most villages, it was customary to keep one bhakri for the cow, one for the dog, and one for the wandering mendicant or tribes- man. The practice is reducing these days, so the vimukta bhatkya jati, or nomadic denotified tribes, use mass gatherings  temple festivals, fairs, bazaar days, election rallies, or wherever thousands are expected to congregate  to collect leftovers from makeshift food stalls. Anything that you may have left on your plate, even that half roti you couldnt finish, is dried in the sun and saved for the long haul.A few hours in the blazing Indian sun wrings the moisture out of the bhakri, making it crisp like a Gujarati khakhra or a biscuit that is fresh out of an oven. This dried version crumbles to the touch, is immune to moisture and fungus, and can last for several months.Depending on the amount of space the nomads have in the saddles of their beasts of burden (donkeys, sheep or goats) they load the dried flatbread into satchels in halves or quarters or crumbs. Nomads carry very little  one tarpaulin each, usually found at gatherings or jatras  but they will carry every morsel of bhakri they can find.Inside the makeshift tents, it is lunch hour, and the tribesmen have been able to beg for some lentils, pitla (thick gravy made out of gram flour) and greens. One man has got a bowl full of chicken curry, with a whole leg piece in it. He generously passes around the gravy but keeps the chicken for himself. The dried bhakris are crumbled into whatever each may have on their plate and mashed with the fingers until it is soft enough to eat. Once soaked, it mashes on the tongue instantly but retains a chewy give. In a more refined form, with some ghee, this would taste like dal baati choorma  a wheat dumpling in lentils.The bhakris accompaniments vary greatly. Some days, the nomads catch mice, a wild boar or a pig, or a farmer may give them a chicken to cook. But they rarely exploit their own livestock for food. They rely on pilgrims and travellers at the jatras wasting food in platefuls, and are rarely let down. Maidans filled with drying bhakris after large gatherings are evidence of this.On most days, the tribesmen drink fermented gruel in the mornings, and stop when they feel the rumblings of hunger. Unlike cows and buffaloes, donkeys and goats can be milked at any time of the day, and nomadic tribes use the milk to wet pieces of bhakri. Some milk is left in clay pots, hundis or dhunis, with vegetables to curdle it into a semi-curd that can form the next meal of the day.If they find a farm in the middle of its cultivation cycle, the farmer may pay them a small fee to park in his field so that the droppings of the livestock can act as fertiliser. He may sometimes give them grain or gravy instead of cash, and allow them to light a fire -- which means they may eat fresh food today. When they cook, they pound the grain coarsely and fashion it into thick bhakris over a low flame, baking them till they turn a light pink. This minimises the moisture content, allowing the bhakris to be stored when everyone has eaten.When they travel into the forests, says Hema Patil, food lab coordinator of the Gian Sanstha of the Society for Research and Initiatives for Sustainable Technologies, associated with the Honeybee Project of IIM, Ahmedabad, the tribes chew the dried bhakri pieces with raw and tender pink-tinged leaves of the jamun, mango or moringa trees. They also carry a chutney made from garlic and dried red chillies. The chutney provokes a flow of saliva when there is no other liquid available for the bhakris. Onions and green chillies, where available, also perform this vital function. When there is nothing, they eat the bhakris by softening them with water.As nomads roam from forest to farm, village to town, their dwelling is a random happenstance, a space where the tarpaulin may hang. Food is never taken for granted. The nomad has just one wish -- give us this day our daily dried bread.Bhakri recipe: GhasyoTeekar, on the far end of the Rann of Kutch, is called Suryasth Bharat the edge where the Indian sun sets. Beyond it is Pakistan, where the sun possibly never rises. The tribes dont count its sunsets. The tribes of this arid and barren landscape carry this recipe  ghasyo -- with them.Wheat or bajra is ground to flour and heated on a very low flame in a dry kadhai or on a griddle until it turns pinkish red. This should take 10-15minutes. It is cooled and carried for long period and is typically eaten with jaggery and ghee. It can be premixed with ghee and jaggery and two spoons are consumed with milk, buttermilk or water. It is referred to instant roti as it is said to form a sweet bread inside the stomach.What are Vimukta Jatis or Denotified Tribes?Vimukta Jaatis are the former Criminal Tribes of India, so notified by the British colonial powers. The label includes the Bhatkya Jatis or nomadic tribes. In 1871, a large section of tribes were labelled criminal by birth under the Criminal Tribes Act, 1871. The Act impacted 13 million people by 1911 and its scope was expanded throughout the 1920s, to cover 313 nomadic tribes and 198 de-notified tribes, a total of 60 million people.The National Commission for De-notified, Nomadic and Semi Nomadic Tribes (NCDNSNT), constituted in 2005 noted that forest laws played a role in displacing these tribes, causing many to be so labelled for protesting eviction from forests and foraging lands to make way for the British railway, roads, and mining projects. The tribes under the act were required to notify the police if they entered settlements, which led to police brutality and superstition surrounding them, not to mention downright exclusion from social progress. The jaat panchayats became their only source of community redressal and justice. In 1950, the list of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes was released.In 1952, the Ayyangar Committee Report repealed the Criminal Tribes Act of 1871 throughout India and enacted Habitual Offenders Act 1952. This Act was recommended for repealing by the Renke Commission in 2008, but has so far not been withdrawn. Today, several tribes have been included under the SC/ST/OBC reservation quotas. Plans are afoot by the current Union Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to repeal even this classification in 2018."

Picture by Bishwarup DuttaCalcutta: A centuries-old Bengali tradition associated with the goddess of wisdom has come wrapped in plastic, customised for small families, in the run-up to this year's Saraswati Puja.On the day after Panchami, a large section of Bengali kitchens - mostly Ghotis - make a steamed dish of uncut mixed vegetables and lentil, popularly known as Gota Seddho (uncut and boiled).The vegetables used include baby potatoes, brinjals, green peas, spinach with buds and flower, sweet potatoes and flat beans among others.Customised baskets with all these items are available at Spencer's stores across the city from Friday. Each basket costs Rs 120 and should serve four to five people, Kaushik Ganguly, head of operations (east), Spencer's Retail, said.""Saraswati Puja dates back to thousands of years, like the Bengali race. She first appears in the Rig Veda. But there is no mention of the steamed vegetable dish in any scripture. Like many other rituals, it probably made its way into the tradition because of evolving local culture,"" author Mani Shankar Mukherjee, better known as Shankar, said.Similarly, for people with roots in Bangladesh, there is a ritual of cooking two hilsas on Saraswati Puja.""Bengalis are famous for neatly peeling and chopping vegetables. But in doing so, the nutritional value of the vegetables gets diminished. Whole vegetables discount that possibility,"" Mukherjee, associated with the RP-Sanjiv Goenka Group that owns Spencer's, said.The steamed dish made from fresh vegetables was prescribed to counter pox, he said. In the absence of vaccines, pox was one of the deadliest diseases and killed thousands.Durga and Kali pujas are synonymous with Calcutta. But the number of Saraswati Puja is far more.The 25 Spencer's outlets have a footfall of close to 2 million a month, Ganguly said. The ""Saraswati Ayojan"" is an attempt to weave local traditions into the retail chain's bouquet, he said."

Speaking to The Hindu about diabetes and its management, Dr. Misra says his new book is an educative guide that teaches readers about how diabetes can affect mental, emotional and physical well being but can be prevented or managed through some simple, methodical stepsWhat is the magnitude of diabetes problem in India, more specifically in Delhi?Currently, 82 million people in India are affected due to diabetes and the number is expected to rise to 151 million by 2045. In a 2015 study, it was estimated that around a quarter of Delhis population suffers from some form of diabetes and around 48% from pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance).What does your book talk about?Before this book, patients obtained knowledge and education about diabetes from physicians and the Internet. Physicians do not have enough time to educate patients and the Internet often provides confusing and wrong information.Further, most of this information is derived from sources in the United States and the United Kingdom, which is often not applicable to Indian patients. An India-specific information source for management of diabetes was needed and is provided by this book. Diet, exercise and management techniques in the book are tailored towards Indian patients, based on research done by our and other groups in India.How is it helpful for the common man?Besides giving comprehensive information about diabetes, the book also informs readers about solutions to common problems that patients face. For example, what to do in case a patient develops nausea, vomiting or fever? What drugs to take when travelling to the hills? What if a diabetic person plays competitive sports? This book answers scores of questions on diabetes and has a list of frequently asked questions for quick reference. The book has photographs and diagrams to better explain exercises or insulin-injection techniques. This book also gives healthy food recipes and a sustainable diet plan. Knowledge about these issues can empower patients and their relatives to manage diabetes. The book is also apt for nutritionists, lifestyle coaches and physicians.Are there ways to prevent diabetes?With modest weight loss (around 7-10% of ideal body weight), physical activity (at least 60 minutes a day) and proper diet, onset of diabetes can be prevented or delayed.For those who are morbidly obese, massive weight loss can reverse diabetes, as has been shown with application of bariatric surgery. Type-2 diabetes is often preventable by simple lifestyle changes. Keep your weight in its ideal range, exercising regularly and eat a balanced diet in small meals with intermittent snacks, which should include whole grains. Avoid sugary drinks and over refined grains.Choose good fats instead of bad fats. Polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats in olive, canola and mustard oils can help ward off Type-2 diabetes.Limit intake of red meat and avoid processed meat. Nuts, seeds, beans, masoor dal, lobia, sprouts, tofu, or poultry are much more healthy sources of protein. Also add two servings each of green leafy vegetables and fruits.What are the rules to help prevent diabetes in children?Prevention of obesity and Type-2 diabetes in children requires systematic and focused approach involving not only the child, but also the parents and peers. You need individualised dietary counselling for balanced diets and must maintain normal body weight from early age. It is important that children/adolescents be encouraged to include at least 60 minutes of moderate intensity outdoor physical activity/sports daily. Discourage time spent watching TV or playing computer games. Parents should try to set an example by themselves exercising regularly. They should share at least one meal with the children and should accompany them to parks and play with them. Group/community must encourage participation in physical activity. Fitness centres, courts for basketball and badminton, playgrounds for hockey and skating, and parks for jogging and walking should be made more accessible. Regular health check-ups should also be done at least once a year. During this visit, the doctor should calculate the childs Body Mass Index and counsel parents if it is above the normal range.What is the proportion of women affected by diabetes?The prevalence of diabetes for women 20-79 years is estimated to be 8.4%, which is slightly lower than among men (9.1%). There are about 17.1 million more men than women with diabetes (221.0 million men against 203.9 million women). Going by the current trend, they will outnumber men in diabetes soon. There are a number of factors responsible for this. Many studies show that girls in India are getting obese and show more metabolic syndrome  clustering of risk factors such as high sugar, blood pressure, deranged lipids  as compared to males. Other factors include weight gain after pregnancy, post-menopausal hormonal changes, as well as social and security issues that prevent them from engaging in outdoor activities and exercises.What are the essential tips to manage diabetes?Making patients understand the importance of correct diet and exercise throughout their life. Enhancing awareness about the importance of scientific treatment and its compliance, which can prevent complications, disability and death. Providing good education to prevent long-term diabetes complications. Regular physical examination and check ups to detect early damage. Maintain positive outlook even if disease is complicated. Maintain disciplined lifestyle.The diet, exercise and management techniques in the book are tailored towards Indian patients, based on research done by our, and other, groups in IndiaAnoop MisraFortis C-Doc chairman"
5aeaf5de9855b73f522c53f0,Farm Dissent Poses Huge Threat for BJP,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farm-dissent-poses-huge-threat-for-bjp-in-upcoming-elections/story-Ww3t1Y4TVDyjJQ2BQp93GM.html,2018-01-23,"Dressed like a farmer himself, a taupe shawl drawn over his shoulders, former finance minister Yashwant Sinha, a sort of rebel-within the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), let out a throaty war cry at a farmers rally in Madhya Pradeshs Narsinghpur on January 11.Those in the seat of power mustnt think we are small in numbers and inconsequential. We will force those in power to bow down. Well shake things up. Well unseat them.Madhya Pradesh  which promotes itself as the heart of India and is home to the Pench national park, the setting of Rudyard Kiplings Jungle Book  has seen some stupendous farm growth rates. But the states image of being a hub of rural prosperity fell apart in June 2017, when the central city of Mandsaur became the flashpoint of violent protests.Angry over falling prices of their produce, farmers announced a 10-day siege in cities such as Sehore, Bhopal and Indore. Five farmers of the Patidar caste, the community behind the campaign against the BJP government in Gujarat, died in police firing in Mandsaur, a wealthy belt that grows legally-sanctioned opium, wheat, soyabean, oilseeds and lentils.A rough patch in Indias agriculture has thrust the rural economy and farmers issue on to the political centre stage, posing a key political risk in BJP-ruled states. Three of them  Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Chhattisgarh  will face elections this year.Agrarian distress was responsible for the BJPs diminished rural tally in the Gujarat elections last month. With farm issues back on the national radar, the BJP is watching out for the possibility of rural dissatisfaction-fuelled anti-incumbency shaking its formidable rural-support base.Nearly 72.4% of Madhya Pradeshs population is rural. About 49% of land-owning farmers had voted the ruling NDA in the 2014 general election, according to data from Lokniti. The BJP-led formation had also won the support of a third of landless tenant cultivators.Across states, falling rural incomes due to a combination of unfavourable global factors, bad weather and unprofitable prices has spawned a new wave of protests. There is a near consensus around two key demands. First, farmers want assured returns that are 1.5 times the cultivation costs, which translate into a 50% profit. Second, they want a complete write-off of all farmers loans. The first demand isnt hard to justify  it was, after all, part of the BJPs official poll manifesto in 2014. The Modi government has also declared that it will double farmers income in six years.One of our sister organisations in Punjab went to court seeking an implementation of this promise (50% profits). In its response in an affidavit in January 2015, the Modi government has said it was not in a position to do so. This is cheating, said Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakaji, one of the main leaders behind the 10-day Mandsaur agitation and the chief of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangaha. He was arrested during the Mandsaur crackdown.Kakaji was referring to the Centres response in February 2015 to a plea filed by the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association. In it, the Centre said a mec- hanical linkage between MSP and cost of production may be counter-productive. The Centre said a 50% hike on MSP on cost may distort the market, Chengal Reddy, the petitioner, told HT. Sharmas colleague Binod Anand says the organisation has set February 1 as the deadli- ne for the government to meet its dem- ands. The next stop: a protest in Delhis Jantar Mantar on February 23, he says.Madhya Pradeshs farm fortunes began dipping in 2013-14, when farm GDP contracted 1.14% due to a drought. The next year, farm growth rose 4.6% but slowed again to 1.7% in 2015-16. In 2016-17, growth shot up 22.39%, the result of a statistical base effect due to poor growth the previous years and a bumper harvest. However, disruptions caused by demonetisation and the implementation of the goods and services tax meant prices crashed.The state is looking to stem rural angst with a slew of sops. This includes an unprecedented flagship scheme, Mukhya Mantri Bhavantar Bhugtaan Yojana, to directly pay farmers a part of the prices they fail to recover for their produce from the markets, something never tried before in the country. But farmer organisations have made it the main target of their attacks.The scheme pays only the difference between the prevailing modal price of a crop and what farmers manage to sell for. The modal price of a crop denotes the price level at which a majority of transactions take place. It therefore serves as an average price. It doesnt pay the higher minimum support prices, or the floor price, set by the Centre. Farm leaders allege the scheme benefits traders more than farmers. Farmers organisations that came together in the aftermath of the Mandsaur protests are preparing for a fresh spell of agitation in the year ahead. Sinha, a detractor of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has promised his support and time to them.The Gadarwara rally attended by Sinha and former Union farm minister Sompal Shastri, who doesnt belong to any party now, was called to highlight the plight of farmers nearby whose land was acquired for a power plant.New-age tacticsThe issues may be rooted in agricultural prices but the battle in Madhya Pradesh is a political one. Anand claims they arent fighting on partisan lines and its difficult to predict what political impact their movement will have in Madhya Pradeshs elections. But leaders of many political parties are in touch with us, he admitted.The Harda-based Aam Kisan Unio is however open about bringing about a regime change if the current government doesnt accept its demand.One of its leaders, Kedar Shankar Sirohi, is a social-media savvy activist who has a Bachelors degree in agriculture and a Masters in agricultural economics. Sirohi says he founded his organisation in 2011 to create an independent, apolitical farmers union as some of the bigger farmer groups were directly affiliated to either the Congress or the BJP.We are non-party but we are not non-political, Sirohi, a farmer who grows wheat and soyabean, in his Harda farm says. Asked to explain his intriguing comment, Sirohi says farmers issues need political solutions. In this new-age farmer mobilisation, social media is a handy tool.When the Mandsaur agitation happened, Sirohi says, the chief minister (Shivraj Singh Chouhan) pointed to jeans-clad protesters to say they werent real farmers. He doesnt know how young farmers look. Today, farmers have one hand on their steering wheel and the other on the mobile (phone).Catchy sloganeering on Facebook and WhatsApp is drafting support. Those who live by the sword die by it. This is a government of slogans and social media, and we will discredit it through social media and slogans, Sirohi says.The Aam Kisan Union has attacked the Bhavantar price-deficit payment scheme as byapariyon ka poshan, kisano ka soshan or nourishment for traders, exploitation of farmers. Our slogan is catchier, laughs Bhopal-based Irfan Jafri, a farm leader who runs the Kisan Jagriti Sangathan. We are calling the scheme election ka collection.Sirohi says joblessness among educated children of farmers has become a major social anxiety. Its delaying marriages, he says. I am a farmer, but our children dont want to do farming. This election could be worse than Gujarat for the BJP, says Anand Bajaj, a well-off farmer from Devas.Sirohi and his colleagues have started an online campaign, asking farmers to stop making loan repayments. They are calling it a non-cooperation movement. Every farmer who enrols has to display a slogan on his house walls, pledging his support. Jafri has posted a picture on WhatsApp of 30-year-old Chain Singh Lodhi from Raisen districts Jamunia village standing next to his house with a pledge written in bold, blue paint that has been widely forwarded.The farmers seem confident about their political strategy. Sirohi says concentrating on electoral seats where the BJP is entrenched would be a waste of time. Of the 230 seats, the BJP wins by a small margin is about 60-70 seats. Thats where we will put up our fight."

The platter was generous compared to the one last winter, he said.Until last year, I had to finish my work and then look for food stalls near the station. Then again, only a few offered complete meals for 15 or less. It was all that I could afford, said Amit, who hails from Sawastipur in Bihar and earns a daily wage that varies between 50 and 60.There were days when I had to sleep on an empty stomach, especially during festivals. However, the food on offer at the night shelters this year has reduced my worries considerably. I have an assured meal after a hard days work and can I sleep here. It helps me recover from stress and work better, Amit said.Amit is among the many homeless people in the city who have benefitted from the free meals provided by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) at night shelters this year.During a visit to night shelters at Bhim Nagar and the railway station, this reporter received positive feedback from occupants about the free breakfast and dinner. They said that the facilities at these shelters have also improved significantly since last year.Last season, the Hindustan Times highlighted the appalling provisions at night shelters which made the administration take corrective measures before the winter set in.Barring the absence of geysers at the Bhim Nagar night shelter, issues such as non-functional toilets, seepage, wet mattresses, unhygienic conditions, and inadequate drinking water facilities were found to be rectified at the night shelters this time around.Read I Officials take stock of provisions at Gurgaons night sheltersHarinder Kumar, who is among the many people who were recently moved from the railway station platforms to the nearby night shelter, said, Earlier, I would examine all the food stalls around the railway station and pick out the one which served the cheapest meal. Often, my luck would run out as the food at the stalls will run out or the stall owner would not show.Kumar, who hails from Rajasthan and works for a daily wage, is deeply appreciative of the free meal initiative. The new initiative of free food at the night shelter not only gives me an assured meal, but also helps me save money; I can now eat two meals instead of one, he said.The free food service was announced by deputy mayor Sunita Yadav on January 11. Two social welfare organizations transport the food from several home kitchens to the night shelters spread across the city, and the MCG serves it.We received a generous offer from several social welfare organisations; they provide food to the MCG and we then serve the same to those seeking refuge at the night shelters. It is our duty to ensure that facilities are optimum, the MCG commissioner V Umashankar said.Since the (free food) initiative was proposed, residents and social welfare organizations came forward wanting to be a part of this setup. According to our estimates, we ask them to prepare a plate of food, which costs around Rs40 per person, for 250 people. Cumulatively, the cost comes to Rs10,000, Mahender Singh, project officer of MCG said.Singh said the MCG plans five days in advance to ensure they do not run out of ration.Dinner at the night shelters is provided starting 7.30pm; caretakers even reserve food for latecomers. For breakfast, all shelters offer a standard snack of tea, biscuits and bread.BOX: A refuge for the homelessNo. of homeless: 1,500+*No. of permanent night shelters: 3 at Bhim Nagar, Kanhai Village, and Sheetla Mata templeHousing capacity: 75 each; 225 in allNo. of portable night shelters: 7 at Rajiv Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Basai Chowk, Gurgaon railway station, Vatika Chowk, Sector 14 part-II and Mahavir ChowkHousing capacity: 12 in each; 84 in allSize of portable night shelter: 10 feet high and 28 feet wide* According to an estimated by the Red Cross Society"

We used to call it the Punjab of the south, especially in fashion and even in foodI think consumption (in Hyderabad) is much, much more than the rest of the country. I would say it compares to the north the per capita consumption is far higher than any other statewe have always been very successful hereits an interesting consumer market, he said.Hyderabad has always been an ideal testing ground for the group thanks to its been a market of firsts for the Future Group with most of its formats like Pantaloons, Big Bazaar and Central coming up first in the city, he said adding that was the primary reason they zeroed in on Hyderabad when they decided to embark on a journey to take up 10 cities to connect with and win the minds and hearts of consumers to build marketshare.Talking about the newly launched sona masoori rice offering, a variety that is primarily consumed in the south markets, he said the group wants to make sona masoori rice South Indias answer to Basmati rice that has been glorified too much.He said apart from retailing sona masoori rice, for which the group has set up a dedicated processing mill in Karnataka, through the Golden Harvest brand, the group is also planning to launch it under the Shubhra brandname in the north markets.He also said the group is looking at expanding its Heritage Fresh chain, which it acquired from Hyderabad-based Heritage group that is promoted by the kin of Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu, from the 60-odd stores to about 150 by next year, primarily in Hyderabad and its outskirts.Biyani also announced that Future Group has roped in Rana Daggubatis Suresh Productions for making television commercials and conducting events like food festivals and fashion shows as part of its high-decibel consumer engagement strategy."
5aeaec859855b73f522c4d38,JAMA Masjid: ASI Begins Repair Work,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asi-begins-repair-work-on-jama-masjid/story-6SvloNOxYm8uDua5InxF4K.html,2018-01-25,"The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) has finally started repairing the cracks in the central dome of the iconic Jama Masjid, the 362-year-old mosque in the heart of old Delhi, officials involved with the restoration work said on Wednesday.A team from the ASI, the national watchdog of heritage monuments, has started preparing the traditional lime mortar that was used in the buildings during the Mughal period between the 16th and 19th centuries. The agency has also created pits at the site for lime slacking, where it will remain soaked for at least two weeks. The work to fill up the cracks is scheduled to begin in the third week of February, the officials said.The ASIs action stems from a ground report in the Hindustan Times on December 14, 2017 that revealed that the Jama Masjid was in an urgent need of repair because parts of its facade and internal structure were crumbling (see box).Though the mosque is not protected by ASI, the agency will do the required job, Mahesh Sharma, the Union minister of culture and tourism said.The Delhi Wakf Board (DWB), the original custodian of the mosque, had expressed its inability to carry out the repair work because of lack of funds and expertise.As HT had reported in December, portions of the eaves of all four chhattris (dome-shaped pavilions) of the mosque had started chipping. Several marble finials on the smaller domes on the northern and southern gates had fallen, and the large pinnacle on the central dome had tilted. The Shahi Imam of the Masjid, Syed Ahmed Bukhari, said he had written to the Prime Ministers office and the ASI in 2016, seeking help for repair.A day after the HT report, teams from the ASI, the DWB, the divisional commissioners office, and the District Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) had inspected the damage.A senior official involved in the restoration said the work at Jama Masjid would speed up after Republic Day. More raw materials will be sent to the site after January 26. Construction workers will first put scaffolding around the central dome, which has major fracture signs. Hopefully, the masonry work will commence within a month, said the official, who asked not to be named because he is not authorised to speak to the media.To maintain the original look while strengthening the building, the mortar ingredients will include surkhi (ground red brick), bel giri (wood apple), gud (jaggery), gaund (gum), urad dal (white lentil), and batasha (sugar candy), another official said.According to Tariq Bukhari, general secretary of the Jama Masjid Advisory Council (JMAC), which manages the mosques daily affairs, the central dome of the principal prayer hall is the worst affected, with white seepage marks clearly visible on it. Rampant water leakage has developed cracks in the main bulbous domes that are further eroding the monuments structural integrity. The seepage has peeled layers of sandstone and plaster from some of the walls and loosened some of the intricate parapet carvings.The ASI had been maintaining and restoring the structure under a special arrangement since 1956. It last worked on the mosque in 2007, when the missing inlay work and the internal water system were restored.The construction of the Jama Masjid, originally named Masjid-i Jahan Numa, started in 1648 as the centerpiece of Shahjahanabad. It took six years to build and cost R10 lakh at the time.The masjid is visited by an average of 5,000 tourists and 1,000 worshippers every day."

Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana led by Raju Shetti had parted ways with the BJP on demand of MSP. MSP was also the main plank at Opposition rallies  as also Maratha protests for reservation and farmers unrest  in the state.The decision to extend the MSP to all kharif cropsis truly historic. It would be a step towards economic empowerment of farmers and higher growth in rural economy, which would have a positive impact on the overall Gross State Domestic Product, Fadnavis said while talking to the media. The state had earlier said legislation would be brought in to make non-complaince to MSP a punishable offence.At present, MSP is confined to select farm produce such as paddy (Rs 1,470), jowar (Rs 1,625), wheat (Rs 1,625), maize (Rs 1,365), bajra (Rs 1,330), gram (Rs 4,000), tur (Rs 5,050), moong (Rs 5,225), sunflower (Rs 3,950), soybean (Rs 2,775), groundnut (Rs 4,220), cotton (Rs 4,160), masoor (Rs 3,900), ragi (Rs 1,725), sesame (Rs 5,000), niger seed (Rs 3,825) and mustard (Rs 3,700).The state government has already implemented the reforms in the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) to facilitate farmers to sell their goods in the open market. But it was confronted with two major challenges related to MSP and higher institutional credit.Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said: MSP was our long-standing demand. But unless it is implemented and brings benefits to farmers, it would prove futile.Raju Shetti said: The government must ensure that MSP is not misused by traders at the cost of farmers. It must serve the small and poor farmers.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5b1397f29855b762ecebd867,Style and substance,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/style-and-substance/article22639733.ece,2018-02-03,"As the culinary landscape is changing at a fast pace, it becomes imperative for iconic restaurants, which represent food and heritage of the city, to stand out. Varq, the landmark restaurant at The Taj Mahal Hotel, which is the go to place for gourmets who want to try the latest in Indian cuisine, is now bracing for a change. Its culinary journey which started from Haveli led to the transformation of how Indian food is prepared, presented and perceived. One of the first to hone the concept of pre-plated Indian food, Varq has contributed in reinvention of modern Indian gourmet dining.Celebrating ten years of its existence, it wants to attract new age patrons, who want a nice blend of taste and health in their food.At the media table, the eight-course lunch had an array of innovative offerings. And as always, taste of the food one has grown up eating came back to haunt. For Arun Sundararaj, Executive Chef, who grew up eating authentic Malayali cuisine in Kerala, it is an inspiration to do better each time he steps into the kitchen. Some of his dishes, including the wholesome North Indian tandoori dishes or even delectable Japanese ones have been tweaked to lend a Southern flavour with its aromatic spices.Therefore, it came as no surprise that the first dish of the meal was created keeping the international traveller in mind. In appearance, Rava upma sushi looked similar to the Japanese raw fish served at the adjoining Wasabi by Morimoto.Sushi with a twistBut the taste was dissimilar as the chef had given an interesting twist to it. It had varied flavours of curry leaves, spices and batter used in upma. It was wholesome as the rice was substituted by wheat. Semolina wheat, another healthier options, was also used.Describing Rava upma sushi as a distinct dish, Sundararaj said: As we all know upma is a staple food in Southern part of India and is usually consumed for breakfast, here I wanted to think of something more innovative. Hence it took the presentation and form of a sushi. For taste, it has flavours of pickle called gongura or sorrel leaf of Andhra Pradesh.The food was prepared keeping in mind the health conscious guest by using different varieties of grains like millets, barley, black rice, buck wheat and raagi flour. Healthier cooking techniques like dehydrating spices, vegetables and fruits were used.Every dish re-emphasised that appearances are deceptive. Drumstick soup was surely an appetiser; it looked like regular coffee except that it was prepared by cooking drumstick leaves and yellow lentils together with pepper corn and herbs like coriander root and curry leaves.Another innovation came in the form of Murg methi malai souffle. It was creamy chicken at its yummiest best. It was an amalgamation of avian meat and fenugreek, in which the taste of chicken was exceptional even though one had an apprehension of flavour of methi overpowering that of meat. Here, chicken was sobered down in the sense that it did not have robustness of the Mughlai variant but it was juicier, tender and was made with less chillies. It was indeed difficult to guess which region it originated from.Next came Achari haldi fish tikka; it certainly was for those with refined palette. Unlike its popular image, it was light on spices and the best part was the touch and go of organic turmeric pickle which made it all the more delectable.For me dish of the day was the duck confit, which had the right ingredients. As duck has taste of its own; there was no generous use of spices. And the portions were tender and just right for the main course. It was inspired by the cooking methodology of Syrian Christians of Kerala. It had the flavour of distinct flavour of cinnamon, cardamom, black pepper, cloves and curry leaves.Explaining the process, Chef Sundararaj said: Firstly, the spices are boiled and then powdered, marinated with duck using coconut oil, ghee, cooking oil, ginger, green chilli. Kept overnight, they are cooked with shallots, curry leaves and powdered spices. It is very important to cook the duck on slow fire for three hours so as to soften the meat.The meal underlined that healthier options can go hand in hand with rich textures of Indian delicacies.It is very important to cook the duck on slow fire for three hours so as to soften the meatArun Sundararaj"

On the strength of their yields from the land, the four women joined hands with Aswathy, another Kudumbasree member, to set up a micro-enterprise that produces organic fertilizers, pesticides, and compost.Despite initial hiccups, it has been good going for the JLG, so much so that they have returned an initial bank loan of Rs. 2 lakh, and been given a fresh loan for the same amount. We have had no losses, though all the cultivation is done organically, Ms. Sathi says.Besides 70 cents of land owned by Ms. Sathi, they have taken land on lease too to grow crops. Though part of Kudumbasree for four years, Ms. Sathi has been cultivating crops for only a year-and-a half. We enquired with the panchayat authorities, and were told about starting the JLG. I teamed up with other like-minded women. My husband and family members too help. Today, what we grow meets most of our needs. We also sell our produce at the weekly market in Malayinkeezhu and at Kudumbasree festivals and the like.Motivation. Not everyone is cooperative, especially when it comes to sharing water. Then there are people who are dismissive of women doing something like this. The support given by panchayat president Chandran Nair and Krishi Bhavan official Chithra motivates us.The women have also been feted for their work. We have received awards from the Kudumbasree State and district mission, the panchayat, and the Krishi Bhavan, besides an incentive from the district mission.Ms. Sathi and the others have now sown lentils such as green gram and black gram.Asked whether their success has spurred other womens groups to take up farming, Ms. Sathi says there have not been many.Samruddhi, which means prosperity, has proved that a return to agriculture is possible. All that is required is a will."

Jasbir Malhi Arshdeep Singh shows the gold medal to his father Darshan Singh, mother Baljit Kaur and sister Gurleen Kaur at their Kharar home on Tuesday. Jasbir MalhiON TUESDAY morning, as Indian U-19 speedster Arshdeep Singh returned to his Kharar home after attending the BCCI dinner hosted for the U-19 World Champions in Mumbai on Monday night, the 19-year-old Punjab cricketer asked his parents to pack his kit. The 6 foot, 2 inch tall pacer, who played two matches and picked up three wickets in the U-19 World Cup in New Zealand, will be donning the Punjab colours for the BCCI U-23 ODI League quarterfinals to be played in Kanpur from February 9 and the brief stay with his parents saw Arshdeep attending some functions.It feels great to be part of the U-19 World Cup winning team. Even though I got a chance to bowl in two matches, it was a moment to remember for me. Playing under captain Prithvi Shaw and coach Rahul Dravid was a dream come true for me. I bowled to Prithvi and Shubman Gill at the nets when I was not playing and Rahul sir always told me to have patience. Listening to him and understanding how to execute the plans helped my confidence a lot. The only thing which I feared was speaking in English at the team meetings, laughs Arshdeep, who claimed two wickets against Zimbabwe in the group stage apart from picking up one wicket against Papua New Guinea.Arshdeep, whose father, 53-year-old Darshan Singh, is Chief Security Officer with DCM, Ropar, started playing cricket five years ago under coach Jaswant Rai at Guru Nanak Public School and returned with an impressive haul of 19 wickets in five matches in the Punjab Inter-District ODI Championship apart from claiming 13 wickets for Punjab in the Vinoo Mankad Trophy. The youngster showed his fine form, clocking 140 kph while playing for India Red in the Challenger Trophy in December.The U-19 World Cup saw Arshdeep bowling along with fellow pacers Kamlesh Nagarkoti and Shivam Mavi. Before the World Cup, I played in the Youth Asia Cup in Malaysia and it helped my game. Nagarkoti and Mavi bowled in excess of 145 kph in the World Cup and we would discuss about bowling on New Zealand pitches. Our bowling coach, Paras Mhambrey sir, also helped me a lot. I also met the Australian coach, former fast bowler Ryan Harris, which was also a memorable experience. We have reached the quarter-finals in the U-23 League and my aim will be to help Punjab win the title, said the speedster, who turned 19 on Monday.For parents, Darshan Singh and Baljit Kaur, the brief stay meant making preparations for Arshdeeps favourite dish, masur ki daal. When I was posted with CISF as part of CMs security in Chandigarh, Arshdeep showed his interest in cricket. Later, when he would travel for matches, I quit my job since the CISF job was transferrable and joined a private firm in Ropar as it meant that I would stay at Kharar. It was his birthday yesterday and he spent it with his teammates and coaches. The World Cup medal is the biggest reward for us. His elder brother Akashdeep, who studies in Canada, and sister Gurleen Kaur, too, followed his matches, said Darshan.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

So, we have reverted to the earlier practice of providing a choice between tur dal and Canadian yellow lintel, S.

The move paid off as it not only helped in conservation of GIB but also brought more money to the farmers.According to experts, when farmers use pesticides, GIB loses a major portion of its food  insects, locust, lizard among others  and the bird is forced to look for smaller insects in the grains, resulting in damage to the crops.The experiment to adopt organic farming was so encouraging that the foundation and the farmers have decided to apply for an organic certification with the brand name, Ghorad. The GIB is locally known as Ghorad.Initially, I was a bit reluctant when the Corbett Foundation suggested me to go for organic farming. But, when I saw a group of rosy startlet in an adjacent field feeding on insects, I realized its importance. The foundation also assured to compensate me for any possible loss, said Yakub Jatt, a resident of Kunathiya village in Abdasa taluka.Devesh Gadhvi, deputy director of Kutch Ecological Research Centre and a member of the State Bustard Conservation Committee , said, We realized that 70% of the food for the GIB during the breeding season were the insects in the agriculture fields and the pesticides were killing them. We then persuaded the farmers not to use pesticides and an experiment was undertaken in a small area. The results were very encouraging. The farmers were able to produce around 700kg of moong.With some publicity on social media, the 700kg of moong was sold off in two days and the farmers who were getting around Rs 45 per kg in the open market were able to garner Rs 70 per kg. We still have orders for another 6,000kg. Encouraged by the results, several other farmers join us. This time, we expect around 50-odd farmers to join the initiative, said Gadhvi.According to Gadhvi, 20 other threatened species of birds are found in the area. All these birds feed on insects."

There is little consumption of vegetables, fruits, meat, fish, egg, or milk, the study said. Other commodities like lentil, spices, and salt are available at the SupplyCo store, which is far away. And, people use the facility less frequently.It was also found that 86.3% of the population were anaemic. Among women, 95.9% had anaemia.. A major expense is for health care services, for which they shell out nearly Rs. 500 for a trip to the nearest Primary Health Centre (PHC). While, the government offers reimbursement to tribal population for treatment expenses, it is not properly executed. Bureaucratic hurdles apart, there are instances of people pocketing the money for alcohol abuse, said Dr. Rakesh P.S. of Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences, who was associated with the study. Water scarcity is severe. Most resources start drying up by February. While there is little awareness about communicable and non-communicable diseases, the womenfolk are aware of the need for breast feeding of infants for the first six months.Incidentally, the cultural practices during mensuration and post-natal periods make many women take to oral contraceptives frequently. It was found that while youngsters had evolved a new culture of taking oral pills to avoid being into what is known as Valayma Kudi, they did not want to go easy on traditions. It shows that an intervention could be possible by educated people in the hamlets, said Dr. Numpelil."

Of the 23 promises he made in a 50-minute speech, two big ones stood out  Rs 200 bonus for wheat and paddy and a tweaking of the popular Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana to offer free warehousing to farmers.The big announcement comes 12 days before the Mungaoli and Kolaras bypolls. Going by the scale of it, it will be difficult for the CM to outdo it over the next nine months till the state polls. Even sharecroppers will now get all benefits, and can rent out farmland for five years.We will give a bonus of Rs 200 per quintal on procurement price of wheat and paddy for 2016-17 under the CM Agriculture Productivity Scheme. I announce Rs 200 per quintal as bonus on wheat and paddy to compensate the loss borne by farmers. Not only this, the government will procure wheat and paddy at MSP of Rs 2,000 per quintal, Chouhan announced at a Kisan Sammelan at Jamburi Maidan. Well turn the ravines of Chambal into lush green farmland at an expense of Rs 1,200 crore and provide land to landless and small-time farmers.The gathering was called to disburse Rs 620 crore to to 3.98 lakh Bhavantar beneficiaries, but the CM turned it into an election rally  covering nearly aspect of farming, from loans and storage and irrigation and sharecropping. Returning to the mike thrice to reiterate his promises and even included compensation for crop damage in Sundays surprise hailstorm.Though the chief minister did not reveal the budgetary allocation for the sops, sources said provisions would be made in the Budget for the year 2018-19. Rabi crop will be procured at much higher rates than the previous year, he promised, extending the Bhavantar benefits to onion, gram, lentil and mustard. Last year, wheat was procured at Rs 1,725 per quintal. This year, it will be hiked to Rs 2,000. MSP for paddy, too, would be increased in the coming season, Chouhan said.Always in his elements in the company of farmers, he threw open the Bhavantar change to the gathering. Only if you agree, we will make this change. Do you say yes, he asked. Yes, the crowd roared back. We have made a few changes in Bhavantar. Farmers can now store their crop in warehouses if they feel they are not getting adequate return of their crop and could make more from the market after a few months. The government will provide warehouse facility to them for free for four months and will also allow them to take 25% loan of the total cost of the produce on zero interest. The government will pay interest on their behalf, said Chouhan.If farmers dont get MSP after four months, the government will purchase their crop under BBY, the CM announced. We have decided to provide financial support to farmers. The government will open 1,000 custom processing and service centres, one in each block, he added. Grading and packaging plants will be set in 50 agriculture markets, Kisan Credit Card converted into Rupee Card and agriculture committees will now have micro ATM facility, he said .Under the CM Young Farmer Entrepreneurship Scheme, the government will provide a loan of Rs 2 crore and 15% subsidy to each farmer. Whats more, the government will repay 5% interest on it till 7 years.State agriculture minister Gaurishankar Bisen announced that six tractor training centres will be opened where rural youth will be given capsule courses in repair and maintenance of tractors.During the CMs speech, a group of farmers from Malwa expressed anguish over non-payment of crop insurance since 2015. They raised slogans during the meeting but BJP top brass pacified them by allowing their leader to meet the CM after the rally.Congress had petitioned the EC to stop the kisan rally because the two bypolls are less than two weeks away. Chouhan accused Congress of trying to postpone the Sammelan for vested interests. Opposition leaders are apprehensive of the initiatives taken by the BJP government in the favour of farmers. Has Congress ever come close to what the BJP has done for farmers? Chouhan said.Congress dismissed the mega promises as poll gimmickry. PCC chief Arun Yadav challenged the CM to announce a timeline for his pledges. In the past 14 years, the BJP and CM Chouhan could not give suitable prices to farmers. How will the government pay adequate price now? While announcing all these sops, the chief minister should also have set a deadline for implementation, Yadav said.The government had claimed there would be more than 2.5 lakh farmers at the convention. Hardly 15,000 turned up. And the crowd mostly comprised BJP workers and municipal corporation employees, alleged Yadav. BJP leaders said that Sundays hailstorm and gale affected attendance as farmers were busy protecting their crop.1. Rs 200 bonus per quintal for wheat and paddy in 2016-172.

This adage fits perfectly on Madhya Pradesh government, that is staring at assembly general elections later this year and mounting anger from the farmers.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans sops on Monday for the farmers announced at a Kisan Mahasammelan has burdened the cash-strapped state, further.If sources from the MP finance department are to be believed, the government would need at least Rs 10,000 crore to meet its commitment made to the farmers.To give a boost to the income of farmers, the state would need about Rs 10,000 crore. And around Rs 5,000 crore in the next two months for effective implementation of the scheme, state finance department sources said.Sources further said that Rs 1,340 crore would be required to pay Rs 200 bonus per quintal on the MSP of 67 lakh metric tonne wheat procured from the farmers in 2016-17 while another Rs 340 crore would go to paddy farmers for 17 lakh metric tonnes of produce as bonus. Another Rs 1,700 core for chana, masoor and mustard farmers and Rs 500 crore for onion.Besides, there are the other announcements like making Chambal ravines suitable for farming and expenses on storing produce in ware houses, said the sources.And where would the money come from for government? The CM too did not divulge the details?The government has done all its calculations. Chouhan may earmark some funds in the budget to be presented later this month. The money may also be arranged after slashing down budgetary provisions of different departments. If the CMs plan is executed, MP might not see any new development works in 2018-19, top sources said seeking anonymity.After having made the announcement, the chief minister was elated, mainly due to the positive response from the farmers, who have been expecting fair deal from him on their produce. The chief minister was seen returning to the dais thrice to repeat his announcements, and extending the Shivratri greeting to the eagerly waiting farmers.Sources said the governments main concern is small and marginal farmers, who often tend to work as agricultural labourers and have not seen a significant rise in their incomes, despite an impressive agriculture growth in agriculture reported by the state over the years. Though MPs farm performance look impressive, the distribution of gains are not reflected in their income. For the rabi 2018, the MSP and bonus announcements will be done after the produce is procured, sources said.Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen said, For farmers, there is no dearth of funds with the government. The government is committed to fulfil its promises.However, the farmers leaders are still not happy.National president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji said, This is another stunt in an election year. We will take out a yatra to tell farmers not to be misled by the announcements."

Kumar had announced that he will never join back after the single-judge quashed his appointment on January 17, ruling that he was holding the public office without authority and overriding powers were given to him without any accountability. However, Kumar could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.Amarinder aide Suresh Kumar is back :HC stays single judge order quashing Chief Principal secretary Suresh Kumar appointment.@htpunjab  Capitol Wanderer (@sharmasurender) February 14, 2018A 1983-batch IAS officer, Kumar was appointed immediately after the Congress government took over reins in Punjab on March 16 last year. The post created for the first time in Punjab was stated to be equivalent to a cabinet secretary of the Government of India. Kumar was being paid Rs 2.5 lakh per month minus pension.Former Union finance minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram and states advocate general Atul Nanda appeared for Punjab. Earlier, former solicitor general of India Ranjit Kumar had defended the government decision before the single judge.The court on Wednesday dealt with technical issues and has not gone into merits of the appointment. The primary argument raised was that petitioner Ramandeep Singhs plea was in violation of high court rules. The division bench, presided over by justice Mahesh Grover and justice Rajbir Sehrawat, stayed the single-judge order and issued notice for April 16.It recorded: ..at best, even if the locus of the petitioner to file a writ of quo warranto is accepted, the same would necessarily espouse a public interest as the petitioners interest does not conflict with that of state or the incumbent assigned the status of a chief principal secretary. Since the single judge, who dealt with the matter, was not bestowed with the subject roster, the judgment under these circumstances could possibly be construed as coram non judice (without jurisdiction). Even otherwise, the matter needs deeper deliberation.Quo warranto, as per high court rules, is filed to challenge an appointment to public office where it is continuous and statutory in nature.Appearing for the petitioner, senior advocate Gurminder Singh pointed out that the issue was not raised before the single judge. They allowed the single judge to decide the matter and are raising this issue here, he said. Chidambaram and Nanda objected to it and argued that it was deliberated upon by the single judge. Following this, the division bench orally said it had correctional powers and was exercising the same.It has serious pitfalls, if we start accepting (what happened in this case). He (petitioner) is not even an affected party, the bench orally said. As the court ordered stay, the petitioners lawyer pointed out that Kumar was not even appellant. Why should he come? The government wants him to join, the bench said, observing that it was a welcome change that there was someone who is not running for a post after retirement.On merit of appointment, the appeal says Kumar did not possess the power to pass orders on any file and he neither took any decision nor recorded it."

Pictures by Shubham PaulSouth Indian food is just idli and dosa. All South Indian food is vegetarian. All South Indian food is cooked in coconut oil. Kurry n Kebab, a cosy restaurant next to GD Market, claims to bust these myths with their Kerala food festival from February 26 to March 4.Idli and dosa are only snacks. For main course we have enough fish and mutton dishes to make Bengalis ask for more, promises Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab.But the owners were sceptical about introducing Kerala fare in Salt Lake and so decided to keep the tried-and-tested Mughlai cuisine on their menu too  hence the word kebab on their name.Nonetheless the upcoming festival focuses only on Kerala food, that you probably have not tasted before.Unniappam for dessert (top), (above) butter milk for startersKerala Mutton Ishtu (Rs 295), a mild, coconut milk-based stew, is unmissable. Chicken lovers can try the spicy Chicken Chettinad (Rs 280). Strictly speaking, Chettinad is a region in Tamil Nadu but it borders Kerala so were taking liberties. It goes very well with Malabari Paratha, says Menon.As an accompaniment, its the appam that is unique in look, taste and texture. The white round staple is soft and fluffy in the centre but has a crispy skirt on the edges. A dosa batter is made of rice and lentil but appam uses only rice. It uses no oil and is cooked on a kadai, which gives it the wholesome shape.Fish lovers must try Aiyla Fry (mackerel) or Naimeen Pollichada (Rs 260), a grill-cum-paturi take on the Surmai fish. Bengalis are partial towards river fish but sea fish like Surmai are very popular in Kerala, says Menon, adding that its not easy to procure the fish. You dont get it in Salt Lake. We have to fetch it from Park Circus, says the resident of New Towns Eastern High.While south Indian food is usually cooked in coconut oil, the Calcutta crowd would not enjoy it, says K. Surendran Nair, the head chef with over 30 years of experience. So were using refined oil. Coconut oil is used rarely, only in dishes such as Potato Stew.As for dessert, try the southern take on payesh or a rice-jaggery-banana fried item called Unniappam (Rs 150). The pellets are served hot over a bed of cold rabri, which is a twist we have added, says the chef.Kerala Mutton IshtuIngredients (serves one) Mutton with bone 500g (5 pieces) Potato half Coconut milk 100ml Green chilli 2 Ginger 5g Onion 100g Cloves, cardamom and cinnamon- total 5g Curry leaves 2gMethodBoil the mutton in a pressure cooker.

A poet must speak out against what she/he considers erroneous. One cannot be a dumb spectator to times where history is considered a toy that can be exchanged for another, where writers are being silenced, names are being changed and communal polarisation is riding high.Although the tone of these visibly political poems is different from the metaphor-clothed poetry of what was written in the past by this poet of seven anthologies of verses, yet she says: These poems have brought a lot of response and I am being labelled a poet of resistance, but resistance is the lot of a woman when she enters her mothers womb. If she is a writer she voices them too.Born in Kalomajra village near Banur, she is the sixth daughter of her parents. I had five elder sisters and after the fifth daughter, two sons were born. I was the accidental eighth and youngest child of the family. To my fathers horror and that of other elders, I was yet another female child, a mistake. My mother had been given a potion to end the pregnancy, but I survived it in the womb. In fact my father, a religious poet, did not talk to my mother for a month and to me for over a year, says Paul.Ironically, she was to inherit her fathers poetic talent and her first poem was on her father turning his back on her.Known well for exploring the politics of the personal, how did she turn overtly political? Paul smiles at this query and says: It all started a couple of years ago with a poem called Selfie. The selfie fever had gripped not just the young but even middle-aged politicians! The lines of her poem are gripping: Mera bal, Mera dal, Mera chhal/ Meri kameez sab ton safed/Tuhada nahi sunana, Tuhada nahi vekhna, Tuhada nahi bolna/Main taan karni hai siraf apne man ki baat/Ajj da nayak Selfie da Sardar! (My hair, my lentil soup, the way I walk/My shirt is the whitest/I wont listen to you, wont look at you, will not talk about you/I will just talk about myself/The lead actor today, Sardar of Selfies.So, following the Chief of the Selfie, came poems like Bhedh-Chaal (Herd mentality) and a moving dirge or Marsiya of the system and the elimination of writer-journalist Gauri Lankesh. Her poem Mughalsarai left a deep impact on many hearts when the iconic junction near Varanasi was renamed Deendayal Upadhyaya Station and people were wondering if the Mughlai parantha would also suffer the name-game fate.Paul has penned and edited several books, including an anthology of poems by different poets on the Punjab of 1984. Talking of her current poems, she says: I have not made an effort to write them. These have come to me spontaneously. So, Pauls readers now wait for her eighth anthology of spontaneous poems."

Last yea, Malaiya presented appropriation of Rs 1,85,564.27 crore with expenditure projection of Rs 169954.46 crore highest since the party came to power. The size of the budget has been increasing over the years, with ever increasing debt on the state. MPs financial prudence has always been questioned by the experts, who say that increased populist announcements are pushing up , the non -plan expenditure."

Pulses are bought from Australia, Russia, Tanzania, Canada and the United States."

This will also minimize the amount of cement used in construction activities and reduce the overall costs.The researchers claim that these bacteria can replace the commercial admixtures that are used to increase the strength of cement or mortar.The research team from environmental laboratory in the civil engineering department of VNIT has been working under the guidance of former director of National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (Neeri) and former environment chair of VNIT, Tapan Chakrabarti , for nearly three years. Chakrabarti told TOI that during experiments it was found that microbially-induced calcium carbonate precipitation could increase the compressive strength of cement by 23.49% for 28 days of curing period. It also reduced water absorption capacity of cement by 15.40% by filling the micro cracks through bio-cementation.The principal investigator of the project Madhuwanti Latkar, associate professor, said, Most important aspect of the process is that use of water during casting and curing is replaced by the microbial solution. The two types of ureolytic bacteria used in the project are bacillus cereus and enterobacter cloacae. The experiment also used lentil seed powder as protein source and sugar as carbon source and meat extract in the nutrient medium. The researchers plan to replace meat extract by yeast to further reduce the cost.Latkar said durability tests also yielded very good results and ranged between the standard figures. She clarified that the bacteria are used only in the first five/six days of the curing as they die after that. Otherwise also, these bacteria are non-pathogenic and extracted from rohizopheric soil. We didnt use pure cultures of bacteria. We used soil along with microbial solution, she added.Chakrabarti said the whole process was environment-friendly and minimized the carbon footprint. In fact, it is a very green technology, he said.A PhD scholar involved in the project, Anuja Charpe , said though the technology is green but transferring the technology or selling it will not be easy. It is difficult to convince people for using environment-friendly technology. People prefer easily available technology rather than green one, she said.Snigdha Bhutange, a PhD student who joined the project just a few months back, says she would be comparing all admixtures available in markets with bio-cementation process to make it more acceptable and accessible.The researchers have earned two patents during the work and the project is expected to continue for another two years or more."

She was not a loud feminist, she established herself as a woman WRITER in the male-dominatedworld of literatureMain chup, shant aur adol khadi thi.Sirf paas behte samundra mein toofan tha,Phir samundra ko khuda jaane,Kya khyaal aaya?Usne toofan ki ek potli-si baandhi.Mere haathon mein thamaayi,Aur hans kar kuch door ho gayaThats from Ek Mulakaat, by Amrita Pritam, the first woman to win a Sahitya Akademi award, in 1956.She wrote novels and verse that ached with the anguish of Partition. It is said her heart never left Lahore. That city gave her her first published book, a collection of poetry called Amrit Lehran. Her first husband, a businessman named Pritam Singh, whom she would divorce 25 years later. And her one true love, the poet Sahir Ludhianvi.She never had a romantic relationship with Ludhianvi. But she did have one with the artist Imroze. Theirs was a love that would last 41 years, until her death in 2005. She was 86. In Delhi, she built a life and cemented her identity as a rebel. But in all those years, Amrita Pritam never visited Lahore again.Ashapurna Devi (1909 1995), the first Indian woman to be awarded the Jnanpith Award for her book Protham Protishruti (The First Commitment) in 1976 belonged to the generation in between two of the greats of Bengali literature  Saratchandra Chattopadhyay and Tarashankar Bandyopadhyay. Ashapurna Devi captured an urban milieu whereas Saratchandra mainly portrayed the village world or the semi-urban world; Tarashankar injected romance in the literature of realism. Devis prose was modern and in colloquial Bengali which was a new trend for her age. Ashapurna Devi was not a loud feminist, she eked out the role of a woman writer in the nearly male-dominated world of Bengali literature, says Sunandan Roy Chowdhury, editor and publisher, Sampark. She found a warm response among female and male readers. She was a female Saratchandra, and in some ways, even better.Separated by many generations and milieu from Ashapurna Devi, Arundhati Roy became the first Indian woman to win the Booker prize in 1996 for her debut novel, The God of Small Things. The multi-generation family story built around twins, Rahel and Estha, captures the many facets of life in Kerala  its politics, caste system and the Syrian Christian way of life. Michiko Kakutani, the New York Times critic, in an article, writes: She proves remarkably adept at infusing her story with the inexorable momentum of tragedy. She [Roy] writes near the beginning of the novel that in India, personal despair could never be desperate enough, that it was never important enough because worse things had happened and kept happening.Most of our women POLITICIANS are second- or third-generation leaders. But there are some who blazed a trail and showed what was possible when courage and ambition met democracy.She was referred to as the first woman in a mans world. The first woman Prime Minister of India (1966  77; 1980  84), Indira Gandhi, was a bundle of contradictions. Elegant and graceful, she was rumoured to never forget or forgive a grudge. The only PM of India to have used the Emergency to retain absolute power. She went from being compared to the Goddess Durga during the war for the freedom of Bangladesh, to being vilified during the Emergency.She was 12 when she began her service for the nation, forming a Vanar Sena, inspired by the Ramayana, to participate in the freedom struggle, helping the Congress party make flags, convey messages and put up notices. From there to a legacy of once having been the greatest threat to Indian democracy, she truly was a riddle wrapped in an enigma.Most of our women politicians are second- or third-generation leaders. But there have been some who have blazed a trail and shown whats possible when courage and ambition meet democracy. Sarojini Naidu, a freedom fighter and poet, was the first woman governor of an Indian state.

Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, a Gandhian and freedom fighter, was the first Indian woman to hold a cabinet rank after 1947 and was Indias first health minister. She helped frame our Constitution and when she passed away in 1964, the New York Times called her a princess in her nations service.

It is said she went door to door requesting parents to send their daughters to the school for which she had to withstand criticism by upper castes mainly because she was a woman and from the backward classes.She was a loving teacher; students called her Savitri ma. Her pedagogy of teaching was participatory, innovative and radically different from the then existing rigid and restrictive mode, says Gowd Kiran Kumar, a research scholar at the department of political science, University of Hyderabad, in an article written for the portal, Round Table India. She encouraged students to think creatively. The results were interesting. 11-year-old Muktabai, a Dalit student of Savitribai, published an article on the plight of Mangs and Mahars in the newspaper Dyanodaya, in 1855. This may perhaps be one of the earliest of Dalit womens writings on their issues. She continued to inculcate modern values in students and her followers, writes Kumar.In 1882, along with Kadambini Ganguly, Chandramukhi Basu passed the examination of the bachelors degree in arts from the University of Calcutta.

She rose from an advocate in Keralas lower judiciary to becoming the munsif in the Kerala Subordinate Judicial Services and a judge of the Kerala High Court in 1983, before becoming a judge of the Supreme Court in 1989. After her retirement from the Supreme Court, Beevi first served as a member of the National Human Rights Commission, before being appointed as Governor of Tamil Nadu in 1997. In a magazine interview in 2016, Beevi had pushed for more women to be included in senior judicial positions and said, There are many women in the field now, both at the bar and in the benchHowever, their participation is meagre...The daughter of a police officer, Priya Jhingan had always dreamt of donning the uniform.

But theres only one who gets the right moment and the right angle. In 2011, Vyarawalla received the Padma Bhushan. Last year in December, on her 104th birth anniversary, Google paid a tribute to her with a Doodle.She entered FILMS when it was considered immoral for women to come in front of a motionpicture camera.Patience Cooper, an Anglo-Indian from Calcutta, became the first popular film star in India. Her achievement is all the more incredible as she entered films at a time when it was considered highly immoral for women to come in front of a motion picture camera. In fact, acting was then regarded as the lowliest profession for women, even worse than prostitution. Little wonder that Dadasaheb Phalke had to cast a man, Anna Salunke, as his heroine in Indias first ever feature film, Raja Harishchandra (1913).Said to be born around 1905, Cooper was among the earliest women who broke social barriers and dared to work in films. As cinema gained popularity in India, filmmakers approached girls from the Jewish or the Anglo-Indian community, who were thought to be more forward and open in their thinking, to star in films. Beginning from dancing for a Eurasian troupe, Cooper joined Madan Theatres, then one of Indias biggest filmmaking companies. She would go on to became their foremost billed star in the 1920s and the early 1930s and also the earliest recognizable face among Indian actors.With her sharp features and fair skin, Cooper was comparable to the Hollywood beauties of the time. In her films, she often played a sexually-troubled woman caught at the centre of moral dilemmas and whose life ended in tragedy. Beginning with silent films, Cooper made the transition to the talkies with comparative ease. Incidentally, she also enacted what are regarded to be the first ever dual roles by an actress in Indian cinema  playing two sisters in Patni Pratap (1923) and a mother and a daughter in Kashmiri Sundari (1925).Though she acted till well into the 1940s, Cooper migrated to Pakistan along with tea-estate owner MAH Isaphani following the partition of the sub-continent. She took on the name Sabra Begum and adopted and looked after several underprivileged children across the border.Patience Cooper died in Karachi in 1993.After he was unable to find a woman to play the female lead in his first film, Dadasaheb Phalke was finally able to convince two women  the mother-daughter duo of Durgabai Kamat and Kamlabai Gokhale to face the camera in his follow up film and another mythological, Mohini Bhasmasur (1913).Durgabai had separated from her husband and along with her little daughter, Kamlabai, had joined a travelling theatre company when they crossed paths with Phalke. In an interview, Kamlabai recalled staying at Phalkes house in Nasik, waking up daily at 4.00 am and travelling to reach the location - three hours away - by bullock cart. Filming took place from dawn to dusk in available light with the help of reflectors.Mohini Bhasmasur is based on the tale of the female avatar of Lord Vishnu, the enchantress Mohini who brings about the destruction of the asura, Bhasmasur. Bhasmasur had got a boon from Lord Shiva that whosoevers head he laid his hand on, that person would immediately be reduced to ashes.Durgabai can also be said to be the head of Indian cinemas first acting family as daughter Kamlabai, grandson Chandrakant Gokhale and great-grandson Vikram Gokhale all became fine actors in their own rightWhen Indias first Talkie, Alam Ara (1931) was announced by Ardershir Iranis Imperial Film Company, it was thought naturally that the companys biggest star, Sulochana, would be the films leading lady. However, hailing from the Jewish community and whose actual name was Ruby Myers, Sulochana was not proficient in Hindustani/Urdu and so another actress in Imperial, Zubeida, went on to become the first ever heroine of the Talkies in Indian filmdom. Zubeida, along with sisters Sultana and Shehzadi, all were actress in the silent era while their mother, Fatma Begum, an actress herself, is regarded as the first ever Indian woman director, having helmed Bulbul-e-Paristan (1926) starring Zubeida, followed by other films as well.KB Sundarambal, a famous vocalist and theatre performer, was paid a whopping Rs 1,00,000, the first ever Indian actor or actress to receive such a sum, to star in the Tamil film, Bhakta Nandanar (1935). She played the title role of a man, the lowly-born devotional saint, Nandanar. It is said Sundarambal had given up performing on the stage following the death of her husband, and in order to put off textile magnate Hassandas, the prospective producer of the film, quoted the then unheard-of amount to put him off only to have him agree! Sadly however, the film did not succeed at the box office.Exploring a career in SPORTS for her daughters, she became a mountaineer.Saina Nehwal won a bronze at the 2012 London Olympics, becoming the first Indian badminton player to win a medal at the Olympic Games. And then she began to slip. So much so, that in 2014, after facing successive losses, the thought of quitting badminton crossed her mind. But not only did Saina bounce back, she also attained the World No. 1 ranking in March 2015. Thats what people close to her admire  her grit and mental toughness. I want to be the Shah Rukh Khan of badminton, the self-confessed Bollywood fan had said in an interview with HT.At 1.07 pm on 23 May 1984, Bachendri Pal stood atop Mount Everest, becoming the first Indian woman to do so. What makes her achievement all the more special is that Pal, one of the seven children of Kishan Pal Singh, had a humble background and money was difficult to come by. In May 2013, 28-year-old Arunima Sinha became the first amputee from the country to climb the summit. In the same year, 50-year-old Premlata Agarwal became the first Indian woman to scale seven peaks in seven continents. Agarwal, a housewife from Jamshedpur, met Bachendri Pal to explore a career in adventure sports for her daughters. Such was the effect of the meeting that she herself started mountaineering.I have proven that women can achieve as much as men can, and I have shown that boxing can be as engrossing as cricket for Indians, says five-time World Amateur Boxing champion and Olympics bronze medallist Mary Kom in her autobiography Unbreakable. Having lived a childhood full of hardships in a Manipur village, she went on to win the 1st Women National Boxing Championship in 2001. At the 2016 Olympics, Sakshi Malik became the first Indian woman wrestler to win an Olympic medalThe year was 1959. Five days after celebrating her 19th birthday, Calcutta-born Arati Saha became the first and fastest Asian woman to swim across the English Channel. The following year, she was awarded the Padma Shri.Thirty-one-year-old Sania Mirza is the highest ranked female tennis player, both in singles and doubles, India has ever produced. Deepa Malik won a silver medallist in shot put at the 2016 Paralympic Games becoming the first Indian woman to win a medal in Paralympics. Last month, BCCI gave the inaugural Lifetime Achievement Award for Women to Shantha Rangaswamy. Back in 1976, she was the first captain of the Indian womens cricket team. She was also Indian womens crickets first international centurion and the first captain to win a Test.She could have escaped, But, she was not a person to quit. And it was this COURAGE that deservedto be awarded.The question, whom do you most admire, living or dead, needs to come with a clause: think of a new name. Because Mother Teresa has been the obvious choice for years. Such is the legend of the first and only Indian woman to have won a Nobel Peace Prize (1979).A young Catholic nun from Albania, Agnes Bojaxhiu arrived as a missionary in 1929 Calcutta. She was 21. As she walked about her adopted city, the destitution around her was so great that she felt compelled to leave her institution so she could do more. Her mission became an order of its own, The Missionaries of Charity, now working with the poor, sick and abandoned in 160 cities across 87 countries.In September 2016, Mother Teresa was canonised and declared a saint.Neerja Bhanot was a model, a career woman, a survivor of an abusive marriage. She was also the youngest person and the first woman to be awarded the Ashoka Chakra, Indias highest peacetime gallantry award, posthumously. She was all of 23 when she died.Neerja worked for Pan American Airways and lost her life while saving 359 passengers of a Pan Am flight hijacked by armed men in September 1986 at Karachi. Eyewitnesses said it was Bhanot who alerted the pilot, co-pilot and flight engineer so that they could escape, ensuring that the flight could not take off. As soon as she realised that the terrorists were targeting American passengers, she got them to hand over their passports so they couldnt be singled out. She was shot dead while helping passengers sneak out of the emergency exits. She could have slid down the chute and escaped, her father said later. But, he added, she was not a person to quit. Bhanot has been immortalised in many ways  a coffee table book, The Neerja I Knew, conceptualised by her brother Aneesh; a life-size sculpture in Punjab by artist Manjit Singh Gill. More recently, the 2016 film Neerja dramatised her story.(Compiled by: HT Weekend team. Women in films by Karan Bali)"

It is a lifestyle that encourages the redesigning of resources to prolong their life cycles. The goal is for no trash to be sent out.Vandana K, a minimalist, defines the zero-waste lifestyle as ""sending the least possible waste to landfills and not forcing juvenile rag pickers to collect your unsegregated garbage."" According to a report by the Ministry of Environment and Forest in 2016, about 62 million tonnes of waste is produced in India annually, 5.6 million of which is plastic. The report also underlines that 43 million tonnes of waste is collected, out of which 11.9 million is treated and the rest 31 million is dumped in landfill sites. Amid this urban lifestyle, these women  Deepa Ratika Deshpande, Monika Khanna Gulati and Vandana K  have chosen to declutter and lead an eco-friendly, no-rubbish lifestyle.Homegrown organic seeds and soapnut plantVandana, 28, is a south Delhi resident who works as a freelance writer. She started to consume cautiously, upgraded to minimal consumption and has now produced a small jar of trash in the last six months. Deepa, 35, is a sustainable life coach and zero waster staying in East of Kailash.Monika, a graphic designer, is a mother of two sons and has a family of five practising minimal consumption. She says, ""In a family of five, we produce only 250 gms of trash in a span of 3-4 weeks."" Monika is an avid comopositer at Nirvana Country, Gurgaon.Homemade cleaning solutionsRatika Deshpande, a 17-year-old resident of Palam area, lives with a family of seven members and decided to practice minimal living. ""She tells us what to do and we follow,"" says Ratika's father. ""There is always an environmental friendly option to everything we use, we just need to opt for those,"" clarifies Ratika. These women say that the six Rs  Rethink, Refuse, Reduce, Reuse, Repair, and Recycle  of sustainable living, are the key elements they have adopted to reduce garbage. We find out more about their lifestyle choices and the alternatives they've adapted to.Mooncup and cotton padThese women choose to make their beauty products at home to avoid throwingout plastic waste.For moisturising, she recommends coconut oil. ""The soap nut (ritha) costs me Rs 70-80 per kg. I use it as a hair cleaner and it lasts for about three months, much more economical and healthier than a branded shampoo,"" she says.Vandana KWe make hot oil at home for my grandmother's joints. For bathing, oil and clay paste is used by my entire family.Deepa doesn't use any bath and body products. She says that the only product she uses is a tooth powder and a bamboo toothbrush. In place of sanitary napkins, they use moon cups and cloth pads.Deepa composting dry leaves and garden wasteApart from compositing, they also make snacks and masalas at home. ""It saves packaging waste and I always know what's going into my body,"" she says. Ratika adds that the snacks they cook and the products they make at home are multipurpose and since the ingredients are basic, they hardly cost anything.She buys groceries from local markets in the cloth bags she stitches to avoid packaging waste. ""Everything you need for sustainable living is a one-time cost and their lifespan is always very long,"" she says.She grows vegetables on her terrace garden. ""Raw leaves and water is my usual breakfast.

It will also help in making the farmers aware of the multiple ways in which they are looted, check what really happens in the agriculture markets and whether they really get the MSP being assured by the Central government.This is a truth mission on the lines of the spirit of Gandhian Satyagraha and we invite everyone to participate to find out the MSP reality, he said.Arguing that MSP is the solemn guarantee by the government to the farmers to ensure a floor price, Mr. Yadav pointed out the reality is that the farmer is forced to sell for much less  Bengal gram (chana) selling for Rs. 800 to Rs. 1000 less than MSP of Rs. 4,400, lentils at Rs. 3,200-Rs. 3,800 as against Rs. 4,250, rapeseed at Rs. 3,500 as against Rs. 4,000, etc. He contested the governments claims of ensuring income of 1/1.5 times the production cost.Prof. M. Kodandaram, whose TJAC is among the several organisations supporting the programme, demanded fair MSP for all crops and alleged that the infrastructure facilities at markets are inadequate with middlemen and traders ruling the roost.Even in recent red gram procurement by Markfed, the farmers arrears were to the tune of Rs. 220 crore."

Down south, however, for some one thousand years, the rice-lentil pudding has been the favourite early-morning carb booster and protein supplement.It is therefore natural that in the heartland of the idli , the idea of celebrating March 30 as World Idli Day has caught on within a few years. Eniyavan, an idli-only caterer, was among the first to moot the idea.On Friday, many ordered varities of idlies through the day, say restaurateurs. Hotel Ambassador Pallava served more than 30 different idlis including elaneer idli, paneer idli, and palapazha idli. General manager Venkat Reddy said, On an average, we serve idlis to 70 persons a day. On Friday, however, we nearly sold out [all special varieties of idlis ] by the end of the day. Vasantha Bhavan had 50 varieties, including those made from rava and millets.Humble and popularThough south Indians claim the humble idli as their own, some historians believe it came via the sea trade route from south-east Asia  a maritime legacy of the Cholas.Today, the idli has become the most popular and, at the same time, healthy, food item in the region. M. Ravi of the Chennai Hotels Association said among all dishes in any restaurant in the city, idlis always come first in terms of sales. Some companies made a bulk order of idlis for their employees on Friday. The Idli Factory sold nearly 2,000 additional idlis because they had orders from corporates wanting to treat their employees. Murugan Idli Shop in T. Nagar too saw a spurt in sales with 2,500 idlis sold through UberEats alone. Lakshmikant K, chief financial officer, said, In our T. Nagar branch alone, we served about 2,000 idlis . Our typical daily business is 1,500 a day, he adds.Harish Warrier summed up the day with his tweet: #WorldIdliDay: Idli, as a food, is an emotion of South Indians."

Organised for three days from March 30 to April 1, the hotel has been serving chocolate idli, chaat idli, carrot idli, mint idli and beetroot idli.Before serving the special idlis, we have been explaining to the customers, mostly visitors from Europe and South Asia, about the ingredients involved and their preparation. Such interaction and recognition for the indigenous dish would certainly promote them across the globe, said J Mubarak , executive chef, Sangam Hotels. For chocolate idli, chefs add chocolate chips along the batter before steaming and for chaat idli, masala powder is added to the dish while steaming.Three pieces of special idlis priced between Rs 90 and Rs 100 a set is a hit among visitors, who click pictures of them having the dish and publish the same on social media with the hashtag #WorldIdliDay. Chili cheese idli has earned the likes of European visitors who enquired about the ingredients such as fermented black lentils and rice, chef Antony Samy adds.On the other hand, doctors reckon idli as one of the healthiest and nutritious food for all age groups. Idlies perfectly adopt the benefits mentioned in the food pyramid suggested by medical professionals for a healthy diet. The easily digestible idli is a probiotic food and suggested for consumption when a person is ill, Dr G Sivaraman, Chennai based Siddha expert said. As people across the globe are celebrating their iconic food in their culture, medical professionals pitched for more emphasise in celebrating idlies in the coming years."

But this will last barely for another week after which we will face a serious problem, says Kalpesh Jain, who runs a store in Sakkardara.For the last two-three days, I have been giving jute bags which are used by distributors and wholesalers to pack. I have asked customers to store them and bring them back to the shop next time, says Jain, who is planning to get cloth bags of all dimensions stitched out of old saris and clothes to use at his store.With notices being put up outside grocery stores saying no plastic carry bags will be provided, customers now will have to get used to bringing their own bags or shell out for reusable ones.People have still not got into the habit of carrying bags to stores, says Virendra Sahu, who runs a provision store at Golibar Chowk. So far, we were packing dry kirana items like dal, rice, sugar and others in virgin plastic bags which come without handle. Paper bags are no substitute as they are not sturdy, says Sahu.Wrapping items in newspapers and tying them with strings will be very time-consuming, so we are not even looking at the option, he adds.Agreeing that newspaper wrapping of grocery is a big no, Dhanesh Jethani, who has a grocery store in Khamla, says, We do not get the kind of hard working labour who would sit and pack the stuff and tie them with a string.Identifying the items while billing and making delivery also becomes a problem when they are not packed in plastic bags. We are waiting for some solutions to emerge and will follow accordingly, he says.The ban has provoked both dismay and praise, but the biggest question for many is what will happen when the supply of plastic bags dries up? Finding an alternate, calculating its cost are the biggest challenges facing us today, says Harish Pitalwar, who runs an online grocery store.Our services include home deliveries, so we cant ask customers to provide bags. Besides, a person who orders online is accustomed to decent packing of items ordered by him, says Pitalwar.So far, items are placed in huge plastic bags and delivered. But now we are thinking of getting big stainless steel crates in which we will put vegetables. For groceries, there is still no option, though we are testing bags made with corn starch for its strength, he adds."

The process of procurement will continue till June 9. All registered farmers are eligible to sell their produce at procurement centres, said Indore agriculture departments deputy director Vijay Chourasia.Around 48 procurement centres will be opened in Indore district.Prices of pulses fell below MSP this season due to higher output in the country and increased imports from Australia and Canada. All India Dal Mill Association has been demanding to immediately ban imports and allow export of at least 25 lakh MT of pulses to check the price fall.Pulses farmers are suffering from huge losses this season because prices have gone below MSP. Government purchase will help in limiting the losses, said association president Suresh Agrawal.MSP of chana is Rs 4,400 per quintal, masur is Rs 4,250 per quintal and mustard is Rs 4,000 per quintal.Chourasia said, Retaining the quality of the produce is the main task. These procured items will be stored in warehouses and godowns.Industry experts said poor prices of pulses may discourage sowing in the next season hitting availability for domestic consumption.We require about 30 lakh MT pulses every year to meet local demand if production takes a hit then imports will go up to meet the local demand, Chourasia said."

The Rajasthan government, however, is purchasing wheat at MSP of 1,735 for every quintal fixed by the Centre.Madhya Pradesh has announced a special incentive of 100 every quintal for chana, masoor and mustard in the 2018 rabi marketing season.According to an official order issued by the Madhya Pradesh government, wheat and other crops, including chana, mustard and masoor, will be eligible for the cash incentive irrespective of the rate at which it is sold in the market.The state hasnt termed the scheme as a bonus to circumvent a central order that curbs state governments from declaring a bonus over the MSP.Upset at lower prices prevailing in Rajasthan, farmers in Kota division are planning a jail bharo andolan on April 12, to protest against what they call lower MSP and inadequate arrangements for purchase of wheat and other rabi crops at the mandis.At most mandis, farmers are being forced to sell wheat at 1,500 every quintal. Farmers are also getting lower prices for chana, which is being sold at about 1,000 every quintal lesser than the MSP, said Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangarhsh Samiti convener Fatehchand Bagla.We will stage protest at the Kota collectorate on Thursday and also court arrest, he said.Kisan Mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat said since Madhya Pradesh was a neighbouring state it was natural that farmers in Rajasthan will expect similar prices. When MP government can purchase wheat at 2,000 per quintal, there is no reason why the Rajasthan government cannot do the same, he said.State agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini said MSP was fixed by the Centre and the new norms prohibit declaring a bonus over and above the MSP.In Rajasthan, the Food Corporation of India is purchasing wheat at 207 designated centres at 1,735 every quintal. Rajasthan is the fifth largest wheat producer in the country.Rajasthan, which goes to the polls in the next few months, has faced a series of farmers agitations in the past one year due to crash in prices and crop damage.Chief minister Vasundhara Raje in her last budget before the elections announced a farm loan waiver of up to 50,000 for small and marginal farmers that will cost the state exchequer more than 8,000 crore.Besides, the farm loan waiver, the state government has constituted a permanent farm commission and has allocated 5,000 crore interest-free loans to the Rajasthan State Co-operative Marketing Federation for procuring mustard and gram."

Thus, farmers got Rs 1,150 lesser than the MSP. The normal average price tur fetched in most of the markets was around Rs 4,250 per quintal. Thus, farmers got Rs 1,150 lesser than the MSP.Tur growers in Maharashtra are staring at a cumulative loss of Rs 1,067 crore as the commodity is trading well below the government-mandated Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400. Government procurement at the 180 centres is about to end on April 18 and growers in Maharashtra have little hope of price recovery towards the end of the season.Tur had grabbed headlines in 2016 when prices of the lentil had crossed the Rs 6,000 per quintal-mark at Laturs Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC). Continuous drought in the main tur growing region of Marthwada has escalated the prices. However, given the bumper crop in 2016-17, prices of the commodity had all but crashed. Despite a record procurement of over 7 lakh tonnes last year, prices had remained below the MSP level. Also, for the kharif season, prices started below the MSP levels as the old stock still remains unutilsed.Forecasts by the state agriculture department had put the production of tur at 9.83 lakh tonnes (lt), of which NAFED was to procure around 4.5 lt under its Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) scheme. Till Tuesday, the state has procured a little over 1.62 lt of tur from 1.33 lakh farmers. Tur, being a kharif crop, is normally harvested after October with farmers preferring to hold up their produce for better prices for a few months before offloading the same.The normal average price tur fetched in most of the markets was around Rs 4,250 per quintal. Thus, farmers got Rs 1,150 lesser than the MSP. The cumulative loss to farmers in the state, therefore, works out to be Rs 1,067 crores. With NAFEDs procurement deadline ending on April 18, chances of any price increase are dim. Sources in the department of marketing said they were optimistic that the deadline for procurement would be extended. We have written for an extension of 1.5 month to meet our targets, said the official.The Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation has around 2.2 lakh tonnes of tur in its warehouses. Tenders have been floated to mill the whole tur and convert it into tur daal, which the government hopes to sell through public distribution systems. Given the huge stock, trade sources have ruled out any price correction in the next few months.Ajit Navale of the All India Kisan Sabha has attributed the loss to lack of proper planning. Farmers will be discouraged to grow tur the next season and its long-term effects will be faced in the retail markets too, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5b2e7c179855b72640115e56,"Vegetarians, here are your proteins",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/669889/vegetarians-here-your-proteins.html,2018-04-13,"One of the most frequent questions that vegetarians face is, ""You're vegetarian, but where do you get your protein from?"" In spite of there being a wide variety of sources other than meat, from which one can add protein to a vegetarian diet, the lack of awareness around it often takes a toll on one's nutritional input.Proteins are essential for building lean mass, boosting metabolism, getting those curves and cuts, hormonal balance and staying disease free, as 80% of your body works on protein. Lack of consumption for the body's basic requirements of this vital compound can cause serious complications.Only when a protein contains all nine of these essential amino acids, it can be considered a ""complete"" protein. It's an established fact that food derived from animals such as meat, milk, and eggs have complete protein structures, while plant-based foods such as nuts, beans, grains, lentils, vegetables, and seeds have incomplete structures. However, just because they are incomplete, that doesn't make them inferior, though, they need to be combined with other food items to provide the right balance of essential amino acids.Here are some tips for vegetarians to take into consideration, in order to meet their body's basic protein requirements:Dal is a good source of protein, especially when paired alongside generous portions of rice.Curd-rice is a lesser known source of protein, it also helps to replenish the bacteria in the gut.Every vegetarian diet should include at least one kind of bean or lentil, at least once in a day combined with generous portions of grains. Beans are a great source of protein with low levels of glycemic carbs.Paneer is a delicious, versatile source of protein, particularly Casein. The slow digestion of this type of protein elicits protein synthesis during the period between meals.Low-fat dairy products are a good source of protein for vegetarians who are also looking to control their fat intake. They are easily accessible and fun to incorporate into various meals and snacks.Soy either in the form of bean, milk or tofu is the saving grace for vegans, and an excellent source of protein. Despite the considerable fears about its effects on human beings, there's no reason to be alarmed as the anti-nutrients are destroyed when cooked. In fact, soy is the only plant based source of protein that is complete all by itself.Edamame beans (which are a type of immature soybean) are very nutritious choice for snacks.Cheese, apart from being practically everyone's favourite food, just so happens to be a very good source of protein. Make sure you keep the portion sensible as its high in fat.Eating foods with the right amounts of protein are just one side of the equation, the other side, which is often overlooked, concerns the rate at which one's body absorbs protein. Here are three ways to ensure that your body's capacity to absorb the proteins you eat is most efficient.Creating a gut environment that facilitates absorption: This can be achieved by including fermented foods, garlic, green bananas, barley, rice, and vegetables in one's diet, while cutting down on unnatural sugar intakes and low glycaemic carbs.Include nutrients that support assimilation and absorption: Vitamin B6, a primary nutrient that helps enzymes break down protein and deliver it to your blood is essential to get the most from one's protein intake. While nuts, seeds, beans, legumes and whole grains are good sources of B6, they are highly susceptible to degradation upon cooking; therefore it's always advisable to use B vitamin supplements.Spaced out protein consumption: The human body can only absorb certain amounts of protein per meal, which varies from person to person, therefore eating one's daily quota in a single sitting is redundant. What truly helps is to space out one's consumption over the course of the day to facilitate more optimal amounts of protein absorption.Vegetarians have long suffered from the ill effects of a protein deficit diet. Fortunately, dietary science has evolved to the point where we can address this serious issue with simple changes to one's food intake, without significantly infringing on anyone's beliefs.(The writer is head nutritionist at The Food Analysts)"

And Mumbai is a city that opens its arms to people from all over the country.Today, on Assamese, Bengali, Odiya and Malayali New Year, BT speaks to four young women from these communities, who live far away from home, yet have kept their culture and tradition alive. Read onTanvi Nair might have lived in Mumbai for a very long time, but her heart lies in her homeland, Kerala. It is this constant pining to go back to where she belongs, that makes her celebrate Vishu and other festivals with fervour. My family has taught me how important such festivals are, to remain connected to our roots. Its not the distance, but the feeling of oneness that matters. The day begins by looking at the Vishukani, where auspicious things  a vessel containing fruits, rice, a mirror, gold and cash  are arranged.Its symbolic of prosperity and happiness. This is followed by a grand sadya (traditional feast) with near and dear ones in the afternoon. Another popular tradition is Vishu Kaineettam  elders giving money as a token of love and blessing to the younger ones. The festival serves as an opportunity for family members staying across the city to come together and recreate a mini version of what it would be like in Kerala. Our elders have invested their time and effort in passing down to us the significance of being connected to our homeland, and it applies to life as a whole. It is our responsibility to be more aware of our roots and pass on the same learnings to future generations, explains Tanvi Nair, the young dancer and PR professional.Sutapa Singha from Kolkata shifted base to Mumbai a couple of years ago, after marriage. There is something about Mumbai... every festival here is celebrated with gusto, says the writer by profession. Sutapa feels that Poila Boishakh is all about bonding with her loved ones. Its mostly about families. And new clothes, of course. I spend the day with my husband and try to meet up with other Bengali friends living in the city. We sing together and enjoy khaati Bangali adda over cups of tea. And, theres always a couple of new outfits in our wardrobe. Ask her how she stays connected to her roots and Sutapa explains, Food is a big connector. One or the other Bong friends is sure to make some pithe puli on this day. And if a Bong has her favourite foods in front of her, it doesnt matter if she is in Kolkata or Mumbai. Of course, I miss my parents and my sister. And my moms special paatishapta with chocolate filling. But, thats alright because I make up for it during the Puja holidays.For actress Plabita Borthakur, Bihu is all about donning the traditional attire. Back home in Duliajan (in the Dibrugarh district of Assam), Plabita would go berserk dancing to Bihu tunes with troops that would drop by for a quick performance. I love wearing mekhela sador (traditional Assamese attire), I wear it sometimes anyway. I make sure I wear one on Bohag Bihu and listen to a couple of Bihu songs to get the feel of the festival. And I definitely cheat on my diet on this day. I used to love applying jetuka (mehendi) and dancing with the different husori (is a group of people dressed in traditional attire, touring peoples homes  singing, dancing and wishing them well for the year ahead) teams that would come over.Just like any other ambitious person, Debdutta Mohanty moved out of her Rourkela home 10 years ago. Although a decade has passed by, but for her, Pana Sankranti , even to this day, is about making the cooling drink this festival is named after. Its been a long time I have been away from Odisha. Back home, we used to visit Shiv and Hanuman temples. In Mumbai, we go to the ISKCON temple and enjoy traditional food. The festival has derived its name from a cooling drink call pana, made out of bela (wood apple), grated coconut, chhenna (grated paneer) and jaggery. Other than that, we prepare rice, khichdi, dalma (lentils mixed with different vegetables) and mixed vegetable (called ghanta in Odiya), says Debdutta, a freelance journalist, matter-of-factly."

(Express Archive) At an enclave in Cooch Behar, prior to the pact. (Express Archive)A school, a health centre, a drainage system, proper roads, and toilets. Pradeep Burmans family of ten and other residents of Kokoyabari in Cooch Behar were promised these basic facilities along with legal documents for their lands under schemes of the state and central governments. For Kamaleshwar Sarkar, 40, who lives with his family in a makeshift refugee colony in Haldibari, a job and a home now seem a distant dream. In Bangladesh, he used to work for a pharmaceutical company, while his wife was a nurse. Today, he runs a toto (e-rickshaw) to fend for his family, which depends heavily on monthly government rations that he terms as too less.Burman, 26, and Sarkar are among former residents of Bangladeshi enclaves in India and Indian enclaves in Bangladesh, who settled in in Cooch Behar after a historic pact between the two countries. On August 1, 2015, over 14,000 people in 37 enclaves got new identities and the promise of a better future after India and Bangladesh agreed on an enclave exchange. In Kokoyabari, most residents, including Burman, have had to construct makeshift toilets while they wait to get proper ones under the Swachh Bharat scheme. Without a school in the area, most children must trek to the nearest primary school, which is is two-and-a-half km away, or the nearest higher secondary school, which is 5 km away, Burman said.Everyone seems to have forgotten us. Just before the polls, some government people come and measure the land. Then they disappear. There are no proper roads. Aanganwadi centres are yet to open. People are yet to get papers for their lands. Here, people have small plots of one or two bighas each, said 66-year-old Bijendranath Burman, a resident of Falanpur, speaking to The Indian Express over phone. Burman was the president of the erstwhile Chit Nagarik Suraksha Committee, which fought for the cause of enclaves until an agreement with India was reached.According to Burman, small agricultural holdings in Falanpur add up to 506 acres, while in Nalgram they stand at a total of 1,393 acres. None of the residents in these areas have received the required papers yet. All we have are only a few tubewells and some solar-powered pump sets for irrigation. Even the voter ID cards given to us have a lot of anomalies and dont contain proper addresses. So many political parties are knocking on our doors now. But we have all decided not to vote in the panchayat polls. We feel cheated. In the newspapers, we read money has been sanctioned, but we see little on ground, said Burman.Official sources said Falanpur has a total population of 2,700, of which over 500 are voters. The ruling Trinamool Congress has blamed BJP for inciting the former enclave dwellers and hatching a conspiracy. All-round development has happenedBut it takes some time. BJP is going to these areas and inciting, misleading people Roads are being built, Aanganwadi centres are being set up, electrification in the areas where they live is complete. The government is building apartments for those who do not have land and have come from the Bangladesh enclaves. Their children are going to nearby schools. The government is also giving rations. We are talking to them and we are confident we will be able to convince them to vote, said North Bengal Development Minister Rabindranath Ghosh, MLA and the Trinamool Congress district president of Cooch Behar.The anger of former enclave dwellers is justified. Little has happened. Only some roads and some tubewells. Their land rights are a major issue. Most of them do not have land rights papers for their own fields. The government is planning to give them small apartments whereas they want the land to build a home. Schools, jobs promised are yet to be delivered. This, even though the central government has sanctioned money. We have highlighted the matter with the Centre, said Nikhil Ranjan Dey, BJP district president of Cooch Behar.Sarkar and his three brothers stay in a makeshift shelter in Haldibari, where six to seven family members stay in a single room. The brothers take turns to run two totos. Roy claimed the family receives 30 kg rice, 5 litres mustard oil, 5 kg kerosene, 5 kg masur dal, 2 kg of salt and 2 litres of milk monthly from the government. There are no schools here. There is no proper drainage system and no proper road. The government promised us employment and skill development through various projects, including animal husbandry and pisciculture. They promised to give us land too. Nothing happened. Many here are working as labourers to fend for their families. I left a job in a medicine company, and my wife, that of a nurse. So many times we have approached the BDO and SDO, nothing happened, said Sarkar, claiming that his community had recently held a meeting and decided to abstain from voting.Roy and his family hail from an enclave in Bangladeshs Debigunj under Panchagarh. They had come to the Haldibari camp on November 27, 2015. There are 530 people (105 families) in the camp, of which 362 are voters, sources said. Roys wife, Kanika, said the low-cost apartments promised to them are still under construction. Each apartment has only one room for families with six or seven members, she added.Our surname is Roy, but somehow, after we got our voter IDs, it was written Sarkar there, she further claimed. At Nalgram, another former enclave, there are 969 voters in a population of 1,800, official sources said. Residents contacted by The Indian Express said they are yet to get papers for their lands, which is their prime demand.I have a family of six. I have two-bigha land, but I am yet to get papers from the government even after three years. We also demand a proper road and a health centre. We will not vote this time. We have voted in the 2016 assembly polls, before which voter ID cards were hurriedly issued to us. But this time, we will not, said Debicharan Adhikari (42), a resident of Nalgram near Mathabhanga in Cooch Behar.Burman, whose family has two-and-a-half bighas of land at Kokoyabari, said almost none of the announced government schemes have reached the ground so far. There are so many government schemes, but we are yet to benefit. We were promised toilets under Swacch Bharat. But that never happened. Some of us used our own money and set up toilets. So many government officials came, media took our pictures, but then everyone forgot us. We are fed up with the false promises. We still have no means of drinking water or a proper drainage system, he said.Kokoyabari has 52 voters from 16 families, official sources said.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

The actor, who spoke about Why do Hindu Gods dance at a session, spoke to us ahead of International Dance Day about the significance of dance in Indian culture. He said, We dont see dance as part of religion in most parts of the world. However, over the years, our way of looking at dance and dancers has changed. Calling someone naachnewali or naachnewala has become a way of putting them down. We need to understand that dance is about seduction. For me, the story of Lord Vishnu taking the form of Mohini and dancing to seduce Bhasmasura is one of the most powerful stories. We dont understand that the story of Natraj also relates to seduction. But somehow, the word seduction has taken a negative connotation now. Through dance, we can understand a lot about Indian culture, history, geography and more. Its about time we did that.The main auditorium of the National Film Archives of India ( NFAI ) was overflowing with people eager to listen to what culture and mythology expert Devdutt Pattanaik had to say. Pattanaik, who was in town to speak about Why do Hindu Gods dance at the inaugural session of the 9th Prayatna Film and Dance Festival, didnt disappoint.From speaking about the relevance and importance of dance in Indian culture and traditions to engaging the audience with witty examples that established an instant connect, the authors session didnt have a single dull moment. For the first time in nine years, were seeing a full house at the festival. I think weve come a long way and hope that this interest stays put, quipped dancer Hrishikesh Pawar who organised the festival.The session saw dancers, artists and people of all age groups turning up in huge numbers and before the scheduled time. Among those in attendance were NFAI director Prakash Magdum , artists Raju Sutar and Vaishal Oak, veteran actress Deepa Shriram, Arti Kirloskar, Lisa Pingale and more."

And Kancheepuram , the robust paddy-cultivating district, considered dead agriculturally.Rooting for a revival , a few experts are now joining hands with farmers to ensure traditional seeds make a comeback in Kancheepuram. To realise this goal, a year ago, seed bank project was launched at Morapakkam, a village 5km from Maduranthakam. At least 13 varieties of paddy seeds were supplied to farmers. Last week, the farmers returned the seeds after the first season of yield, raising hopes that the forgotten paddy varieties will see new seasons again. Creating marketing options for farmers, the experts launched three seed banks a week ago and supplied seeds to 500 farmers in the district. Green Cause Foundation along with Bioversity International (an FAO) organisation was instrumental in setting up three seed banks in Kancheepuram district.M J Prabhu, agricultural expert and one of the organisers of the event, says it was challenging initially to convince farmers to cultivate traditional paddy seeds using organic materials. Many had left paddy cultivation and moved to other fields. We had to convince them, said Prabhu, adding that repeated awareness programmes helped. It has been a year since the initiative began, and farmers in Kancheepuram have successfully cultivated 13 traditional paddy varieties. As a token of respect, they returned four kilogrammes of paddy seeds each to Nel Jayaraman, the man who revived more than 160 varieties of traditional seeds in Tamil Nadu, and from whom farmers had collected the seeds last year. They got seeds of paddy varieties like Jeeraka Samba, Swarna masuri from me. Today they have returned the seeds. Its a good gesture. If they continue to cultivate more, it will help, said Jayaraman.The key to populrise traditional varieties is to know which seed is suitable to what kind of weather. We have a wide range of paddy seeds for each season. Some seeds need less water, and some are drought-resistant. If we choose the seed suitably, we can expect a good yield, he said.The medicinal value of traditional paddy seeds is a big advantage, feels Prabhu, especially since people are looking for healthy organic alternatives today. Seeraka samba, according to him, can reduce bad cholesterol. We chose the seeds keeping the health aspects in mind. We have selected 36 villages and in each village we are planning to distribute one seed. The first season is now over and we are looking for various marketing options. We will cover more areas in the coming months, said Prabhu."

Instead, it is contemplating promoting horticulture and irrigated dry (ID) crops such as maize and jowar. The government plans have twin advantages  the farmers get remunerative prices for their produce if they switch over to the horticulture/ID crops, and the gross value added (GVA) would improve significantly. Also, over-dependence on borewells and tanks, which is the case with paddy, is expected to come down.To start with, the ID crops and horticulture would be promoted in about 1.5 lakh hectare, which is under paddy cultivation, said a senior official from the Agriculture department, who did not want to be quoted.The government noticed that the farmers prefer to cultivate paddy even under limited water resources resulting in low net returns. As a result, the paddy prices are not encouraging. Sometimes, it is becoming difficult to ensure remunerative prices though varieties such as BPT 5204 (popularly known as samba masuri) are being exported.The minimum support price (MSP) is Rs. 1,590 per quintal. As the MSP announced by the Central government was not encouraging, the State government paid 200 more per quintal to see that the farmers would not feel the pinch of falling prices, sources say.In addition, the groundwater usage is very high. Farmers are dependent on borewells and tanks to cultivate paddy in more than 1.5 lakh hectare in the State. Also, water is not available to farmers under the Nagarjunasgar right canal for the last three years for about two lakh hectares.The approximate area used for paddy cultivation is 17.5 lakh hectare and 7.5 lakh hectare during khariff and rabi respectively. However, the cultivation during kharif is around 15.5 lakh hectare and the rest is left vacant for want of water and other reasons. The government proposes to bring down paddy cultivation from about 22 lakh hectare (both kharif and rabi) to 18 lakh hectare in a phased manner.The government, in view of these facts, is contemplating introducing agro climatic crop zone method as part of its strategies  water management, crop management and internet of things (IoT) in agriculture, to increase the farmers income. Under this method, crops suitable for the geographic region are suggested in a scientific manner. The government would encourage cultivation of fruits and vegetables, pulses and millets like jowar instead of paddy. The plans are likely to be implemented from kharif season this year.These plans, however, would not be implemented in rice bowl districts such as East and West Godavari (Godavari delta), Krishna (Krishna delta) and Nellore (Penna) and a few parts of north coastal Andhra, where farmers dependence on tanks and borewells is less. As much as 45.6 lakh hectare is used for agriculture in the State. In addition to that over 13.8 lakh hectare is under horticulture and 1.4 lakh hectare is under aquaculture. Out of 80 lakh hectare cultivable area, only 60.7 lakh hectare is being cultivated. The government feels that 11.8 lakh hectare can be brought under cultivation by following right agro climatic practices and efficient water management practices."

This means there is an argument about something that does not merit any discussion. So, let the tur come first and then discuss, Mr. Pawar said in Satara.It is too early to talk or indulge in wishful thinking about future calculations. Let us first contest the elections and win a sizeable number of seats in order to be able to form a government, Mr. Pawar said.At the same time, the NCP leader acknowledged that only the Congress, among all opposition parties, has a traditional presence in all states as opposed to the Trinamool Congress, Samajwadi Party, or the Telangana Rashtra Samiti.Mr. Gandhi on Tuesday had said he is ready for the PMs job if the Congress wins the 2019 Lok Sabha elections."

Presently, there is a single procurement centre at the mandi, where procurement of gram and lentil is underway. We are in the process of establishing another procurement centre to speed up the process, ADM Nidhi Nivedita told TOI.The administration is also contemplating to divert some farmers reaching Chhawani Anaj Mandi to other wholesale markets of the district, she added.Till now,the administration has procured gram and lentil crops worth Rs 51 crore and payment of Rs 19 crore has already been made to the farmers. The remaining amount would be paid to them soon, the ADM said.She said that the procurement of gram and lentil will continue till June 9, while the procurement of wheat will conclude on May 15.Nivedita, who on Friday morning visited the mandi, reviewed the status of registration of the farmers for procurement of their agriculture produce and transportation of the crops. She instructed the officials concerned for mapping of the warehouses to calculate the storage capacity and arrangement of basic facilities, including water and sheds for the visitors at the mandi.The ADM also asked the officials concerned for cancellation of licence of person for wrong weighing of crops."

They called their initiative Good Food for All.The participants from the rural and tribal communities were to teach the participants from low-income urban communities how to make meals healthier yet more affordable, with more green and fresh vegetables on the plate. The urban NGOs and communities, meanwhile, were to share their know-how of marketing channels and the latest in the veterinary field with the women farmers, tribal, pastoral and nomadic communities.Women do most of the work in the farms and are farmers in their own right. But no one wants to recognise this fact. So we decided to form a collective, identify small plots and farm vegetables and lentils that could be sold by us. Earlier, we did not know what to do with the excess crop. Agents would take the excess crop at a low price from us and make a profit. Today, we can sell directly to customers, said Seema Sayyed , a farmer from Osmanabad who is also a part of Swayam Shikshan Prayog, one of the four main NGOs in the initiative.On Thursday, Nitya Ghotge, a veterinarian and part of Anthra, an agricultural resource centre, held an evaluation session. The participants were from the Satara-based AWARD and the Mumbai-based rights group YUVA. Many shared their experiences and brought with them a range of indigenous agricultural produce, including varieties of kokam, a staple cool drink during the summer months.People in many communities do not eat good food, mainly because they cannot afford it. Through this programme, the urban communities got to know of the vegetables and fruits that the tribal communities consume. They have now started preparing similar food items at their common canteens, said Purnima Joshi , also from Anthra."

So, it is no wonder that many make a living selling it in the streets, on beaches and wherever crowds gather. However, J Shahul has been at it for over a decade and his stock is sold in a jiffy, especially on rainy days.The 36-year-old from Keelavasal says that he had been selling various evening roadside snacks for many years before deciding to concentrate only on boiled lentils, which people usually had no reservations on having as an evening snack. He established his shop at Keelavasal in front of Ananda Metal Company , a popular utensil store, with the result that most of the customers who came to the shop in the evening ended up snacking at his cart too. ``On an average, I earn around Rs 500 a day, which is more than sufficient to run my family and hence stuck to this trade for over 10 years, says he.In the morning, he soaks the lentils with the help of his wife who later boils them to the right consistency. ``It should not be over-boiled or under-boiled and it is important that the seeds are cooked through so that people do not have problems digesting them, he said.His cart has an assortment of side dishes which can be added to the boiled lentil based on customer preference while raw mango is finely chopped and topped on the paper cone into which the lentils are added. ``Some people like it spicy, some salty and some bland and I give it to them according to their preference, he said. Arunachalam , 45 who works in a textile shop in the area, says this is not just a snack but a fulfilling meal. ``After a packet or two of the boiled lentils, I can have a light dinner later in the evening. His spices are really good, he said. The shop opens at 7 pm and Shahul winds up around 10 by which time he would have sold over 200 to 300 packets of boiled gram. A packet of gram sells for Rs 10 whatever may be the addition but during summer he also sells water melon slices as a cooler."

It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."

(Express) A group of travellers at a farm in Nate, Ratnagiri. (Express)WHEN Nikiti Nagori (23) sipped a glass of Alphonso amras (mango pulp) at a Ratnagiri-based mango farm last weekend, she couldnt stop at one. While the Kolkata-based corporate lawyer has relished Alphonso mangoes at her office in Mumbai, she confesses nothing matches the joy of plucking mangoes from farms and having them amidst nature.In the last couple of weeks, an increasing number of travellers have visited farms in Konkan region and Dapoli to experience the natural taste of the king of fruits. While some prefer to drive to the farms, many tour groups are organising mango tasting sessions in these farms.Last weekend, we took a bunch of 15 travellers to an agro-based farm in Nate in Ratnagiri. During the tour, they were given a complete tutorial on how mangoes are cultivated, the time it takes for the fruit to ripen and when is the apt time to pluck them. The locals who worked at these farms act as our guides, Mahesh Kumar from Ramblers India Group, which organises treks for travellers, said.With urban travellers preferring to opt for farm visits, Kumar decided to introduce mango tasting in his three-day tour of Konkan region. The group relished mango products, including aamras and pickles in their lunch, and hoarded boxes of mangoes on their way back to enjoy them during summer, he said.While tourists from Mumbai, Pune and other parts of Maharashtra are regulars at such tours, travellers from other areas like Gujarat, Delhi, Karnataka, and Chennai and even foreign tourists flock to these quaint Maharashtra farms to relish mangoes cultivated in the Konkan belt, tour organisers said. A quick getaway from the routine and the urge to taste fresh produce from the farm drives them, they added.This is the first time I have visited a farm. Our group would have plucked hundreds of mangoes. The joy of eating a fresh mango, and that too amidst its natural surroundings, cannot be compared to anything. It is an unique experience, Nagori said.Cashing in on the demand, prominent travel websites are arranging special trips to mango farms in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg. Varun Gupta, CEO, Goomo said, Some of these farms provide for a different experience, including home stays and Alphonso tasting. These experiences are becoming popular and we have seen a 10 per cent increase in queries for the same from our weekend getaway travellers.A range of mango produce, namely raw mangoes in dal (lentil soup), salad made with raw mangoes, vegetable dishes made using Alphonso mangoes (savoury) and the most sought after of the lot  homemade mango icecreams  remains popular amongst tourists who visit the belt.Rahul Kulkarni, who runs Farm of Happiness at Pungus village in Sangameshwar of Ratnagiri, said: In the last two years, tours offering mango tastings have become popular. Travellers love to know how the fruit is grown and hear the local lores. Despite soaring temperatures, travellers love flocking here to taste the king of fruits.Kulkarni said that such specialised tours also offer job opportunities to local residents and an additional source of income.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Express photo by Prashant Nadkar Over 4 lakh tur growers from the state have been registered with NAFED. Express photo by Prashant NadkarMore than 2 lakh tur growers in Maharashtra have been left in the lurch as the deadline for the procurement of tur under the Price Support System expired on Tuesday. These farmers had registered with either the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation or the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation to sell their produce. But, as the deadline for the procurement is over, they dont know what to do with their produce.Tur growers have been facing losses for two consecutive years as the lentil has failed to trade even at the government-declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. With no extension in sight, farmers fear that they will have to sell their produce at cheap rates at the wholesale markets.The state government has, meanwhile, failed to meet the procurement target for tur. Till Monday, Maharashtra had reported procurement of over 3.17 lakh tonnes, way below the target of 4.47 lakh tonnes. The failure to meet the procurement target has resulted in losses worth over Rs 1,000 crore to tur growers in the state. At the wholesale market of Latur, tur has traded between Rs 4,000-4,200 throughout the season. In order to help farmers, NAFED had started procurement of the produce through the two federations, but both agencies have failed to meet their procurement deadline despite being granted an extension of almost a month. Over 4 lakh tur growers from the state have been registered with NAFED.The state had recorded purchase from over 2 lakh farmers and the total value of the transaction was slated to be around Rs 1,600 crore, of which Rs 950 crore have already been paid to the farmers. Farmers, however, have complained about the slow procurement process, which is further marred by allegations of corruption. One of the major reasons for the slow pace of procurement was the unavailability of godowns to store the produce.Around 2.2 lakh tonnes of tur still remain in the godowns, with the marketing federation able to dispose of around 40,000 tonnes as daal. Tur growers have started to protest against the stoppage of procurement. In Parbhani, growers threw tur at the local District Deputy Registrars office to protest against the stoppage. Manikarao Kadam, Parbhani district president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatna, said of the 17,000 farmers who had enrolled for procurement, only 5,000 were able to sell their produce.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5b26a9229855b70a272af880,Scent of a lemon,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/scent-of-a-lemon-231659?ref=india-new-stry,2018-05-20,"Paromita SenEXSQUEEZE MOI: The gondhoraj is not full of juice like the acid lime, nor as easy to come by as the kagzi. Photo by Subhendu ChakiThe gondhoraj, quite literally means the sultan of aroma. Even king of fragrance is a fair translation but it doesn't really do justice to the majesty of it.We are, of course, talking limes. From the football-sized grapefruit to the golf-ball sized acid lime, India has been blessed with plenty. There is the large, loose-skinned Nagpur orange, the yellow-green mosambi, the juicy kagzi, the small but sweet Darjeeling orange, naarthangai that is always pickled, the large, slightly bitter chakotra or pomelo, the Malta that grows in the northern hills, the sweet-tart sweet lemon grown mostly down South... But none of these compares to the innate kingliness of the gondhoraj.Most traditional meals in eastern India, celebratory or otherwise, start with a wedge of lemon and a pinch of salt. If you did not want to squeeze the tart fruit over any of the dishes, you could always use it at the end to wash the oiliness off your hands. Intimate meals always feature the gondhoraj - in a bowl that it shares with green chillies.Considering the sheer variety of limes available in India, it is a mystery why it is used so little in cooking. It is tamarind that is the primary souring agent in eastern India, yoghurt in the north and kokum in the South - the lime is restricted to sherbets and pickles.Not that the gondhoraj would be a great souring agent - it tends to lose its beautiful fragrance when heated. Says food historian Pritha Sen, ""The lime has always been used as a condiment, never the star ingredient."" But that might be changing.Pass a grove of gondhoraj - or even a single tree - and, like a royal fanfare, it announces it presence with a whiff of that distinct scent - clean, citrusy, with an undertone of floral sweetness.This fragrance is most intense in the oval, bright green and shiny leaves - in fact, they were used to flavour the gondhoraj bhaat, where the leaves are layered with the rice. When there were no limes in the garden, the leaves were used to flavour the pulses - masur dal or bhaja moong dal.The dark green limes are, of course, always in great demand. As they ripen, they turn a smooth light green and acquire a little juice. Not that you want a whole lot of gondhoraj juice - it is extremely sour. The gondhoraj, like kingly favour, is best savoured in small doses.The gondhoraj is actually a native of Rangpur, a hilly area in the northern part of Bangladesh - bordered on one side by Assam and the other by West Bengal - with rich golden soil. It used to grow wild there.It was possibly a poor foodie who discovered that his simple meal of overnight rice ( panta bhaat) and green chillies became a feast for the senses when flavoured with the leaves of the hardy lime tree.The Rangpur lime, a natural hybrid born off a Mandarin orange and a citron, has been known in Indian cuisine since the Mughal era, says Rishi Krishna De, assistant director in the department of agriculture of the West Bengal government. It has since migrated to the tables of the rich and thence, in the recent past, to the kitchens of fine dining restaurants.Found in the eastern part of the country, it is grown commercially in Bengal, Assam and Tripura, as well as in gardens across the country.All the citrus fruit in the world can trace their roots to the Indian subcontinent. In fact, it was the citron - father of the gondhoraj - that first travelled out of India with Alexander the Great. When it reached Europe, it was named the Citrus medica for its curative properties. The Rangpur lime, too, has travelled; among other places to Florida in the US, where it is called the Mandarin lime and grown primarily as a hardy ornamental plant that can withstand low temperatures.If you Google Rangpur lime, scientific name Citrus limona, you are sure to be disappointed. It shows a round, orange fruit that looks nothing like the green, oblong, thick-skinned gondhoraj we know and love. Pictures do not say the whole story; if you can lay your hands on a Rangpur lime, you will recognise its sweet, citrusy fragrance at once."" Gondhoraj limes are plucked before they ripen. That is why they are green in colour,"" says De. ""If left to ripen on the tree, they will turn bright yellow."" The gondhoraj that is commercially grown is usually not pure Rangpur lime but lime that has been cross-bred to be smaller in size.The thick-skinned fruit is a table lime, its fragrant but scanty juice usually squeezed over rice. At most, it is used to flavour buttermilk ( gondhoraj ghol) or sherbet. It is its leaf that is used to flavour dal or rice. In that, it resembles its cousin, the Kaffir lime, used generously in Thai cuisine. The rough-skinned Kaffir lime itself is, however, pruned off to get a more lush growth of leaves.These days, however, the gondhoraj is flavouring a host of dishes - from the pioneering Gondhoraj Bhetki to Gondhoraj Chicken to Gondhoraj Sorbet to Gondhoraj Mousse. Vegetable dishes and cocktails, too, have not escaped its influence.""The trick to the best flavour profile from gondhoraj is to get fresh, quality limes and use them fresh,"" says Joymalya Banerjee, chef-owner of the contemporary Bengali cuisine restaurant, Bohemian, in Ballygunge, Calcutta. ""Steaming or heating it to high temperatures kills 90 per cent of the gondhoraj flavour,"" says the man who came up with the recipe for Gondhoraj Bhetki when he was the head chef of the Bengali fine dining restaurant, Oh! Calcutta. ""You can say I was the one who started this trend,"" he says, while pointing out that the idea was Anjan Chatterjee's, the man who owns the Oh! Calcutta chain.Chatterjee once admitted to The Telegraph his obsession with the king of flavour and his tendency to ""follow every waft of citrus scent borne in by the sea breeze"", looking for the elusive gondhoraj. That is how he discovered that apart from the Kaffir lime, the gondhoraj has cousins in China (Canton lime) and Japan (hime). These are varieties of the same family of Rangpur limes, as is the Limao cravo found in Brazil and the Mandarin lime in the US.Replication is the best form of flattery and Chef Joy has got a lot of that. He, however, feels that none of the dishes has been able to get or consistently maintain the flavour profile of the Gondhoraj Bhetki of Oh! Calcutta. As for the Bohemian menu - tired of being referred to as the Gondhoraj Man, a name chef Karen Anand bestowed on him - the chef has taken a few of the gondhoraj dishes off the menu. Yet, the day we visited Bohemian, Gondhoraj Julep was the most ordered mocktail.Bohemian has another popular cocktail, the Gondhoraj Martini. It is flavoured with Gondhoraj Limoncello brewed under Chef Joy's supervision. The lime-rimmed martini glasses add another layer of flavour to the drink.Should not the aroma that improves everything from chicken to alcohol to dessert be given global recognition? Why then has the gondhoraj remained a local phenomenon? According to Chef Joy, that's because no one has yet been able to bottle the volatile oils of the fruit. Without that it is not possible to take the gondhoraj to foreign shores.Agriculture scientist De says gondhoraj stays fresh long enough to be exported but there is no demand for it because it is difficult to squeeze the juice out of it. Gondhoraj lemonades, however, are doing brisk business in foreign lands.While we in India are still discussing the possibility of making the gondhoraj a global flavour, a British company has beaten us to it. Liquor company Diageo has been marketing the Rangpur lime-flavoured Tonquaray Rangpur since 2006. Made in Scotland, this citrus-flavoured gin is most popular in the US. As is the Rangpur lime marmalade - the only way the Americans have made the tart limes palatable.The gondhoraj can only grow in soil that is rich and dark. That is why the Rangpur lime thrives in the dark, volcanic soil of Hawaii, as it does in eastern India. There, the king of fragrance is affectionately called the Kona lime. It is as beloved as the gondhoraj but it is not "" gondhoraj"".The sultan of aroma remains rooted firmly in the clayey soil of the Ganga delta."

His death came five days after another farmer Moolchand Meena, 65, allegedly died under similar circumstances at Lateri Mandi in Vidisha district.Omprakashs death triggered protests near the Narsinghgarh Mandi in Rajgarh district, about 140 km northwest of state capital Bhopal. Farmers staged a protest and also blocked National Highway-12 passing through the town.The agitating farmers alleged that the Rajgarh district administration had made no arrangements for them to beat the scorching heat while waiting to sell their produce.The process is too slow and we have been waiting in a queue for the last three days. There is no drinking water for us either, said farmer Ramkishan Singh.The farmers lifted the highway blockade after the district administration assured it would increase the number of weighing machines, arrange drinking water and provide other facilities.The deceaseds brother Peru Patidar, who was with him when he died, declined to say anything. Fellow farmers said the Patidars produce was masoor dal (red lentils).Rajgarh collector Karamveer Sharma said rumours spread by anti-social elements misled the farmers. It was Peru Patidar who was waiting for his turn at the mandi. Omprakash Patidar came to the mandi in the afternoon only to give his brother food.Sharma added, Weighing of the agriculture produce at the mandi was over for the day at 3.30pm, whereas Omprakash Patidar died at 5pm. He was having his food in the mandis canteen when he collapsed. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, where a doctor declared him dead. In the preliminary post-mortem report, it was found that he died of cardiac arrest."

His proposed reforms included devaluing the rupee and abolishing many of the stringent regulations that prevented thefree flow of trade. These unprecedented measures projected India into the global marketplace, accelerating economic growth and significantly reducing poverty. Twenty-seven years later, Indias economy continues to grow. According to a recent report by Euromonitor International, India was projected to be the fastest-growing major economy in 2017 and the third largest consumer market, ahead of Germany and Japan, by 2030. By then, India is also slated to have the largest working-age population on the planet. To put this another way, one quarter of India's 1.1 billion people were under the age of 15, more than half were under age 25, and more than two-thirds were under age 35, according to a 2009 study by The Heritage Foundation. Despite Indias burgeoning economy, there are concerns that the country may not have enough jobs to support the population without similar reforms in education, employment, and e-commerce. Nevertheless, Naturevibe Botanicals CEO, Rishabh Chokhani, believes there are three ways in which India can compete and collaborate with the western marketplace.Shared interest in organic foods and natural productsNumerous articles reveal that US millennials, including the younger Generation Y, and Generation Z have embraced the natural health industry, taking it from a yuppie niche to a widespread way of life. As interest in the market grows, competition will reduce prices, making organic foods and natural products increasingly affordable for the lower and middle classes.According to research, a similar interest is growing in India, where the holistic philosophy known as Ayurveda has been in use for centuries. This natural approach to health and wellness uses a positive mindset and organic products  such as botanicals, herbals, and essential oils  to achieve an optimum state of mind-and-body wellbeing. These are extensions of techniques that are already being used in spas and yoga studios throughout the US.As of 2011, the National Ayurveda Medical Association had over 30 training programs throughout the country, while the Scripps Center for Integrative Medicine offered a four-part physician training course in association with the Maharishi Ayur-Veda Association of America (MAAA)  the organization that originally pioneered the use of Indian meditation, yoga, and Ayurveda techniques in the US in the late 1950s.2. Shared interest in technology-based entrepreneurshipOf Indias nearly 1.3 billion inhabitants, 521.9 million are employed and 47% areemployed in agriculture. This makes agrarian occupations the primary ballast of Indias workforce and economy, despite cross-cultural stereotypes that routinely feature technology. Common commodities include dairy products, cotton, fish, goats, jute, lentils, oilseed, onions, potatoes, poultry, rice, sheep, sugarcane, tea, and wheat.However, with the population growing at an annual rate of 1.17%, efforts must be made in other sectors to support the growing influx of workers that are expected to flood the workforce by 2030. Fortunately, India is fast becoming a hub of entrepreneurship and digital interconnectivity, which has lowered the unemployment rate and provided jobs with a greater degree of technical skill to match the efforts that are also being made in education. This growing emphasis on entrepreneurship and e-commerce has increased the use of smartphones and the popularity of online shopping.3. Shared interest in online shoppingUS millennials are well known for their online shopping habits, which have closed the doors of more than one superstoreand jeopardized the commercial health of countless others. Stores like Mervyns have gone bankrupt, while chains like Kohls are struggling to survive. Good quality photos, free shipping, fast delivery, and easy exchanges or returns have fueled online sales, making Internet shopping a fast, convenient way to make purchases, even if shoppers cant view the product in person.In India, the November 2016 demonetization policy aims to ditch cash flow to encourage digital purchases. This is in keeping with the greater emphasis on technology, entrepreneurship, and a free-market economy. As cash flow ceases and startups continue to flourish, online sales will spike  not just in India, but also across continents.Thus, Indias knowledge of agriculture, combined with its increasing openness to a free-market economy, is good news for the growing interest in holistic health practices on both side of the Atlantic. By devoting more land to the cultivation of superfoods and botanical products (which are already a large part of Indian culture) and using technology to market and sell them online, both the East and the West could benefit by the alliance."

After the election you will get to know (the outcome). (Source: Twitter/@nimmasuresh)The opposition BJP today fielded senior leader S Suresh Kumar as its candidate in the election for the post of Karnataka Assembly Speaker to be held tomorrow, apparently to force a trial of strength before the H D Kumaraswamy government seeks vote of confidence.Suresh Kumar, a fifth term MLA from the city, filed his nomination papers before Assembly Secretary S Murthy at Vidhana Soudha, the seat of the state legislature.The Congress-JD(S) coalition, which claims to enjoy the support of 117 MLAs, has plumped for Congresss Ramesh Kumar, a former Speaker, as its candidate for the post. Ramesh Kumar also filed his nomination papers.Suresh Kumar told reporters that he has filed his nomination on the directions from BJPs state unit chief B S Yeddyurappa and other leaders. Based on the strength of numbers and various other factors, our party leaders have confidence that I will win. With that confidence I have filed my nomination, he said.Asked about his chances of winning since the BJP has only 104 MLAs on its side, Suresh Kumar said, I have filed my nomination. There is election tomorrow at 12.15 pm. After the election you will get to know (the outcome).Suresh Kumar was accompanied by two BJP MLAs C N Ashwathnarayan and Sunil Kumar while filing the nomination. In contrast, Ramesh Kumar was accompanied by Karnataka state Congress president and Deputy Chief Minister G Parameshwara, former chief minister Siddaramaiah and a host of Congress MLAs and leaders, while filing the nomination.The Congress and JD(S) had unanimously chosen Ramesh Kumar as their candidate for the Speakers post, Siddaramaiah told reporters after the nomination was filed. He said, I got to know that the BJP has also filed nomination I hope they will withdraw. If election happens Ramesh Kumars victory is certain.Pointing out that Ramesh Kumar has experience as Speaker (from 1994 to 1999), Siddaramaiah said, he was known as a good presiding officer and had conducted House proceedings in a smooth manner then. After the election of the Speaker, the crucial floor test will take place, when Chief Minister H D Kumaraswmay will seek vote of confidence.Kumaraswamy and his deputy  Congress G Parameshwara were sworn-in yesterday at a ceremony that turned into a grand spectacle of unity by leaders of regional parties of various hues, signalling emergence of an anti-BJP bloc for the 2019 Lok Sabha polls.The three-day-old B S Yeddyurappa-led BJP government in Karnataka had collapsed on May 19, with the chief minister announcing his decision to resign without facing a trust vote, with the numbers not in his favour. Governor Vajubhai Vala had then invited Kumaraswamy to form the government and prove his majority within 15 days.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A time when the devout fast from pre-dawn to sunset. It is also when the citys quaint areas  the bylanes off Mohammed Ali Road Bhendi Bazar and the heart of Bohri Mohalla  come to life with mouth-watering foods. BT went to the most popular of these spots  the bustling and beautiful Minara Masjid gully. Head here by 7 pm to catch the buzz, sights and sounds that it is so known for. And take your appetites along. The brightly-lit lane has little stalls on either side dishing up rolls, kebabs, baida roti, rich haleem and khichda , chilled firnis and, of course, piping hot malpuas, drizzled with thick cream. Heres more...Right at the entrance of the lane is a little makeshift stall with a huge handi or cauldron of khichda. This is a specialty  made of delicious, slow-cooked meat and lentils and garnished with thin slices of garlic, birasta (fried onion), mint leaves, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Its said to infuse energy in those who are fasting to last through the day! You will also find a lighter and creamier version of the dish  the Hyderbadi badaami haleem  here.There are several finger foods to tuck into. Try the Chicken 65 (a fiery import from Andhra Pradesh), garam samosas, masala aloo, and more, with some naan.When youre here, reserve your appetite for kebabs, kheema, boti, bheja fry and other skewered fare, hot off the sigdi and made on a large, iron tawa. These dishes must be had steaming hot, with dollops of tangy mint chutney, onion and mint leaves.An unmissable part of your gastronomic trail is the malpua and it deserves special mention. It is essentially a large pancake-like sweet, made of egg, maida, sugar, saffron and milk. The round, sweet malpua is best had hot, straight from the kadhai, with a lavish dollop of thick cream or malai. Making it is also quite an art! First the eggs are beaten and charoli nuts, sugar and saffron are added to this. The malupa maker then swirls a generous portion into the smoking kadhai and deep fries it in ghee. If you want to have a small portion, ask for a single or then have the double and rabdi varieties.You cant leave here without a round or two of cold firni . You can also end your repast with sandan  the steamed sweet that looks like an idli, soft shahi tukda, cold fruity milkshakes, black currant and dudhi halwa and the mithai-centred flaky phool khaja."

(Express file photo) Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. (Express file photo)Frustrated by the long wait to sell his produce of chana, a farmer stormed into the mandi office here last week and threatened: If I am not able to sell my crop on Monday, I will set it afire here. The threat, which came against the backdrop of a farmers death at the mandi as he waited to sell his produce, jolted the officials into action. They had a tough time pacifying the farmer.With hundreds of farmers waiting outside mandis in temperatures above 40 degree Celsius to sell their produce of chana, lentil and mustard to the government, scenes like these are becoming common across Madhya Pradesh. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday asked Collectors to take steps to reduce delays at mandis. The Collectors have been told to ensure that limited number of farmers are called to the mandis so that there are no queues. BJPs Kisan Morcha on Thursday asked its members to reach mandis and offer cold drinking water to the waiting farmers from May 25 to June 15.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavThe BJP governments direction came a day after the Congress asked its workers to reach mandis and procurement centres and interact with farmers. Alleging that farmers are dying in the state due to firing, high debts, farm losses and now waiting to sell their crops, state Congress chief Kamal Nath has said the state government claims to be pro-farmer but they are the ones to suffer the most.The long queues at mandis and procurement centres follow the governments decision to buy wheat, gram, mustard and lentil directly from the farmers. The procurement of wheat began on March 15 and will continue till May 26 while purchase of chana, mustard and lentil began on April 10 and will continue till June 9. As of Thursday, the state government has procured 9.79 lakh MT chana, the highest ever in the country, and 70.58 lakh MT wheat.Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. The MSPs for chana, mustard and lentil are Rs 4,400, Rs 4,250 and Rs 4,000, respectively. Shortage of weighing machines and porters is aggravating the situation because only a limited number of trolleys can be weighed at the smaller mandis like the one at Lateri.Most mandis are not equipped with a weighbridge that can quickly weigh a loaded and unloaded trolley to determine the produce. The current process involves emptying a trolley on ground, distributing the content in sacks, weighing them and sealing them. It takes up to 80 minutes to weigh a 40-quintal trolley. After the death of the farmer last week, the Lateri Mandi increased the number of weighing scales but they are still proving inadequate to cater to the rush.Lateri, one of the smaller mandis, caters to 10,000 farmers living in a radius of 35 km. Once the farmers reach the mandi, before their turn or after, they dont go back home so that they save on diesel or rent of tractor-trolleys. Also, they have no option but to sell to the government because traders are offering much less. The farmers, however, said that if they sell to traders, they get the money immediately, but the proceeds from selling to the government is deposited after some days.We are angry with the government. We need money on time. No point getting something extra when the need is over, said Babu Khan, a farmer from Lateri, when asked about the extra money he will get by selling his produce to the government. Mandi officials, on the other hand, said the farmers either come before the due date or later and insist on selling their produce immediately. Even when they are told to go home and come at a later scheduled date, they dont go. This makes things unmanageable, said mandi official Vishwanath Dhamde.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This year, 1,000 families were selected from different parts of Old City and an entire months ration was distributed to them so that they do not face any difficulties during the holy month, he said.The welfare trust was started by the late Mohd Zaheeruddin Khan in the year 2003 to initially provide succour to 70 poor and needy families. Now, the trust serves over a thousand families, and even arranges for Iftar meals every single day during Ramzan.While the quantity of ration distributed depends on the number of family members, each ration kit typically contains essentials items like rice, onions, oil, wheat, two types of lentils, chilli powder, turmeric powder, dates, beans and some spices.Besides Masiuddin, his three sons, Mohd Azharuddin Khan, Mohd Javeeduddin Khan and Mohd Faisaluddin Khan are members of the trust.Apart from providing free ration during Ramzan, the foundation also provides a monthly pension amount of Rs 300 to the elderly and Rs 500 to the disabled along with monetary support for medicines."

Telegraph picturePatna: An MP from the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), which is part of the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance, on Monday staged a dharna against the Narendra Modi government at the Centre and the Nitish Kumar government in Bihar.Veena Devi, the LJP MP from Munger, was protesting what she called the lack of government help for pulse farmers in the Mokama taal (lake) area. Veena said she decided to sit on dharna with farmers at Mokama chowk, around 100 km east of Patna, as she failed to get a response from Union agriculture minister Radhamohan Singh, river development & Ganga rejuvenation minister Nitin Gadkari, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and even Veena's party boss and consumer affairs, food and public distribution minister Ram Vilas Paswan.""The farmers growing pulses in the taal area face many problems - there is no storage facility for their produce, irrigation and marketing facilities are poor - leaving them with no other alternative but to sell their produce at lower price to middlemen,"" Veena explained.The pulse producing belt around the taal includes areas such as Mokama, Barh, Barahiya, Lakhisarai, and Sheikhpura.Veena claimed that after trying in vain to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi for a while, she could finally meet him on May 19. The Munger MP said that the Prime Minister listened to her grievances and assured he would take up the case. However, Veena added, her biggest disappointment was that despite several attempts to meet chief minister Nitish Kumar and her party boss Ram Vilas Paswan, none of them gave her time.The agitating farmers on Monday paralysed movement of vehicles on highways passing through the area and also stopped trains. The Tata-Danapur Express was stranded at Barh junction for hours due to the farmers' protest.The Mokama taal area alone constitutes 1.16 lakh hectares of the total 2.5 crore hectares on which pulses are grown in the country. The taal is spread over 1,062 sq km comprising seven continuous lakes and is fed by the Ganga, Punpun, Harohar and several other local rivers. It stays submerged in four- to six-foot-deep water from July to September. The farmers grow chana (gram) and masur - varieties of pulses - once the water recedes in September and October.Farmers have been fighting for water management and development of the Mokama taal area for decades.JDU MLC Neeraj Kumar, who hails from the Mokama taal area, said: ""The main problem behind farmers' plight is poor and irregular pulses procurement by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (Nafed), which is a central agency.""Neeraj claimed that Nitish has taken various initiative to develop the taal area such as building roads, electrifying villages and constructing canals."

(Express Photo by Deepak Daware) Farmers sell their harvest at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee mandi at Amravati, Maharashtra. (Express Photo by Deepak Daware)When in mid-December, Anand Pawar decided to register the standing tur (pigeon-pea) on 10 out of his 50-acre holding with the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federations purchase centre at Latur, he was quite hopeful of realising the governments minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,450 per quintal for the soon-to-be-harvested crop. At the time of registration, this farmer from Harangul Khurd village of Latur taluka was even promised he would soon receive an SMS, specifying the date and time for him to proceed to make the sale at the centre.The SMS never came and, more than five months later, Pawar is still stuck with the 65 quintals of tur he harvested in mid-January. And he deeply regrets not having sold his crop then at the prevailing market rate of Rs 4,200-4,250 per quintal. Tur is currently trading in the Latur market yard at Rs 3,550-3,600 per quintal. Why promise something you did not intend to deliver? What option do I have other than sell at todays going price? I need the money for my next crop, with the monsoon rains just 2-3 weeks away, says Pawar, whose sole consolation is from the soyabean on his balance 40 acres. While it also sold initially below the MSP of Rs 3,050 per quintal  at Rs 2,550-2,600 in November and Rs 2,800-2,900 in December  prices rose significantly thereafter. Pawar could fetch Rs 3,800-3,900 per quintal for his last lot of soyabean sold in early-April.Pawar is a relatively better-off farmer, who was able to make some money by not selling his entire soyabean crop during the peak marketing season of November-December. But 2017-18 has been an unmitigated disaster even for him, when it comes to pulses. For growers of tur, urad (black gram), moong (green gram), chana (chickpea) and masur (lentil), this is a year they would simply not want to remember.ALSO READ | Does growth in pulses output mean India has reached self-sufficiency?The curse of low realisations for farmers  ironically, in a crop where India has been perpetually import-dependent  comes despite government agencies undertaking record procurement during the last two years. In the 2015-16 crop year (July-June), a mere 1.19 lakh tonnes (lt) of pulses were procured under the Price Stabilisation Fund set up by the Narendra Modi government: 50,422.53 tonnes during kharif and 69,049.08 tonnes in the rabi marketing season. In 2016-17, procurement by the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED), Food Corporation of India and Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium rose over 13 times to 15.62 lt. That included 14.74 lt of kharif pulses (11.66 lt tur, 2.20 lt moong and 0.89 lt urad) and 0.87 lt of rabi pulses (0.60 lt chana and 0.27 lt masur).In the current year, procurement, which is ongoing, is set to further double. NAFED, the only government agency now procuring under the so-called Price Support Scheme (PSS), has till now bought 14.59 lt of chana, 8.58 lt of tur, 2.95 lt of moong, 2.03 lt of urad and 1.36 lt of masoor. That adds up to around 29.50 lt. The final figure could well cross 30 lt  unprecedented as far as pulses go.But unlike for wheat and paddy  for which there are established systems that have stood the test of time  the actual process of procurement has been far from smooth in the case of pulses. Under PSS, the MSP-based procurement is done by state marketing federations that are sub-agents of NAFED. In states such as Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra, farmers wanting to sell are required to register themselves first at the procurement centres of their areas. As part of this process, they have to mention the area planted under a particular crop, while providing proof of land ownership (copy of 7/12 revenue extract) and also their Aadhaar identification and bank account numbers. Once registration happens, the farmers are supposed to get an SMS intimation of the date for bringing their produce, the idea being to avoid overcrowding at the procurement centres. Payments, too, are to be credited directly into their bank accounts within 48 hours of the sale taking place.However, things havent quite worked that way on the ground.ALSO READ | Breeding challenges: Hybrid rice clicks better in poor than agriculturally prosperous statesIn MP, farmers have had to wait in long queues at the mandis for selling their chana and masur at the governments MSPs. There have even been reports of a couple of farmers dying after standing for hours in the searing summer heat. The situation has been rendered worse by the shortage of weighing machines and porters, especially in the smaller mandis. Notwithstanding all this, government agencies, as on May 22, had managed to procure 9.10 lt of chana from MP (worth Rs 4,003.96 crore at the MSP of Rs 4,400 per quintal) and another 2.67 lt (Rs 1,174.99 crore) from Rajasthan. The agencies also bought 1.34 lt of masur from MP, whose MSP value was Rs 571.23 crore. Both MP and Rajasthan are, incidentally, headed for state assembly polls in November-December this year.In Maharashtra, many farmers registered their crop at government purchase centres, but could not sell a single quintal at the MSP. Pawar sought to sell, apart from his 65 quintals of tur, also 25 quintals of chana grown on five acres this rabi season. I went to the centre on Monday to make a final enquiry on whether at least my chana would be procured. But the officials could not give any definite date. How does this government really expect our incomes to double?, he asks sarcastically.Government agencies procured 4.01 lt of tur from Maharashtra is the 2016-17 kharif marketing season. This time, they purchased another 3.25 lt, worth Rs 1,770.84 crore at the MSP, but farmers havent received even half of this amount so far (when they were supposed to get paid within 48 hours). The reason for it is that the procured produce has not been moved from the centres to the designated godowns. NAFED will not realise the payments without that. But the produce cannot be moved, as there is no space in the godowns, which are full with the unsold tur and chana of last year, admits a Maharashtra government official.With the new planting season about to start, NAFED is desperately issuing tenders for offloading its inventories. Total unsold stocks of pulses in government godowns, from two years of record procurement, are estimated at more than 40 lt. These stocks  on top of continuing imports  will exert further pressure on prices when the next crop arrives from September. The only thing that can prevent such an eventuality is drought. That, again, isnt going to help farmers.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Devarapalli Prakash Rao at his tea stall in Cuttack.Devarapalli Prakash Rao, who runs a small tea stall in Buxi Bazar area of Cuttack, shot to national fame over the weekend of May 26-27. Invited by the Prime Ministers Office, he met Narendra Modi on the backstage minutes before the Prime Ministers rally at Cuttacks Kila Padia (Fort Grounds) on the first day.The Prime Minister mentioned me during his Mann Ki Baat programme the following day, a beaming Rao told The Sunday Express. Modi also tweeted about Rao, who has been running a school for slum children since 2000, using half of the roughly Rs 700 he makes each day selling tea.The tweet, with a picture of Rao and some of the students whose life he is transforming, attracted nearly 8,000 likes and over 1,700 retweets. While Rao, 60, is not exactly new to fame, having won multiple awards at the state level  Human Rights Award (2016) and Annie Besant Award (2015), among others  this certainly made many people outside of Buxi Bazar in Cuttack aware of his work.But over the years, recognition, he said, has done little to solve problems with which he wrestles every day.Raos Asha O Aswasana School is right behind his dilapidated two-room house, which previously served as the school, near Buxi Bazar. This area is largely populated by Telugu-speaking immigrant settlers, and some Muslim and Christian families, Rao said.The main classroom is about 150 square feet, with a tiny office on one side and a pre-nursery room on the other. It has 74 students and six women teachers  or guru maas, as they are called. Almost all the students come from nearby slums.The (school) land belongs to the Dharakote royal family from Ganjam district, Rao said. The landowners have not yet bothered me about the land, but the prospect of eviction haunts me.He came close to it in 2013, when a man came to the school and claimed that he had bought the land and wanted to raze the school and the slums. Timely intervention by the Cuttack district administration saved Raos labour of love  it was found out that the man had fake land documents.Rao and his guru maas also recall the 17 carefree months from March 2013, when they used to receive books and free meals for the children after the school was recognised under the Labour Ministrys National Child Labour Project (NCLP). The school was eligible because parents of most students are trolley rickshaw drivers, drain cleaners, and daily labourers.In 2014, the Centre issued a notification to states to close NCLP schools from September 30 and reallocate the students to nearby government schools to reduce government expenditure. That was a disaster, said Gitarani Panda, a teacher. The children in our school, who come from nearby slums, refused to attend the closest government school. They were used to the flexible teaching regime of three hours in our school.Raos school runs six days a week from 9.30 am to 12.30 pm. The curriculum follows the prescribed norms of Odishas state education board, but the timetable is flexible. Sometimes we just sing and dance after an hour of math. The school always tries to keep these kids interested, said Namita Ghosh, another teacher.After NCLPs closure of schools, Rao continued to run his school without government aid. He said that the financial toll is hard and the occasional help from philanthropists, in cash and kind, is not enough. The humble meal of dalmaa-bhata (lentils and rice) for the students, Rs 1,200 salary per teacher, and the cost of utilities is a crushing burden for him. I am thankful that my wife, a staff nurse at a government medical college, bore all expenses of our two daughters, he said.The school has students from pre-nursery to Class III. Rao then personally helps the students find places in Class IV in Cuttacks government schools. The quality of education at our school is recognised by the government schools, which is why they take in our students. But our guru maas sometimes struggle to teach English correctly, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b1b00ee9855b76d5703600f,Farmers forced to sell pulses below minimum support price,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/patna/farmers-forced-to-sell-pulses-below-minimum-support-price/articleshow/64440338.cms,2018-06-04,"PATNA: Farmers in Bihar are under stress as the prices of agricultural commodities like pulses have fallen sharply in the past few months. Traders claim the prices of pulses and spices have plunged 20% below the minimum support price (MSP) in the last eight months.The prices of commodities like diesel and petrol have increased drastically, but that of agricultural produce have remained low. Farmers are under immense pressure as transportation of foodgrains is affected. The support prices are below 20-25% than it should be, because of which the market value is also less. We have suffered huge losses, Yashwant Kumar Rai, a farmer from Rohtas , told this newspaper on Wednesday.Sudarshan Pandey from Buxar said, Tur dal is mainly produced from December to February and its prices normally rise by March. But even in May this year, the prices are low. Farmers are getting zero benefit from pulse farming.According to Subodh Kumar, a trader in Mithapur vegetable market, the prices of various agricultural commodities, including lentils and spices, have sharply decreased. Till April 2017, Arhar dal was Rs160/kg, but has been around Rs62-65/kg for the past eight months. Likewise, Masur, Moong and Chana dal were sold at Rs60, Rs90 and Rs120 per kg respectively, but their prices have also witnessed a steep fall over the last eight months. The prices of other spices like cumin, turmeric and black pepper have also decreased.Elaborating the reasons behind fall in prices, deputy director (agro) at state agriculture department, Anil Kumar Jha said, The prices of pulses have gone down because of good production throughout the year. Despite the good yield, farmers kept producing the same varieties as cropping pattern is hardly changed in the state.For instance, he explained, The support price (decided by the government) of Tur dal at present is Rs54.50/kg and its market price is Rs64/kg. Based on this, farmers in Bihar are under moderate conditions as the actual realization is running in positive direction. The condition of loss comes when the support price is very less than the market price.Residents, on the other hand, are upbeat over the lower prices of dal. Geeta Devi of Meethapur said, There was a time when dal was costlier than chicken, but it is affordable for all."

The types of pulses to be procured are gram, moong, arhar and masur.The extended Mokama tal area that encompasses parts of Patna and Nalanda districts is famous for the production of pulses. Actually, the four districts constitute the one uniform zone, Singh said.The NAFED has already started the work and around 1,900 metric tonnes of pulses have already been procured till Monday. In the meantime, a more elaborate system is being worked out. We are working on the detailed action plan, Singh said.Traditionally, only paddy used to be procured from the farmers of the state at the MSP. This year, we introduced the procurement of wheat at MSP in 18 districts of the state. Now, from this year, the procurement of pulses would also be done, Singh said, adding that the Centre has fixed MSP for 25 items of agriculture, including foodgrains and pulses.He said paddy is procured by Primary Agriculture Credit Societies (PACS), wheat by Vyaapaar Mandal and NAFED has been selected as the agency for the procurement of pulses in the state.The selection of NAFED has been done for the primary reason that the procured pulses have to be stored in specially designed godowns to prevent their perforation and other deformities in them. NAFED has access to such specially-made godowns, Singh said, adding the godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) are already full.The first round of talks has already been held with the NAFED representatives. It is for the first time that a decision has been taken to procure pulses from the farmers at the MSP rates, Singh said, adding: Once the system has been set up, the procurement will become a continuous process."

As per the list India submitted to the WTO, it had proposed to hike customs duty on specified motorcycles, which include Harley Davidson, to 50 per cent.For automobiles and earth moving equipment, SIM socket/other mechanical items (metal) for use in the manufacture of cellular mobile phones, the duty has been hiked to 25 per cent from 15 per cent.Deloitte India Partner M S Mani said that on several products such as pulses, the increase is very steep (30 per cent to 70 per cent).For iron and steel products, the increase is at least 50 per cent of the existing rate (from 15 to upwards of 22.5 per cent).""The increase in the customs duties on goods originating from the USA was expected, but the magnitude of the increases would have been unexpected. These increases would make the domestic products cheaper compared to imports and lead to domestic manufacturing/demand pick-ups as a corollary,"" Mani said.The decision to hike duties is in retaliation to the unilateral increase in tariff by the US on certain steel and aluminium products earlier this year which had tariff implication of USD 241 million on India.The duty hike by India would have equivalent tariff implications for the US.On March 9, US President Donald Trump imposed heavy tariffs on imported steel and aluminium items, a move that has sparked fears of a global trade war.India has said the duty imposed by the US has affected steel exports by USD 198.6 million and aluminium shipments by USD 42.4 million.India has also dragged the US to the World Trade Organisation's (WTO) dispute settlement mechanism over the imposition of import duties on steel and aluminium.India exports steel and aluminium products worth about USD 1.5 billion to the US every year.

Jokes about her cooking also irritated her. And when she was fed up with her relatives' constant taunts, she decided to take action. On Monday, the 28-year-old allegedly poisoned food at her relative's house-warming party in Maharashtra's Raigad district. Five people died, including four children, and 120 guests fell sick after consuming the insecticide-laden daal (lentils), police said.Pragya Survase, a housewife, allegedly mixed insecticide in the food and served it to the guests at her relative Subhash Mane's home in Mahad village.

One way is through sporting success.So, along with Schwarzenegger, other stars from Hollywood and Bollywood such as Sylvester Stallone and Salman Khan are held up as heroes, and the gyms stay busy for hours, filled with music and camaraderie as men tone their bodies to perfection.It was not always so.Afghan bodybuilding legend Aziz Arezo reminisces about his time as a teenage lifter, when there were ""very, very few people"" in the capital who knew anything about the sport.He himself was only inspired to take it up after seeing movies and posters featuring foreigners such as Schwarzenegger.""Arnold was my... role model,"" he says, smiling as he remembers how expensive postcards featuring the star were.Speaking to AFP between lifting weights at his small gym in Kabul, Arezo -- his physique not quite what it was in his glorious bodybuilding past -- reels off his long list of accolades, including being named Afghanistan's first master sport bodybuilder by the country's Olympic Committee in the 1970s.It is a long career, and at times a lonely one.Though now a trainer himself, guiding hundreds of Afghan youths through lifts and crunches, he never had the guidance of one.Years ago he made the equipment and dumbbells in his gym from spare car parts as there was no place to buy them.""I have been a teacher of myself,"" he says, adding that his dumbbells are ""more efficient than foreign dumbbells"".Under Taliban rule, he worked for four months in Kabul before eventually fleeing again, fearing their restrictions despite their views on bodybuilding.""Nowadays, bodybuilding clubs are everywhere in the city, and everyone has made a gym of his own,"" he says.He has trained hundreds of bodybuilders in his career, but is suspicious of new methods employed by many young Afghans, including taking protein supplements to boost their abilities.""I believe if you do sport or exercise naturally, it is better than protein,"" he says, warning of detrimental side effects.""Before my workout... I was drinking carrot and banana juice, and post-training, I was taking two eggs, three glasses of milk, one bowl of beans and lentils, and it was everyday food for me,"" he says.""Today's bodybuilding is not natural.""Regardless of the method, sport can help ease the psychological trauma of nearly four decades of war, says Ali Fitrat, a psychology professor at Kabul University.Afghans are stressed socially, culturally, financially and politically, he said, citing fighting, insecurity and poor economic conditions as some of the most devastating factors.In such a conservative, gender-segregated society, sexual frustration is another stress factor.""People do not have access to sex, and men and women are segregated in all parts of their lives,"" Fitrat told AFP. ""(But) sex is also a need, and (the lack of it) is one of the reasons for stress in our society.""As such, he says sports such as bodybuilding can play a ""vital role"" in helping to release stress and tension.But, like Mohammadi, he also suggests that young men in particular have a strong desire to make their mark.""They want to show their bodies, they want to attract the attention of the people, and they want to have different looks and to look different than the others,"" he said.However, security continues to deteriorate in Kabul, where both the Taliban and the Islamic State group have stepped up their attacks.Many fearful residents now limit their movements. Arezo says his gym's membership has shrunk.""Nowadays people are concerned about fleeing the country rather than taking up sport,"" he says."

The minimum support price for paddy has been hiked by Rs 200, or about 13 per cent, and the rest by up to 50 per cent. The decision, taken by the Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, comes less than a year before next general elections.Also, by the end of this year, assembly elections will be held in three BJP-ruled states - Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh - where farmers, already restive, form a chunk of the populationThe delay in implementation of a big hike in support prices -- one of the pre-election promises of the BJP -- has triggered huge protests by farmers in many parts of the country.. They also had the support of the opposition, which has highlighted farmers' suicides to accuse the government of being insensitive to farmers' demands. While the move is expected to boost the rural economy, there are concerns that it could translate into food inflation.Called it a ""historic decision"" by the NDA government, Home Minister Rajnath Singh said, ""Farmers are the largest producer, consumer and customer in this country but they never got the price they deserved for their produce. Modi ji understood this and now farmers will get 1.5 times more MSP on their produce.""PM Modi, who has promised to increase farm incomes, tweeted:        -      1.5  MSP      ,                      -   - Narendra Modi (@narendramodi) July 4, 2018The MSP is like a shock absorber by the government to safeguard farmers against any sudden fall in produce prices. The MSP is a guaranteed price for their produce. In February, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley while presenting his fourth budget in the Modi government, promised to set MSP at 1.5 times the cost of production.The government was regularly attacked by farmer associations and the opposition for making ""hollow promises"" about doubling their income by 2022.Congress President Rahul Gandhi had accused the prime minister of ""finishing the farmer"". He said, ""The government has to help the farmer. How will that happen? Through MSP and loan waivers. In the absence of such measures, small farmers are unable to make any money.""Last year saw massive protests by farmer associations across the country over MSP and loan waivers. It started last summer in Madhya Pradesh, where six farmers were killed in police firing, and spread to other states where farmers destroyed fresh produce in symbolic protest. In March, it took shape of the colossal Kisan Long March in Maharashtra, in which around 50,000 farmers walked 180 km from Nasik to Mumbai.Last month, farmers across the country held a 10-day ""Gaon Bandh"", during which thousands refused to send supply of fruits, vegetables and dairy products to cities.According to the list, the MSP of common grade paddy has been fixed at Rs 1,750 per quintal. The MSP for top variety cotton will be Rs 5,450, up from 4,320 per quintal. The price for two varieties of pulses -- urad (lentil) and tur -- will see a revision of about Rs 200 per quintal."

Cherry producers also felt the pinch during their short cherry season, as they face an additional 25 per cent tariff in China.India last month submitted a revised list of 30 items -- including motorcycle, certain iron and steel goods, boric acid and lentils -- to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on which it proposes to raise customs duty by up to 50 percent. In May, India notified the WTO that it plans to raise its tariff before June 21 on apples from the already very high level of 50 per cent to 80 per cent.The European Union (EU) has also announced tariffs on American imports.""The USDA will not stand by while our hard-working agricultural producers bear the brunt of unfriendly tariffs enacted by foreign nations. The programmes we are announcing today help ensure our nation's agriculture continues to feed the world and innovate to meet the demand,"" Mr Perdue said.Of the total unjustified retaliatory tariffs imposed on the US, a disproportionate amount was targeted directly at American farmers, the Department of Agriculture said.Trade damage from such retaliation has impacted a host of US commodities, including field crops like soybeans and sorghum, livestock products like milk and pork, and many fruits, nuts and other specialty crops, it said.High tariffs disrupt normal marketing patterns, affecting prices and raising costs by forcing commodities to find new markets.Additionally, American goods shipped overseas are being slowed from reaching market by unusually strict or cumbersome entry procedures, which can affect the quality and marketability of perishable crops, it said.""He (Trump) understands the farmers in this country feed us, they fuel us, they clothe us and he'll do everything he can to protect them. He is working with the Department of Agriculture to protect them and he'll keep doing that,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Hogan Gidley told reporters during Air Force One Gaggle.Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin said ""the bailouts, tweets, and bragging won't save the lost crop value for our farmers and won't protect their reputations around the world as reliable sellers.""""The president's scorched earth trade war has put a lot at stake for Illinois and our rural economy. Soybean farmers in Illinois tell me that since the start of the president's trade war, they've seen their crop value drop by 20 per cent.""Declaring a trade war on the world, instead of the truly bad actors, leaves a lot of collateral damage,"" Mr Durbin added."
5ce7c4c7e8e3fc56af41b2e5,The pilgrimage’s progress,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-pilgrimages-progress/article25282141.ece,2018-10-22,"I remember seeing the birth of Ayyappa on stage during a Kathakali performance. Following the drama of Bhasmasuras destruction by Vishnu as Mohini, Shivas fear turning to gratitude, the two male gods retreated behind the curtain drawn across the stage. The curtain trembled to the clash and roar of cymbals, drums and singing, before being lowered to reveal an image of Ayyappa. We were overawed by the performance and did not think of raising questions about the ways of the gods. I remember too, in the late 1960s, participating in the kettanara rituals (the placing of the bundle of offerings and some items for sustenance on the pilgrims head before he sets off on the pilgrimage) of young cousins departing for Sabarimala on foot. The ritual involved all the women in the household. The young men were unshaven, in black, had donned the mala, and were ready to walk the long route barefoot after having observed their 41-dayvrathams. I was overawed by the faith of the young Ayyappa, the women, and was too young to raise any why nots.Shortcuts and compromisesIn the 1960s, the young Ayyappa would have been among the 15,000 or so who made that arduous journey. No longer. In the past five decades, as the numbers have burgeoned to millions, Lord Ayyappa has been witness to, and extremely tolerant of, every aspect of the pilgrimage being changed beyond recognition. Let us begin with the most important reason being cited for prohibiting women pilgrims of menstruating age: that they cannot maintain the 41-dayvratham. Yet, as we know from personal knowledge, and from detailed anthropological studies of this pilgrimage, the shortcuts and compromises on that earlier observance have been many and Lord Ayyappa himself seems to have taken the changes in his stride.Not all those who reach the foot of the 18 steps that have to be mounted for the darshan of the celibate god observe all aspects of thevratham. A corporate employee, such as one in my family, may observe the restrictions on meat, alcohol and sex, but has given up the compulsion of wearing black or being barefoot. I recall being startled when I saw Ayyappas clad in black enjoying a smoke in the corner of the newspaper office where I once worked; I was told that it was only alcohol that was to be abjured. My surprise was greater when I saw several relatives donning the mala about a week before setting off on the pilgrimage, a serious abbreviation of the 41-day temporary asceticism. Though this has meant no diminution in the faith of those visiting the shrine, clearly the pilgrims progress has been adapted to the temporalities of modern life.Lord Ayyappa has surely observed that the longer pedestrian route to his forest shrine has been shortened by the bus route. From 1,29,000 private vehicles in 2000 to 2,65,000 in 2005, not to mention the countless bus trips, this has resulted in intolerable strains on a fragile ecology. In other words, pilgrim tourism, far from being promoted by womens entry to Sabarimala, had already reached unbearable limits.One of the most vital practices of this pilgrimage enjoins the pilgrim to carry his own consumption basket: nothing should be available for purchase. Provisions for drinking and cleaning water apart, the sacred geography of the shrine was preserved by such restrictions on consumption. But like many large religious corporations such as Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, the conveniences of commerce have pervaded every step of the way, with shops selling Ayyapan Bags and other ladies items that can be carried back to the women in the family. In addition to the gilding of the 18 steps, which naturally disallows the quintessential ritual of breaking coconuts, Lord Ayyappa may perhaps have been somewhat amused by the conveyor belt that carries the offerings to be counted. Those devotees who take a return route home via Kovalam to relieve the severities of the temporary celibacy would perhaps be pardoned, even by the Lord, as much as by anthropologists who have noted such interesting accretions. And in 2016, according to theQuarterly Current Affairs, the Modi government announced plans to make Sabarimala an International Pilgrim Centre (as opposed to the State governments request to make it a National Pilgrim Centre) for which funds would never be a problem.The invention of traditionLest this be mistaken for a cynical recounting of the countless ways in which the pilgrimage has been corrupted, let me hasten to say that my point is far simpler. Anyone who studies the social life and history of religion will recognise that practices are constantly adapted and reshaped, as collectivities themselves are changed, adapted and refashioned to suit the constraints of cash, time or even aesthetics. For this, the historians E.J. Hobsbawm and Terence Ranger coined the term the invention of tradition. Who amongst us does not, albeit with a twinge of guilt, agree to the token clipping of the hair at Tirupati in lieu of the full head shave? Who does not feel an unmatched pleasure in the piped water that gently washes the feet as we turn the corner into the main courtyard of Tirupati after hours of waiting in hot and dusty halls? And who does not feel frustrated at the not-so-gentle prod of the wooden stick by the guardian who does not allow you more than a few seconds before the deity at Guruvayur? All these belong properly to the invention of tradition leaving no practice untouched by the conveniences of mass management.But perhaps the most important invention of tradition was the absolute prohibition of women of menstruating age from worship at Sabarimala under rules 3(b) framed under the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965. Personal testimonies have shown that strict prohibition was not, in fact, always observed, but would such a legal specification have been necessary at all if everyone was abiding by that usage or custom from time immemorial? It is a custom with some aberrations as pointed out by Indira Jaisingh, citing the Devaswom Boards earlier admission that women had freely entered the shrine before 1950 for the first rice feeding ceremonies of their children.Elsewhere, the celibate Kumaraswami, in Sandur in Karnataka where women were strictly disallowed, has gracefully conceded space to women worshippers since 1996. The heavens have not fallen, Gandhi remarked in 1934 when a small state in south India [Sandur] has opened the temple to the Harijans. Lord Ayyappa, who has tolerated innumerable changes in the behaviour of his devotees, will surely not allow his wrath to manifest itself. He will be saddened by the hypermobilisation that surrounds the protests today, but would be far more forgiving than the men  and those women  who make, unmake and remake the rules of worship.Janaki Nair teaches history at the Centre for Historical Studies, JNU, New Delhi"

In due course, she learnt that the ancient texts contained several stories of gender swapping characters, Gods and deities changing their sex and sexuality.Mohini, being held at Art Houz Gallery in Jenneys Residency in the city, is the result of the journey through ancient Indian texts. About a dozen canvases depicting mythological characters who are androgynous, who defy gender boundaries and who change gender, are on display.Mohini, the feminine manifestation of Lord Vishnu, fascinates Kalki. Mohini is the epitome of beauty, intelligence, glamour, knowledge and she is also a visionary. While the 10 avatars of Vishnu are spoken about, Mohini is not. There are no temples for Mohini, she says.Initially I was apprehensive of doing the series, wondering whether it would have value. While there is liberty and freedom of sexuality in our epics, the contemporary world lacks it, Kalki says.The exhibition depicts characters from myths and epics such as Shikhandi, Brihannala, Aravan, Ardhanareeswara, Narada, Mitra and Varuna, who either underwent gender transformations or who were involved with characters that underwent gender transformation. I painted them slowly as I wanted to experience what I was doing. I brought in my own vision and imagination to every character and also played with my own elements, Kalki says.The artist says gender transitions mythological characters underwent had a valid reason and a philosophy behind it. They are not just folk tales or fairy tales. Most of such transitions were based on establishing truth or dharma. For example, Lord Vishnu became Mohini to kill Bhasmasura, the demon.India is vibrant and diverse just like the queer community. I have an urgency to express myself. I celebrate my femininity. As a transwoman, I want to use bright colours to express myself, she says.The paintings will be shipped to Bulgaria after the exhibition gets over on Monday."

But we had a look at the manic traffic, and changed our minds. Just the day before, I had been caught in the traffic for what seemed like hours. So, I decided that Id look up Zomato and order something exciting from our part of town.A few minutes of surfing later, I zeroed in on what looked promising  a delivery outlet called Rendezvous Calcutta in Noida. I called up and was told that it has been around for a while, has mostly Bengali food and delivers through Swiggy.Fresh and well-cookedI had an interesting chat with Chef Madhumita, who runs the place (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456). The food is all prepared fresh, so they have to be given some time to cook and deliver. The recipes are authentic, she said, and brushed off one of the Bengali food delivery places that I rather like as not genuine. And she helped me choose our order. We decided on a plate of dhokar dalna (Rs. 160), aloo posto (Rs. 145), shukto (Rs. 145), bori-aloo maachh jhol (Rs. 255), maachher kalia (Rs. 210) and tomato chatni (Rs. 70).The food came within the hour. And we had a delicious lunch, for the dishes, as the chef had promised, were fresh and well cooked. I had the dhokar dalna, which is a dish of steamed besan cakes in thick gravy that I really enjoy. It was superb; the cakes were soft, and the gravy was nice and tasty. I like my aloo posto with more posto (khus-khus, or poppy seed paste) than aloo, but in many kitchens it is cooked the other way around. In Rendezvous, too, it was more of a potato dish than posto. But it had a nice flavourful taste.The shukto, which is usually a cooling summer dish of vegetables in a light sauce, was delicious. It had a mix of vegetables, and the right balance of mildly sweet and bitter tastes. The two fish dishes were outstanding. There were large chunks of potato and fried bori (lentil balls) in bori-aloo maachh jhol, while the maachher kalia gravy was rich and sumptuous. The fish was fresh, and the pieces were large. Most of the gravies were hot, which I enjoyed after months of a low chilli diet. The tomato chatni, however, wasnt all that exciting. I must say Ive had better.Elaborate menuI didnt try out the meat dishes, but will order in another day. They have kosha mutton (Rs. 210), railway mutton (Rs. 375), chicken rezala (Rs. 375) and chicken curry (Rs. 360). There are other kinds of fish dishes, too  such as pabda tomato jhal (Rs. 240) and shorshe pabda (Rs. 230). Vegetarians can try out the aloor dum (Rs. 120), phul kopir dalna (Rs. 145), doi potol (Rs. 145), chholar dal (Rs. 100) and begun bhaja (Rs. 50). They have biryanis and rolls, breakfast fare such as radha bollobhi (stuffed puris with aloo) and snacks such as fish fries and chops.Madhumita tells me that she is not a trained chef, but has always been interested in cooking. She used to be a marketing professional, and then decided to get into the food business. I am glad she did!"

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.BHOPAL: The state Congress on Saturday morning released its poll manifesto, calling it a ""Vachan Patra (Pledge Document)"", and promising to shut down Vyapam, waive farm loans of up to Rs 2 lakh and constitute a Vidhan Parishad in the assembly. The Mandsaur police firing that killed five farmers will be reinvestigated if Congress comes to power, it says.For the first time, Congress promises to launch a Ram Van Gaman Path tour to retrace Lord Ram's footprints in MP, pass a law to protect River Narmada and set up a new 'religion and spiritual department'. It also aims to begin commercial production of cow urine and cowdung cakes. Unlike Chhattisgarh, it hasn't called for prohibition but vows to rid MP of 'intoxicants'.To address upper-caste resentment after amendment of the SC/ST Atrocities (Prevention) Act, the Congress Vachan Patra promises a Samanya Varg Ayog or Commission for general categories to address their issues.The manifesto was released at the state Congress headquarters here on Saturday morning by PCC chief Kamal Nath, state election campaign chairman Jyotiraditya Scindia, former CM Digvijaya Singh, Leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, and former Union ministers Suresh Pachauri and Arun Yadav. Chairman of the manifesto committee Rajendra Singh was also on dais.Congress described it as the voice of people of Madhya Pradesh. There is something for just about everyone  daily wagers, jobless, industrialists, homemakers and even journalists (a law to protect mediapersons), but the focus is clearly on farms and job creation.Kamal Nath told reporters, Congress is not releasing a manifesto for the people of the state. Rather, this is our pledge to bring Madhya Pradesh back on the tracks of development so that farmers can smile, women will feel protected and youth can get employment. In the last 15 years, BJP presented only jumla patras (propaganda deeds) in the name of manifesto and deceived people. Congress is determined to end corruption and mafia rule which starts from villages.Scindia called it a a new morning after 15 years of darkness for farmers, women and youth. Congress has presented its resolution, not just a manifesto, out of the willingness to serve. We have promised progress and development, plus reduction in price of petrol and diesel, justice for slain farmers of Mandsaur and distribution of free laptops to meritorious students in every district. Women will be given priority during recruitment in police force. Industry will be promoted so jobs are created. And all this will be implemented with a specified time limit.Apart from agricultural loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh, Congress promises 50% waiver on electric bills for agrarian sector, grant of Rs 51,000 for marriage of young women, and salary subsidy of Rs 10,000 to firms to encourage employment generation and investment. The manifesto assures passing a law for right to housing. Rest houses will be built every 15km along the Naramda Parikrama route.The Vachan Patra says that if Congress comes to power, it will bring transparency in recruitments and appointments and Vyapam  which has been in the eye of a storm for eight years  will be shut down. Congress alleges the BJP governments involvement in Vyapam irregularities.Congress manifesto promises more than the BJP governments policies at the Centre and state. While chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan promised bonus on grains like wheat and dal, Congress promises to give bonus to farmers on practically every major crop grown in the state  wheat, paddy, jowar, bajra, corn, soybean, mustard, cotton, arhar, moong, gram and masoor, urad, garlic, onions, tomatoes and sugarcane. The Narendra Modi government in Delhi gave LPG connections to the poor through Ujjwala Yojana, and Congress promises Rs 100 subsidy per cylinder. It plans to raise social security pension from Rs 300 per month to Rs 1,000.We are going to the people with a new thought process, to give the state a new direction, said LOP Ajay Singh."

The pulses are imported from Canada and Australia.The advisory is general in nature and states that there is a possibility of glyphosate contamination being above permissible levels. It has sought tests to determine the same in pulses. The Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) will collect samples and get these tested, said Maharashtra Minister for Food and Civil Supplies, Parliamentary Affairs and Medical Research, Girish Bapat.FDA Commissioner Pallavi Darade told The Hindu, The Food Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has asked us to just take samples. We have passed on the circular to the officers in the field and asked them to do so. Depending on the results, we will intimate the FSSAI.Four or five typesMs. Darade said the FDA would take three three or four samples across Maharashtra. We will include wholesalers and retailers and will cover four or five major pulses. The permissible levels differ across pulses and one would need to refer to the Act to identify the specific parameters of individual pulses.A State secretariat official, however, said that since there were no standards in India, the Codex Standards (prevalent in the USA) was the reference point.As per the Codex Standards, 2 mg per kg is the permissible limit for black eyed peas (chawli), 5 mg per kg for red lentils (masoor dal), 5 mg per kg for green peas (vatana), 5 mg per kg for split chick peas (chana dal) and 20 mg pe kg for soyabean, the official said.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government, through the FDA, has also launched a drive against adulteration as well as identification of spurious food items like a vegetable oil-based imitation product of mawa that is being marketed as special barfi during the festive season.Mr. Bapat also said the State government will amend Sections 272 and 273 of the Indian Penal Code to make the s manufacture and sale of spurious food products a non-bailable offence, punishable with over three years of imprisonment."
5ce6f239e8e3fc56af4161db,3 quirky Indian tales from French Reunion Island,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/travel/3-quirky-indian-tales-from-french-reunion-island/cid/1674937,2018-11-13,"Reunion Islands in the Indian Ocean, an overseas department of France and about 9,000 km from Paris, is like a delicious kichdi - a goulash of African, Asian and European cultures. Its the comfort food that would lift your spirits in an acrimonious world.Sandwiched between Mauritius and Africa, this paradise isle has mountains, valleys, sandy beaches, pristine blue seas and vertiginous falls. But more than the natural beauty, it is the people of the island that give it its distinctive characteristics.The paradise isle has mountains, valleys, sandy beaches, pristine blue seas and vertiginous falls Image: Sudha PillaiAnd people of Indian origin  about 45 per cent of the total population of 837,000 inhabitants  are shining testimonies to this amalgamation.How they came to be thereThe island, formed from a volcanic rising five million years ago, was first discovered by Arab traders. Soon the invaders -- Portuguese, British and the French -- arrived. Finally, the French colonised it, and christened it Reunion Island in 1793.An apt name for what the island is today, if not historically accurate.The island was formed from a volcanic rising five million years ago Image: Sudha PillaiReunion Island began as a place where prisoners were left to die. But the prisoners started living idyllic lives  swimming in the sea, climbing mountains, growing rice, vegetables and fruits in the fertile volcanic soil. After all, the island has 300 micro-climates.The French decided to reclaim this paradise for themselves. First they brought Africans here as slaves for the sugarcane plantations. After slavery was abolished, they fetched indentured workers from India.And that is how the Indian community started out on this unlikely island.Mary Theresa SubramaniamI met Mary Theresa Subramaniam at the Saint-Pierre market, where shes been working for the past 30 years. Marys great-grandfather came to the island with his wife and nine children. But he abandoned them and returned to India. His young wife raised her children in a foreign land.Clad in a skirt and lavender top, Mary has distinctive South Indian features. Shes never visited India. She believes she may have a few relatives back in India but has no clue about their whereabouts. This is also a typical story amongst the Indian community here.Mary is both a Hindu and a Christian. And there are many like her on the island Image: Sudha PillaiMary is both a Hindu and a Christian. And there are many like her on the island.When the Hindu Indians got off the boat two things happened at the immigration office. First, their names were Frenchified. Mary says, The immigration officers couldnt get the Indian names right. Vaidyalingam became Vaitilingam, Arumugam became Aroumougam, and so on.Second, they were asked to embrace Christianity. Due to the fear of retribution, they embraced it and a few continued to practise Hinduism secretly. Over time, the lines between faiths blurred. When Reunion Islands embraced religious diversity, most Indian families found themselves both Christian and Hindu.Priest BalaramA short walk from the market is the Mahakali de Bazaar or the Mahakali temple. Mahakali Utsav and Tamil New Years Day are big celebrations on the island.Tall and lanky Balaram, who can trace his roots back to Pondicherry, is the presiding priest at the Mahakali temple. He is, like most Indians here, fluent in French. Because that is what we speak at home, he says. Balarams great-grandfather came to Reunion Island. He is one of the few Indians on the island who still has some connection to India. Every year he goes to Munjod, a village in Kanjeepuram, to study Sanskrit.Balaram, the presiding priest at the Mahakali temple, speaks French at home Image: Sudha PillaiOn the island, Indians from South India, often Hindu, are known as Malbars. Immigrants from North India came later. Muslim Indians from North India are known as Zarabes.Temples and mosques - the first mosque of France was built here - stand alongside churches. Nowhere is this intermingling of faiths more evident than in the pretty cemeteries. At the St-Pierre Cemetery, amidst decorative family vaults and single graves with cherubs on tombstones, I found numerous graves of Indian-origin Christians. They had a saffron-coloured Trishul-cross combo on the headstones. This was the best religious khichdi I had ever seen.Tombstones of Indian origin Christians at the St-Pierre Cemetery Image: Sudha PillaiJacky ArourmougamMany elements of India are integrated into the weave of the island. But the influence of Indian cuisine stands out. Jacky Arourmougam, a celebrity chef on the Island, says, About 80 percent of Creole food is inspired by India. Rice and lentils are staples along with croissants and baguettes. Samoussas or Samosa is the undisputed national dish.I enjoyed an outdoor picnic at Trou deau at La Saline Les Bains with Jacky. His forefathers hail from Bengal and South India. Some of his unique dishes are inspired by the secret recipes of his mother and grandmother who came from Bengal. When the French-sounding achhard is placed on the table, you realise it is but the spicy Indian achaar and that kurkuma is turmeric which is used extensively in the island cuisine. And chicken cari draws heavily from the Indian curry. No doubt, the mingling of communities has given Reunion Island its unique food culture.Celebrity chef Jacky Arourmougam is inspired by the recipes of his mother and grandmother who came from Bengal Image: Sudha PillaiFor most Indians in Reunion Island, their acquaintance with India has been through faded stories of their ancestors travelling through the family vine or the banyan and mango trees in the backyard, the seeds of which were brought to the island by their forefathers or the recipes that are carefully passed down from great-great-grandmothers. While few Indian-islanders desire to travel to India, most of them are indifferent to the distant association. Reunion Island is where they feel rooted. Its not that they shun their past. It is just that they prefer to live in the present."

In the last eight years the Hindustan Park resident has made the city his home, has given promising musicians and artists a platform called Chaitown Creatives, flown down Angie Miller of American Idol fame for performances, taught vocals at Calcutta School of Music and has conducted several music shows, including the 50th edition of Assembly of God Churchs annual Christmas celebrations last year. The 32-year-old from Boston is currently preparing for Christmas concerts, which will be held next month, and hes writing new music for an album. Heres more from Zac.This is the busiest time of the year since you conduct several music shows in the city. What can we expect at this years Songs of the Season (December 7 to 9), which Assembly of God Church hosts every year?Songs of the Season is one of the longest-running Christmas productions in the city. The 51st SOS will not disappoint. Its a Broadway-style musical filled with wonderful songs, dancing and drama, and the 40-odd members of the choir and cast are working hard. Ive also been working with the Kolkata Symphony Orchestra and the Kolkata Community Choir for their upcoming Christmas concert (December 8 at St. Pauls Cathedral).You have been living in Calcutta for almost eight years and recently returned to writing music. Tell us what inspires you and can we expect an album.There is something so wonderful about India, especially this city; such a sense of togetherness and this marvellous atmosphere of joy. After eight years of living in Calcutta I can proudly claim that a part of me belongs to the city; you cant separate it from my identity. A lot of my writing is coming from my life experiences and lessons Ive learned in the past few years, living in India. Id like to put all the songs Ive been writing into an album and Im pulling in a few friends from Calcutta to collaborate with.You have also spent a couple of years in Mumbai. How do you find the music scene there and in Calcutta?I never really lived full-time in Mumbai, but I did spend a significant amount of time there and I have quite a number of Calcutta friends who have turned Mumbaikars. Although all of them still proclaim loudly there is no city like Calcutta, Mumbai has so many different opportunities for musicians to make a living. To me, though, Calcutta stands out as a city with a deep-rooted passion and love for music.What brought you to Calcutta?We had close family friends who were living here at the time. After finishing my studies, I was given an invitation to work with young musicians, specifically to train vocalists.What was your initial perception of the city?All I knew about Calcutta was that Mother Teresa lived here. I look back and laugh because Calcutta is so much more than that. Amanda and I dated while living in Calcutta; we hosted our wedding reception in Calcutta; and, our son Kaden was born in Calcutta. Hes now 15 months. Calcutta seems like a different world compared to Boston, but what I feel weve done as a family is taken the West and the East and adopted the best of both.How did the journey from Berklee College of Music in Boston to India shape you as a musician and a person?Berklee was a challenging place to study at. I grew a lot as a vocalist studying under some incredible professors. From Berklee to moving to India in 2011, and up until now, there has been a lot of life Ive lived. There have been extremely painful events and extremely joyful events that have taken place in my life. I think one of the greatest lessons Ive learned is finding joy  true joy  and leaning into that joy during lifes painful events. I think losing our daughter Chloe and burying her here in India will still be one of our familys most painful events, and at the same time Kaden being born a year later will be our familys most joyful event. Not just our family, but so many loved ones here walked with us through that pain and joy. This journey of learning to put others first has and will continue to shape me as a person and as a musician. Its definitely shaping how I write and the message I want to get across in the lyrics I sing.What have been some of the milestones for Chaitown Creatives, which you started to bring together artists and musicians?Chaitown was started out of a desire to see young musicians and artists excel; to give training and new platforms. I think one of the milestones is artists collective, which is still going strong after almost three years. Its one of my favourite events that Chaitown hosts.Do you intend to stay on?As for now we are here and based in Calcutta; its our home. We havent put a timeline for our family at this point.Five musicians from Calcutta you cant get enough ofPaloma and Adil  Palomas voice is goldWhale In The Pond and Sourjyo SinhaDavid Mani (singer-songwriter)Deep Phoenix (percussive guitar)Sherman Jackson (pianist from the AG Church)Five places in Calcutta that inspire youRabindra Sarobar, Jorasanko Thakurbari, Prinsep Ghat, the AG Church, north Calcutta (especially Shyambazar)Five things in your wardrobe thats IndianPunjabi kurtas, Kolhapuris, Nehru jackets, Indo-Western suits, dhotiFive Indian/Bengali dishes that have become a household stapleTadka dal (any kind of lentil dish).

The Naamdaar does not know what smoke is. He doesnt know how the wood stove burns. In my childhood, I have seen my mother cook on a wooden stove and water in her eyes. I have seen it, and this has inspired me to introduce Ujjwala Yojana, he said.The Marwar region of the state has 10 Assembly seats. Nagaur is considered the heartland of farming and Jats dominate here politically, influencing over 40 Assembly seats across the state. In his speech, Modi pitched that his party men understood the needs of farmers better than the Congress and Rahul Gandhi.The life you spend is the same as mine. Neither you were born with a golden spoon nor am I born with it. The poor mans misery is known to the person who rises from among them. Those who are born with a golden spoon, they do not even know the pain of a thorn getting stuck to their feet while walking barefoot in fields, he added.He also hit out at Gandhi over the Congress presidents remarks on Monday that his great grandfather Jawahar Lal nehrus caste, Kaul Dattatreya was also his. Modi said if Sardar Vallabhai Patel had been the prime minister at the time, the condition of farmers would have been much better. If Sardar Patel had become the Prime Minister, farmers would be happy today. If the first Prime Minister of India had been a son of a farmer, then the situation would be different today. Patel had fought with Gandhiji for the rights of the farmers... because he knew the troubles of the farmer and agriculture, he said.The PM added that if voted to power, the BJP government would implement the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee and that both the state and Central governments are constantly working on double farmers incomes. The Minimum Support Price for crops would be hiked by 1.5 times, he added.I congratulate the Vasundhara government. They have tried to bring irrigation water to 1.5 lakh hectares of land in Rajasthan, he said.Farmers in the state have been protesting for a long time about increasing debt, rising costs and low MSPs. Although the government did waive off loans of upto R50,000, the anger among the community is a concern for the saffron party.Reacting to the PMs allegations Congress election committee chief and MP from Ajmer, Raghu Sharma, hit back saying, The entire country knows that due to the incompetence of the Vasundhara Raje Government, 150 self-respecting farmers of Rajasthan has had to resort to suicide. Now that the Congress has announced that they will waive off farmer loans in 10 days, the BJP is exasperated and talking rubbish."

Addressing an election rally in the state, Shah referred to the report and alleged Vadra received commissions after a loan of thousands of crores of rupees was sanctioned to a big company.A company got a loan of thousands of crores and its commission reached the Nehru family's son-in-law within a few months, with which he bought 150 hectares of land in Bikaner at a throwaway price and then sold it for a higher price. I want to ask Rahul Gandhi if he can answer now, Shah said at Nagaur.At a time when Rahul Gandhi has repeatedly targeted the ruling party for failing to manage ballooning NPAs of public sector banks, BJP latched on to the report to try and corner Congress for its vulnerability to corruption and nepotism.Chronicling the details of the Bikaner land deal at a press conference here, BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said, Corruption and Congress are synonymous. This naamdaar parivar has one big farmer and his name is Robert Vadra. Grabbing land belonging to farmers, building an empire of corruption on that land...is what the Gandhi family, Vadra and the Congress are good at.Continuing his attack Patra said, ""Robert Vadra is a tainted 'naamdar'. His land scam model is world famous. He set up Skylight with a seed capital of Rs 1 lakh. He then bought land at rock bottom rates with other peoples money, changed land utilization, and then sold the land at 7 times, 10 times, 20 times the price, pocketing crores.Patra said he was quoting PM Narendra Modi in saying Rahul doesnt know how to differentiate between moong and masoor (dals). Vadra, while claiming farm land, wasnt growing any crop other than money.BJP has used Vadra to attack the Gandhi family, retaliating to Rahul Gandhis bid to target Modi on the Rafale deal. BJP has maintained that Rahuls stand against the deal was motivated by Dassaults refusal to entertain the role of Sanjay Bhandari, a defence middle man, who the party says, has business links with Vadra."
5ce5c99ae8e3fc56af40ef46,Well-being of society at root of rigorous rituals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/well-being-of-society-at-root-of-rigorous-rituals/cid/1674931,2018-12-11,"Modern day Chhath has emerged as the most revered and popular community festival of Bihar, in which all strata of society participate with equal zeal and sincerity though with many new manifestations and amendments. But the worship of the Sun God, which constitutes the essence of the festival, has been prevalent in the Magadh region and in other parts of Bihar for millennia.Though the role of fire got minimised in Aryavarta (present day Uttar Pradesh) after the Later Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC), its use increased further east, in the Bihar region, from 600 BC onwards as new settlements emerged in Magadh.The pre-historic settlements of the hilly and the jungle terrain of South Bihar regions and Northern Jharkhand were the source of the sustenance for nature worshippers, including the followers of the sun/fire cult. In recent times, more than 42 rock shelters/cave settlements belonging to the pre-historic as well as early historic period have been deciphered in the districts of Nawada, Jamui, Giridih and Jamui.The Taradih excavations of Bodhgaya have unearthed artefacts since the Neolithic period. Several fire pits have been found which also justify the worship of fire/sun god as continuity since pre-historic times.The Aryanisation of the Magadh region, since 600 BC, superimposed the Rig Vedic (1500-1000 BC) concept over the local tradition of the sun/fire cult in the area.The first manifestation of the Sun God in the Mahabodhi pillars of Bodhgaya in the art form during the Saka-Kushan period is thus natural. As such, we also find Sun God appearing on Kushan coins during AD 200-300.The rapid march of the Magadh Empire during 600 BC and the subsequent rapid urbanisation of the Magadh region further regenerated and popularised the local prehistoric sun/fire cult among the urban gentry and the ruling elite of Magadh region.LINK BETWEEN WORSHIP OF SUN GOD AND MOTHER GODDESSWorship of the Mother Goddess is associated with the fertility cult, which had its origins in primitive agricultural societies of the world. Discovery of idols of Mother Goddess in various matured forms at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation prove beyond doubt that the worship of Mother Goddess has been popular in India from pre-historic times.The Mahabodhi Pillars of the Saka-Kushan times have revealed two distinct images carved out of stone: (i) The Sun God and (ii) The Primordial Mother Goddess.While the image of the Sun God was conceived during the Rig Vedic phase, the Primordial Mother Goddess was still in the pristine form, as the River Goddess and was conceived from the folk traditions of Aryavarta.With the evolution and the advancement of the agrarian economy in Aryavarta, the worship of Mother Goddess emerged as the most popular form of worship in the folk tradition.The River Goddess slowly evolved in the mindset of the village communities of Aryavarta during the Late Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC). The concept of the River Goddess of Aryavarta travelled far and wide during 600 BC to AD 300 from Northwest India to Eastern India in the Indo-Gangetic belt and was popular among the people of the time in general and the village communities in particular. The Mahabodhi Pillar depicts the River Goddess as sitting on a ghata (vase or kalash) and black-clouds representing two elephants are pouring water on her head by their trunks, signifying heavy downpour during rainy season. Later, the River Goddess has been identified as the Gaja Lakshmi form of Goddess Lakshmi in the Brahmanical pantheon but it also survived in its pristine form, in the folk tradition of Magadh (in particular) and Bihar (in general) in the form of Chhath Puja.Interestingly, the most significant utensils used on the occasion of Chhath Puja are a holy pot (kalash) and the chaturmukh dwip. The kalash signifies the Mother Earth or Mother Goddess, which proves beyond doubt the inter linkage between the Sun God (male divinity) and the Mother Goddess (female divinity).The Chhath Puja is directly rooted to the well being of the agricultural society as the worship of the Sun God is directly related to the harvesting season of two major crops of Bihar: kharif and rabi. The harvesting time of kharif crops is the month of Kartik (October-November); and that of rabi is Chaitra (March-April).The present form of Chhath Puja was conceived during the medieval period. The various aspects of Chhath Puja got crystallised with the stabilisation of the medieval period as we can see the devotees urge the Sun God to provide them good health, male progeny and wealth (good harvest and monetary gain), a general urge for all classes of the agrarian feudal society of the central Gangetic plain of Bihar.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COCONUT, PAAN AND BANANASSeasonal fruits and vegetables (of the Bihar eco-system) are needed for Chhath Puja, but the only exception is coconut which is known as Kanchan Phal. It signifies that coconut is resistant to rotting for months due to its sclerenchymatous outer cover and can be safely transported from one part of the country to another. In the ancient and the medieval period coconut (but not the green coconut) was very much part of Bihars dietary supplement.Significantly, betel leaf (paan) and bananas had been brought from the Southeast Asian eco-system in the ancient period, probably by Brahmin and Buddhist monks, but both had been internalised in the cultural traditions of India. Both paan and bananas predate the medieval Chhath Puja traditions and are essential part of the rituals.Of late, pineapples and oranges have also become a part of the Chhath Puja offerings.Orange is unknown in the wild state, it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia from ancient times but now, it is available in the market due to the availability of rapid communication. Similarly, pineapples, a fruit of the eco-system of northeastern states, are now readily available in Bihar during the Dala Chhath of Kartik.The use of some of todays common fruits, vegetables and pulses is not seen in use by devotees due to their origin from other eco-systems like potatoes (Latin America), onion (Central Asia), apples (Central Asia), lentil (Central Asia), cauliflower (Syria and Europe), cabbage (Mediterranean countries) among others. Instead, the local edibles are in use e.g. sweet potato, singhara, pomelo, Bengal gram (chana dal) and turmeric saplings.Jaggery (gur) from sugarcane is the traditional sweetener of Indian cultural tradition and is an essential part of Chhath Puja festivities.But now some devotees also use sugar crystals, popularised by the British who opened sugar mills in north Bihar and elsewhere during the early decades of the 20th century.The author is a research writer and freelance journalist.

From chopping to deep frying, we tend to cook all the goodness out of food. There are, however, ways we can retain nutrition without compromising on taste. Heres how to go about it.Chop, chopThe usual process of preparing vegetables for cooking is to peel them all  even the ones that dont need it  cut them into small pieces and soak in water. This removes dust, grime, pesticides and added colours. It also removes about 40 per cent of vitamins B and C.Proper cleaning is absolutely essential to get rid of toxic substances, even if you lose some nutrition in the process, says skin specialist Dr Sanjay Ghosh. The added colours and pesticides are poisonous and can cause severe disorders. Dr Ghosh suggests that vegetables be washed thoroughly in running water or soaked before chopping so that the nutrition is not washed out along with pesticides. They should then be cut in large pieces and cooked quickly. Peeling vegetables is not necessary as peels have fibre and nutrition. These fibres are good for people with diabetes, high cholesterol and too many fat deposits, Dr Ghosh adds. Peel the vegetables thinly so that you can save some fibres and nutrition while getting rid of toxic chemicals.Smoking hotMost people cook in smoking hot oil but this process is incorrect. All cooking oils have a specific smoke point  the temperature at which oil molecules break apart and give off smoke. That is also when the beneficial fatty acids and vitamins go up in smoke and a host of harmful free radicals are produced. Free radicals cause inflammation that leads to high cholesterol, heart diseases, stroke, Alzheimers, cancer and many other disorders. Forget eating, even being exposed to this smoke while cooking is dangerous, especially for those who suffer from asthma and allergy.To protect yourself, heat the empty pan first. Then pour in oil, heat for a few more minutes and add the ingredients before the oil gives off smoke. Cover the pan and cook on low heat.Deep friedPuri, kachauri, pakoras, chops  Indian cooking has an array of deep fried dishes. Regular consumption of them may lead to obesity, which is linked to high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, stroke and heart disease.Apart from free radicals, smoking hot oil also produces trans-fats, which raise the level of bad cholesterol and the risk of cerebral stroke. If you recycle oil used for frying, you create aldehyde, an extremely harmful organic substance that leads to a host of disorders including Alzheimers and Parkinsons disease. So should one throw away oil left over after deep frying? Well, it depends on the smoke point of the oil. Safflower, canola, mustard, sesame and coconut oil dont disintegrate at moderately high temperatures. If you fry at moderate heat  and not extremely high heat  then you can reuse them. Strain the oil once cool to get rid of burnt particles (harmful organic substances) and recycle. But if the oil looks turbid instead of clear, throw it away.Incidentally, coconut oil is one of those rare oils that has a high smoke point. This means you can safely use it for deep frying. Unfortunately, while popular in southern India, coconut oil is not accepted as a cooking medium in the rest of India.Choose shallow frying [like a paratha] over deep frying. This is not crispy but tastes good and the nutrition is preserved, says nutritionist Vijaya Agarwala. If you love crispy fries, get an air frier, she suggests.Cooking stylesNow lets talk about cooking procedures and how they affect nutrition.Boil: People think it is a healthy process even if the end product is bland. However, throwing away the water you boil in means losing 60 per cent of the nutrition of Vitamin B, Vitamin C and minerals. This is also true of rice. So boil things in just enough water and if there is any extra left, use it to make gravy.Also, let the water boil first and then put in the rice, lentils or veggies. Always cook on a low fire, with a lid on the pan. You can also use a pressure cooker to boil food in.Steam: This process of cooking retains the most nutrition. Vegetables such as tomato, carrot and broccoli become more nutritious when you steam them. If you saute the ingredients slightly and then steam them, the dish is tasty as well as healthy.Poach: Poaching helps retain the nutrition of an egg. You can also poach thin slices of fish and some vegetables (such as carrots and capsicum).Grill: You can grill vegetables, fish and meat but be careful not to char them. Any charred or blackened parts should be removed. Eating such parts can lead to cancer in the breast and pancreas as the process brings about harmful chemical changes in meat and chicken. Grill only the lean cut (low on fat) of meat or chicken.Saute: The easiest way is to cook in the saut mode on an induction cooker. You can even do it on low heat on a gas. Use olive oil for the best nutrition (especially anti-oxidants).Microwave: Extensive research has shown that cooking in the microwave retains nutritive value but can make food dry. Sprinkle some water on the food before reheating it to keep it moist. However, never use a plastic or melamine vessel to reheat food in the microwave oven."

Chandrababu Naidu on Tuesday expressed the view that the BJP was getting weakened across the country. During the last five years, it faced many drubbings in by-elections and in the elections to five States.Reacting to the election results, he said the people were up in arms against the BJP. They recognised that it did nothing for them in the last five years. Hence, they were looking for an alternative. The people were supporting the TDPs fight against the BJP. The election results were an indication in that direction, and would help in forming an alternative to the BJP in the general elections in 2019, he said.Alliance rejected: JaganOpposition leader and YSR Congress Party president YS Jagan Mohan Reddy said the people of Telangana had rejected the unholy alliance of the Telugu Desam and the Congress Party.

Over 130 food stalls from 26 states are spread, rather randomly, across the complex.You can end up gorging on the regular and the familiar  pao bhaji, masala dosa, aaloo tikki, chholey bhature, pizza, momo, chowmein, honey chilly potato  and miss out on the joy of being surprised.How about Jaipurs tandoori chai? Watching it being prepared and served is a fascinating experience. Or, eating pathar ka gosht, chunks of chicken cooked on stone.Theres much more, if your palate enjoys the thrill of the unusual. At stall 43, you can wolf down Malabar snacks such as meat pathiri (fried pastry filled with chicken), chicken cutlet and chicken cake, which looks and feels more like a quiche. Then theres kilikoodu (birds nest), a famous iftaar dish of the region, which wasnt available in the evening but stall owner Mohd Ali of Calicut promised to serve it during the weekend.To counter the general perception that street food is unhygienic, National Association of Street vendors of India (NASVI) organised a day-long programme on hygiene and cleanliness.About 500 vendors attended the training conducted by FSSAI. At the festival, all vendors and cooks wore plastic gloves.One of them was Sanjiv Gupta, who makes uncommon omelettes, some as large as an eight-inch pizza. His cheese-chicken omelette (Rs 240) is a complete meal. Setting up a stall at a food festival like this establishes your identity, makes you known to a wider group of people, says Gupta, who owns a stall in Dwarka-7.Some years back, litti-chokha used to be a top draw in the Bihar pavilion at the annual trade fair because it wasnt readily available in the capital. That was then. Now Bihars most well-known dish is served both in modest pushcarts and swish restaurants across the city. But Devi Prasad of Patnas Kanker Bagh colony has come up with a sizzling non-vegetarian variation of what was once a poor mans staple: chicken-litti. In Prasads concoction, the litti and the chicken are not offered separately but sloshed together in a fierce curry on a hotplate and served for Rs 180 at stall 55. I sell one quintal of chicken every day between 4pm and 9.30pm in Patna, he says.Patori, served with kadhi, is a popular snack in Nagpur. Prakash Vyas (stall 78), who has brought the dish to the festival, explains what makes it different, if not special. Patori is a deep-fried pastry stuffed with coriander leaves, peanuts and sesame seeds. Its a rare dish that serves coriander leaves as a stuffing rather than as a chutney, says Vyas.An Afghan stall provides international flavour. Mantoo, the Afghan variation of the momo, is topped with curd and split chickpea lentil (chana dal). It is on offer along with kabuli, the traditional Afghan pilaf served with raisins.An interesting sidelight is Bapus Thali, four items that Mahatma Gandhi loved to eat. For Gandhi, food was about fulfilling a need, not satiating a desire. One should eat not in order to please the palate, but to keep the body going, he once said. At the festival, theres a small exhibition outlining his philosophy of nutrition. To summarise it in five simple points, it goes: Eat to live, raw is good, eat more greens, whole grain is good and chewing is essential. Between 1 and 3 pm, you can sample Bapus thali for Rs 60. It comprises four dishes: Gujarati snack muthiya, sprouts cutlet, millet khichadi and ragi-teesi laddoo, with jaggery as a sweetener."

Respite for one would come only at the cost of the other ones interest.Poor rains are expected to increase the rates of pulses. But the higher rates may help in easing farmers losses. Traders fear the rates may still be reigned in if the government, which is sitting on a huge stock of pulses procured in previous years, begins offloading it. A sudden increase in supply due to it will offset the shortfall due to less output.Rates of pulses had touched a rock bottom due to a bumper crop in the last two years. This led to large-scale purchases at minimum support price (MSP) by the National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED).This year a poor crop of pulses both in kharif and rabi seasons is estimate and it has already led to a bullish trend. Yet the prices are either below the MSP or barely above, so far. The rates need to increase further for farmers to profit, said a traderArrival of pulses would begin with tur in January which is a kharif crop. There are market estimates of at least 30% downfall in output of tur.Tur in raw form is available for Rs4,400 to Rs4,800 a quintal, an increase of over Rs500 within two months. This is still below the MSP which is at Rs5450. Raw tur is further processed into tur dal and is sold for between Rs60 and Rs70 a kg in bulk markets, said market sources.Pulses like chana (gram) and masoor (lentil), which are rabi crops, reach the market by March. Rates of chana have jumped by Rs1,200 a quintal in two months and touched Rs4500 to Rs4700 a quintal. The MSP, on the other hand, is at Rs4,620 a quintal. Chana dal, made out of chana, is in the range of Rs60 to 65 a kg.Both tur dal and chana dal had made headlines in 2014 when the rates had touched Rs200 and Rs120 a kg, respectively.Masoor is priced at Rs4,300 a quintal in raw form, still below the MPS by Rs150. Masoor dal costs up to Rs48 a kg, said sources in local market.Traders say even as there is a bullish outlook considering the shortfall, uncertainty remains.Meanwhile, farmers in Vidarbha, who mainly grow gram, are facing a tough rabi season. According to a senior officer in states agriculture department, rabi production is expected to be down by 30% in Amravati division which covers west Vidarbha. There is an equal downfall in the sowing as well.Chana, which is the main rabi crop of the region, has been affected. In east Vidarbha, estimates have not been made yet as sowing is still in progress, said a source.Amid fears that NAFEDs sale may keep the price low, its managing director Sanjeev Kumar Chaddha told TOI that the agency is left with over 5 lakh tons of tur. There are no plans to sell it in the open market. After setting aside the required quantity for buffer stock, the pulses may be supplied through the public distribution system, he said.On chana, Chaddha said, NAFED is left with 23 lakh tons of it. It would be sold from time to time in open market as well as PDS. The measures would be calibrated and it would be seen that supply by NAFED does not lead to a crash in prices.The rates have barely improved and there was a petition in the high court seeking the government should take steps for price control. Tur, which is among the major pulses, is still ruling below the MSP. If NAFED offloads the stock the farmers would be at a loss, said Pratap Motwani, secretary of Itwari Grain and Seeds Merchants AssociationArpit Jain of Himalaya Agro Impex said it may be too early to predict the trend. There is a bullish outlook at present. The rates of chana jumped by over Rs1,000 two months ago after that there has been no movement. Maharashtra stands third in chana production after Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh. Recently there have been showers in some of the pockets which can improve the output. There is enough stock with government which if offloaded can ease the rates, he said."
5ce513abe8e3fc56af409d7c,A balanced diet helps keep anaemia at bay,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/a-balanced-diet-helps-keep-anaemia-at-bay/cid/1680261,2018-12-29,"Do you feel sluggish and weak and struggle to get through the day? If the answer is yes, chances are that you might be suffering from anaemia, a condition in which your blood has a decreased haemoglobin count.Haemoglobin is the main part of red blood cells that bind oxygen. It is the most common nutritional deficiency disorder globally and India has one of the highest numbers of anaemia cases in the world. In India, anaemia affects an estimated 50 per cent of the population!What is haemoglobin?Haemoglobin, sometimes abbreviated as Hgb, is a protein in red blood cells that carries iron. This iron holds oxygen, making haemoglobin an essential component of ones blood. If the haemoglobin level is abnormal or low, the cells in the body do not get enough oxygen.The urban scenarioIt is often thought that anaemia mostly affects the economically weak population, those living in rural areas and in poor hygiene conditions. A recent study showed that anaemia affects urban society as well, with one in three teenage girls affected in cities. The main reason being they prefer diet fads or junk food. Refined food, lacking vital vitamins and minerals, is also one of the causes.Many young people skip breakfast, which should be the biggest meal of the day. Family meals are also a big casualty to urban work schedule with teenagers and children eating junk food at schools, cafes and restaurants. High intake of tea and coffee, and wrong choice of breads, oils, salad dressings lead to empty calories piling up without essential vitamins and minerals. All these make the system weak.What causes anaemia?The most common cause, especially in women, is iron deficiency. Iron is an important component of haemoglobin and if you dont have enough iron, your body cannot make enough healthy oxygen-carrying red blood cells. In most cases there is an inadequate supply of nutrients like iron, folic acid, proteins, amino acids, and vitamins B12, A, C and B-complex vitamins.Some other causes of anaemia are acute/chronic gastritis, surgery, menstruation, haemorrhoids, childbirth, injuries, certain disorders like thalassemia, medications such as painkillers and antacids, endurance training, excess intake of tea/coffee, frequent blood donation, alcohol intake and colorectal cancer.SymptomsConstant tiredness.Zero motivation to exercise.Achey muscles and body pain.Mood swings and apathy towards social and professional circles.Hair fall, brittle nails and dull, pale skin.Shortness of breath.Restless legs.A condition called pica where one craves strange foods or non-food items like ice, clay, dirt, chalk or paper.Anxiety.Cold hands and feet.Irregular periods, cramps and headache.Diet doOne should incorporate food rich in iron in their meals, like vegetables such as amaranth, spinach, beet, broccoli, Brussels sprout and microgreens.Dried fruits such as raisins, figs and apricots.Legumes like kidney beans, lentils, chickpeas and peanuts.Nuts such as cashew and pine nut (roasting nuts may damage nutrients, so go for raw and non-blanched varieties).Seeds like pumpkin, sesame and flaxseed (always soak seeds overnight).Oats, ghee and jaggery.White meat like chicken.Shellfish, eggs and liver.Combined with foods rich in iron, vitamin C-rich foods may increase the absorption of iron by up to 300 per cent.Avoid coffee and tea with meals, for they can reduce iron absorption by 50-90 per cent.Soaking, sprouting and fermenting grains and legumes can improve iron absorption by lowering the amount of phytates that are naturally present in these foods.Food prepared in a cast iron pan tend to provide two to three times more iron as those prepared in non-iron cookware.Having legumes and quinoa that are rich in the amino acid lysine with iron-rich meals may increase iron absorption.Iron supplementsGenerally, you should only take an iron supplement under the supervision of a doctor. If you do take an iron supplement, try having orange juice with it to boost iron absorption.If not treated, anaemia can worsen and become an underlying cause of chronic ill health, such as impaired foetal development, delayed cognitive development and increased risk of infection in young children, and reduced physical capacity in people of all age groups.Shikha Prakash is an ayurvedic consultant at Padaav Speciality Ayurvedic Treatment Centre, Dehradun, and a visiting consultant at AMRI Hospital, Dhakuria"

I have had my fill of rich food, and discovered that I quite like lightly cooked food, too. I have also been struck by a mini-revolution sweeping across the country  that of home delivery outlets.Indeed, I find that 2018 was full of good food delivered at the doorstep by new outlets offering everything from regional food to coastal cuisine to good old Awadhi and Hyderabadi dishes. Someone somewhere in the city is willing to deliver something that you may be yearning for  from stew-appam and Bohri mutton to maachher jhol and couscous salad.Speaking of maachher jhol, I had two excellent Bengali meals prepared by two outlets in Noida  Prinsep 21 and Rendezvous Calcutta. Chef Madhumita, who runs the latter (phone numbers: 0120-4267726 and 8826743456), prepares a mean aloo posto and shukto. And the fish with lentil balls (bori-aloo maachh jhol) is excellent. The Biswas family runs Prinsep 21 (nos: 08010360859 and 8470880448). I loved their dhokar dalna, steamed lentil cakes in gravy, and chicken rezala, a yoghurt based dish that is light, yet most delicious.It was a great year for biryanis, kormas and kababs, too. Some of the best dishes came from a new food outfit called Sassy Begum (no: 9999122999). I loved their tender Sikhampuri kabab and haleem, flavoured with cashew nuts and poppy seeds, and the tangy bagare baingan. The Hyderabadi kuchchey gosht ki biryani was full of flavours and tender pieces of meat. The Godavari chicken biryani from The Biryani Project (no: 8750212212) was superb, too, flavoured as it was with curry leaves. I also fondly remember the galouti kababs and dum nihari gosht that came from Biryani by Kilo (mob: 9555212212;www.biryanibykilo.com). Their Malamaal Biryani was full of the good stuff  with as much meat as rice  and my friends loved it.One of the most exciting deliveries came from a service called The Melting Pot Tiffins (9568199605;http://meltingpottiffins.in/). You can have your fill of regional and community cuisine from this delivery service  which offers everything from Goan, Kashmiri and Bihari to Anglo-Indian and Marwari. I still remember their delightful South Indian vegetarian tiffin -- appam and stew, cabbage phoogath, mini rawa molagapori served with coconut chutney and gooseberry pachadi, and kerala red rice. The Goan chicken hamper consisted of the coriander-flavoured chicken Cafreal, among other dishes, and the Gujarati non-veg hamper included some delicious Bohri mutton. You must not miss their salted caramel kheer -- barnyard millet kheer with jaggery salted caramel.A wonderful mixAnother interesting delivery service is Iras (nos: 9871950119 and 7982837171), which offers a wonderful mix of flavours and dishes that are low fat and appeal especially to the young. I had their air-fried kababs and thin-crust pizzas prepared with light mozzarella cheese. They have various kinds of salads, including grilled veggies with couscous.And, of course, I cannot forget Noshi  and its dimsums. The dimsums  chicken and chestnut, chicken and chilli oil, edamame and truffle  were simply delicious. And I made a great meal out of some Thai steamed fish, cooked in a mild lemony sauce.I enjoyed the coconut Mysore chicken with rice from YumYum South and their small podi-smeared idlis and vadas. From Trial Box (no: 01244601666), I had the Sufiana kabab, som tam salad, harissa chicken and fish that had been lightly grilled and cooked in a lemon-and-butter sauce. The salad was nice and tangy, the kebab platter had various kinds of kebabs  with different flavours (such as patthar key phool and rose petals) and sauces (some hot oriental sauces).Another great discovery was Roomali Garh (no: 9225112277)  an outlet that delivers mainly Rajasthani dishes. The food comes beautifully packaged in bright yellow cartons, which somehow adds to the taste of the food. I loved their Nagori gatta curry, which was nice and spicy, Marwari aloo pyaz, dhundhari kadhi chicken, which consisted of minced balls in a light and flavourful curd-based sauce.All in all, it was a memorable year. And its nice to know that good food is just a mouse click away."
