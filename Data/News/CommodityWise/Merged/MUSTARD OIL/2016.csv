""Specially in the unreserved and suburban sectors the existing fare has been kept very low,"" he said.Asked whether the railways are considering hiking the fare in the suburban and unreserved segments, the official said, ""Though there is a need for rationalisation of the fare structure, there is no such proposal.""The passenger sector is getting about Rs 30,000 crore cross-subsidy annually from freight earnings.According to the data, the passenger fare for the 303 km distance between Delhi and Jaipur in general class is Rs 105, which can be compared with the mobile Internet pack of 500 MB. The travel from Delhi to Dehradun is at present costing Rs 105 in the unreserved general class, less than the cost of one kg of refined oil.Bus fare to Dehradun and Jaipur is Rs 450 and Rs 400 respectively, it said.Train fare for the New Delhi-Lucknow sector, a distance of 513 km, is Rs 150 and the bus fare is Rs 700. According to the railways, train fare for Lucknow is less than the cost of one kg Tur dal.Similarly, Delhi-Amritsar fare of Rs 140 is less than the cost of one kg of mustard oil and Delhi-Jammu fare of Rs 175 is less than the half a kg of desi ghee, as per the chart.The railways are charging between 22 paisa per km to 44 paisa per km for the unreserved general class fare while the bus fare is ranging between 89 paisa and Rs 1.44 per km journey, said a senior Railway Ministry official."

The agriculture officers claimed that wheat crop in Allahabad and Pratapgarh has started showing signs of damage and production could be severely hit.The agriculture land in Allahabad is around 2.5 lakh hectare, of which wheat is grown on 2.3 lakh hectare while in remaining area pulses and mustard are grown. As per experts, the day temperature is hovering around 25 to 26 degree Celsius, which should be around 12 to 15 degrees in early January. The situation is equally worse in areas where irrigation facilities like canals are available and areas which depend on rain. Farmers have to draw water from nearby water sources. In Allahabad, worst affected areas are Koraon, Karchana, Manda, Khiri, Bara in trans-Yamuna. The farmers of trans-Ganga areas of Mauaima, Baharia, Soraon, Holagarh are equally affected. The wheat crop in the neighbouring Pratapgarh district is equally affected.The farmers are pinning hope on rabi crop after kharif crop failed due to hailstorm in 2015, followed by drought.Farmer Prakash Singh said that leaves of wheat crop are turning pale due to lack of rain and foggy weather. The farmers have lost hope and those who have take loans for procuring seeds and fertiliser have started migrating to the city to work as labourers.Munna Singh of village Sewan in Nawabganj said that famers will be severely affected if crops fail to get the optimum weather condition. District agriculture officer J P Dube said, ""The threat of another drought looms large if the prevailing weather condition does not improve in next two weeks. The crop is affected due to high day temperature.""Till date, the damage is not being assessed as the administration wants to wait for another few days. ""The crop wants bitter cold conditions and moisture which this winter lacks,"" added Dube. Meanwhile on Saturday, the difference between day and night temperature was over 12 degrees Celsius. Maximum temperature was recorded at 24.9 while the minimum stood at 12.7 degrees. The humidity was high at 92%.On Friday, the maximum temperature was 25 degrees and minimum was 8 degrees."

Shetye, soon after being elected as the Chairperson of the Shri Shanaishwar Devasthan Shani Shingnapur-Newasa, said: There are no plans to allow women to go at the chauthara (the temple platform)the tradition will continue.It is an ancient tradition that women are debarred from climbing up the temple steps to pour oil and offer prayers to Lord Shanidev. Theres no reason for us to change traditions and there should not be any controversy over the issue, a senior trustee member said.On November 28, 2015, a woman broke the nearly five-century old tradition and climbed near the idol of the world-famous Shani Shingnapur temple. The woman was captured on CCTV of the temple complex, while passing through the security barricade to the chauthara or platform where the idol was installed.Breaking traditionsHowever, CCTV footage suggests that there was no attempt to stop her by anyone, either from the temple staff or the devotees.In December, four women from the Bhumata Brigade of Pune had attempted to breach the security cordon around the inner sanctum, but were barred by security personnel. Plans of holding a massive rally of 400 women activists to storm the temple premises on Republic Day this month against the gender discrimination are on. The shrine at Shani Shingnapur consists of a five-and-half-foot-high black rock installed on an open-air platform, which symbolises the god Shani.A Trishul (trident) is placed along the side of the image and a Nandi (bull) image is on the south side. In front are the small images of Shiva and Hanuman.On a day 10,000 to 40,000 people visit here, but on Saturdays and special occasions more than 1.5 lakh people visit the temple. On an average, 2,000 litres of mustard oil is offered in the temple and it goes up again on Saturdays."

However, by mid-January there is no flowering in mustard and wheat. ""Situation is not at all looking good. Kharif season was bad because of untimely rain and now weather is not supportive for the Rabi crop too,"" said Nagendra Singh Khangarot, farmer from Ajmer.Farmers were happy with the early descending of winters this time and they hoped a good crop of wheat and mustered.

A farmer near Nagaur growing Pusa Mustard-30 in his two-acre field.A mustard oil that is healthy and yet retains its characteristic pungency is something many consumers  especially in northern and eastern India  would consider as the ideal cooking and frying medium.That ideal combination may have become real now, with the release of a new variety, Pusa Mustard-30. Developed by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), it has an erucic acid content of less than 2 per cent of total fatty acids. The normal Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) typically have over 45 per cent erucic acid, linked to increase in risk of cardiac muscle impairment.The high erucic acid levels in Indian mustard have led to a growing market for imported rapeseed or canola oil (Brassica napus). Belonging to the same Brassicaceae family, but of a different species (napus), canola oil has the advantage of low erucic acid (below 2 per cent), but lacks in glucosinolates, organic compounds that catalyse reactions in the broken seeds imparting the pungent taste associated with mustard oil. While the glucosinolates content in Indian mustard is about 150 micromoles per gram of seeds, it is less than 30 for canola.Share This Article Related Article Administrative apathy: Cradle of Indias Green Revolution languishes without a headAdministrative apathy: Cradle of Indias Green Revolution languishes without a head Breeding breakthrough: Now, an Indian mustard as good as canola  and non-GM!Breeding breakthrough: Now, an Indian mustard as good as canola  and non-GM!

The seed yields are 11-12 quintals per acre, with 40 per cent oil content. This is as good as what farmers are getting from regular mustard varieties, though the oil is of much superior quality, says Bhagirath Choudhary, founder-director of South Asia Biotechnology Centre, which has done the major lab-to-land work of taking Pusa Mustard-30 from the IARI to farmers fields.Choudhary sourced 5 kg breeder seeds of Pusa Mustard-30 from IARI and planted in the 2014-15 rabi season to produce about 30 quintals of commercial mustardseed. In the current rabi season, he has undertaken contract cultivation of the new variety across 110 acres in Jabalpur, Nagaur (Rajasthan) and Moga. This year, my production should cross 1,200 quintals. I am also paying a premium of Rs 200/quintal over the market price for regular mustard to incentivise farmers to grow this variety, Choudhary notes.The 40-year-old agri-entrepreneur has even promoted a separate venture, Arpan Seeds Pvt Ltd, to produce and market the oil from Pusa Mustard-30 under the Lifegard brand. I want to position it as a premium healthy Indian mustard oil. I hope to get some support for this 100 per cent Made in India startup initiative, he notes.The Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) has also called Choudharys initiative as a first of its kind effort by ICAR-IARI under public-private-partnership mode to launch an indigenously developed health value product with improved oil quality.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

If the warm winter conditions continue, a range of rabi (winter) crops as well as fruits such as apples could be impacted, say experts.The past two kharif (summer) seasons were hit by deficit monsoon rains while heavy unseasonal rains and hailstorms affected the intervening rabi crop over large regions of Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.Experts said high winter temperatures could impact tillering (side growth) of wheat and could lower yields if the temperatures continue to remain above normal. High temperatures in March could affect grain formation in wheat, which would then be in the milking stage. Wheat has been grown this year in over 35 lakh hectares in Punjab and about 24 lakh hectares in Haryana. The two states are the biggest contributors of the grain to the national stock.High temperatures and missing snowfall is also posing a threat to Himachal Pradesh's Rs 3,500-crore apple sector. Experts said rain and snow at this time of the year is crucial as it provides the chilling hours required for good production of apples in the coming season.In Uttar Pradesh, the weather is causing concern not only for wheat but also the gram crop. ""If the weather remains warm and dry in the second half of January, it will hit flowering and ripening of wheat and gram"" said Sudhir Panwar, president Kisan Jagriti Manch and member of UP State Planning Commission.The lack of winter rain has also worsened the groundwater situation in UP, where 52 districts or two-thirds of the state's area, faced a drought last year. Irrigation has also suffered because of the decline in water table.In Rajasthan, farmers have been hoping in vain for minimum temperatures to drop below 5 degrees C and ground frost to form, as these conditions are good for wheat, barley, peas, grams and mustard.""With a clear skies and high temperatures, moisture levels have decreased. There's now a chance of these crops getting damaged. For mustard in particular, you need shivering cold conditions,"" said Amrik Singh, a farmer in Sriganganagar, the main farming district of Rajasthan."

India spends more than $10 billion annually on vegetable oil imports and GM mustard  with yields 38 percent higher than normal varieties  will give Modi a chance to slash this bill.The Prime Minister has already shown he is keen to push for technology in farming, which sustains more than two-thirds of India's population, by reversing an effective ban on field trials of GM food crops soon after taking office in 2014. Earlier, as the chief minister of Gujarat state, he had backed the widespread adoption of GM cotton by farmers.GM mustard is next on the country's radar. Results from safety tests conducted on the hybrid oilseed crop over the past decade were submitted to the government in September.""I am hoping that its commercial launch happens,"" Deepak Pental, the main scientist behind the GM oilseed crop, told Reuters. ""And the very fact that the ministry called a meeting (on January 4) suggests they are serious. Also, if India's top scientist is writing to the PM then it surely is significant.""In a letter sent to Modi and seen by Reuters, principal scientific adviser R Chidambaram said GM food crops were widely prevalent globally and their use would only rise as changing weather patterns hit farm output. India already consumes oil derived from a GM rapeseed grown in Canada.""India, in my opinion, should not hesitate to be the first introducer of new advanced technology, after convincing itself, of course, about its value to the users and the nation, its economic viability, its safety and environment friendliness,"" Chidambaram wrote in the letter sent in October.""GM food crops fall into this category.""India's environment and forest ministry that is responsible for assessing GM crop applications said the 3,100-page mustard safety report was being evaluated, and that commercialization would be preceded by a careful analysis of risks and benefits.India's GM mustard makes use of three genes already incorporated in rapeseed hybrids in Canada, the United States and Australia and extensive biosafety tests have revealed no cause for concern, Pental said.Also, oil derived from its seeds does not contain any of the proteins linked to the three genes used, he added.While things are moving in the right direction, Pental acknowledged that overcoming opposition would be difficult.Grassroots groups associated with Bharatiya Janata Party have opposed GM crops fearing the reliance on expensive seeds patented by multinationals like Monsanto. Pental, however, said the mustard project was state-funded so seed prices would be reasonable.Monsanto launched Bt cotton in India in 2002, selling seeds directly and licensing local producers. The GM cotton, which produces its own insecticide, has helped India become a leading producer and exporter of the fibre. Monsanto is also developing GM corn varieties.Prabhakar Kelkar, the national general secretary of the farmers' body affiliated to BJP's ideological parent, the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, said the government should not go ahead until every seed variety was found to be foolproof.""We'll make people aware of the ill effects, especially after pest attacks devastated GM cotton crops recently,"" said Kelkar. ""But if the government approves then what can we do?"""

For dirt tracks, off roads and mountain trails abound within an hour's drive of the city's heart, a magnet for outdoorsy folk from these parts - and for events like the Hansaplast Rocksport Challenge.'Have money, head outdoors' may well be the motto of the well-off Gurgaon resident, who has money and time to spare. At the wonderfully named Camp Tikkling, adventure enthusiasts picked their activity of choice and enjoyed a fun Sunday., basking in a kinder-than-usual January sun.The organizers argue that this is India's biggest carnival of adventure. Certainly, the many who flocked to Camp Tikkling on the weekend - around 1,600 on the Saturday, and approximately 2,800 on Sunday - showed that the 'Challenge' has become an essential part of Gurgaon's calendar.And if the sight of adrenaline seekers testing their endurance amid mustard fields felt a tad incongruous, the backdrop did little to mask the intensity of the competitors.An obstacle course was set up for those for whom adventure is nothing without aches and pains, and bruises and blood. Participants had to negotiate the rock-strewn ruggedness of the Aravallis, and features like water-filled trenches. Conquer all that and you deserve a medal. But it wasn't just a day given over to those with stamina and spunk.Besides the obstacle run, there were zorbing, paintballing and quad biking. There was hot-air ballooning too, but the daytime breezes over the weekend meant that only on Saturday evening was there any chance of folks taking to the air to delight in the bucolic surroundings.The vibe was decidedly pumped up. Techno- and bass-heavy music rumbled from the speakers as crowds milled around lazily or purposefully (according to their mood). Participants in the races could be recognized from their mud-caked bodies, relieved as well as invigorated by the thrill - and challenge - of the chase. Meanwhile, stalls selling adventure gear and mountain-friendly bikes jostled with those selling handicrafts (there was even a live pottery session) and 'funky' stuff like masks.And then there was Rannvijay Singh, rockstar hero and 'chief architect' of the race. Not surprisingly, the 'Selfie with Rannvijay' contest drew many an awestruck fan. This roadie, genial and approachable, didn't disappoint. Neither, for that matter, did the 2016 Rocksport Challenge."

""It is surprising that Delhi University is making an attempt to commercialise a technology which has so far been pushed by multinational seed companies. It is more surprising that even if Delhi University is able to develop the technology, there is no public institution to make it available to farmers,"" Nitish wrote in his letter.The CM also questioned the rationale behind launching GM mustard seed by sidelining the traditional variety. ""The variety developed by Indian Council for Agricultural Research (ICAR) has productivity of 2.1 tonnes per hectare against the national average production of 1.2 tonnes per hectare. The very relevance of launch of GM mustard seed is doubtful,"" Nitish said.Vehemently protesting the commercial launch of GM mustard seed, Nitish said the Bihar government had rejected the use of such technology in the state in 2009. ""In 2011, field trial of GM maize was done without any information to the state government and it was stopped only after I took up the matter with the then Union forest and environment minister,"" Nitish said.In his letter, the CM pointed out that according to the existing policy, commercial release of GM seeds should be done only after taking state governments into confidence."
5b2e38e69855b7245313ff9f,Enemy Lurks within Villages in Border Areas,https://www.hindustantimes.com/punjab/in-border-villages-enemy-lurks-within/story-IVpshiv8Tiyo7fe6k1Sd6M.html,2016-01-20,"The white pillars that mark the international border between India and Pakistan stand bright in the fog, mute witness to the drug smuggling, and now terror, route to Punjab. Beyond the pillars, the mustard crop is in bloom in Pakistan, while the lush wheat fields provide the winter backdrop on the Indian side. A fortnight after the Pathankot terror attack on the airbase, a visit to Punjabs border villages reveals a deceptive calm but disturbing truth that the enemy lurks within.On the surface, its difficult to miss the prosperity that families of farmers in Punjabs border villages have seen over the past 15 years. Landholdings may have shrunk but trucks parked outside houses in villages located just a shout away from the border speak volumes about the easy money narcotic smuggling has brought.The high number of drug addicts in these villages also reveals the misfortune that has befallen their residents.Once into smuggling cloth material, opium and later gold from Pakistan, crossing the unfenced, and unguarded, border was like venturing into the neighbourhood for these families. In the past decade, however, they have taken to smuggling heroin. The contraband is smuggled from Afghanistan and Pakistan into India via J&K, Rajasthan and Punjab. A major part of the consignment is passed through Punjab, while some quantity of heroin is sold in the local market by couriers. The smuggling has been going on unchecked as its done with the tacit understanding of Punjab Police and politicians, at different levels, coupled with the lack of a modern surveillance system and inadequately deployed Border Security Force (BSF).Now its just that Pakistan has begun pushing in terror with the narcotics, the Pathankot attack being the latest fallout.EVERYONE IS A SUSPECT HERESmuggling has is virtually a lucrative cottage industry in Punjabs border belt. Despite the rising risks, villagers admit, it has helped build fortunes. The signs of prosperity are visible in villages such as Mahwa, Daoke, Naushera Dhalla, Havelian, Mehndipur and Rajatal.But drug addicts can also be spotted easily. Border villagers are into smuggling and the youth are in the grip of drugs. Everyone is a suspect here, says Amandeep Singh of Mehndipur village, in the Khemkaran sector, surrounded on three sides by Pakistan.TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORTAbout 2 km from Mehndipur is Sehajrai village of Pakistan, considered the hotbed of heroin smugglers due to its proximity with the border. Border villagers own farm land across the barbed fence up to the pillars. They grow wheat and paddy in the fertile stretch on the Indian side, while their Pakistani counterparts plough land right up to the pillars.At many places from Fazilka to Pathankot, the border criss-crosses in such a manner that the Pakistani farmers land is 50 metres from the Indian fence. Pushing heroin in small-sized packets is then just a throw away. There have been instances of police and BSF recovering Pakistani mobile phone SIM cards from Indian couriers. The border villages receive signals of Pakistans cellular networks such as Mobilink and Ofone.When the crop is tall and ripe on both sides of the Radcliffe line, the border pillars are not visible. This is an advantage for Pakistani smugglers, who can easily hide amid wheat or paddy crop while venturing into Indian fields to push the poison into Punjab. And, there is no dearth of takers. Before the border was fenced, Indian villagers could simply walk into villages in Pakistan that are a kilometre away, says Labh Singh, 80, of Naushera Dhalla village. A former opium smuggler, he broke down and said with regret: My son was into smuggling and was caught with fake currency and arms. He died in jail.BSFS CHALLENGESPolice and politicians encourage drug smuggling. Police harass the innocent. I have been detained many a time unnecessarily, claims Suba Singh, a former sarpanch of Rajatal village, infamous for smugglers, even as another villager Kundan Singh, 90, reminds the former about his shady past.Now, every family that owns farms across the fence is seen as a potential heroin smuggler in the garb of a farmer. This stigma doesnt ruffle many. Smuggling, many admit, flows in their blood.Thats one of the enormous challenges the BSF faces while guarding the 553-km border of Punjab. The BSF kisan (farmer) guards accompany peasants to their land across the fence. Many a time, we have recovered heroin hidden in farm appliances. It is not easy when you have to watch anti-national activities of those whom you are protecting, says a senior BSF officer."

""It has come to our knowledge that a clandestine attempt is made to commercially release GM mustard seeds in the country,"" Nitish wrote in the letter. ""It is surprising that Delhi University is attempting to commercialise a technology, which has so far been pushed by multinational seed companies."" Nitish cited the conflicting claims on the superiority of GM mustard over traditional varieties. ""It is relevant to mention that the productivity of existing Indian Council for Agriculture Research (Icar) bred varieties of rapeseed and mustard is 2.1 tonnes per hectare, whereas the national average productivity is only 1.2 tonnes per hectare. Therefore, even with the existing varieties and technology, productivity can be doubled provided farmers are given the right variety and appropriate technology,"" Nitish wrote. Modern biotechnological or genetic engineering methods are used to modify genes or DNAs of crops to make genetically modified seeds. In most cases, the aim is to increase yield. The scientific community is divided on the usefulness of such crops. Many activists blame GM cotton as the reason for widespread farmer suicides in cotton growing areas of the country. The letter also enumerated the instances when the state government rejected field trials of genetically modified brinjal (Bt-brinjal) and maize between 2009 and 2012. ""In 2011, the field trial of Bt-maize was laid without informing the state government and thereafter following my telephonic conversation with the then Union minister for environment, the trials were cancelled, and was hurriedly uprooted without adequate scientific care,"" Nitish wrote.

He further pointed out that a letter from the Union environment ministry, dated December 19, 2012, informed that a no objection certificate (NOC) from the state government was mandatory prior to field trials of GM crops. The state government's worry stems from the fact that mustard is a major oilseed crop in the state. Its leaves are edible, seeds are used to make condiments and oilcake is used for animal feed. Its flowers are a source of pollen for honeybees as well. ""It appears that when the interested parties (read MNCs) failed to win the farmers' confidence, they are trying to push the measures through public institutions,"" the letter stated. Nitish said if the technology is adopted without the state government being consulted at the trial stage, it would be ""against the spirit of consultation and cooperative federalism."""

Children like Ibrahim and women are used as carriers to smuggle opium across the border. Crossing over to Bangladesh in the morning and returning before sunset is a common practice.Finer products like heroin are carried back from there through Lalgola and Domkal. Around 750-800 gm of resin is required to produce 100 gm of heroin. The riches from the opium trade has reduced poverty.Ismail Sheikh of Golapgunj, a daily labourer till recently, has come into wealth and built a pucca house and bought a motorcycle. How? He took 1 bigha land on contract for a year and sowed poppy. ""Last October, we all took seeds of mustard or wheat but Ismail went for poppy. And we heard that he garnered over Rs 50,000 from the plot,"" said his neighbour Alim.Ismail's isn't the only rags to riches story. Thousands of farmers in Malda, Nadia and Murshidabad have found the short cut to success within three-four months, dumping the uncertainty over ravi crop to welcome offers from some 'foreigners'.Sabiruddin of Rejinagar recounted how the 'foreigner', Lakshman Yadav, met him and offered money to take contract of the land to farm. Yadav, a resident of UP, came here from Lalgola.Sabiruddin took the 1 bigha land from the owner who lives in Kolkata, for Rs 12,000. Yadav gave him this money as well as the seeds. The contract was that Yadav would take away entire resin collected from the poppies leaving the kernel for the farmer. Sabir learnt that the resin costs Rs 25,000 a kg. ""I heard that the gum is used to make intoxicant,"" he remarked.Thousands have similarly fallen to temptation of easy money that has led to the conversion of land along the belt into 'mini Afganistan'.Those who cannot afford to till large land opt for smaller ones even in the backyard. ""With China Silk invading the market, the cultivation of traditional mulberry has become non-viable. Even farming of vegetables with huge expense and little profit is avoided by the farmers,"" observed Binoy Mandal of Ramnagar. Instead, a cottah of poppy cultivation costs Rs 5000-7000, which yields 1 kg of resin that fetches Rs 60,000-70,000."" ""Moreover, the farming is not strenuous.Malda had a shortage of wheat production this year. Against 43,290 hectare of land in which wheat was cultivated last year, 41,145 hectare was used this year.Opium cultivation has a long history in this region. Immediately after the war of Plassey in 1757, East India Company discovered the treasure of opium in adjoining areas. Mainly controlled by the Portugese, the British soon took control of the trading to export opium to Asian and European countries. Apart from being used by the pharmaceutical companies, the opium journeys across the parched plains on a trail beaten by the British, who learnt to enslave China with Indian opium.However, the Indian government after Independence has never given licence to farmers to grow poppy apart from parts in Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh. But the tradition remained in Bengal. Oblivious of the danger and huge 'potential' lying within, Some farmers used to spray poppy seed in their lands. It is to get poppy seeds (posto) which is a popular cooking ingredient.FACTFILE:Villages thriving on poppy cultivation: Rajarampur, Nasipur, Kedarchandpur,Sarbangapur, Kasipur, Dubsor, Dakatepota, Chandghar in Murshidabad;Kaligunj, Tehatta, Karimnagar in Nadia; Harishchandrapur, Manikchak, Golapgunj, Ramnagar, Shersahi, Sahabazpur in Malda.Land under poppy cultivation: 5 lakh hectarePoppy cultivation unearthed: 15,000 bigha"

After expecting yet another Rabi crop failure, government and farmers are now hopeful of normal production provided similar conditions prevail till the end of January.Intense cold that has gripped the state for the past one week is proving favourable for crops. Concerns and worries of officials of agriculture department have quelled, however, some fears linger on because of abrupt weather conditions.""There were some concerns among farmers when mercury was on the rise. But with a dip in mercury again, situation is coming back to normal. If temperature remains like this for another week or so, there will be normal production of wheat and mustard, the major Rabi crops in Rajasthan,"" said an official from the department.Unusually, hot weather in winter impacts crops, where it's difficult for wheat to germinate completely while mustard lacks oil content. Other crops like barley, gram and millets and seasonal vegetables too have negative effect in high temperatures. ""Farmers were happy with the early descending winters this time and they hoped a good crop of wheat and mustard, as both wheat and mustard require low temperature for quality production,"" said Nagendra Khangarot, an agricultural expert.A total of 84.13 lakh hectare has been brought under Rabi crop cultivation this season. Out of this, 29.65 lakh hectare is covered with an estimated production of over 1 crore tonnes. Nearly 23.83 lakh hectare is under covered with rapeseed and mustard. Other major crops that have been sown are gram (11.4 lakh hectare) and barley (3.3 lakh hectare).Officials are also upbeat after weather department forecast a long spell of winters. Agriculture directorate said cloudy weather and rains will boost Rabi crop production. ""If rain occurs, it will act as a boon for the crops. If weather department is to be believed, we can expect some showers in the coming days,"" added the official."

He, along with around 20 friends from his school, was busy practising for the 67th Republic Day celebrations. ""We will showcase various feats using the roller skates, such as circling around while holding hands, which require a lot of co-ordination. We have been preparing for the show for the last one month,"" said Tanish. Students from various schools and colleges are busy preparing for the parade to make sure that their steps remain perfect on the Republic Day parade. Rani Aishwarya Chowdhury, a student of Saraswati Sishu Vidya Mandir, has been taking part in the parade for the last five years. ""This is a great venue to meet new people and make friends. It is a fun-filled affair and one gets to learn teamwork and dedication,"" she said. Like every year, a daredevil stunts show by the students of Maharishi College will be one of the main attractions of the parade. A group of 15 boys and girls of the college will showcase their riding skills in 10 bikes. This year, they will present a lotus formation. Two rounds of march-past are being conducted between 2.30pm and 5.30pm every day in which 89 troupes, each consisting of 32 persons, are taking part. Apart from the cadets from schools and colleges, jawans of Central Industrial Security Force, Central Reserve Police Force, Railway Protection Force, 120 Infantry Battalion Territorial Army, home guards and traffic police are also taking part in the drill. Volunteers of several organisations, such as Red Cross and Brahma Kumaris, will also be a part of the parade along with four cultural groups from Ganjam, Koraput, Kalahandi and Puri. Police are continuously providing instructions to improve the performance of participants. They are focusing on every minor detail, right from maintenance of gap to guiding the flag bearers. While as many as 20 platoons of police will be deployed in and around the parade place, additional 10 platoons of police force would be deployed at various parts of the city. ""We will intensify frisking of vehicles in the city. Night patrolling will also be intensified,"" said deputy commissioner of police Satyabrata Bhoi. Adivasi Mela From creating colourful mud houses with thatched roofs to bamboo adornments, participants at the Adivasi Mela are putting in their best efforts to present a grand show during the fair. The 15-day fair will start on the Adivasi Ground from January 26. With the major attraction of the fair being graphic representation of tribal lifestyle, people from around 25 tribal communities of the state are setting up replicas of their hamlets on the fair ground. Products, including food ingredients and tribal jewellery, are also highlights of the fair. Badis (pulse cakes), turmeric, fumigant, tamarind paste, pulses and cereals such as black gram, kendul, mustard and cumin seeds, cinnamon and a large variety of rice will be available apart from handicraft items such as dongriya shawl, comb, wooden and iron crafts of Bhatra and bamboo crafts. This year, around 150 kiosks will be set up. Adequate security arrangements will be made to ensure smooth conduct of the fair, while CCTV cameras would also be installed. The annual fair is organised by the state scheduled castes (SC) and scheduled tribes (ST) department."
5940a0bf7be9e024e4599a08,Sunday story: The Cattlelines,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/sunday-story-the-cattlelines/,2016-01-24,"A cattle market at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from the border with Bangladesh. The haat, one of the larger cattle markets of Murshidabad district, comes alive every Sunday A cattle market at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from the border with Bangladesh. The haat, one of the larger cattle markets of Murshidabad district, comes alive every SundayBorders mean little here  the Padma doesnt think its worth even a pause. So the river flows on, even at Lalgola in West Bengals Murshidabad district, where it is part of the border between India and Bangladesh. The river refuses to pay heed to any man-made creations  border fences or security outposts  dismissing all such attempts with a casual change of direction every year during the monsoon. Over the last year, however, the Padma would have noticed a shift: the cattle smuggling trade between the two countries, much of it over the river and its tributaries, is now down to a trickle.Officers of the Border Security Force (BSF), whose jawans patrol the 915 km stretch of the border that West Bengal shares with Bangladesh, estimate that cattle smuggling has come down by more than 70 per cent since the BJP-led government at the Centre made the issue one of its top priorities. In April last year, Union Home Minister Rajnath Singh instructed BSF personnel deployed along the border to check cattle smuggling.Four months later, the minister touted the drop in figures for cattle smuggling as one of the governments major successes: from about 20-22 lakh cattle that would be smuggled across the border every year, he said, the numbers had come down to 2-2.5 lakh cattle in 2015.Since the NDA government came to power, the BSF has given its men discretionary powers to shoot at cattle smugglers, a strategy that has reportedly contributed to the drop in smuggling. In December 2015, in a written reply to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Minister of State for Home Kiren Rijiju had said, During the current calendar year, 21 cross-border criminals were killed by the BSF along the Bangladesh border, of whom 16 were allegedly cattle smugglers.We are taking different measures to ensure that cattle smuggling is stopped. Over the last year, we brought it to a halt and now weve asked the Centre to provide us with land to construct fences to stop all infiltration, says BSF DIG R PS Jaswal.BSF officers claim their efforts have had a direct result on sale of beef in Bangladesh. Figures available with the cattle haat (market) in Bangladesh show that around 22 lakh cattleheads were sold in 2013, 18 lakh in 2014, but only 4.5 lakh in 2015.But what Delhi sees as smuggling, Dhaka sees as legitimate cross-border trade. So during the November 16-17 Home Secretary-level talks between the two countries, Bangladesh raised the issue of rising prices of beef in that country as a result of the BSF crackdown. Dhaka reportedly also requested Delhi to go easy on cattle smugglers.The BSF has identified 64 Border Outposts (BOPs) along the Bengal-Bangladesh border that are vulnerable to cattle smuggling. Of these, they say, 46 account for 80 per cent of the cattle smuggling cases. Eight of these are in Murshidabad, where the river makes the border particularly hard to sanitise.The BSFs outposts are mostly bamboo sheds where jawans spend the nights. In the mornings, these outposts see a steady stream of people who take their cattle to the other side to graze. The jawans greet the cattle herders, reminding them to be back before sundown.Besides the outposts, new fences have been set up and BSF jawans patrol the river, their twin-engine speed boats rushing past the smaller country boats.But everyday life has a way of looking beyond the jawans, their guns and their speedboats. Umaruddin Ahmed, a farmer in Aurangabad village, says he routinely crosses over with his herd of cattle. Why should the border matter? My sister lives in Bangladesh. My ties with her are more important than anything else. We have documents issued by the state government that prove we live in India. The BSF examines our papers and allows us to walk across, says Ahmed, who has just returned from another visit to his sister. While the younger of his three sons takes care of his 200 sq ft field, he takes care of his cattle, taking them for walks across the border. My cattle like grazing on the other side. Here there are too many cows and not enough space. And of course, I get to chat with my sister, he says.This easy relationship that the villagers share with the border coupled with the Centres push to stop cattle smuggling leave the BSF with an unenviable job. Not only do they have to ensure that every Indian citizen who crosses the boundary is properly identified and returns before sunset, they also have to photograph, tag and count every animal that crosses the border.If someone returns with one animal less, we immediately file a case against him and hand him over to the police. There is no separate section in the Indian Penal Code for cattle smuggling, so we register cases under sections pertaining to cheating, says a senior officer of the BSFs Lalgola unit who spoke on condition of anonymity.The daily ritual of counting cows at checkposts, once in the morning and then again in the evening, is one of the many ways the BSF hopes to counter a trade that has thrived in the area for as long as anyone can remember.Apart from constructing border roads, putting up flood lights and increasing outposts along the border, the BSF has also increased the frequency of its surveillance. On Thursday, the Union Home Minister said a plan had been finalised to complete the fencing of the border.The BSF is now digging trenches and laying iron pipes in them along the barbed wire fences at the border. The trenches and the pipes will make it difficult for the cattle to jump across. This method has been very successful, says IG Sandeep Sulanke, who is in charge of the BSFs South Bengal Frontier.On more than one occasion, however, BSF jawans and officers have found themselves outnumbered and outflanked by the cattle smugglers. In December, we ambushed a big group of smugglers and their cattle. When we fired in the air, the cows, around 200 of them, started running helter-skelter and the smugglers gave us the slip. We were left holding the tails of a few cows. We only managed to round up about 50 cows, says a BSF officer posted at Cooch Behar, the district neighbouring Murshidabad, where the BSF claims cattle smuggling has come down  from a lakh a day to 500  since the land boundary agreement on enclaves made it easier to identify the border.Despite their efforts, many in the BSF feel that given the socio-economic realities of southern Bengal, the demand for beef and the nearly limitless supply of ageing bovines in India, smugglers will soon find a way to hoodwink them.We are doing our best and the situation (of cattle smuggling) is far better now than before, but frankly, we can stop, say, 10 cows. How can we stop a hundred? Theres a constant supply of cows from India and high demand in Bangladesh. With the kind of poverty in these parts and the money thats to be got from smuggling, to many of them, the risk of getting arrested or even dying during a smuggling operation seems worth taking, says a BSF officer who is posted at the BSFs Murshidabad circle headquarters in Behrampore town.In June 2015, the BSF had in its official magazine suggested that the only way to curb cattle smuggling was to legalise the export of over-aged and non-milching animals and promote beef industry in India by allowing the slaughter of unwanted cattle.Its a little before noon and a cattle haat is on at Omarpur, a little over 8 km from Lalgola at the border. The haat, one of the larger cattle haats of Murshidabad district, comes alive every Sunday. Several thousand cows are brought here for sale from across India  particularly Haryana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand. Most of the cows are old and sick, their ribs sticking out, their eyes glazed.Almost all these cows will be smuggled across the border for slaughter, some will make it to the few legal slaughterhouses in the state, says a trader.I have just sold two of my cows for Rs 13,000. They were healthy and fetched a good price. I am going to buy some chicken and vegetables and well have a feast at home today. Its a Sunday after all, says Ibrahim Kazi from Behrampore town, briskly counting the notes.For decades, the smuggling and sale of cattle across the border have provided sustenance to families in Murshidabad, both Hindus and Muslims. The trade has thrived, often as a family profession, with secrets passed down generations: how to evade the BSF, the best routes to transport cattle, how to ensure stealth while crossing the border.The economics of cattle smuggling is what makes the BSFs job tough. For most Indian farmers, a cow past its prime is of little value. Besides, tractors have long replaced bulls and oxen and they are of little use too. So the cattle are sold to traders who supply them to slaughterhouses in India, both legal and illegal. But with beef selling for around Rs 350-Rs 450 a kg in Bangladesh, in comparison to Rs 150 a kg in Bengal, smuggling is far more lucrative.Villages such as Shamsherganj and Lal Kola are seen as the hub of the cattle trade. By day, however, these are just an idyllic expanse of green. Their fields, thick with silt from the Padma, are among the most fertile in the country. But fragmented landholdings have forced villagers to look for livelihood options elsewhere  and its cattle smuggling that most turn to.We grow vegetables and our produce is possibly the best in the state. But we dont earn any profit. The money we earn, which allows us to educate our children, comes from taking cattle to Bangladesh, says Barun Mondal, a farmer at Shamsherganj.However, he claims to have stopped himself. I used to transport cattle from the haats to the collection point. It wasnt thought of as illegal until recently.Ahmed Raza, the headman at Chotokalia hamlet in Shamsherganj, says, Most families here survive because of cattle smuggling. Women roll beedis at home and men tend to their farms. But without the cattle trade, our income will go down by half. There are already families here who can no longer afford to send their children to school. Education is free, but theyd rather have more hands to work on the fields if thats the only source of income, he says.Ranjit, a villager from Omarpur in Murshidabad, who now works for an insurance company, says he smuggled cattle for most of his adult life. You cant do this on your own. You need to be part of a network, says the 42-year-old, adding smugglers usually organise themselves along religious or caste lines. For instance, the Muslim families of Omarpur look out for each other. Similarly, smugglers of the Ghosh community share information with each other, he says.Though he now sells insurance to people in his village, I was very good at smuggling, he says proudly. That makes him qualified to explain the trade and its ways.To begin with, he says, villagers bring their cows to the haats, from where transporters take them to collection points. The transporters avoid the main roads and usually move with not more than two cows at a time. Depending on the distance they cover, they get paid Rs 200-Rs 500 to take the cattle to the collection point, he says.This collection point is usually the home of a villager who is trusted by those in charge of the operation. Here the cows are kept for a few days until there are at least a hundred cows in one village. The smuggler pays for the upkeep of the cows and also pays a few thousands to the person whose house is the collection point, says Ranjit.The third and final part of the operation is the actual crossing of the border. This is done by cattle herders, usually young boys called rakhaals. The cows are fed a mixture of mustard oil and salt, which, smugglers believe, makes them less likely to moo while crossing. At places where the river separates the two countries, the cows are led into the water and forced to cross the river. The rakhaals hold on to the cows tail as they swim across the river to the other side. Smugglers prefer taking at least a hundred cows together because even if the BSF were to interrupt the smuggling operation, there is no way two patrolling officers can stop a hundred charging cows or bulls, he says.The rakhaals choose their time and moment to cross over  they usually do so when theres heavy fog or when its raining. That makes it very difficult for us to see the cows as they move across the border, says a BSF jawan posted at the Murshidabad circle headquarters.The BSF has been filing FIRs against the cattle smugglers they arrest before handing them over to the police. But the police, they say, need to do more. The BSF is limited to the border, but the police can make arrests in the haats. But that doesnt happen, making our job almost impossible, says the officer.So for now, the BSF relies on its meticulous headcount. There is a joke in the BSF now about how we are actually the CSF or the Cattle Security Force. We are following our orders and we are stopping the smuggling of cattle. But as far as national security is concerned, many of us feel that our efforts will be better directed at stopping the flow of fake currency and contraband and not counting cows, says a senior BSF officer.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
591f3db57be9e025a5d4c415,Thorough debate on GM crops is need of hour,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/525122/thorough-debate-gm-crops-need.html,2016-01-25,"Thorough debate on GM crops is need of hourKalyan Ray, Jan 26, 2016, DHNS 23:58 ISTAs the Central government prepares to battle a contempt notice in the Supreme Court on the purported trials of genetically modified (GM) mustard, a year-old British Parliament document may come handy for the department of biotechnology (DBT) to firm up its arguments, being the first narrative from lawmakers on why the conservative view on genetically modified crops needs re-examination.Titled Advanced Genetic Techniques for Crop Improvement: Regulation, risks and precaution, the report from the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee assumed significance in the backdrop of DBTs admission of taking a relook at the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India Bill to iron out its flaws, before it is brought to parliament once again seeking passage. The British report reflects several arguments that have Indian scientists voiced for years, but failed to convince a large section of the society.For instance, many opinions of Indian anti-GM activists are modelled on the European Union legislation. The point, which is largely ignored, is current EU legislative framework for novel plants is founded on the premise that genetically modified plants pose inherently greater risk than their conventional counterparts. The regulations were developed in 1990s when little was known about the GM technology. That changed in the last two decades.The weight of peer-reviewed scientific evidence, collected over many years, has shown this argument unjustified. Where genetically modified crops have been shown to pose a risk, this has invariably been a result of the trait displayed  for example, herbicide tolerance  rather than the technology itself.Worldwide, over 175 million hectares are dedicated to GM crop, accounting for 12 per cent of arable land. No inherent risks have so far been identified to human or animal health from this consumption or to the environment from their cultivation.The EUs process-based regulatory system for novel crops is increasingly proving itself to be incapable of dealing with advances in technology. This raises the prospect that potentially important agricultural innovations will be hindered, or even halted, by inappropriate regulation, while potentially harmful crops may escape appropriate control if they are produced using techniques not captured by GMO regulations, argues the British Parliament report.Five years ago, an Indian parliament report  by the Standing Committee on Agriculture  too scrutinised the GM crop issues. Based on scientific evidences presented before it, the panel noted biotechnologys salutory contributions to agriculture. But citing regulatory glitches and precautionary principle, the Standing Committee on Agriculture asked the government to discontinue all field trials and carrying out the R&D activities in strict confinement.The UK report, however, asserts that precautionary norms act as a barrier to progress in this field because scientific evidence relating to the use of GM crops are neither insufficient, inconclusive nor uncertain.The Indian parliamentary panels report was followed by another critical report from an expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court. It supported continuing with the stay on field trials till regulatory issues are addressed, though one member of the panel disagreed.Surreptitious testingThe Central government issued a moratorium on GM crop field trials, which was lifted later. But field trials remain mostly suspended in the absence of no objection certificate from state governments. The contempt petition argues that field trials of GM mustard were conducted surreptitiously in two states, in violation of past orders from the Supreme Court.A month after the contempt petition was filed, DBT released the National Biotechnology Development strategy in January 2016, demonstrating the governments intention to follow the biotechnology driven path for crop improvement. The department wants to set up translational centre for agri-biotechnology, partnering with the state agriculture universities. The genetic modifications would target predominantly at overcoming the biotic and abiotic stresses like drought or flood situation.But, for the strategy to succeed, the apex court and parliament have to be convinced that benefits of genetically modified crops far outweigh the risks, if any; and past action from Indian scientists and government officials are far from convincing.There is no logical answer to a simple question  why, more than 15 years after commercial cultivation of Bt cotton was approved, not a single Bt cotton seed from any public sector seed company has come to the market and why the private sector was given a free hand.However, it is a question on the percolation of the technology, and not the GM technology per se. A proposal to involve Indian Council of Agriculture Research on GM crop trials through its all-India coordinated research programme remains on paper.Good risk management requires the potential benefits of an action to be thoroughly considered alongside the risks. It also requires a consideration of the risk of failing to act.Current GMO legislation fails to adequately recognise this point, argues the UK Parliament report. This has led to a one-sided decision-making process and has sent a misleading message to the public about the potential value of these products, to the economy, society and the environment.Its clear that instead of a single technology, a diversity of approaches  technological, social, economic and political  are required to address the ills in the agriculture sector.However, advanced genetic approaches do have a role to play. We are convinced by the evidence provided to us that this suite of technologies is a potentially important tool, particularly in the developing world, which should not be rejected unless there are solid scientific evidence those technologies may cause harm, says the UK report.Fears of pursuing advanced genetic approaches to crop improvement, it says, inevitably locks out alternative technologies and solutions are ill-founded. But regulatory reforms have to be an essential. Whether the DBT and other ministries can undertake the necessary reforms and convince parliament and the Supreme Court, is a million dollar question."

Rabi crops have been under pressure due to dry winter following two consecutive drought years, raising concerns over production levels.The drop in temperature in the last few days has given a breather to farmers. The cold weather will help standing wheat and mustard crops, Mr Singh said.Asked about the wheat crop prospects, Karnal-based Directorate of Wheat Research head Indu Sharma said: At this point of time, cool temperature is very beneficial for the crop, both early and late sown varieties.However, the wheat crop prospects would depend on the temperature next two months. If the temperature does not rise above normal after February, there will not be any set back on production, she said. Wheat sowing has been completed in most states, though some bit been sown in the sugarcane belt, she added.On mustard crop, the Solvent Extractors Association president Pravin Lunkad said: In last few days, the cold weather condition has picked up, which is good for standing wheat and mustard crop.This year, flowering in mustard is higher by 10-15 per cent than the previous year. However, much would depend on climatic conditions during February-end and March, he said in a statement.As per the latest data, area sown to wheat - the main rabi crop - remained down by 4.46 per cent at 291.97 lakh hectare as on January 22 of the rabi season as compared with 305.60 lakh hectare in the yearago period. - PTISowing of rabi crops like wheat began from October and is almost coming to an end"

Telegraph picture Calcutta, Jan. 27: Come Sunday, foodies in Calcutta, who have probably had their fill of Chinese, Thai and Mexican, will have a chance to get adventurous and step out of their comfort zone to taste khar, tenga and the heat of bhut jolokia, with a couple of silkworms thrown in for good measure. Northeastern food curator Gitika Saikia will be here to take the residents of the city, as well as Assamese residents here who have been pining for some authentic cuisine from back home, on a gastronomic journey through the hills of Assam. The pop-up is scheduled to be held at Club de Ville in Udita Bengal Ambuja on the EM Bypass, to highlight a medley of urban and rural cuisine of her state. A pop-up restaurant is a temporary set-up, often operating from a private home, restaurant or borrowed space, mainly during festivals and other occasions. Saikia, currently based in Mumbai, will cook simple yet mouth-watering dishes from Assam, with an emphasis on indigenous food. She had also held pop-ups in other states and abroad. Famous for her blog Gitika's Pakghor and her pickles, she will provide some of her signature dishes, including lai xaak gahori or pork with broad mustard leaves, til maas (fish cooked with sesame seeds) and rongalao murgi (tender chicken pieces with ripe pumpkin). For a real challenge to the tastebuds, she will present the fiery bhut jolokia, in chutneys as well as with pork and bamboo shoot. The event is the brainchild of food blogger Anindya Sundar Basu of Pikturenama, and his wife Madhushree Basu Roy, cook and food stylist. Connecting over social media, Saikia and Basu hit upon the idea of holding this pop-up to showcase the hidden flavours of Assam. ""Foodies in Calcutta are very open to trying out different kinds of food. The city offers plenty of scope for the introduction of Assamese cuisine. I am sure foodies will embrace the unique flavours of Assam,"" Basu said. ""I quit a more than 10-year-long corporate career in September 2014 to pursue my passion of promoting the unexplored Northeast, its culture and its customs. Since I am passionate about cooking, it was the best medium I could come up with,"" said Saikia. ""I first entered the kitchen when I was in Class II to make a fried egg. I remember it was a disaster and never tried it again till Classes VI or VII. I was a bad cook throughout and then moved to a hostel, limiting my cooking skills all the more. After marriage, my mother-in-law, who is an excellent cook, taught me indigenous fare. Seeing her cooking, my interest grew and every time I visited home, I would come back with new recipes and the availability of organic ingredients in the kitchen garden influenced me to try different things,"" she added. On Sunday, the guests will be served black tea served with homemade pithas (rice cakes) on arrival. The main course will comprise lai xaak gahori, guti alu aru tita phool bhaji (baby potatoes stir fry with red bitter flowers), topola bhat (sticky rice), til maas (river fish cooked in black sesame with a hint of herbs) xukan khorisa, mosola paat bhut jolokia gahori (pork with smoked bamboo shoots, bhut jolokia and Arunachali herbs), rongalao murgi, lau khar (bottle gourd and masoor dal cooked with organic alkali and flavoured with Assamese coriander) and steamed plain rice. The accompaniments are misa maas aru bhut jolokia chutney (shrimps with bhut jolokia chutney) and homemade bamboo shoot pickle.

Assembly polls are scheduled to be held in Punjab early next year and the Aam Aadmi Party is eying the north Indian state as the next destination for political expansion.In his letter, the AAP leader also claimed that scientists are conducting tests of GM crops in Delhi University labs without possessing a no-objection certificate from the Delhi government, which makes such tests illegal.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture had raised concerns about such crops in 2012. The report of Technical Expert Committee, constituted by the Supreme Court, also raises concerns over it.We demand that government must make all reports and data related to GM crops in its possession public so that scientists, state governments, farmers and consumers could debate it, Sisodia said in his letter."

Thats what they say, apparently. For this beekeeping family of Punjab, money and honey have become synonymous, quite literally! Simranjeet Singh, the young scion of a large extended family  50 members are into beekeeping across the state  cant remember when his father or his uncles last tilled their 10 acres of land for wheat or paddy.He has grown up seeing them keep honeybees, not needing to cultivate the land at all. And, now with him as incharge of the flourishing bee business that brings in a sweet profit of more than Rs 30 lakh a year, he says its a win-win from the start.My father, Gurmail Singh, trained at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in beekeeping in the early 1980s. We havent looked back since. Once his business flourished, his brothers left traditional farming and took to the trade. Even his sisters started beekeeping at the places they got married. My mothers brothers took to it when they saw us doing great. In all, we have almost 50 persons of our extended family doing this work.He adds, philosophically, I believe that if there were no bees there would be no humans. These bees are laborious creatures doing whats essential for pollination of plants and giving back to nature something so sweet and nourishing. What could be better than this?Simranjeets love for bees, however, was not at first sight. It was something that the family was already doing. I wanted to do something else. After my Class 12, I dabbled into craft items import and trading, but it did not quite work out. A national-level power-lifter, Simranjeet even rejected job offers from the railways and the police, returning to the family trade.Home sweet homeNow completely involved in every bit of it, Simranjeet says anyone can start beekeeping. All you need is five bee boxes. You can start with one too, buying more as the bees grow in number; but five boxes will give you a decent return of around Rs 1.5 lakh at the end of the year.One single box (there is a double-decker too) costs Rs 4,000 to 5,000, and there is a government subsidy of 40% on this. Each box comes with four trays full of bees and each box has 10 trays. Once the box is full the trays brimming with bees are shifted to newer boxes, and that is how the number of boxes increases. Boxes are the only major investment, besides the head- and hand-covers for the labour.The boxes are placed near fields where flowers abound. It could be mustard, like we have now. Then there is apple, sunflower, cotton and eucalyptus. Honey produced by the bees during different seasons and by those that feed on different flowers looks and tastes different. The mustard honey, for instance, freezes over; while others dont. Some kinds of honey also go bad, against the perception that no honey ever goes bad, he explains.Read Part 1 of special series here: Futuristic Farmers 1 - Riding pigs to prosperityHow the bees do itThe bee boxes are to be kept away from one another with a minimum distance of three feet. Bees get out of the box and after collecting nectar return to the same box. They use their sense of direction and smell to return to the box. They can wander away till almost 3 km and still come back home, provided their home is at a distance from the next nearest home; that is why the distance between the boxes has to be maintained, explains Simranjeet.And do they sting as much as they are said to? Of course they sting. I have been stung several times. After all we are thieving their produce! But new research is showing that bee sting is actually therapeutic.Moving with timesThe over 1,000 bee boxes that Simranjeets honey factory has are placed across Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and even Rajasthan. We can afford to migrate the boxes. Wherever there is a flowering season, we shift them. We move the boxes two to three times a year and, considering the profits, the transportation cost is negligible, he says.To place the boxes, you dont need to own the land or pay anything.We meet farmers who have fields flourishing with flowers. Those who dont know much about beekeeping initially objected. Some even said the bees would eat up the flowers and their crop would perish. But soon they realized that its harmless, and now people allow us to keep the boxes. Also, since we are in this business for over a decade, the places where we keep the boxes are with us for long.At many places, beekeepers are now invited to keep boxes. Apple growers have realised that bees help in pollination and lead to a better yields. In such cases they even pay us to keep our bee boxes in their fields.Drumming it upThe honey is collected in drums with a simple centrifuge contraption that holds the bee trays. We dont have to transport the drums. Honey traders make their own arrangements of collecting the honey, treating it whichever way they want and sell it further. The biggest market is the US, and traders whose samples are cleared export honey. The honey we produce in our farm is called Ugani Honey and all of it is exported to the US.If a beekeeper does not migrate his boxes, one box will yield 20-25 kg of honey in a year. It sells for Rs 100-150 per kg, and someone with five boxes will make over Rs 1 lakh a year.The math of itSimranjeets 1,000 bee boxes are migrated; and he uses three flowering seasons in the year. The yield per box is over 35 kg. His total yield of 35,000 kg is exported and that gives him nearly Rs 45 lakh. His cost of labour and transportation of boxes is about ` 15 lakh, leaving him with a profit of over Rs 30 lakh a year.It is a low-maintenance business and once the basic training is done the bees can be handled by unskilled workers. We have hired only a dozen workers. Daily care is required only initially, says Simranjeet, who obviously gets enough time to work as an active municipal councillor in Rajpura.Now he has big plans. Generating the honey is the easy part. Getting a good rate for it is the challenge. Honey traders get together and keep the rate as low as they can. The best solution to this is to sell it directly to the buyer. I am trying to export my honey directly to the US. We are getting the first set of sampling done ourselves to prove the quality of the honey to make it exportworthy, he says.Building a movementBut he also has something up his sleeve for the growing fraternity of beekeepers. There are almost 35,000 beekeepers in Punjab alone. I am trying to bring them together under the banner of the Progressive Honey BeeKeeping Association of which I am the president. We will ensure they get a good rate. We only need a little push from the government.He adds, Through the association dealing with the traders we have managed to get a rate of Rs 105 per kg for the bee keeper when the market rate fell to as low as Rs 70. Second, we are trying to create a cooperative society wherein well ask bee keepers to contribute their produce which will then be supplied to traders at a rate better than what the individual honey producer gets.He says the association is also in talks with the Punjab government to procure honey and market it through Markfed (Punjab governments marketing federation for farmers). Beekeepers are already enthused at the idea of bringing in a golden revolution. Over 500 have joined the association.We are also asking the government that honey be categorised as agriculture produce and the value-added tax (VAT) of 6.5% be waived. It should be considered not as a small scale industry but an agri-business, he adds.On the sideOther than honey, beekeeping yield propolis, a high-value wax used in medicines; and royal jelly, the honey produced by the queen bee, again an expensive raw product for medicines. Everything a bee produces is saleable. And the key lies in maintaining purity. Honey being sold by many big brands is full of antibiotics as the farmers have no idea how much antibiotic is to be sprayed and when.

Ugranarasimhe Gowda, convener, Coalition for a GM Free Karnataka, accused the GEAC of being anti-people and anti-environment under the influence of multinational companies (MNCs) and lacking transparency in its working.Krishna Prasad, promoting organic and indigenous crops, expressed concern over the hurried and secretive process pertaining to the release of GM mustard. He said it reinforces suspicion that the government was hiding something or was under pressure of the powerful GM lobby. He said the much-touted GM cotton had failed to deliver despite claims to the contrary and new crops should not be allowed for commercialisation as opting for GM food would impact the safety of the consumers, besides livelihood of millions of farmers in the country.The activists pointed to their experience in H.D. Kote in Mysuru district, which has a large area under cotton cultivation and even spanned an organic cotton movement. But the introduction of Bt. cotton led to near extinction of the indigenous cotton variety.Activists also cautioned that MNCs will arm-twist the government, which would be hamstrung when it comes to food security. Mysuru district witnessed violence a few years ago when private companies withdrew Bt. cotton seeds from the market creating an artificial scarcity to jack up the prices. If the GM in food crops were to be introduced, the MNCs could monopolise the food market affecting food and nutrition security of the country, said the activists.Government is hiding somethingor is under pressure from the powerfulGM lobby"

Light, filling and yummy! And to hell with those that disagree. Maybe they dont know how to make it. And Bandar kya jaane adrak ka swad, etc. (By the way, the way monkeys plunder everything from refrigerators to dustbins these days, unhe adrak ka swad pata hai ya nahi, how do we know? I mean, is there any research around that yet? But anyway, leaving this engrossing, worthy topic for another day).Thing is, a usual family will always have the simple ingredients around the house, with a thing or two from the friendly neighbour  an onion or two, a potato or two (boiled/raw), some stale bread (stale is the key-word here, poke around in your fridge long enough and youll discover some hiding behind your day-old daal), some oil, chillies (borrow some from whichever party is winning the twitter-war of the day), rai-mustard, the usual spices. And yes, some sauce. And there you have the easiest meal-in-one.As I gobble up more than my share of this salty-sweety-sour concoction, I cant help but thank Maa, who invented it. Even if she actually didnt, it had to be a mothers invention. Every mother needed inventions like these before two-minute noodles spoiled it all. When a few minutes is all between a mother and a hunger-tantrum which can be tantamount to world-war in a tea-cup, came bread-poha to the rescue! The snotty kids couldnt recognize either the bread (from breakfast? No way) or the veggies- in- disguise, saw everything nice and golden and saucy and slurped it all up and all was well till homework time.This humble dish from God-knows-where, I realize, as I bite into a succulent pea just after a rather hot bit of green-chilli, is so much like life. Just think, mish-mash of old and fresh, sweet and sour and unpredictable  you never know what youll get in your next bite! And most of it is tasty, some of it palatable and just a bit perhaps, not that nice (sometimes the sides of the stale bread may get a bit err..woody). It takes a number of things, mixes them up in some random order and somehow changes them all  most of them, for the better. And with the things you chose to add or not, you can make it as rich and as interesting as you want. Or not. Totally up to you! As my dear friends father used to caution her  Its your life! Life, as well as bread-poha, is ours to make as we want. And yes, it must be had hot. Leave it too long and youll wonder what happened to it.Bread- poha has none of the predictability of fancier dishes which can be so monotonously borrring! Take paneer  soft and ? what? With all due respect to its nutrition etc. it tastes like, well, nothing. And I specially dislike the way when it sneakily finds it way in a supposedly lip-smacking pakoda or a parantha and then, in the first bite reveals itself in its unalterable single-dimension-ility. To those non-vegetarians, smirking right now, chicken is as uni-dimensional, FYI!Be that as it may, heres the recipe for the unenlightened and the interested:Bread-Poha (for 2)Ingredients:Bread-slices  slightly stale, 4-5 slicesPotatoes- 2 medium, peeled and cubedPeanuts  roasted/fried and ground coarselyOnion- 1 large  choppedFor the seasoning  1 tsp rai/ mustard seeds, dry whole red-chilly, kari-pattaGreen chillies, salt, turmeric, chilli-powder(Additionals  green coriander, finely chopped carrots, peas, cashews, kishmish (as I said, up to you!)Method:Heat 2 tbsp of oil, bung in the rai-mustard, when it splutters, add green and red chillies, kari-patta and chopped onion. When the onions are nice and lightly brown, add turmeric and chilli-powder. Add the cubed potatoes. Cover and let it cook. Meanwhile cube the bread-slices, put them in a pan and lightly sprinkle them with water and mash them very lightly. If youre new to this, your potatoes should have cooked by now. Now, bung in the bread mish-mash and adjust salt and spice. Stir vigorously. Everything should look nice and evenly orange-ish. And smell nice. Add a healthy, big dollop of tomato sauce/ketchup. Mix well again. Cook till the potatoes start slightly browning. Sprinkle green coriander, chillies and ground peanuts! Eat up before it gets cold!P.S. Are you wondering where is the poha in this? Ha! Ha! There isnt! Isnt that how life throws surprises at you too?"

We will oppose it in Delhi and will definitely not allow even a single such store to open in Delhi. We are opposed to multi brand retail, Mr. Goyal said.The trade wing of the party took part in discussions being held on the issue at a gathering of vendors, hawkers and traders at the Ramlila Maidan on Thursday. The three day meeting and protest concluded on Thursday.The discussions took place around the issue on how to save retail trade as FDI in retail would affect small traders, vendors and hawkers first. The central government has decided to continue the FDI in retail policy of the previous government and we oppose it, Mr. Goyal said.

Telegraph picture Jorhat, Feb. 4: For these filmmakers, the land and the soil beckon. What they are out to promote is organic. Filmmakers Ishana Raj from Mumbai and Krista Slavik from the US have accompanied Peggy Carswell of Fertile Ground, Vancouver Island, Canada, to make short films on pesticides, fertilisers and how crops can be grown without chemical additives in Assam. They were accompanied by linguistic expert Emily Rainton from the US. The four were participating in a training workshop on organic farming and seeds preservation organised by the Internal Quality Assessment Cell-NAAC and Community College, UGC, in collaboration with Annapurna Seeds Library, Kathgaon, Meleng and NGO Fertile Ground at Kendriya Mahavidyalaya, Kenduguri, here. Fertile Ground, headquartered near Vancouver, has been working with farmers of Assam and small tea growers to promote sustainable traditional agriculture and strengthen grassroots organisational capacity since more than a decade now and has taken up a few projects here, besides providing support to small organic tea growers in acquiring small-scale processing equipment. Ishana is preparing to release her first feature film - to be a comeback vehicle for Arvind Swamy of Roja fame. Ishana said she was drawn to what Fertile Ground was doing and contacted the group over the Internet. She had also gone to Vancouver Island where she met Krista and formed a tie-up. Krista said they had already shot small videos that showed trainers in action and other clips on how to make compost from materials available. ""We hope to shoot more, showing how pesticides and fertilisers can be made without chemicals and then put them up in public forum like YouTube and other websites so that the whole world can access them,"" she said. Fertile Ground had earlier uploaded one such video on YouTube, which has garnered 82,000 views. In her presentation, Peggy raised the issue of genetically modified (GM) crops. India has allowed the growing of 14 GM crops, including mustard and brinjal. Many countries, including Canada, Mexico and England, have said no to GM crops. It is up to you how you deal with this issue. It will contaminate the local variety of seeds and we would like farmers to work and grow what they have as their own,"" Peggy said. Mahaan Bora, a farmer who has collected more than 800 varieties of indigenous rice seeds from all over the state and has planted them in small areas in his farmland in order to keep the germplasm in tact, also appealed for the purity of the indigenous varieties. He also appealed to all the colleges to maintain a biodiversity register so that all the herbs and plants could be documented. Students had brought their own collections of rice seeds, which were on display in an area of the college. Fertile Ground is doing two projects - one at Digboi in collaboration with the IOCL, Rotary Club and Axum Agri, an NGO and the other at Kakojan College where they have set up a model organic farm and are trying to chalk out a certificate course on organic farming. It is also working with Axum Agri in five villages of Margherita in Tinsukia. Apart from this, it is involved in training farmers and small tea growers. ""We are looking for an experienced person in organic agriculture for the post of manager. Apart from this, we also require volunteers and trainers. A website is in the making where all organic growers can connect. From February 10-14 there will be the Organic Small Tea Growers Association of Northeast conclave at Dimakusi, Udalguri district, and we are expecting farmers from Tripura and Arunachal Pradesh to come. Buyers of organic tea from Canada are also scheduled to arrive and attend the conclave. We would like this to become a movement,"" Krista said."

(Reuters) New Delhi, Feb. 5: The Union environment ministry today deferred a decision on whether to release a genetically modified (GM) mustard plant for commercial cultivation amid overwhelming protests from activists and farmers organisations opposing GM crops. The genetic engineering appraisal committee (GEAC), an advisory panel of the ministry, was to decide today whether to approve for cultivation by farmers a version of GM mustard that promises 25 to 30 per cent increase in yields. If the GM mustard, developed by scientists at Delhi University, was approved today for cultivation, it would have become Indias first edible GM crop released for farms. India had approved GM cotton in 2002 and over 90 per cent of cotton cultivated in India is now genetically modified. But Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar today met protesters opposing GM crops and assured them that the government would not approve the GM mustard without due processes, and that he would call a meeting to hear all issues. A crowd of anti-GM activists and farmers opposing GM crops had congregated at the environment ministry here where the GEAC was to evaluate safety and efficacy research data on the mustard and decide whether to release it for farm cultivation. Opponents say government policies and regulations over GM crops should begin with a needs assessment and an evaluation of whether alternatives to GM crops are available. Members of the delegation that met the minister say they have also pointed out the regulatory body that assesses the safety and efficacy data does not have adequate representation from the health ministry and that unacceptable conflict of interest exists in the regulatory body. The Coalition for GM-free India, a body of activists, rejected an invitation from the GEAC last night to attend its scheduled meeting today, saying a meaningful dialogue would be possible only after all safety and efficacy data is placed in the public domain. We find it outrageous that the GEAC meetings are held in secrecy, that the GEAC minutes are not being made public, and its members sworn to strict confidentiality, Sridhar Radhakrishnan, co-convenor of the Coalition for GM-free India, said in letter sent today to the GEAC. The coalition has repeatedly in the past called on the GEAC to release bio-safety data, pointing out that the Supreme Court has also issued directions for making such data public. It is shocking that the GEAC is blatantly flouting Supreme Court orders, Radhakrishnan said in the letter. Scientists involved in developing GM crops have long argued that fears over GM crops are baseless, pointing out the economic gains from GM cotton and the large-scale cultivation of edible GM maize, canola and papaya in other countries. The GEAC had over five years ago approved a GM brinjal, engineered to resist a common insect pest. But former environment minister Jairam Ramesh, after consultations with scientists as well as activists and opponents of edible GM crops, had in February 2010 ordered a moratorium on GM brinjal."

Though the department hasn't launched an investigation over the charges levied in the letter, it has rattled officers posted at Sardulgarh, Rama Mandi and Dabwali border. The letter says the scam is in full swing in these areas.The letter, which surfaced last month, was forwarded to TOI by a department insider. He claimed that prima facie, it seemed to have been written by an officer of the department as it carried in-depth details like names and TIN numbers of firms allegedly involved in the scam. It also mentions items whose billing is done by the firms to evade tax.But it doesn't mention names of officers involved. Though senior officers of the department are tightlipped on the issue, they said no inquiry is going on. The letter claimed that some traders have set up offices near state borders. They purchase huge quantities of refined oil, sugar, pulses and mustard oil from other states but pay no taxes as they are hand in glove with officers posted on the department's barriers.Copies of the letter have been sent by the anonymous sender to the chief minister, deputy chief minister, financial commissioner taxation (FCT), excise and taxation commissioner (ETC) and others.Amrit Lal Jain, president of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal, to whom the letter was also sent, said, ""I was shocked to receive the letter at my home address.

(Express photo by Praveen Khanna)HELPING THE government buy peace with activists protesting against granting clearance to the first transgenic food crop in the country, the biotechnology regulator on Friday deferred a decision on allowing the cultivation of a genetically-modified (GM) hybrid mustard.The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), a body under the Environment Ministry that regulates the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs), asked the developer of the hybrid mustard  Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants  at Delhi University, led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental, to provide some more information on bio-safety related data.The GM variant, called DMH11 (Dhara Mustard Hybrid 11), is said to deliver 25-30 per cent higher mustard-seed yields compared to the best check varieties currently being grown in the country.The hybrid went through Biosafety Research Level-1 (BRL-1) tests in 2011-12 and 2012-13, in Rajasthan, under the coordination of the National Research Centre for Rapeseed-Mustard at Bharatpur, and BRL-2 tests at the Indian Agriculture Research Institute in Delhi and the Punjab Agricultural University in the 2014-15 season.The necessary field trials have already been done and we have submitted all bio-safety related data to the regulator, Pental said.The institute sought a final approval from the GEAC in December for environmental release of the crop. But even before the application process was initiated, anti-GM NGOs and activists cutting across ideological lines  from the Left to RSS-affiliated organisations  began protests, in a recreation of the agitation against Bt brinjal, also a GM crop, in 2010.They were joined by a number of scientists from several institutions and even Delhi Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia who wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding that the process be halted.Incidentally, the approval for BRL-2 tests of DMH11 was given by the Delhi government in November 2014, when the capital was under Presidents Rule.On Friday, the activists gathered around the Environment Ministry building as the GEAC met in the morning. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar later assured them that no decision would be taken without due consideration and consultation.In 2010, Bt brinjal had got the final approval from the GEAC but the then Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh put an indefinite moratorium on that decision which still holds. In the case of Mustard DMH11, the GEAC put off its decision by at least a few months.Javadekar said that while the government would not stop scientific research, it would not take any decision in haste.We are not rushing through any decision. We need to increase production and productivity in agriculture. We need to give emphasis on science, development, productivity and increased production. But at the same time, we have to be scientific and not risk the lives of our people. So, every decision will be taken only after due deliberation, he said.He also indicated that the introduction of GM crops would happen only if other avenues of increasing production were not available. We cannot let our people starve. But if there are other good alternatives availableour Prime Minister has repeatedly talked about organic farming, and using biotechnology in agriculture. But at the same time, scientific methods are also important, he said.The GEAC prepared a time-bound roadmap for taking a final decision on DMH11 mustard that involves holding public consultations as well. If the roadmap is followed, the hybrid would be back to the GEAC for approval by the end of May.Pental said he would provide all the new clarifications that have been sought from him. He said he was also willing to put all the biosafety data in the public domain once the GEAC gives the final approval.There is no attempt to keep data secret as some people have been alleging. I will surely make all data public. But that cannot happen before the final approval, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

We have sought some more information on certain aspects of the data. We will take due deliberations before reaching any decision and will not rush through the decision,"" said Javadekar.He also made it clear that the government would not stop science (research in the field of transgenic crops) nor would it force GM crops on somebody without having a broad consensus on the issue.""We cannot stop science from progressing. We cannot starve our population. We will explore all alternatives. There are other good alternatives of increasing our productivity like organic farming. But at the same time, the scientific methods are also important,"" he said.His remarks came even as protesters staged a dharna outside the environment ministry under the banner 'Sarson Satyagrah' and submitted a petition, signed by over 41,000 citizens from across the country, to him demanding that the government should not go ahead with commercialisation of GM mustard. Delhi government minister Kapil Mishra also joined the protesters.Earlier, a number of citizen groups including RSS-linked 'Swadeshi Jagran Manch' had written to Javadekar, demanding a stop to commercial sale of GM mustard. The Supreme Court had also sought an explanation from the government on its proposed move to introduce the genetically engineered variety of mustard.""The court has asked us information on the issue and we will submit it in 15 days. Once it is submitted in the court, anyone can access the details,"" the minister said.Reacting to the allegation by activists and farmers that the GEAC has been working in a secretive manner, Javadekar said, ""It is not a cricket match where regular commentary is required. Whatever is legally required is provided through our website"".The government's stand on the GM crop issue was also made clear by the Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh. While addressing a global biotechnology summit, he said ""Genetic engineering is one tool to break yield barrier in many crops. The department of agriculture supports research on transgenic crops if it is conducted as per approved procedure\guidelines and prescribed approvals are obtained from the GEAC"".The demand for food crops will increase in future and this increased demand will be met only through technology, he said, adding that the ""new technologies that are beneficial for farmers and are found to be safe to environment and human health are the ones which would be preferred"".GM mustard, developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants in Delhi University, is the first transgenic food crop that has come up before the GEAC for its approval for commercial release after the indefinite ban on GM brinjal in 2010. At present, only GM cotton (Bt Cotton) is allowed for commercial cultivation in India.Though the GEAC had in July, 2014 given permission for scientific field trials of many transgenic varieties of rice, wheat, mustard, maize and brinjal, it has so far not allowed commercial cultivation of any GM food crop in India."

Both are considered quite important as they can help in reducing India's import bills of pulses and edible oils in the long run.Since India's current annual import bills on pulses and edible oils are Rs 10,000 crore and Rs 56,000 crore respectively, the focus of public research institutions has been on developing varieties which can fill the huge demand-supply gap.Mustard-30) developed by IARI scientists will not only increase productivity but will also be beneficial for health as it has low erucic acid. Higher erucic acid content leads to diseases like myocardial fibrosis in adults and lipidosis in children.Compared to normal mustard varieties which possess more than 40% of erucic acid, PM-30 possesses less than 2% of erucic acid using conventional breeding method.Seven of the 11 varieties, identified by the institute last year, are of different horticultural products. They include Pusa Betakesari (cauliflower), Pusa Sarda (Sarda melon), Pusa Madhurima (musk melon) and Pusa Bahar (Marigold).These varieties have been around as wild growth in different parts of the country.

Mohinder Singh Sidhu's attempt to get out of the conventional crop cycle about two decades ago in Sheron village of Sangrur has been a fully spiced-up example of it.Sidhu started planting red chillies in his village known more for wheat and paddy rotation, season after season. Today, farmers from even Sirsa and Fatehabad districts of neighbouring Haryana come to Sheron to buy chilli seeds from Sidhu. For the forthcoming planting season, he has prepared seeds for 200 acres.Even near home, farmers of his village plan to have at least 50 acres under red chillie as planting starts in a week from now. Till a few years ago, chilli were planted over 10-15 acres. Sidhu's advice to his fellow farmers and higher prices fetched by his crop are the key reasons for the shift.Known as 'chilli king', 53-year-old Sidhu is, however, not limiting himself to one crop only. He also grows various vegetables and oil seeds, including tomatoes, grams, mustard and potatoes in half of his 30-acre landholding.His tryst with the spice crop began in 1995. A trendsetter, Sidhu are first in the area to set up net house at his farm to grow vegetables and chillies.Speaking about his foray into spices and vegetables, Sidhu said, ""A farmer has to spend nearly Rs 30,000 for sowing chilli in one acre and can get an average yield in the range 80-100 quintals. Going by today's price of about Rs 14-15 per kg, one can easily earn up to four times of the total input costs, which is roughly over Rs 1.2 lakh per acre. Having seen the high returns, more than a dozen farmers in my village alone have decided to grow chillies in the season which starts from the middle of February.""He says his motivation to diversify into other crops was simple. ""I wanted to increase my income from existing landholding. That's the reason I decided to grow chilli in 1995, and soon started reaping benefits of my new venture and carve a niche for myself in Punjab. Recognition followed sometime later as I was conferred with the state award for progressive farmer in 1998 from PAU. Next year, I received the Kuldeep Singh Dhaliwal Award, and in 2000 PAU bestowed 'Chilli King' title on me. In 2005, I got the Chief Minister's Award."""
58f8ab95a3d24b0b70c39936,Of fairness creams and a twitter bug,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/of-fairness-creams-and-a-twitter-bug/article8207825.ece,2016-02-08,"A number of initiatives, such as Raahgiri and Car-Free Day, taken by citizen activists and non-government organisations in Gurgaon over the past few years to promote public transport have caught the national attention and have been emulated in various parts of the country. But not all officers in the local administration appreciate these programmes and Deputy Commissioner T.L. Satyaprakash is one of them. At a recent programme organised by the Municipal Corporation of Gurgaon, Mr. Satyaprakash, compared such programmes to fairness creams which bring no real changes, but make the customer feel that something is happening. Not happy with the remarks of the Deputy Commissioner, a woman member of a NGO associated with the Car-Free Day said: When the Delhi government is leaving no stones unturned to promote initiatives like Car-Free Day and Odd-Even Formula, little is being done by the local administration and the Haryana government. It is because of the indifferent attitude of the administration that such initiatives are failing to produce desired results.This past week, several district heads of the Delhi Police were bitten by the twitter bug. Between February 3 and February 6, as many as five Deputy Commissioners of Police (DCPs) joined the social media platform.The DCPs of East, South West, Outer, New Delhi, and South districts created their own handles introduced on the network by the official handle of Delhi Police Commissioner B.S. Bassi. In addition, North and South East Delhi district DCPs have been operating on twitter for a while but ever since Mr. Bassi himself opened an account last December, embracing social media was always on the cards. But when asked about the en masse entry into the social network, most of the DCPs said it was not a timed moved and was more of a coincidence that their handles were created almost around the same time.Delhi Police chief B.S. Bassis cautious approach towards protesting students a day after the police brutality videos surfaced did not go down well with many officers. As the students agitated outside the Delhi Police Headquarters last Tuesday against the brutal use of force by the police, Mr. Bassi ordered that no lathi-wielding policeman should be visible. The armed policemen were almost immediately removed, but that left many officers grumbling. Wait and watch how the protesters will soon be encouraged to break the barricades, said one officer. Though no efforts to break the barricades were made, a louder and seemingly provocative sloganeering led a policeman to advise his senior to remove all media persons, particularly the camera crew, from the spot for a few minutes.Give us two minutes without these cameramen and see how we end their sloganeering in no time, he suggested, drawing peals of laughter from all the policemen around.Raising the issue of the recent revision in Delhi High Courts roster having reduced the strength of judges hearing the original civil cases, lawyers have demanded that at least six judges be assigned for this segment.The number of judges was reduced after an amendment in law enhanced the High Courts pecuniary jurisdiction from Rs.20 lakh to Rs.2 crore.High Court Bar Bar Association (HCBA) secretary Abhijat has pointed out that though the purpose of amendment to the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, was to reduce the burden of civil cases and ensure speedy justice to litigants, the subsequent reduction in number of judges hearing these cases has led to congestion and diluted the effect of transfer of civil cases valued at less than Rs.2 crore to the lower courts. Of the four judges assigned with the task of hearing the original civil cases, two have been entrusted with hearing the arbitration and conciliation matters as well as the commercial disputes. Effectively, the civil cases are being heard only by two courts, which have also been assigned the cases involving commercial disputes. The HCBA has requested the Chief Justice to revise the roster of the original civil side and restore the Bench strength to a minimum of six judges in the interest of efficient administration and speedy delivery of justice.The AAP government protested last week against the Centres decision to allow genetically modified mustard in the market. But strangely, the protests were led by Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra and other AAP leaders but Environment Minister Imran Hussain was conspicuous by his absence. In fact, it was Mr. Mishra who went to meet Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar on the issue and even then the Environment Minister did not accompany him.This led to a discussion among reporters as to why Mr. Hussain was not even talking about the issue. Interestingly, the media-shy Environment Minister even stayed away during the period when the government introduced the odd-even scheme.(Contributed by Ashok Kumar, Shiv Sunny, Mohammed Iqbal and Maria Akram)"

In the 13 years since Bt cotton was introduced here, not a single new GM crop has been approved.The latest to hit the wall is Mustard DMH-11, which on Friday failed to get the approval of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). Developed by a team of Delhi University scientists this GM hybrid promises 25-30% more yield than the best mustard varieties currently grown in the country. The problem is that science seems to weigh less with the regulator than politics and ideology.Look at the weight of evidence on Bt cotton: since its introduction, the countrys cotton production has gone up more than 2.5 times.Those who argue that different standards must apply to food crops should note that cotton seeds also yield animal feed and the second largest produced edible oil in the country. No compelling evidence has emerged on damage to either biodiversity or human health. Yet, GM mustard struggles to get approval while ironically India chugs plenty of imported GM soybean and rapeseed oils  imports now feed 70% of the domestic demand for edible oils.Housed in the environment ministry, GEAC doesnt really enjoy the desired independence. In the infamous case of Bt brinjal, even when GEAC gave approval it was overruled by then environment minister Jairam Ramesh. An independent regulator was proposed in the Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India Bill, but this too became the victim of a Parliament more disposed to having rows than legislating. Yet, as better food technology must become an integral part of Indias food management plan, so must a truly independent and science-focussed regulator.On the upside, the fact that Mustard DMH-11 has been incubated in Delhi University defies swadeshi warnings about GM being a tool for MNC takeover, suggesting instead that domestic scientific institutions can also supply the urgently needed technological breakthroughs in oilseeds, pulses and other in-demand foods. Thankfully, there seem to be a healthy number of GM candidates for field trials and eventual commercialisation. We must encourage research interest in biotechnology, not tie down scientists and innovators in Kafkaesque red tape. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar says the government is not rushing through with GM. But regulator uncertainty and sloth doesnt serve either science or the country well."

The food safety wing last week got reports from Calcutta-based Mitra SK Pvt. Ltd for the samples collected two months ago. The authorities are now planning to lodge a complaint against the sweet shops concerned under the Food Safety Act. The food safety wing is now waiting for results of the 37 Patna sweet shop samples, all of which had been sent to the Calcutta laboratory for tests two months ago. ""As per the Food Safety Act, if a food product is found to be sub-standard then there are provisions to pay fine to the violator while the act says that if something injurious to health is found in the product, then there are sections not only for imposing fine against the violator but he/she could be put behind bar,"" said a food inspector, who did not wish to be quoted. The food inspector added: ""As per norms, in food products, you can only use food colours but in all the three samples, the industrial colour (used to dye clothes) have been found, which is dangerous."" Doctors said eating industrial dye can have serious health hazards. JKL Das, a physician at Patna Medical College and Hospital, said: ""Consumption of industrial dye can mainly cause cancer. Besides, it can also cause gastroenteritis, kidney and liver problems."" Earlier, the food safety wing has found adulteration in cottage cheese, mustard oil, ghee and turmeric samples. ""Two years ago, we had found starch in 95 per cent of the 60 samples of the cottage cheese we collected from various city shops,"" said another food safety officer wishing anonymity. He added: ""However, eating adulterated mustard oil or ghee found in city shops might have serious implications on health. Earlier, we had found presence of palmolive oil and argemone oil in mustard oil samples. Consumption of argemone oil can cause dropsy disease. In ghee samples, we had found presence of saturated fats, which can also upset stomach while we had found the presence of lead chromate in the turmeric powder samples. Lead chromate can cause cancer.

It is also a reminder that the traditional Indian diet is seasonal, local, minimal in its environmental impact and above all, striking in its immense variety. When I went there on a cool morning, little hillocks of pearly ponkh were being stacked at my feet. Big jute sacks, plump with onions, were being emptied onto raised platforms. Sweet-fleshed yams were being rolled onto colourful plastic crates. Cardboard boxes were being prised open to reveal ruby-hued strawberries and tangy star fruit.Bhaji galli has a fairly old pedigree, originally named for Jagannath Shankarsheth (Jagannath Lane). Its colloquial appellation comes from the vegetable vendors from Vasai who used to unload fresh vegetables that they got from Vasais weekly market, in the compound of the nearby Balchandra building. The number of vendors then slowly swelled, until the entire lane was overwhelmed by a flood of fruit and vegetable sellers.Today, the lane hums with a steady stream of Mumbaikars, some from as far away as Powai and Borivali. Bhaji galli is dotted with vendors on both sides, many specialising in certain kinds of produce: root veggies, kanda batata, fruits, or foreign vegetables. I am drawn to a stall selling a bewildering array of wintry tubers and greens for undhiyu: green Surti papdi, baby eggplants, purple kand, sweet and regular potato, seedless (ariya) kakdi, Rajagiri bananas and fenugreek. The lady next to me is buying up several packets of these. I come from Borivali once a month to Bhaji galli, she explains as I gawk at the quantity of vegetables she is buying. I have to buy enough undhiyu samaan to last my family that long. But why come all the way here, I persist? She gave me a long, cold look and then she smiled gently. She spoke in a soft voice, as if to an insane person. Bhaji galli has the best quality vegetables, she said, enunciating each word.I slink away to the next vendor, who has heaped posies of mogri or rat-tail radish pods, both green and purple. Oddly, for someone who isnt too fond of radish, I cant get enough of mogri, which I mostly eat raw. But this time, I stir fry them lightly at home with some chopped garlic and salt. They are still delicious, but seem to have lost their sharp flavour and their glorious crunch, having turned a bit fibrous.I move down the lane to Chachas stall, one frequented by my mum for years. We have never been able to find out his real name, You call me chacha only. But we do know that he sometimes keeps amba haldi (mango ginger), another winter favourite. Amba haldi looks almost exactly like regular ginger, tastes a little like green mango with an acerbic aftertaste, but is an obscure relative of the turmeric family. The mango ginger is ripe for pickling with just a little salt water and lime juice and is eaten with every meal to ward off winter infections. But you could also lace your curry with a few slivers, to give it a sour-sharp tang. Its widely used to perk up South Indian, Rajasthani and Gujarati dishes.A little further into the lane, I spot an enormous heap of fresh, leafy vegetables in every possible shade of green. Behind the pile presides a dignified old lady.There is sarson or mustard greens, the main ingredient in the hearty Punjabi winter staple, sarson da saag. There are bunches of spinach and bathua, both of which make first-rate pakodas; I find bathuas bitterness too acrid to consume except when shrouded by a shell of deep-fried dough. But in Jiggs Kalra and Pushpesh Pants Classic Cooking of Punjab , bathua sits comfortably with sarson, spinach and moolipatta (radish leaf) in the aforementioned sarson da saag. This time, I will try and stuff it into a paratha. I also buy the dill, parsley, tender green garlic, pudina and spring onions, ready to be transformed into osh, the warming, nutritious stew that is much loved by Iranians. The lady also has baby methi and gongura; the latter I am going to try and cook with shrimp, Andhra-style.While the lady is rootling around in her tin box for change, I spot a vendor surrounded by a swathe of carrots, both the orange English carrots and the red-hued Indian carrots. The red carrots are more intensely-flavoured and carrotier than their compatriots. I will add them to green peas for a delicious gajar matar sabzi and if some are left over, I will try to cadge the century-old recipe of vegetable achaar from my Punjabi friend. Into her pickle go gobi, shalgam, gajar tempered with salt, chilli, mustard seeds and oil with a little jaggery. It is a delectable winter tradition.A market is an excellent way to get under the skin of a place, and Bhaji galli is a true reflection of Mumbai. The soft drink crates and plastic trays overflowing with international produce reflect the citys growing omnivorousness. Here, a tray heaving with snowy daikon radish. There, a crowd of avocados balanced precariously on a rickety wooden stand. Naturally, the radish and avocados make their way into my shopping bag.What else do I bring home? A perfectly spherical white gourd, which I will stuff with mincemeat as soon as I finish writing this story. Little fronds of fennel which I happily eat raw in salads, but also braised and served on a bed of white fish. Postbox-red chillies. Tart gooseberries or amla. (Amla juice is the elixir I should absorb but amla murabba is what I will actually eat, with stacks of thepla). And finally, green gram, nestled within their pods (a proper pain to shell). Fried or roasted with a light sprinkle of salt and chilli together with a squeeze of lime, they make for the most satisfying winter evening snack.The author is a freelance writer and editor"

(Source: Express Photo by Shuaib Masoodi) A mustard field in full bloom at Batapora in Srinagar, Kashmir. (Source: Express Photo by Shuaib Masoodi)In a move that has effectively placed commercial cultivation of GM Mustard in cold storage for now, biotech regulator Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) has outlined several steps before the hybrid could be brought back to the table for a review.Besides suggesting eight time-consuming additional bio-informatic tests for inclusion in the seeds biosafety dossier, the GEAC on February 5 asked the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) to prepare a Risk Assessment and Risk Management (RARM) document.It set a timeline of two weeks for submission of the revised biosafety dossier but separately recommended a long winding procedure for further review and consultation on the biosafety data.The revised dossier received from the applicant would be considered by the Sub-Committee and a Biosafety RARM report would be prepared for consideration of the GEAC, it said.The report would have to incorporate all concerns raised by Coalition for GM-Free India, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, various representations and even comments in the media.Subsequent to the review, and if the biosafety dossier is found to be complete in all respects, the GEAC has recommended that both dossier and RARM report  minus certain confidential segments  be put out in the public domain for comments.However, no information would be posted while the review is still under progress, said the biotech regulator.A detailed response to the comments received would be prepared and considered before a final decision is taken by the GEAC, says a note from the Environment Ministry.Bowing to the widespread opposition by farmers and NGOs, the GEAC also agreed that an opportunity for personal hearing may be provided as and when requested.After the GEAC meeting on February 5, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar had said his ministry would not rush into any decision or impose decisions without wide consultations.Before the fresh review procedure starts, the committee will meet first  likely on March 3  to finalise the modalities for preparing the RARM report including roles, responsibilities, consultation, time lines etc.The GEAC, meanwhile, has now decided to meet every month, which is its original mandate, with the first Friday of each month set as the meeting date. Last year, the GEAC met only twice.The spat over GM Mustard DMH-11 has turned into a national debate even though this variety is being developed by Delhi Universitys CGMCP which has pledged to distribute it for free. The project is funded by DUs Department of Biotechnology and the National Dairy Development Board.Supporters of GM mustard  which has the potential of increasing yield by 25 per cent  say it is required in India as the country is still dependent on edible oil imports. Indias rapeseed-mustard seed production stood at 63.09 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 crop year (July-June).This is the first proposal that has come up before the NDA government after the previous regime had put a moratorium on commercial cultivation of Bt Brinjal in 2010. Currently, Bt cotton is the only GM crop allowed for commercial cultivation.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

All but one of the eight terrorists were French citizens, trained by ISIS in Syria. They returned, unnoticed, and attacked six locations killing 130 people, CIA Director John Brennan said.There is a lot that IS probably has underway that the US doesnt have full insight into, he said.We knew the system was blinking red. We knew in the days before that IS was trying to carry out something, he told CBS in an interview yesterday.But the individuals involved have been able to take advantage of the newly available means of communication that are walled off, from law enforcement officials, Brennan said adding that the IS has been using very sophisticated technologies and communication systems.Im expecting them to try to put in place operatives, the material or whatever else that they need to do or to incite people to carry out these attacks, clearly. So I believe that their attempts are inevitable. I dont think their successes necessarily are, he noted saying it was inevitable that IS will try to attack the US.IS he observed, is trying to provoke a clash between the West and the Muslim world to gain more adherents.Because what they are claiming is that the United States is trying to take over their countries which is the furthest thing from the truth, he asserted.Brennan argued that the intelligence security services have stopped numerous attacks and operatives that have been moved from maybe Iraq to Syria or into Europe.They have been stopped and interdicted and arrested and detained and debriefed because of very, very good intelligence, he noted.But the failure in Paris allowed ISIS to attack with bombs and assault rifles, said the CIA Director.Noting that there are reports that ISIS has access to chemical precursors and munitions that they can use, he said the CIA believes that IS has the ability to manufacture small quantities of chlorine and mustard gas.Theres always potential for IS to transport those chemical weapons to the West.This is why its so important to cut off the various transportation routes and smuggling routes that they have used, he said.The CIA chief said the waterboarding method of torture is not being used and would not be used in the future.The cyber environment can pose a very, very serious and significant attack vector for our adversaries if they want to take down our infrastructure, if they want to create havoc in transportation systems, if they want to do great damage to our financial networks. There are safeguards being put in place. But that cyber environment is one that really is the thing that keeps me up at night, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The other two, in Nagaland and Mizoram, would commence their academic sessions soon, he added.Singh said the university had planned six vocational training centres and six multi-technology testing centres to empower the unemployed rural youths.""Central Agricultural University's effort to distribute 2,500 soil health cards to farmers is appreciable. I hope such efforts will continue and prove beneficial for the farmers in future,"" he added.The minister added that it was important to promote cultivation of oilseeds and pulses for the food and nutritional security in the Northeast.""The effort by Central Agricultural University to promote mustard under zero tillage is commendable. I hope that the university will play an important role in increasing the farming area of different pulses like lentil and lathyrus,"" Singh added.He also advised the scientists of the varsity and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research to develop technologies and resources for organic agriculture in the region. Emphasis should be given on production of farm manure from all organic waste, he added."

Last week, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), a body under the environment ministry, deferred a decision on allowing the cultivation of a hybrid mustard variety called GM Mustard DMH-11. The GM variety was developed by Indian scientists in Delhi University and did not pose the usual problems associated with the use of GM seeds developed and sold by foreign multinationals. Field trials had been conducted and the mustard variety has been proved to give 25-30 per cent more yield than the traditional mustard varieties which are sown in the country. Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar has said that the government did not want to take a decision in haste. But the debate on GM crops has been going on in the country for many years. The government has not been able to make up its mind. The UPA government stopped commercial production of Bt brinjal in 2010 after the GEAC had given its approval.Bt cotton is widely cultivated in the country and it has raised cotton production by 2-3 times. One view is that food and non-food GM crops have to be treated differently. But cotton seed oil cakes are used as cattle feed and so they enter the human system. There have been no complaints about GM cotton adversely affecting the environment or human or animal health. India is the worlds largest importer of edible oils. More than 70 per cent of the consumption is met by imports. The soyabean oil and rapeseed oil which are imported into the country are produced from genetically modified crops. So the opposition to domestic cultivation of the mustard GM variety is misplaced. There is a need to increase the production of oilseeds and cultivation of the high-yielding domestic mustard variety which offers scope for this.The GM mustard seeds will be supplied free to the farmers since the research that led to the development of the variety was publicly funded. So, fears about control of the countrys agriculture by foreign seed companies are misplaced. The bio-safety data will also be put into the public realm for study and appraisal. Issues concerning food security, seed monopoly and bio-safety are the main points of opposition to GM crops. The apprehensions over these issues are mostly without basis. India does not have an independent regulator to deal with the technological and other matters related to GM crops. The government should set up an independent regulatory mechanism and take other steps to promote research into and use of GM technology."

(Express Photo Oinam Anand) Deepak Pental (second from left) with fellow scientists at a mustard trial field in Jaunti village of North West Delhi. (Express Photo Oinam Anand)It is Indias largest source of edible oil.Unlike soyabean, which has only 18 per cent oil content, and groundnut, more than 50 per cent of whose kernels are either consumed directly or exported, rapeseed/mustard is one crop that is a true oilseed. With annual production of around 2.4 million tonnes (mt), mustard accounts for a quarter of the countrys average edible oil availability of 9.4 mt from indigenous sources (see chart).That being the case, mustard would be central to any strategy aimed at reducing Indias reliance on edible oil imports, which, in 2014-15 (November-October), amounted to over 14.4 mt valued at $10.5 billion. The fact that it is a rabi crop with almost 75 per cent area under irrigation  as against barely 25 per cent in groundnut and one per cent for soyabean  and having roughly 40 per cent oil content, makes mustard the most suitable candidate for ushering in a yellow revolution, similar to what wheat and paddy did for the Green Revolution.For years, breeders have exploited a phenomenon known as heterosis or hybrid vigour resulting from crossing two genetically dissimilar plant varieties even within the same species. The first-generation or F1 offspring from such crosses tend to have yields higher than what either parent can individually give.Share This Article Related Article Let the farmer judgeLet the farmer judge The other oil: How a product almost entirely imported has defied food inflationThe other oil: How a product almost entirely imported has defied food inflation Call Luddites bluffCall Luddites bluff GM row again, with mustard toppingGM row again, with mustard topping A perennial deficit: The other oil problemA perennial deficit: The other oil problem Edible oils up on millers buying,global cuesIn mustard, though, there have been two major constraints standing in the way of realising yield grains from heterosis that can help considerably boost domestic production.The first is the narrow genetic base of mustard varieties grown in India. Scientists at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) in Delhi University, led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental, however, showed that this problem could be addressed by crossing Indian mustard cultivars with juncea lines of East European origin like Early Heera and Donskaja. The combination of the two divergent gene pools enhanced the crossing options; the resultant F1 progeny were found to exhibit significant heterosis.The second constraint is more basic, having to do with the absence of a natural hybridisation system in mustard. Mustard flowers contain both female (pistil) and male (stamen) reproductive organs, making the plants largely self-pollinating. To the extent that the egg cells of one plant cannot be fertilised by the pollen grains from the stamen of another, it restricts the scope for developing hybrids  which, in crops such as maize, cotton and tomato, is possible through simple emasculation or physical removal of anthers.Pentals team at the CGMCP initially developed a cytoplasmic male-sterile or CMS line of Pusa Bold Indian mustard. This line (in which the stamen is sterile and cannot produce viable pollen), crossed with the East European Early Heera-2 variety (which is male-fertile and hence capable of pollinating the former), resulted in DMH-1, Indias first ever mustard hybrid. Its average seed yield, at 2.6 tonnes per hectare, was a fifth higher than the 2.1-2.2 tonnes for existing best check varieties, including Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Varuna, Rohini and Kranti.The CGMCP scientists also bred another hybrid DMH-4, from crossing Pusa Bold with S-7, a derivative from Indian and East European mustard lines. The yields from it were the same as DMH-1, but the new hybrid produced bolder seeds.The CMS-based hybrid breeding system, however, had drawbacks. It could work only in a single Indian mustard variety (Pusa Bold). Using the same CMS (female) parental line, thus, limited the crossing options. We tried transferring our CMS system (126-1) to many Indian and East European mustard lines. But in all these cases, the male sterility broke down and such partially fertile lines couldnt be used for hybrid seed production. The system was also unstable, especially under low temperatures, explains Pental.The inherent limitations in CMS-based hybrid breeding, then, led Pentals team to explore the genetic modification or GM route. The technology they chose involved deploying alien Barnase and Barstar genes. The Barnase gene, isolated from a soil bacterium called Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, coded for a protein that impaired pollen production and rendered the plant into which it was incorporated male-sterile. This plant was, then, crossed with a fertile parental line, containing, in turn, the Barstar gene from the same bacterium that blocked the action of the Barnase gene. The resultant F1 progeny was high-yielding and could also produce seed/grain, thanks to the Barstar gene in the second fertile line.The CGMCP scientists used the Barnase-Barstar GM technology, originally patented by Plant Genetic Systems (now part of Bayer CropScience), to create a robust and viable hybridisation system in mustard. This system was also used to develop DMH-11 through crossing Varuna (Barnase) with Early Heera-2 (Barstar). This GM hybrid, which has demonstrated up to 30 per cent heterosis in field trials, is currently awaiting approval for commercial cultivation.The Barnase-Barstar system enables us to breed hybrids from a wide range of Indian and East European mustards yielding higher levels of heterosis. Besides, we can introduce new traits relating to oil quality (zero erucic acid, low glucosinolates content) or resistance to disease (alternaria blight and stem rot), which wasnt possible with just a single, unstable CMS parental line, Pental points out.CGMCP has, in fact, tied up with the University of Arizona to map the Indian mustard (Brassica juncea), which itself has two constituent genomes AA (from the Brassica rapa species) and BB (from Brassica nigra), each containing 30,000 genes.The rapa genome has already been sequenced, while the work on nigra will be completed by the end of 2016. Once this is done, we will be able to know and locate the genes that code for specific traits, be it oil content, seed size, pod length and density, number of seeds per pod or disease resistance, adds Pental.GM technology will only help in developing hybrids with new parental combinations and incorporating these various quantitative, qualitative and disease resistant traits into them.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

A long wait in the queue meant losing out on precious work hours for the 42-year-old kantha artisan. Today, a tubewell just a stone's throw away from her house saves her time, energy and even health woes. Harindanga and East Chunari villages now have three tubewells with clean water to drink, thanks to an initiative by the German consulate. A team from the consulate, headed by Angela Grossmann, the vice-consul in Calcutta, visited the two villages recently to inspect the tubewells and interact with the villagers. Most of the women of the area are supported by Shamlu Dudeja and her NGO, The SHE Foundation. ""There are over 100 artisans from Bagula (in Nadia district) registered under our NGO and the rest, around 250, are supported by us,"" said Dudeja, who also accompanied the team. At present, she supports over 800 kantha artisans across Bengal. The German consulate had handed over Rs 1,47,000 for the micro-project to SHE Foundation last year. The latter ensured its speedy completion and also got the water examined. ""The best thing about our tubewell is the hygiene factor. It has been built in a clean environment with no toilets or garbage dump nearby. That makes our drinking water safe now,"" said Suchitra's neighbour, 36-year-old Rinku Biswas. Suchitra, Rinku and many other women in Harindanga stitch in their spare time to supplement the family income. ""We stitch in the afternoon or when there are no household chores to take care of. We would waste a lot of time looking for good drinking water. That affected our productivity. Now life has become easy,"" smiled Rinku, who has a tubewell just next to her house. The happiest of all is Jaya Rani Biswas, all of 100 years old. The wrinkled lady hugged Grossmann and Dudeja for the ""gift"". ""We have a social responsibility towards our artisans. Getting funds for the tubewells was a step towards that. We try to help villagers in every possible way. These tubewells are for everyone, not just for the families of our artisans,"" said Dudeja, as she and the village girls impressed Grossmann with samples of kantha work. It was a double boon for East Chunari, the bigger of the two villages. In celebration, the villagers gave Grossmann a taste of rural life, taking her on a tour of the village and sharing personal stories with her. ""This is the first time I am travelling so far (around 93km from Calcutta) to meet project beneficiaries. I am so glad we could help these villagers, for whom clean drinking water is a luxury. It is good to touch hearts,"" she said, posing with the villagers for snaps and learning how to pump a tubewell and sieve mustard seeds as well. ""I tasted tubewell water for the first time,"" she laughed. Molina Biswas, 40, is happy she has more time in hand. ""Fetching drinking water was a big deal for us. Covering long distances on foot would leave me tired and if I got chatting with a friend there, it meant a longer break from work. Often the water was not even healthy. Now I can spend more time at home,"" she smiled."

The rescue team had been scouring the fields on motorcycles. They spotted the animal in fields belonging to a farmer Purkharam Meghwal, whose crops had not attained a great height. - the animal stood higher than the crop and was thus exposed. The male adult was tranquilized with two injections. After the first tranquilizer dart was shot, the panther did not lose consciousness and had to be given another injection.Desert National Park deputy conservator of forests Anup Kumar said the panther had been roaming in the Pokhran area for about five days.

Their major grievance is that Supplyco refuse to pay them regularly on the grounds that it could not afford more than two packers per outlet. There are four of us working in the packaging section in every outlet. But only two of us get our wages, which we divide among ourselves. We got bonus only once. We have been included in Employees Provident Fund, but we are to pay to the EPF only once in two months, Chitra.P, working in the Peoples Bazaar outlet in Kozhikode, explained the bizarre situation she and her colleagues have been in for quite a number of years.I joined Supplyco 20 years ago. There are people with around 30 years experience as well. When we joined, the wage was 7 paise per packet, whatever be the size or weight of it. Now, it is 50 paise. That is all the increase we got in 30 years. Usually we take home not more than Rs.2500 per month. But with the new rule that we need not be paid unless the packet we made is not sold off, the wage has come down. If business is low in Supplyco, our wage is directly affected, Chitra said.Supplyco outsourcing the packaging of fenugreek, cumin and mustard has further affected the wages of the packaging workers. These items are packaged in very small quantities and hence so many packets can be made of just one kilogram of each. Making small packets benefits the packagers, said P.Viji, Secretary of Asanghatita Meghala Thozhilali Union, organising the strike.The strike was inaugurated by womens right activist K.Ajitha.

In that context, the promotion of not-so- widely-showcased regional cuisines, like pahari food, as Himachal cuisine is referred to in North India, comes across as a breath of much-needed fresh air in the clutter of other popular cuisines, such as Punjabi (or what passes for it, these days) or Rajasthani cuisine.I was therefore quite enthused about the invite to a Himalayan Pop-Up curated by Miss Shimla Sherry Malhotra,from Marriott Hyderabad which would be hosted at its Indian specialty restaurant Bidri.Yogender Pal, the executive chef at Marriott Hyderabad, is an old guard of the slow and steady cooking techniques of retaining flavours and nutrients, and also hails from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh. I soon learnt that hobby chef Sherry Malhotra, who also happens to be Miss Simla (2005) , runs a successful catering business in Mumbai, and you would obviously expect something completely out of the ordinary! Enough said, I rest my case, you get the drift.When a couple of us, food bloggers reached Bidri in the afternoon, we were handed out the chef caps and aprons and soon got down to re-creating a recipe Chana Madra, a Himachali recipe, Chickpeas cooked in a light yogurt gravy, along with lotus seeds (makhana) and coconut slices. The recipe uses whisked yogurt, whole garam masala (green cardamom or choti elaichi, cinnamon and cloves) as well as ground elaichi powder, red chilli powder, a pinch of turmeric, jeera powder, salt to taste and a bit of sugar too.Himachali cuisine is light, healthy and flavorful and makes wide use of yogurt, saunf, garam masala, hing, mustard oil, ghee, black lentils, besan, fenugreek and tomatoes, which are grown locally, shares Chef Pal. Mutton is more common than chicken and since fish is not available in abundance, its expensive and made only on special occasions.We then sat down to a typical lunch representing different regions of Himachal Pradesh, such as Kasauli, Shimla, Kangra, Mandi from which the dish Channa Madra comes from, according to chef.Our lunch menu included the following:StartersDahi Ki Chaap (lamb chops braised in buttermilk with fennel seed)Macchi FryMethi aur Saunf ki Murgh ChaapMain CourseChaa Gosht (lamb braised in a yoghurt besan gravy)Methi Macchi (fish cooked with fresh fenugreek and tomatoes)Channa MadraNashpati ki Subzi (pears cooked with red chillies & fennel)Sepu WadiBhey (lotus stem cooked in yoghurt)Maash DaalKaale Channe ki MaaniTudkiya Bhaath (vegetable pulao with tadka)Babru (puris made of fermented wholewheat atta and filled with urad dal masalaDessertsMeetha Bhaath (sweetened basmati rice with saffron)Khus Khus aur Makhaane ki KheerThe spread looked roughly like this:A huge Himalayan spreadThe notable standouts, besides the earlier-mentioned Channa Madra, were the delightfully crunchy and fresh Nashpati (pears) Ki Subzi, Methi Macchi, Sepu Wadi (urad dal fritters cooked in a spinach base), Kaale Channe ki Maani (blackpeas cooked with tamarind gravy and with onion spinach fritters). Tudkiya (tadka in Pahari) Bhaat was also spectacularly soft vegetable pulao rendered that smoothness thanks to yoghurt simmered with the tadka and veggies.In fact, the vegetarian dishes were more evolved on the taste quotient than the notable non vegetarian dishes like Chaa Gosht. Methi Macchi, seer fish cooked with fenugreek and tomato was delectable, and so was Dahi ki Chaap, which reminded me a lot about the Kashmiri Tabak Maaz.Finally for desserts, the Khus Khus (poppy seed) aur Makhaane ki kheer was just the perfect ending to a hugely memorable meal.(Himalayan Pop Up is running at Bidri, Marriott Hyderabad for dinner until 27th of February)."

The biggest being that Pental used EH-2 (Early Hira mutant) as one of parents in the experiment to develop one of his hybrids without giving any recognition to the fact that it was developed at Nagpur University.The DMH-11 hybrid was developed at Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGCMP) in DU, funded by the National Dairy Development Board (NDDB) with support from the department of biotechnology (DBT). Scientists claim that while developing the hybrid, CGCMP has not just gone wrong in many technical steps but also hid important facts like not conducting the field trials in a desired way and not putting results of biosafety trials in public domain.Agriculture scientists across the country told TOI that all the agencies involved in giving clearance to DMH-11 experiment at different stages had supported Pental blindly without giving a thought to ramifications of the experiment on plant sciences. These include the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation (RCGM), GEAC, NDDB, NIN, and DU. NDDB has specially been pouring in crores of rupees in DU since 1992. While accepting that Pental was a good scientist, everyone expressed shock over the manner in which he manipulated the facts.Scientists and experts alleged that in the entire development of the DMH-11 technology, these agencies have been hand-in-glove with Pental. It is proved by the fact that ICAR conducted the open field trials at ten locations in country in 2005-06 without approval from the GEAC and RCGM. These locations also included the National Research Centre for Rapeseed Mustard (NRCRM), now called Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research (DRMR) at Bharatpur in Rajasthan.They edclaim the former deputy director general of ICAR, E A Sidique, Pental and NDDB officials used their position with ICAR to conduct the trials in open fields which is against environmental norms. The scientific community holds all of them equally responsible as Pental for the mess.S E Pawar, a BARC scientist from city who was associated as a consultant in the NDDB funded project at NU since 1999 where late Prof Anil Khalatkar was the principal investigator, said Khalatkar had developed EH-2 (early Hira mutant) in NU's Botany Department. This EH-2 was used as one of the parents in the experiment for developing DMH-11 by Pental.Pawar said Pental and NDDB should have acknowledged the contribution of NU and use of EH-2 as the male parent. He also insisted that while conducting the BRL-I and BRL-II trials, recently released hybrids like DMH-1 and NRCHB-506 should have been used as checks. ""I was involved in conducting multi-location trials of DMH-1, DMH-2 and DMH-11. But DMH-11 never out-yielded the national checks,"" said Pawar. He is also demanding that everyone involved in withholding the actual data and not giving proper information to the GEAC should be taken to task. ""I congratulate the MoEF and government of India for not accepting the proposal for commercialization of DMH-11 at this stage,"" he said.Meanwhile, Aruna Rodriques, who has been fighting against GM crops, has filed a PIL for contempt of Supreme Court. She is pleading Supreme Court orders of February 15 and May 8, 2007, April 8 and August 12, 2008, were wilfully and deliberately disobeyed by conducting numerous GM field trials of GM Mustard with the aim of introducing a herbicide tolerant (HT) food crop in India.Rodriques added Pental conducted large-scale open field trials. There was a clear, historically proven risk of contamination from limited BRL-I field trials and there was a huge possibility of contamination from large-scale field trials in BRL II. This, she said, was despite the petitioners having a court order against any contamination in a matter of limited or BRL I field trials.Rodriques said India was a centre of origin of mustard and there was huge area under the crop here. Mustard is pollinated by wind and insects and the entire mustard crop in India would be contaminated if this new technology was adopted. ""Pental has not just hidden the truth, but made statements. This is perjury. He makes claim that DMH-11 provides 25% higher yield than any other variety. He further makes a claim that our import bill for edible oil is astronomical and therefore his mustard is in the national interest because of high yields. These claims are erroneous and misleading,"" said Rodriques.Pental's hybrid at the most can only be as good as the parent lines he is using. However, in order to show his hybrid as superior, (made using the Barnase-Barstar system) he used a very old and straight variety Varuna for comparison instead of comparing with a hybrid. This Rodriques insisted was a clear fraud. ""Our modern varieties and hybrids provide yields comparable to what he has produced. Hence there is no need at all for GM mustard. So there is the huge cover-up and official support to that cover-up by regulators, the ICAR, the Department of Biotechnology or DBT,"" she said.The reason why we have high imports has more to do with low import tariffs on edible oil and toeing the WTO line and thereby disadvantaging Indian oilseed farmers. Until about two decades back India was self-sufficient. ""Pental is neither addressing the real problem nor presenting true analysis. He is indulging in mischief instead,"" she added.Interestingly, the reports of All India Coordinated Trials in rape seed mustard (available with TOI) also confirm the claims of scientists and organizations standing against the commercialization of GM mustard. Sources in the DRMR Bharatpur revealed that in all trials (BRL I and BRL II) were conducted at 13 locations but at many places the farmers destroyed the crop, some places the trials were stopped for other reasons. Last year, permission was sought in 12 states for trials but except for Delhi and Punjab none gave permission. Delhi has no place for trials and Punjab contributed just 0.6% of production. The average yield as per the project report obtained in DMH-11 is 23.9 quintals per hectare which is as good as or even less than those of existing non-GM hybrids used as a national check. Sources also confirmed the claim of scientists and activists that Pental had used a very weak variety (not hybrid) for comparison and his claim of 25% higher yield was spurious.The deputy director general of ICAR J S Sandhu admitted to TOI that ideally experts from bodies like the ICAR, RCGM and national institutes working in GM technology should have been consulted or involved in the experiments but DU worked in isolation which was not good science. ""The experiment should have used appropriate checks which I gather were not done,"" he said.GM mustard DHM-11 has also received objections and protests from organizations like Coalition for a GM-free India, Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, different state governments like Bihar, Rajasthan, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh. Bihar CM Nitish Kumar and deputy CM of Delhi Manish Sisodia have already written to Prakash Javadekar, the union minister for environment, forest and climate change.However Pental claimed he had followed all rules and regulations stipulated in development of a GM crop and conducting trials. He said the data on biosafety was never to be shared in public domain. It had been given to the right authority, the GEAC. On comparing a hybrid with a straight variety, Pental said those who were raising this question were foolish as he had used the methodology used elsewhere in the world. ""Hybrids are always known to outperform a variety. I have just developed a system of hybrid making. It can be used for incorporating other properties like disease resistance in mustard or other crops. I cannot convince the anti-GM lobby as it has its own belief system,"" he said.FACTFILEGM mustard DMH-11 hybrid has been developed using Barnase-Barstar system. Barnase gene has been isolated from Bacillus amyoliquefacein bacteria, a soil bacteriumIn the process of development of hybrid DMH-1 and DMH-11, a transgenic hybrid, one of the Nagpur University mutant (EH2- early Hira 2 developed by Late Anil Khalatkar) was used by Pental in developing DMH-1 without giving any credit to the University. The EH2 had the property of higher yield so he used it as a parent to develop these hybridsProduction of DMH-11 hybrid developed by Pental requires spray of herbicide Barstar which increases the production cost manifoldThere was virtually no need for a GM hybrid in mustard as the existing hybrids (DMH-1 developed by Pental himself with support from NDDB), NRCHB 506, Coral 432 and Coral 437 commercialized by both public and private sector are available and are much cheaper.Instead of comparing the DMH-11 with existing high yielding hybrids for yield evaluation, Pental compared it with weak checks of straight variety Varuna, Maya and RL-1359 which is scientifically incorrectTrials of BRL-I (confined trials) and BRL-II were approved by RCGM and GEAC without proper controlThe nutritional biosafety and cattle feeding studies conducted by the National Institute for Nutrition (NIN) Hyderabad have not been disclosed in public domain.* The seed weight of DHM-11 is around 3.3 to 3.5 gm/1000 seeds (due to very small seed size, which is not preferred by farmers) whereas that of other new released varieties and hybrids is 5.5 to 6.5 gm/1000 seeds.* The DHM-11 has not been developed for any specific trait like any disease and pest resistance. There is no advantage in DMH-11 of higher yield. Hence no rationale for the crop* Unfavourable data while preparing the DMH-11 hybrid has been purposely omitted in the reports submitted to GEAC* Glufosinate (Basta), a herbicide used for seed production of DMH-11 is very harmful for environment. Its use will increase if this technology is commercialized. It is more harmful than the commonly used glyphosate which has been declared a cancer causing agent by the leading International Cancer Institute (IARC) of the WHO.The actual experiment  Seed production technologyDMH-11 was developed by using the genetic male sterility system using following process"

In four out of six cases, the increase is more than 22%. Why do we need GM mustard, which the developers claim will yield more but in reality generate less. Non-GM mustard hybrids are equally good, said Sharad E Pawer, a retired crop scientist, who was associated with Nagpur University as a consultant on mustard development.Trials were conducted by Indian Council for Agriculture Research. We could not have rigged the data. This accusation itself shows how desperate some parties are to stop GM technology for hybrid seed production in mustard, Deepak Pental, former vice-chancellor of Delhi University and the leader GM mustard team told Deccan Herald.The mean yield of DMH-11 over 8 trials is 37% higher than that against varieties with whom the crop was checked. The facts presented by Pawar are distorted, said Pental.Contesting Pentals argument, Pawar claimed when compared against currently used mustard varieties, DMH-11 performed poorly.The comparison should have been made with national hybrid checks. It has not been done in this case. Instead, the comparison has been shown with weaker varieties, which provide a false impression that the transgenic hybrid is a better performer, he wrote to Javadekar last month.A crop biotechnologist from Bhabha Atomic Research Centre, Pawar is a fellow of National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and was associated with the National Dairy Development Board's projects on developing better mustard hybrids for years.

They are the first major American combat force on the ground there since the US pulled out of the country at the end of 2011.

Inclement weather damaged crops last February and March. Winter crops like wheat and mustard in many parts of Punjab and Haryana took the brunt of erratic weather this year too.Farmers now feel the need for medium and long-term weather forecast to help them plan ahead for farm operations. Current weather forecast is valid for only 24 to 72 hours.Over the past one week, India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued weather forecast predicting rain, thunderstorm, hail and high velocity winds and cautioned farmers against bad weather. But farmers feel short term weather forecast does not give them enough room to manage their operations and take decisions on sprays and irrigation.Harman Singh Randhawa, a horticulturist from Hoshiarpur said if farmers received weather forecast 15 days in advance they could plan better. ""If farmers knew of current rain and thunderstorm 15 days in advance, they wouldn't have irrigated wheat crop. This would have prevented it from lodging (flattening) due to strong winds. There is little we can do if we have short-term weather updates. Our operations can be better planned with advance weather forecast,"" he said.Seconding his opinion, Manpreet Singh Bajwa from Khaira Kalan village of Mansa district, said weather forecast 10 to 15 days in advance would help them handle emergencies better.""Currently, farmers are getting forecast about weather conditions for the next 24 to 48 hours. This cuts too close and we don't have enough time to manage our activities. Moreover, long and medium term forecast will also help farmers understand weather patterns better. For instance, non-seasonal rainfall has been troubling us for the past few years, especially when wheat nears maturity. If we get accurate long and medium term weather forecast, we will be able to plan and execute our operations better and cut down losses,"" he said.Bajwa also said accurate long and medium term weather updates would educate farmers in bringing about changes in their outlook. This would also enable them to educate others in their peer group.""Met department advisories teach us a lot about changing weather patterns like excess or non-seasonal rainfall and even drought. Monsoon rainfall has been deficient in Punjab and Haryana for two years in succession. If farmers know how rainfall will be during monsoon, they can base the entire crop calendar from sowing to harvest to marketing accordingly,"" he said."

A good yield was expected this year but heavy rains induced by westerly disturbances flattened the wheat crop less than a month before harvest in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.The damage can be up to 50% in several districts of Haryana, Punjab, northern Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, an agriculture ministry official said, adding that state governments had been asked to submit reports.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal ordered divisional commissioner A Anbarasu to assess the damage to crops in the Capital. Have asked Div Commissioner to assess damage to crops of farmers in Delhi due to unseasonal rains (sic), Kejriwal tweeted.The governments of Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Rajasthan also instructed officials to assess the loss.In 2015, the Centre gave states about Rs 8,000 crore for crop losses due to unseasonal rains.In Madhya Pradesh, protesting farmers took a tractor trolley full of hailstones to the office of the SDM, Banda in Sagar district and a chakka jam protest was held on NH-86 near Banda on the Sagar-Chatarpur road to draw the administrations attention towards damage to crops.In Rohtak, Ram Chander, a Dalit farmer who had taken two acres of land on contract for Rs 25,000, said rain and thunderstorm had almost completely destroyed his wheat crop. There is not much left, he said, crying for government help.Farmer Kundan Lal Jatav of Ghatla village in Rajasthans Alwar district said with tears in his eyes that rain and hail ruined his entire mustard crop on seven bighas of land.The government needs about 62 million tonnes of grains, including wheat and rice, to ensure steady supply of food items under the national food security law. Good crops in 2014 had ensured adequate stocks but crop damage in two consecutive years can exert a burden on the buffer maintained by the Food Corporation of India.Experts say the government might not have enough buffer stocks to sell in the market to keep wheat prices under check.Apart from wheat, officials admit, there has been extensive damage to mustard, potato and peas in these states. The showers have withered the flowering of mangoes in Uttar Pradesh and apple, pears and apricots in Himachal Pradesh.Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and asked the government to assess the crop damage and provide adequate compensation to the affected farmers.After the hailstorm and heavy rains, farmers of northern India are in distress.

As many as 264 villages have been severely affected in Madhya Pradesh alone.The minister said that government has decided to extend relief to Union Territories as well under NDRF, which was not the case earlier. Farmers in Maharashtra too felt the impact as mango crop was affected in certain parts of the state due to rains in the previous week. The current spell of rains will, however, be beneficial for late-sown crops, if there is no wind or hailstorm in the coming weeks.The minister's assurance came hours after Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi raised the issue in the lower House and demanded immediate action to extend relief to the affected farmers. Demanding a statement from the agriculture minister on the issue, Gandhi said the Centre should hasten provision of relief to the affected farmers and, unlike the last time, the assistance should reach them as early as possible.Though arriving at any actual figure on the extent of crop loss is difficult at this juncture, agriculture ministry officials, on the basis of the preliminary findings, believe that the impact of rains and hailstorm is less than last year when as many as 15 states were affected due to rains for a longer period during the middle of the harvest season."

To prevent this from happening again, women's groups are organising special 'pujas' in the farmlands on the advice of local 'pundits'.

They believe that rituals of this nature would distract nature's fury from advancing into their territories,"" said Yadav.""A few months ago, a spiritual guru had instructed villagers to hold special prayers as he had prophesied that hailstorms and heavy rain would cause immense devastation. Several male groups too chant mantras at the village temple.

This, as per the state's calculation, works out to be 38,000 metric tonne mustard or sesame oil. Akhilesh has said this will be great help to population residing in 50 drought-hit districts of the state. The letter said, keeping in mind UP's financial condition, it will not be possible for the state to bear the cost, but the government will take care of distribution, transportation, and expenses on margin money. With regards to this, a letter written by the state government to secretary, consumer affairs, food and public distribution, Government of India, on January 3, 2016 has also been attached.UP CM has also written that people in drought-hit districts and farmers were facing the most difficult times as a result of a second season of drought and natural calamities.

In his letter, the CM also said UP government, to meet the protein needs of the drought-hit people in 50 districts, will provide 2 kilos of arhar daal, and one litre edible oil, per family, to all Antyodaya families and eligible households.The CM has also said UP will need 37,000 metric tonnes of wheat, 29,000 metric tonnes of rice, 38,000 metric tonnes of arhar, and 1.89 crore litres of mustadr or sesame oil per month.

According to his son Rajveer, Prasad died on Monday evening after complaining of chest pain.He suffered a huge blow after seeing that the mustard crop had been almost completely destroyed, Rajveer told The Hindu. Prasad was not the only casualty of the untimely rain and hailstones. Two more farmers reportedly died in Agra due to the distress caused by destruction of crops. About 30-40 per cent of the crops have been destroyed by the sudden change in weatherOfficials told The Hindu that farmers were badly affected by the large-scale damage to crops. In Aligarh district, wheat, potato and other rabi crops were badly affected. There is no district in western Uttar Pradesh which has not seen crop damage.Though the agriculture department has begun surveying the losses incurred, unofficial estimates put the figure at 25-30 per cent.From the information we collected from the ground, production of wheat in Meerut division may go down by 15 per cent. Similarly, the percentage of crop damage in Saharanpur, Moradabad, Bareilly, Agra and Aligarh division is about 20-25 per cent. The crop damage may go up further if it rains in the next few days, said Ghulam Mohammad Jaula, president of the Bharatiya Kisan Mazdoor Manch.Mr. Jaula said the problem was multi-fold for farmers. First of all, a large number of farmers have not enrolled for the crop insurance scheme. The other problem is that a farmer will get insurance benefit only if the crop damage is at least 33 per cent, which complicates the situation especially for small farmers who are solely dependent on agriculture for survival, added Mr. Jaula."

Theres a rustle in the deciduous woodland stretching on either side: a luminous pair of golden-green eyes holds mine. The dogs stop barking and the screech of an owl shatters the night. To escape the mayhem of the Jat agitation only to meet a leopard on the prowl, I think. The honk of a car breaks the reverie and I hurry down Clutterbuck Road that runs past a golf course at the edge of the forest connecting two of Dehraduns premier institutions: the Forest Research Institute (FRI) and the Indian Military Academy (IMA).The plan was to let the new car roar through the countryside, but the Capital and all routes to the West and South are under siege, and the only way out is to drive northeast to Dehradun. Ghaziabad, Meerut and Muzaffarnagar whiz past in a cloud of exhaust fumes, highway-choking traffic and riot-scarred houses interspersed with mustard fields. Two hot parathas and a frothy sugarcane juice later, I cross the East India Company-built bridge over the Ganges canal into Roorkee, Uttarakhand. Home to Asias oldest technical institution (now, IIT Roorkee) and the Bengal Sappers, it is the kind of provincial town discovered as one journeys elsewhere. But beyond the dust devils spiralling through its Cawnpore Dwar, the mountains beckon.Cradled between the purple-hued peaks of the Himalayas and the rain-doused hillsides of the Shivaliks, Dehradun has been a hub of learning since The Raj: The Doon School, Welham, Survey of India, and establishments that study wildlife, geology and energy. But, at heart, this gateway to the Terai remains an old-world town that indulges in ice creams in the dappled shade of deodars, and the joy of browsing through wood-panelled bookstores.All life radiates from the red-bricked Ghanta Ghar, a six-face clock tower, beyond which lies the crush of Mall Road, Rajpur Road and Paltan Bazaar, with its array of curiosity shops and the famed Sunrise Bakers.The burnished gates of IMA swing open to a world that hasnt changed since the past century. Established in 1932 as a training establishment of the Indian Army, its colonnaded Collins and Kingsley blocks have housed generations of youth perched on the precipice of manhood.The Chetwode Building, named after Field Marshal Philip Chetwode, whose credo is engraved in the central hall and in the heart of every officer who earns his pips, fronts the drill square. Inside, impressive oils of generals and gallantry award winners who were alumni line the walls. The museum has interesting war relics, including Pakistan Army Lt Gen AAK Niazis pistol surrendered at the end of the 1971 Indo-Pak War.Across the highway that divides the campus stands Khetarpal Auditorium, from the steps of which newly-commissioned officers throw up their caps in jubilation. The Tons river skirts the outlying grounds, made famous by Lakshya and Vaaranam Aayiram , and dotted with trees, handsome colonial bungalows and signboards that announce Gentlemen Cadets have the right of way.The FRI that trains Indian Forest Service officers stands alongside, past a road of wild flowers that dust the grass. Almost every tree in the tropical litany claims a place here, but this wooded paradise is just the hors doeuvre . The Greco-Roman building at the end of Brandis Road, named after a German forester in British service, Sir Dietrich Brandis, houses the main office and many museums, and is a work of incredible beauty. Mynahs peek through library windows, Red-vented bulbuls sing from bushes and monkeys swing incessantly from tree to tree.The 35-km drive to Mussoorie takes in the trimmed prayer flags of the Tibetan Buddhist monastery of Mindrolling, the open vistas of Garhi Cantt, bungalows entrenched in deep lawns fringed with dahlias and, to my surprise, stacked apartments with enviable views of the hazy jungle ridges.Vestiges of past gloryAs the car wheezes its way up the steep hills, clouds come boiling up the valley. Mussoorie, at an altitude of 6,000 feet, is considered the Queen of the Hills, but I find her more like a dowager. The sahibs in sola topees and memsahibs with parasols picnicking by Kempty Falls are a sepia-tinged memory. The summer exodus from the plains is yet to begin, but the town teems with snarling vehicles and harried pedestrians. Yet, sometimes, you can still glimpse the Mussoorie that once was.At the Mall, where during The Raj Indians and dogs were not allowed, and leaders like Motilal Nehru knowingly broke the rule to pay a fine, people crowd its grand hotels. I search in vain for the Charleville that once hosted a British monarch and then generations of Civil Service probationers, as part of the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration. The Savoy where fancy dress balls were held still stands, but no handlebar moustaches quiver over chota hazri .The Company Garden is awash with flowers, and Lal Tibba, the highest point here, glows in the afternoon sun. Children stream out of red-roofed public schools like Woodstock and Wynberg that still survive with their traditions unchanged. Up another steep, white-knuckled drive stands Landour, a cantonment town once built for convalescing soldiers, with pretty houses presided over by well-known names like Ruskin Bond and Tom Alter.The last stopThe ginger-honey-lemon tea at Char Dukaan preps you for the winding climb to St Pauls, and charming Rokeby Manor, now a hotel in the midst of pine-lined roads that eventually lead into Tibet.My last stop is at the house of George Everest, Surveyor-General of India, who lived here briefly. Cool winds vectoring off different peaks meet under the wide verandah. The aroma of freshly baked cake wafts up. A lone hawk glides on a thermal, as clouds and evening sunbeams contend for dominion. And beyond these far pavilions, in the valley below, Dehradun lights up like a blazing comet.But, at heart, Dehradun remains an old-world town that indulges in ice creams in the dappled shade of deodars, and the joyof browsing through wood-panelled bookstores"

Aishwarya waits for her father to finish his cup of coffee so that they can start their daily exercise. For the past five years, every day , at this hour, Sriram would lean over the dining table and ask his daughter one question after another. Aishwarya would reply out loud and write in her diary .A routine to keep the 34year-old meaningfully occupied culminated when she released a book on her thoughts on Sunday . Every page has handwritten jottings in Tamil extracted from six sets of diaries. Though the book is titled, `Avalakku Endru Ore Manam', Aishy's Jottings (roughly translates as `A Mind of Her Own'), Aishwarya speaks about herself in first person.On Sunday , Aishwarya stood at the corridor of An na Alumni Club, singing softly to herself and saying hello to people her older sister introduced her to. The sisters wore matching pink and mustard kurtas. ""I picked the clothes,"" Aishwarya says. She was dressed up for a special day -a day she released her book.Aishwarya was diagnosed with `autistic tendencies' when she was two -in the early 80s when there was little knowledge about the spectrum disorder. The dia ry gives a peek into how she ived each day -mundane it may be but deeply meaning ul. From short observa ions, her everyday activities of cutting vegetables and riding her cycle, the diary details how she feels and her emotions after her body goes through seizures. The pages are also interspersed with pencil sketches.""Many now know about autism due to awareness campaigns,"" her mother Girija Sriram says. ""But, at that time I didn't understand it and I was shattered.Physically , she was all right.I thought she'd get better.""During her school days, Aishwarya would stand alone in the corridor for hours gazing into the sky while other children sat inside the class. She was then shifted to a special school, where she discovered that she was good in writing. The special tutors focused on her mother tongue -her best medium to express her feelings and thoughts. The writing is sometimes taken over by isolated English words or alphabets whenever the word has the phonetics of `f ' as Tamil doesn't have that alphabet.""We decided not to sanitise Aishwarya's writing,"" says her older sister, Abhirami, a freelance book editor and reviewer. ""The book is unique not just because of her perspective but also because of her language."""

Photo: AFPChampion ram King of Oils shows no visible signs of stress before his semi-final fight at the National Stadium in Lagos.The amber eyes of the snow-white ram barely register the raucous crowd 50 metres away but his outward tranquillity belies a tenacity deep within.Three and a half years ago, Dayo Folami bought King of Oils for less than 50,000 naira (Rs. 16,714). Yet today the 39-year-old businessman says the ram is priceless.Ive won a lot of money with the power he has, Folami, wearing a white T-shirt and dark jeans, told AFP at Sundays event. He doesnt give up.What motivates King of Oils to dominate in the ring is a mystery, said Folami. There is no winning secret of rams, you can never force them to fight.It is exactly that innate will to battle that distinguishes ram fighting from other animal sports, Folami said. With eight weight categories and referees, the Ram Lovers Association of Nigeria (RLAM) is working to bring ram fighting into the mainstream by enforcing a strict set of rules to ensure ram safety and fair play.We brought in rules and regulations of different weight categories, just like in boxing, RLAM member Basheer Bash Agusto said. People expect to see fairness.Agusto, the 68-year-old owner of champion ram Little Tiger  who competes in H, the lightest category  said the rams are just like any other athlete.Once identified as a fighter you make sure hes not lacking, Agusto explained, recommending to give him vitamins and clean between the hooves.Agusto, his silver hair in a short mohawk and a thin gold chain necklace, said ram fighting is an escape from daily life in Nigeria, where poverty is endemic despite massive oil wealth. They can't go to the polo club or golf club, never mind the boat club, so here they have an outlet to look forward to.Intimidating namesHundreds of people gathered under a blazing sun to watch the rams fight on a sandy pitch, fenced off with orange and blue rope.Vendors sold popcorn and suya  a salty, spicy grilled meat served with red onions and tomatoes  while contortionists in striped outfits of mustard yellow and lime green performed in front of VIPs sitting in the shade under white tents.Some rams are named after historic warriors (Attila the Hun, Spartacus), while others after devastating diseases (Ebola, Malaria).The Nigerian ram fighting rules state that at the start of a tournament rams are allowed to hit 30 blows before the referee calls a tie. By the finals, rams can headbutt up to 100 times.But sometimes the fight never takes place at all, with unwilling rams high-tailing it to the safety of their owners amid laughs and jeers from the crowd.At stake is a plethora of official prizes ranging from cars to kitchen appliances. More lucrative, however, is the gambling on the sidelines where men bet tens of thousands of naira on rams. After football, this is what brings people together, said ram judging assistant Segun Odulate. If you come here you wont think anything more, youll concentrate on the rams and youll be happy.  AFP"

Instead paint someone's life by choosing a colour based on their birth sign. According to city-based astrologers, colours have their own significance in different birth signs. For instance, pink and cream bring positivity in the life of Taureans and pale shades like off-white and cream calm the jostled nerves of Arians. For Sagittarians, red gives them a high energy.""Colour therapy is a recognized stream of medicine in which the patient suffering from a colour deficiency is advised to gain that colour balance in his system. Holi is the best occasion for natural treatment which ancient Indian scientists designed in consonance with nature. You can select your own colour on Holi and apply on others if you know the birth sign to have the best vibration of nature as well as friendship. Organic dry colours must be used instead of wet,"" said Madan Gupta Spatu, an astrologer.On this day, the scene of 'Holika burning to ashes' is enacted every year to mark the victory of good over evil. Holika was a demon who tried to kill Prahlad, the son of King Hiranyakashyap. The king had won over the kingdom of earth and was very egoistic. His son was a devotee of Lord Vishnu which he did not like and asked his sister to kill Prahlad. However, when she tried to kill him, she was burned to ashes.Holi comes on the conjunction of changing season coupled with religious backgrounds. This is why a day prior to Holi, Holika Dahan is performed where people gather around fire as burning of wood with several herbs purifies the atmosphere and makes it germs and virus-free.Time for Holika Dahan | 4:55pm to 5:31pmAries | Red, pale shades like off-white and cream calm jostled nerves of Arians.

Picture by Badrika Nath Das Cuttack, March 27: Many city residents suffering from jaundice due to consumption of contaminated water are now depending on traditional healers who claim to cure the waterborne disease through various herbal medicines. Take the case of 35-year-old Nisha Begum. She is extensively relying on traditional methods to treat her eight-year-old son suffering from jaundice for the last five days. ""We have heard jaundice can be cured by traditional methods and we have absolutely no faith in allopathic medicines. Many people in our locality got cured by traditional healers,"" said Nisha. ""Most of the herbal remedies are prepared through a mixture of black pepper, leaves and other products. One has to consume the mixture ranging from a period of three to five days. My condition has improved after consuming traditional medicine,"" said Sazid Khan, a local resident. Khan said there are a lot of other healers who claim to cure jaundice through mustard oil. Since many residents believe in traditional methods of treatment carried out by quacks, the poor turnout at a dedicated health camp is a major cause of concern for the senior officials of the district administration. Proper diagnosis of the patients is the most important job to combat the disease. ""It is really unfortunate that most people in Jobra are not turning up at the health camp for proper diagnosis and treatment of jaundice,"" said chief district medical officer Prafulla Behera. So far, around 27 persons have been afflicted with jaundice in the last 12 days at three localities in Jobra under ward No. 41 of Cuttack Municipal Corporation (CMC) limits. Behera added that steps had been taken to ensure people turn up at the health camp for proper treatment of jaundice. An official source said: ""Awareness drive has started through public announcements while leaflets are also being distributed to spread facts about the deadly waterborne disease. The CMC officials, on the other hand, have intensified the process of removal of solid waste from jaundice affected pockets in Jobra. ""We have deployed additional sanitary staff members for the removal of solid waste and assist officials of the public health department for drain cleaning job and realignment of the pipelines,"" said Gyana Das, the municipal commissioner. Local residents blamed the lack of a solid waste management system and sewage discharge norms for the jaundice outbreak at Jobra twice in the past one year. Most of the pipelines pass through the drainage channels in over 50 per cent of Cuttack. The distribution pipelines are repeatedly getting damaged due to rampant construction activities under the integrated sanitation project while no step is being taken for immediate repairs. ""We have formed 20 teams to detect the source of leakages in the supply of drinking water pipelines. Water is being supplied through 20 temporary tanks installed at various points in and around Jobra,"" said assistant engineer of the public health department, Bhawani Shankar Mohanty."

UP government has announced that it will give 25kg potatoes, 10kg wheat flour, 5kg chana dal, 5 litres of edible oil, 1 litre desi ghee and 1kg milk powder to 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in Bundelkhand. This will be in addition to the 35kg foodgrain the families receive under the National Food Security Act, 2013.According to SDRF guidelines cleared by the Centre on April 8, 2015, however, families grievously affected by natural calamities can be offered government assistance on following conditions: First at the rate of Rs 60 per adult, and Rs 45 per minor, for those families not staying in relief camps. Secondly, the state government should identify families not staying in relief camps and also declare the basis on which they were selected as beneficiaries for assistance. Thirdly, any special assistance can only be given to beneficiaries for 30 days, and extended in the case of drought to a maximum of 90 days or three months. Lastly, the state government cannot spend more than 25% of the total annual allocation to SDRF for extraordinary relief operations.But special assistance of the kind UP government plans to give to Bundelkhand's poorest of poor - the Antyodaya familes - is in direct contradiction of most of the SDRF guidelines. Sample this: Each relief package for distribution in the region costs the state more than Rs 2,500, including packaging, transport and distribution. According to UP's department of food and civil supplies, there are 2.34 lakh Antyodaya families in seven districts of Bundelkhand, with one family unit, on an average, accounting for two adults and three children. According to SDRF guidelines, relief should be given at the rate of Rs 60 per adult and Rs 45 per child. If this formula is followed, each family is entitled to receive relief worth Rs 255.But every unit of UP's Bundelkhand package-if only the cheapest variant of each component is considered-adds up to approximately Rs 1,670, minus the costs of packaging, transport and distribution. That's 10kg potatoes for about Rs 60-Rs 80, 5kg chana dal for Rs 375, 10kg wheat flour for Rs 240, 5 litres of mustard oil for Rs 575, and 1kg desi ghee for Rs 400. Add 1kg milk powder for families with children and the amount increases by Rs 250 to settle at Rs 1,920 per packet.For 2.34 lakh beneficiaries, the cost totals Rs 45 crore. With additional cost of packaging, transport and distribution, senior government functionaries confirm one month of supplying relief to Bundelkhand's poor will cost the state's exchequer approximately Rs 70 crore, and that is on the lesser side. UP does not have the financial resources to provide relief to the drought-hit farmers. Earlier this month, CM Akhilesh Yadav wrote to prime minister Narendra Modi asking for financial assistance from the Centre ""to provide, for at least six months' edible oil and foodgrains for residents of the drought-hit districts of the state."" In UP, SDRF allocation for a year is Rs 709 crore, not allowing the government to spend more than Rs 177 crore per annum for relief work across UP. for the moment, though, UP government will support poorest of poor in Bundelkhand for a month. Then, the drought-hit poor will be on their own, again."

The news sent shockwaves in Lucknow, 425km away from Ballia and director general of police headquarters were monitoring the case closely. Perpetrators of the crime have not been traced.Killing of so many sparrows is a setback to UP government's effort to save the bird, led by the chief minister and the incident occurred exactly a week after World Sparrow Day. It is feared the birds were given poison-laced feed by hunters who wanted to feast on them. Ballia police have registered FIR under Wildlife (Protection) Act and was looking for the bird killers.On Sunday morning residents of Madhavpur village under Bansdeeh Road police station stepped out to till their fields. Around 1km away from the village, Narendra Singh was preparing to harvest his wheat fields when he saw some people running. Near his fields three dozen dead sparrows were found. The group had managed to take away the remaining sparrows before villagers arrived at the scene. Police and forest department officials were informed . District police superintendent of Balia police Manoj Kumar Jha said that a large number of mustard seeds were found from the spot. ""We believed the group wanted to hunt the sparrow for meat. The group was not from the same village and we are working on the case,"" said Jha.A panel of five veterinary doctors were summoned to examine the dead birds and police said poisoned mustard seeds were used to lure the birds. Forest officials said, the poison is off low intensity and kills the birds slowly and meat is also less harmful for consumption unless eaten very frequently. Officer-in-charge of local police station inspector Nandlal said, ""Remains of five birds have been sent to Lucknow based forensic science laboratory to determine what poison had been used. Pesticide is used in high quantity in this region."" It was the first time killings of birds on such a large scale was reported to police."

Her collection Ebb and Flow is been inspired by the life and death of a flower. I start off my prt line with the blooming of the flower. There are a lot of pastel colours and then in the evening wear, a lot of deeper, darker tones appear. It is a contradiction  in the sense that I use a lot of embroidery, she points out. The brand is an ode to her father, who passed away from cancer a few years ago. Bhupal showcased 16 garments in the show. Initially I had hoped to present 40 but now I can focus only on the evening wear.Bhupal started the label two years ago and it took her six months to realise what her first collection was going to be. Her mentor has been Tarun Tahiliani with whom she interned. Unless you work, you wont know how to communicate with your tailors or embroiders. I feel like I learnt so much from him, she adds.Lakme Fashion Week Summer/Resort 2016 concludes today.See more at: www.lakmefashionweek.co.in"

Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi's promise of 24 hours electricity supply to entire Morigaon from the Tiwa-dominated site of the district, jobs to more than 200 youths of Bangthai on priority remain a dream as the proposed electricity project has not seen the light of the day even nine years after laying of the foundation stone. Dispur signed an MoS with Calcutta-based Amrit Group of Companies for a Rs 55 crore bioenergy project in the district from where 10MW power will be generated utilising wastage from Nagong paper mill in neighbouring Jagiroad. On November 22, 2007, Assam chief minister Tarun Gogoi and then cabinet minister Prodyut Bordoloi addressed a gathering of more than 10,000 people of southern Morigaon and laid the foundation stone of the alluring power project. Local Hari Chandra Pator took his first job as supervisor in Amrit Group's bioenergy project. Some youths, led by trained NCC cadre Dwipen Das, were engaged as security guards. Eight hectares of agriculture area was purchased from the Bangthaigaon villagers and the company started initial works immediately after the official formalities were over. ""For all the Bangthaigaon households it was a big achievement and credit was given to the Congress government in the state. The chief minister promised both power and employment in such a time when both load-shedding and unemployment plagued our villagers,"" Pator told The Telegraph . Two years after starting project work (in 2011), Amrit group left Bangthaigaon all of a sudden. ""Within a night the company workers left the Morigaon-based rented house without informing us. Half of the boundary-construction work had just been completed when it cut off connection,"" Moni Bora, who was engaged as contractor, said. The contractor allegedly lost more than Rs 16 lakh. Pator, Diwpen and their associates lost salary of 15 months. What remained in the site includes the unfinished boundary wall and the black foundation plaquelaid on the foundation day of laying foundation stone. ""Neither people from Dispur nor from Amrit group visited Bangthaigaon in the last few years. A year ago some Bangthaigaon villagers moved Morigaon legislator Junjunali Borua to ask about the government's stand on the project, but the legislator expressed answered the villagers about her ignorance on the matter. ""From last season I started mustard cultivation at the site. I do not know how many years I will have to meet people from the company,"" said contractor Moni Bora said. Bangthai under Jagiroad Assembly constituency is one of the biggest Tiwa-dominated belt of central Assam. The village, 10km from Jagiroad town, is hit by under-development and backwardness. ""Apathy of the governmentmachinery, neglect and reluctance of local administration to uplift the people's livelihood stand on the way of development"" Srinath Bordoloi, another villager, said."

The developers from Delhi University brushed aside those allegations.The people should know how and why GM mustard is being permitted or denied because they have to consume that food or feed and face consequences. It is a policy decision by the public authority, which needs to be revealed to the public in general as mandated by Section 4 (of the RTI Act) because they are going to be affected if GM mustard is marked, said the order.The genetically engineered mustard was under the consideration of the biotechnology regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) for commercial cultivation, when environment minister Prakash Javadekar held it back presumably for wider public consultation. A GEAC meeting scheduled on April 11 has now been postponed."

""People should know how and why GM mustard is being permitted or denied because they have to consume that food or feed and face the consequences. It is a policy decision by the public authority which needs to be revealed to the public in general as mandated because they are going to be affected if GM mustard is marketed,"" information commissioner Sridhar Acharyulu said in his order.The decision to release GM mustard for commercial cultivation is currently pending with the central regulator. Though the GEAC was scheduled to meet on April 11 to examine the details, it postponed its meeting. The issue has got highly politicised with anti-GM activists and a section of scientists locked in a polarised debate. While UPA took a conservative line, some Sangh outfits are also wary about the implications of GMOs.At present, only GM cotton is allowed for commercial cultivation in India.Although the central regulator has given its nod for scientific field trials of many transgenic varieties of food crops including rice, wheat and maize among others, it has so far not cleared any GM food crop for commercial release.The appellant in the case before the CIC, Kuruganti on Wednesday said, ""The regulator and the ministry of environment, forests and climate change (MoEFCC) were declining requests for a copy of the biosafety dossier as submitted by the applicant, despite the fact that earlier Supreme Court and Central Information Commission Orders exist from 2008 and 2009, respectively, in similar cases"".Kuruganti, an activist working for sustainable farm livelihoods and also for the cause of GMO-free India, argued that administrative precedents exist within the regulatory regime as seen in the case of Bt brinjal where data was put out for public scrutiny in the past. She emphasised that it was public scrutiny of those data that ultimately led to an indefinite moratorium on commercial release of Bt brinjal on safety issue."
58f9c388a3d24b0b70c42221,Make GM mustard data public: CIC,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/make-gm-mustard-data-public-cic/article8448708.ece,2016-04-08,"The Central Information Commission (CIC), arbitrator on Right To Information requests, has asked the Environment Ministry to make public all the data pertaining to the safety of genetically-modified (GM) mustard, sans proprietary intellectual property data. GM mustard is likely to be the first transgenic seed, to be available in farmer fields. It has had a tumultuous history in India with activist groups claiming that it will be a gateway to several other GM food crops  tomato, rice, brinjal, etc.  and that these may pose health and ecological risks. Currently, GM cotton is the only transgenic crop commercially available in farmer fields.The GM mustard in question has been developed by Deepak Pental, a geneticist at Delhi University, with support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology. The technology involves using a complex of genes, sourced from soil bacterium, which makes it easier for seed developers to easily develop hybrid varieties of mustard, generally a self pollinating plant. Hybrids varieties are generally known to produce greater yields but they necessitate farmers to keep going to seed companies every year to buy fresh seed. The technology, according to Mr. Pental, will contribute to increasing yields of such hybrids by 25% of existing varieties.Kavitha Kuruganti leads the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, which also campaigns against GM crops. Ms. Kuruganti  who petitioned the CIC  avers that the GM seeds so produced arent substantially better than existing mustard varieties and that seed developers and biotechnology regulators have colluded to push GM mustard. She also argues that in spite of multiple requests, the department hasnt made a copy of the biosafety dossier, which details the GM mustard varietys performance, available publicly.The Commission directs the public authority to verify and provide such informationspecifically the bio-safety dossier as submitted by the crop developer and any other material submitted by them and under review, after separating confidential information, if any, as per their independent decision. The Commission also directs all biosafety data pertaining to all other GMOs in pipeline as that is part of voluntary disclosure under Section 4 of the Right to Information Act reads the order, seen by The Hindu. These details are expected to be made available by April 30 after the seed developers have edited out potential proprietary information, Ms Kuruganti added. Through the hearing, the Environment Ministry was asked why this data wasnt voluntarily uploaded  Im not sure if it will be available on the website but once we get it, we will certainly make it public, Ms Kuruganti told The Hindu."

Solemn little school children in prim grey uniforms, socks briskly pulled up to their knees. Village women, pivoting energetically, as they take turns singing verses of a rollicking welcome song. Men in shabby-genteel blazers, standing stiffly in the background, politely waving leafy branches, their faces wreathed in toothy smiles.Pryda village welcomes us with flutes, a gaudy, flower-decked satin banner and unexpectedly warm hugs. Set in the West Khasi hills of Meghalaya, this village is home to about 45 families. Its accessible only via a picturesque, but challenging, one-hour trek from the main road, through steep dirt tracks, snaking streams and rough steps hewn into the rock. We find our way there by following the sound of Prydas drummer womans beats, which echo from a distance through the quiet hills.We also have a guide: village matriarch Spermon Kharnaior. Shes not absolutely sure how old she is; a spirited discussion later at the village school house, over spicy pork curry, fragrant sauted mustard leaves and cups of sweet red tea, reaches a consensus when the group settles on the age of 75. To be honest, she looks older, with her frail frame, deep wrinkles and crimson mouth, stained by years of chewing betel nut. Till she begins to lithely scamper up the hills, telling stories in rapid Khasi as she leads the way. During the last, especially steep stretch, she extends a leathery hand and grabs my wrist, then impatiently hauls me up the path right into the centre of the celebration, which she joins with gusto, raising her hands and snapping her fingers.I was at Pryda because it was one of the host villages of Slow Foods Indigenous Terra Madre, which was held in Shillong last November. An event that was as unique as it was earnest, it brought together influential indigenous people from across the world. For five days, over 600 delegates representing 140 tribes from over 58 countries joined forces to discuss the way ahead.The consensus? The tribes, who have learnt to co-exist comfortably with their land, while holding on to tradition, have answers for us all, especially when it comes to food. In a world that is giddy with conflicting dietary and health advice, tribes from villages like Pryda are an invaluable resource, because they havent changed the way they essentially live  and eat  in generations. And more often than not, theyre getting it all right. We are welcomed into the village with a tray of boiled yam and sweet potato, served with salt and deadly green chillies: a clever, nutritious and unexpectedly delicious snack. After a long lunch, set out on sturdy wooden tables at the village school house, as we get ready to leave, they hand us a final snack: sohplang, a juicy, indigenous tuber, deftly wrapped in banana leaves, to eat on the way back. Its crisp, juicy and refreshing. A world away from the heavily processed granola bars, energy drinks and juice boxes that have become synonymous with an active lifestyle today.According to Slow Food, which works with the villages of the Northeast, this part of India is home to more than 250 indigenous groups, and is considered to be one of the most bio-culturally diverse areas in the world. Meghalaya is home to one of the first species of citric fruits, a type of orange that is found only in the Garo hills.I spend a delightful day at Shillongs Barabazar, known as Lewduh, a heaving, pulsating warren of cobbled paths crammed with bustling stalls. There are trays filled with wriggling eri worms, famous for the silk they produce. A friendly chef from the Khasi tribe, who I bump into at the market, tells me how theyre his favourite snack, simply deep-fried with a dusting of salt. We try a handful, and theyre less intimidating than expected: crunchy outside, spongy inside, with an almost familiar smoky barbeque flavour. If youre squirming right now, steel yourselves: insects are likely to be the food of the future, considering they are economical, easy to raise and packed with protein. Just another little tip from the tribes.In a world that is giddy with conflicting dietary advice, tribes from villages are an invaluable resource"

Lucknow division of Northern Railways has floated a tender to outsource the job of shooing away rats from the station. The bids have come from four agencies and the one that quotes the minimum price will bag the one-year contract.It's after three years that a tender for rat control has been floated. ""It will be done as and when need arises,"" said senior divisional commercial manager (DCM), NR, Lucknow, Ajit Kumar Sinha.To keep the contract running, however, the chosen agency would need to have its performance assessed based on number of rats it shows dead in a day or a week. The agency might just present the tail as proof .It is the same as in the case of banks and insurance companies in which an owner has to show the left ear of a buffalo when insurance is sought for the dead bovine. At Varanasi railway station, where the contract was awarded to a public undertaking in November last year, dead rats are counted each time the payment is made.""The number of dead rats was initially high. Now, it has come down, at times to a single digit in a day,"" said sources. The annual contract worth about Rs 7 lakh is being awarded to keep the station free of rats. ""We don't want to spot even a single rat or else the exercise of outsourcing is futile,"" said sources.The agency will use four types of treatments. It will put zinc phosphate mixed with 'aata', 'chana daal', mustard oil, sugar and rice at all such spots where rats are seen, in the pits, parcel office, platform, canteen and offices at the station so that rats could eat the mixture. Besides, they will install glu-pads, burn 'lobaan' (gum resin) and use aluminium phosphide.Dead rats are given mass burial in a pit in the station premises after being counted and number is noted in the official register.The agency will have to go for the treatment twice a month. ""Problem with Charbagh is that once there is pest control by the NR, the rats move to 'chhoti line' (Junction) station. They have dug a trench all the way between two stations,"" said a station officer.The two stations should undergo the rat control exercise simultaneously.The 2012 contract did not yield results because only 18 to 20 rats were found dead everyday, while rest escaped. Railways, however, did not expect anything less than 500 rats found dead every day.The high expectations are not without reason, said an official. An agency which was given contract before 2012 showed 2,000 dead rats in a day. Were they all from Charbagh station? There is no evidence.Rats have for long been a major nuisance at Charbagh station. Apart from frightened passengers and hygiene concerns, what worries the officials is the fact that huge rats have made deep holes under the railway tracks, threatening safety."

Or, rather, several names. When I moved into this suburb of Delhi 20 years ago, it was called Gurgaon, a gaon, or place, where gur, or jaggery, was sold.It was a green-gold chequerboard of wheat and mustard fields, a pastoral idyll in which neelgai roamed and peacocks strutted.Into this Eden entered a serpent in the guise of property developers who bought land from the farmers and turned it into real estate.With the cash they got, the erstwhile farmers bought crates of IMFL and Maruti 800s, not necessarily in that order. They drank the IMFL, crashed the Marutis and had little to do after that but watch what had been their farmland transform almost overnight into a glittering Millennium City, with glitzy malls and bars as famous for their beer as their brawls.Gurgaon became an IT and industrial hub, attracting talent and enterprise from not just across the country but across the world. Gurgawa, as the locals pronounced it, or Gurrgaon (the 'Gurr' to rhyme with 'purr') as the newly-arrived cosmopolitan sophisticates preferred to call it, no longer sold just 'gur'.It overtook Delhi as the culinary capital of India, its eateries and bistros dishing out everything from Kashmiri to Korean fare, from gourmet burgers to Chicken Manchurian a la Chinjabi.But nothing sucks like success. Gurgaon grew at a pace too fast and furious for its own good. Towering condominiums and office blocks of glass and steel erupted out of the astonished earth amidst piles of garbage where pigs rooted, turning Millennium City into Smellenium Shitty.Power cuts, water shortages, traffic snarls, potholes linked with sporadic patches of road threatened to turn Gurgaon into Grrrgaon, a breeding ground for angst and anger.But now the new dispensation has given Gurgaon not just a new name  Gurugram  but also new hope. Gurugram  the place where a guru, or teacher, resides  is an apt name for an IT hub where the geek shall inherit the earth. Guru could also refer to Guru Dronacharya, after whom a local Metro station is named, and who is said to have been the resident sage of the place.Linking 21st century IT to an ancient Vedic past, Gurugram seems set to face the brave new world of the future. Now it's up to Gurugram's chelas, its citizens, to ensure through civic-mindedness that their city lives up to its exalted name. Kyon ji? Done deal?"

5904b1797be9e04154dfa8f2,"Moving matches won’t help farmers, GM crops will",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Swaminomics/moving-matches-wont-help-farmers-gm-crops-will/,2016-04-17,"Two droughts in a row have caused immense distress in areas like Marathwada. The courts have ordered the Indian Premier League to move its cricket matches out of Maharashtra to conserve water. But this will not improve farm incomes.Far more relevant would have been the ending of free canal water and free electricity for pumpsets encouraging inappropriate water-guzzling crops like sugarcane. Agriculture accounts for 80% of all water consumption. This can be halved by switching from field-flooding to drip and sprinkler irrigation.Agriculture accounts for almost half of all employment but only 14% of GDP. India must move people out of agriculture into industry and services. Meanwhile, it must harness the latest technologies to improve farm yields and income.Many farmers organizations have long demanded the approval of genetically modified (GM) crops to raise yields. They have been opposed by various NGOs on pseudo-scientific grounds. Environment minister Prakash Javadekar needs to urgently secure approval for growing GM crops in the interests of both science and farming.Two weeks ago, six farmer organizations demanded government approval to grow GM mustard, developed by Indian scientists. This will raise yields by 20-30%, and improve farm income by over Rs 1,000 crore. It will also reduce Indias dependence on imported edible oil.Farmers leader Chengal Reddy says GM mustard and GM brinjal could replicate the stunning success of GM cotton. This has revolutionized cotton farming, doubled output and converted India from an importer to a major exporter of cotton. Like all crops, GM cotton needs constant improvement, especially against new pests, but its impact in the last decade has been stunning.International NGOs like Greenpeace have enormous budgets and now channel millions of dollars into developing countries. Many Indian NGOs now depend critically on such dollar inflows for their jobs and budgets. Thats why they exude passion on western green agendas like GM crops, while saying relatively little about environmental disasters that India actually needs to focus on, like the destruction of aquifers by farmers getting free electricity, and diversion of scarce canal water to water-guzzling crops like sugarcane and paddy at the expense of crops like maize needing much less water.The NGOs claim GM foods are unsafe. This is flatly disproved by the simple fact that in the US, which grows a wide variety of GM foods, over three trillion meals have been eaten without any adverse consequences. India has long imported and consumed edible oils based on GM soybean and canola. Cotton-seed oil extracted from GM cotton in India is widely consumed. There is not the slightest evidence of any harm.BT IS BETTER: Government should dump the bogus objections of activists and expedite approval of GM brinjal and mustardThe activists seek by hook or crook to delay genetically modified crops, using the courts and rented mobs financed partly by dollar inflows. In consequence, they have increased approval time in many western countries to seven years or more, raising the cost of bringing a new GM crop to market to almost $150 million. This means only the biggest companies like Monsanto can afford to stay in the game. Thus the very activists that demonise Monsanto end up strengthening its market domination.Sharad Joshi, Indias most famous farm leader, used to say that most Indian greens were really watermelons  green outside but red inside. Marxists who can no longer sell the idea of the dictatorship of the proletariat have shifted to selling horror stories about GM crops. They claim to have scientific knowledge, but much bogus green research on the terrible fate that would hit Indian farmers growing GM cotton turned out to be as fictitious as the worst Stalinist literature.Norman Borlaug, Nobel Laureate and father of the green revolution, was a great supporter of GM crops. He blasted anti-GM activists as ignorant alarmists spreading falsehoods. There is no evidence that biotechnology is dangerous. A top science writer like Matt Ridley has long exposed the anti-GM campaign as hollow.Dr Patrick Moore, a scientist and founder of Greenpeace, later left that organization in protest against its non-scientific opposition to GM crops. When I last met him, he was seeking funding to prosecute Greenpeace and other NGOs for crimes against humanity. He said that depriving farmers and hungry people of the benefits of GM crops was nothing less than a crime against humanity.So Mr Javadekar, please dump the bogus objections of pseudo-scientific activists, and expedite approval of GM brinjal and mustard. Bangladeshi farmers are already growing GM brinjal, getting higher yields and incomes.Ordinary brinjal needs 30-35 sprayings of pesticide against just five sprayings for GM brinjal. Pesticide levels in Indian diets are already dangerously high and need to be reduced. For the sake of consumers as well as farmers, let the GM revolution spread fast and wide."

5923bd887be9e01fcef0591d,A crucial victory  for biosafety,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/541708/a-crucial-victory-biosafety.html,2016-04-20,"A crucial victory for biosafetyShalini Bhutani, April 21, 2016, DHNS 0:08 ISTCIC held that denial of information merely because the issue is 'under process' is unreasonable.An order given by the Central Information Commission (CIC) in New Delhi on April 1, 2016 hasnt got the attention it warrants. It is not only a step towards biosafety, but also significant for democracy. The CIC passed the said order in response to an application by a concerned citizen seeking the full biosafety dossier of transgenic mustard from the Environment Ministry (MOEFCC).A genetically modified (GM) variety of mustard, known as DMH11, has been developed at the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP) in the University of Delhi (South Campus). The crop developer had submitted the required information on the GM mustard variety to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC under the MOEFCC) in 2014 and 2015 as part of a mandatory biosafety dossier. It is this information that was sought by the RTI applicant.The GEAC had conveyed that the crop developers application was under review and would only be made public after the appraisal procedure was over. The CIC held that denial of information merely because the issue is under process is unreasonable. In the continuing debates on whether or not India should adopt GM seeds in food crops, the views are often deeply polarised. The value of the CIC order is completely lost if it, too, is seen as a two-sided battle between those for and against GM.Dealing with the real and potential risks of modern biotechnology has three aspects  risk assessment, risk management and risk communication. Much of the discussion in India is on how best to improve the regulatory framework for risk handling, but not enough attention is given to risk communication. Risk analysis is not complete without that.Communication, in this context, cannot just be a one-way transfer through websites or press releases. To be meaningful to the decision-making process, it has to be interactive. The aspect of consultation is yet to be institutionalised in India. Until now, the broader community and people at large are seen as obstacles in a bureaucratic approval process.The Office of the Gene Technology Regulator of the Australian government stresses on how findings must be presented to the public in a manner that facilitates inputs. There needs to be an interaction between the decision-making body, the regulating authority and the ordinary public. This is also what the CIC order reiterates. The information needs to be revealed to the public because they are the ones who will be affected if GM mustard is marketed.Intellectual property (IP), particularly patents and plant variety certificates in the area of crops, can become a means to not only secure exclusive economic rights over ones innovation, but also to exclude others from seeking information about the same during the pendency of the IP term.The GEAC had also declined to share any information on GM mustard on the ground that the crop developer had patent rights on the variety. GEAC officials invoked Section 8(1)(d) of the RTI Act, which allows for IP-related information to be withheld if disclosure adversely affects the competitive position of the IP-holder.Yet, the CIC held that larger public interest warrants the disclosure, in spite of any IP. This is a welcome stance from the point of view of biosafety. In fact, public sector biosafety research on proprietary GM crop varieties can become very restricted or be made expensive by companies due to IP.International lawThe Cartagena Protocol is the international treaty on biosafety. India is a member of this since 2003. It is based on the idea that a country cannot regulate GMOs unless it is aware of them being transported into its area. Therefore, it requires for Advanced Informed Agreements to be signed before living modified organisms (LMOs) are shipped to another country.The CIC also cited the precautionary principle, which is a globally accepted environmental principle. The principle asks for one to tread with caution when the risks from a technology are not fully known. This is with an end to protect the environment. Both, the global protocol and the principle require access to information to be made workable.The CIC order makes it easier for the Central government to incorporate the necessary provisions for both transparency of biosafety data and public participation in any new bill that it might draft on the issue of GM.The Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India (BRAI) Bill has been pending since its first avatar as the National Biotechnology Regulatory Authority of India Bill, 2008. There was considerable public outcry on the manner in which the bills attempted to muffle voices speaking out against GM technology.The CIC has now asked for making public the complete agenda and minutes of the GEAC meetings within 24 hours of approval. The Commission has also directed that all biosafety data pertaining to all other GMOs in the pipeline be part of voluntary disclosure under Section 4 of the RTI Act.Additionally, it has imposed a time limit, demanding that all directions be complied to before April 30, 2016. This lays the ground for a risk communication charter in the area of biosafety, one in which people can not only ask questions but also get answers."
59230f037be9e01fceefea99,How the World Health Organization's cancer agency confuses consumers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/541623/how-world-health-organizations-cancer.html,2016-04-20,"By Kate Kelland, LONDON, April 20, 2016, (Reuters): 15:55 ISTThanks to scientists working under the auspices of the World Health Organization, you can be fairly sure your toothbrush won't give you cancer. Over four decades, a WHO research agency has assessed 989 substances and activities, ranging from arsenic to hairdressing, and found only one was ""probably not"" likely to cause cancer in humans. It was an ingredient in nylon used in stretchy yoga pants and toothbrush bristles.All the other 988 substances, however, pose some level of risk or need further research, according to the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), which is an arm of the WHO. Some things in IARC's top category of carcinogens are pretty obvious nasties, such as plutonium, mustard gas and smoking tobacco. Others are more surprising: Also ranked as ""Group 1 Carcinogens"" are wood dust and Chinese salted fish.IARC has said that working as a painter causes cancer, using a mobile phone possibly does, and working shifts as a pilot or a nurse, for example - is ""probably carcinogenic."" Last October, it ranked processed meats in its top category of known carcinogens, alongside plutonium.The findings have caused consternation, not least for non-scientists puzzled by what IARC's rankings mean.As a global authority on cancer - a disease that kills more than 8 million people a year worldwide, with more than 14 million new cases appearing annually - IARC has enormous influence and commands much respect, even among its critics. Yet experts from academia, industry and public health say IARC confuses the public and policymakers. Some critics say the way IARC considers and communicates whether substances are carcinogenic is flawed and needs reform.Even the WHO, which oversees IARC, was caught off guard by the agency's announcement that red and processed meat should be classified respectively as probable and known carcinogens. The WHO's official spokesman, Gregory Hartl, issued a statement saying WHO's Geneva headquarters had been flooded with queries and requests for clarification. IARC's ruling did not mean people should stop eating meat, he said.Asked about the relationship between IARC and the WHO, Hartl told Reuters: ""WHO works closely and continually with IARC to improve the way the two bodies collaborate and communicate on the knowledge of potential and real hazards and risks to the public.""At stake are judgments that can affect the lives of millions of people and the economic activities of states and multinational companies. IARC's rulings influence many things, from whether chemicals are licensed for use in industry to whether consumers choose or spurn certain products or lifestyles.But its methods are poorly understood and do not serve the public well, according to Bob Tarone, a statistician formerly at America's National Cancer Institute and now Biostatistics Director at the International Epidemiology Institute. He said of the way IARC works: ""It's not good for science, it's not good for regulatory agencies. And for people? Well, they are just being confused.""Paolo Boffetta worked at IARC for 19 years, rising to become head of the genetics and epidemiology team, and describes himself as ""still a strong supporter"" of the agency. Nevertheless, Boffetta, now at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in the United States, said IARC's approach sometimes lacks ""scientific rigour"" because its judgments can involve experts reviewing their own research or that of colleagues.Some institutions have also clashed with IARC. The agency is currently embroiled in an acrimonious dispute with the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) over glyphosate, an ingredient of widely-used pesticides. IARC says glyphosate is ""probably carcinogenic."" EFSA says it isn't. The glyphosate row has thrown up concerns about potential conflicts of interest at IARC: It involves an adviser to the agency who is closely linked to the Environmental Defense Fund, a U.S. campaign group opposed to pesticides. (See ).In the face of its critics, IARC steadfastly defends its methods and aims. ""This is really the strongest possible process,"" Kurt Straif, the head of IARC's classification programme, told Reuters when asked about the way his agency evaluates possible causes of cancer.IARC's director, Chris Wild, has also defended the agency against criticism in scientific journals. In a letter to one of the journals, he said the scientists involved in its classification decisions ""are motivated by a desire to improve public health by identifying the causes of human cancer and thereby contributing to disease prevention.""Richard Sullivan, a professor of cancer policy and global health at King's College London, says any confusion is due to a widespread misunderstanding of IARC's role.""IARC is purely there to do the science. And the science is absolutely fine,"" he told Reuters. ""But there is a disjunction between the pure science and the policy and public health messaging. That's where problems arise.""SEMI-DETACHED AGENCYFrom the beginning, IARC has been a compromise. Born out of a French initiative, it was originally envisaged as an independent agency with a huge budget. It ended up as a semi-autonomous part of the WHO with modest funds. IARC, based in Lyon, had revenue of about 30 million euros ($34 million) in 2014, whereas the British charity Cancer Research UK had income of about $875 million and the U.S. government's National Cancer Institute had a budget of $4.9 billion in 2014.Despite its limited financial heft, IARC was a pioneer and established itself as a world-leading authority. Its assessments of whether something is a cause of cancer catch the eyes and ears of policymakers and the public.To produce its assessments, IARC assembles groups of experts who review the existing scientific evidence and then place a substance or activity in one of five categories: carcinogenic to humans; probably carcinogenic; possibly carcinogenic; not classifiable as carcinogenic; and probably not carcinogenic. These reports are known as ""monographs.""The public sometimes misunderstands what IARC means by its classifications. The agency says it assesses ""hazard"" - the strength of evidence about whether a substance or activity can cause cancer in any way. It takes no account of typical levels of human exposure or consumption. So it is not measuring ""risk"" or the likelihood of a person getting cancer from something.IARC gives no view on the relative levels of risk of getting cancer from, say, plutonium or alcohol; what it does say is that there is clear evidence that both are capable of causing cancer. Therefore it ranks both substances in its top category of being carcinogenic.Geoffrey Kabat, a cancer epidemiologist at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the United States who has publicly criticised IARC, says the classifications do the public ""a disservice.""""What the public wants to know is: What are the agents in our surroundings that are likely to have palpable effects on our health? Not theoretical exposures which might, under some far-fetched conditions, possibly have an effect,"" said Kabat, who is also author of the book ""Hyping Health Risks.""The risks of public misapprehension were evident in some of the media reaction to IARC's announcement on red and processed meats. The Huffington Post declared: ""Meat is the new tobacco."" Britain's Daily Mail said ""health chiefs"" had ""put processed meat on same level as cigarettes.""Such interpretations are misleading, in IARC's view. Straif told Reuters that the blame for any confusion lies with industry, activist groups and the media.""There are stakeholders on various sides that want to make it look ridiculous,"" he said. ""There are activist groups who want to say, 'This is now an IARC carcinogen and we need to take all actions against it'. And then there is a third dimension - the media, who have their own interests in being sensational.""Straif defended the decision to place processed meat in the same hazard category as plutonium, saying that ""for both of these things there is clear evidence that these are human carcinogens.""""NAIVE, IF NOT ANTI-SCIENTIFIC""Some critics say the problems with IARC's monographs begin well before they become headlines. Their concerns focus on the composition of the ""expert working groups"" that decide which of the five IARC categories a substance or activity should go in. These experts sometimes include people who have spent years publishing research on whether the substance or activity under scrutiny can cause cancer. They may be part of IARC working groups that review their own research or that of close colleagues.Between 2012 and 2015, for example, IARC published or started 18 monographs involving 314 scientists. A Reuters analysis found that at least 61 of those scientists served on monograph working groups that considered their own scientific research. The analysis did not include the number of scientists on working groups that reviewed the research of close colleagues.In letters, commentaries and articles in scientific journals, Tarone of the International Epidemiology Institute and other scientists have questioned whether such people ""are the best judges of the validity and methodological soundness of their own and allied work.""IARC's Straif said the agency's working groups consist of ""the world's best experts"" who critically review the scientific evidence and are not swayed by previous findings in their own work, or that of close colleagues. ""IARC has a strong belief, for good reasons, that those who know the most about certain exposures are those who have worked on such exposures,"" he said.Straif said IARC's rules ensure no ""author or associated colleague"" can directly evaluate a study they have published. And neutrality is assured, he said, because the discussions involve 20 to 30 people in an environment where ""advocacy of any kind ... is not tolerated.""Tarone regards IARC's assumption that all experts will be detached and independent as ""naive, if not anti-scientific."" He told Reuters: ""It's absurd to assert there are no issues of bias related to self-interest, reputation or careerism. It has nothing to do with bad motives, it's just human nature.""Tarone and other critics say IARC is inconsistent in its treatment of potential conflicts of interest and cite as an example a study of radiation of the sort emitted by mobile phones. In June 2011, IARC concluded such radiation is ""possibly carcinogenic."" That ranking put mobile phone use in the same category as lead and chloroform.Anders Ahlbom, a senior professor at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, was originally invited to chair the working group on electromagnetic radio frequencies in May 2011. However, Ahlbom, who thinks there is little evidence to suggest mobile phones cause cancer, was asked to step down about a week before the meeting was due to begin after he told IARC he had been contacted by a journalist. The journalist had questioned him about being on the board of his brother's consulting firm, which helps clients lobby on telecoms issues.IARC decided that Ahlbom had a perceived conflict of interest. Ahlbom accepted this decision, although he said there was no conflict since he had no financial interest in his brother's company. Ahlbom said his departure upset the balance of the IARC working group, which, he and five other scientists said, included researchers who already viewed mobile phones as likely to raise the risk of brain tumours.""It appears that IARC handles conflicts of interest differently depending on who the person is and which 'side' he is assumed to represent,"" Ahlbom told Reuters.Straif said IARC ""takes all conflicts of interest seriously, regardless of the individuals or organisations involved."" He said that Ahlbom's exit from the working group did not leave it with an imbalance.""It is difficult to perceive how a strong working group of 32 internationally renowned experts would suddenly not have a balance anymore because of one single expert who had a conflict,"" he said.SEEING REDAt the meetings of IARC working groups, invited observers who have ""relevant scientific credentials"" are allowed to attend; but they have to sign confidentiality agreements and cannot discuss the proceedings. Straif says this is to ensure the scientists can speak candidly, without fear of having their disagreements or discussions reported externally without their consent.One observer, a specialist in food and animal science who attended the working group on red and processed meats in 2015, spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity. The person alleged that the expert panel reviewing the scientific evidence appeared to aim for a specific result.In its meat assessment, IARC went beyond its normal remit of assessing hazard, not risk. It gave specific warnings about the risk of eating red and processed meat products.IARC said, for example, that for each 50 gram piece of processed meat eaten daily, the risk of a person developing colon cancer increases by 18 percent. The observer who spoke to Reuters said these data appeared ""to come from nowhere, overnight.""The observer said: ""I expected that the science would be reviewed with a high level of rigour. But quite frankly, at the end of the 10 days, from a scientific standpoint I was really quite shocked.""Straif said the numbers came from ""a combined analysis"" of the scientific papers under review, and were issued by IARC because there was sufficient evidence in human epidemiological studies for the working group experts to feel confident in them.Straif told Reuters parts of the working group discussions may have been missed by some observers: ""We really worked around the clock, up late into the night and all weekend, so I'm not sure if the observers were there at all times.""In a subsequent email to Reuters, he said the risk estimates and corresponding scientific papers were part of the monograph discussions from ""the very first working drafts and through all revisions."" He added: ""It is very difficult to understand how any participant could have missed this discussion.""While not disagreeing with IARC's assessment of meat as a carcinogen, the WHO headquarters issued a series of tweets giving context. The WHO stressed that ""the health risks of processed meat are vastly different of those cigarettes and asbestos"" and that ""meat provides a number of essential nutrients and, when consumed in moderation, has a place in a healthy diet.""The controversy has raised questions at WHO headquarters about the organisation's control over IARC. ""There is talk here now of needing to rein IARC in,"" said a Geneva-based WHO insider.Charles Clift, a global public health specialist at the Centre on Global Health Security at Britain's Chatham House, said the WHO should have taken more of a role in IARC's presentation of its conclusions on red and processed meat.""The WHO should be there to give authoritative guidance,"" Clift said, ""not just endorse things that can be misinterpreted - either from IARC or anybody else.""The WHO's spokesman, Hartl, told Reuters that IARC was a ""functionally independent"" agency, and that when IARC flags up cancer hazards, the ""WHO assesses or re-assesses the levels of risk associated with those hazards. Based on the risk assessment, WHO reaffirms existing or issues new guidance aimed at safeguarding public health.""Straif of IARC said: ""I'm very happy with the way we do things at the moment. We are really at the head of the scientific community."""

Instead of depending on insurance companies, the state government wanted its own set up to provide compensation to farmers under the scheme.The Union Cabinet had approved the new crop insurance scheme in January this year and it will come into affect from the coming kharif season. Under the scheme, the premium to be paid by farmers has been brought down considerably to only 2 per cent for khariff and 1.5 per cent for rabi crops.While the Haryana government has notified the scheme for the state, it is working on the modalities.Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said that they have sought permission from the centre to set up their own corporation for implementation of the scheme. The Centre is giving Rs 300 crore for the scheme. Haryana has made provision of Rs 300 crore in the budget for the same. Instead of depositing all this money with insurance companies, we could set up our own company. This will also ensure that the farmers do not face problems in getting compensation in case of crop damage, he said.Dhankar added that talks would also be held with insurance companies for the implementation of the scheme. The modalities will be worked out once a discussion is held. He said that the aim is to encourage farmers to take insurance which they are reluctant to.As per the 2011 Census, of around 16.7 lakh farming families in Haryana, around 2.14 lakh families were covered by Modified National Agriculture Insurance Scheme up to kharif 2013. This was the last crop for which the government notified the insurance scheme. The farmers complain about having to pay the premium even when they were not being adequately compensated when the crop failed.Farmers have faced successive crop failures in the state. The Haryana government paid Rs 1,092 crore compensation for damage to wheat and mustard crop last year. An amount of Rs 967 crore was announced for damage to cotton crop due to whitefly pest.The compensation was restricted to an area of five acres. A special girdawari is also being done in some villages to asses damage to wheat crop this year following hailstorm and rains.

58fa7e1da3d24b44f321d557,Drought pushes Bundelkhand farmers to the brink,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/drought-pushes-bundelkhand-farmers-to-the-brink/article8520956.ece,2016-04-26,"On the night on March 27, Musru Prajapati was up as usual, keeping vigil in his field at Khurhand village in Banda, Uttar Pradesh. Three consecutive droughts, with bouts of hailstorms and unseasonal rains, had dented his morale. He wanted to defend whatever little crop he managed to grow on his four-bigha land from stray animals which raided his fields in the dark.He had started to look tense and desperate. He even reduced his food intake, said Musrus son Mayaram.Musru, who owed Rs 1 lakh to moneylenders and relatives, was found dead the next morning. The post-mortem report could not ascertain the actual cause of his death, but his family, villagers and local officials believe he was the latest in the list of  sadma  (shock) deaths that have stalked the parched landscape of Bundelkhand. In Banda itself, nine such deaths have been reported in the last two months, District Magistrate Yogesh Kumar said.To witness the agrarian crisis, all one needs to do is drive through the parched region, past its definitive yellow and brown landscape. Swathes of land lie unused as farmers did not sow this season given the absence of irrigation facilities and crippling water crisis. Some took a chance, seduced by light showers, only to face huge losses later.Musrus family had borrowed the seeds and fertilizer, and even leased land at much higher costs. The burden has now shifted to his son Mayaram, whose plans to migrate were shattered by his fathers death. He now has to take care of three younger brothers. While politicians are building farm houses, farmers are forced to abandon their farms, said Mayaram, who remains without a job despite a graduate degree in education and a post-graduate degree in economics.Rising suicidesAccording to activist Sanjay Singh, around 18 lakh people have migrated from Bundelkhand over the years. Since 2003, 3,500 farmers are estimated to have committed suicide in the region. The figure this year is already 174, said Mr. Singh.While the agrarian distress has shattered the hopes of smaller peasants, even the big farmers are at a loss, many engaging in distress sale of grain and cattle. The poor quality of grain is also making it harder to sell. The Food Corporation of India accepts six per cent shrinkled grain but the farmers samples [with around 12 per cent shrinkled] are failing the FCI standards. They are engaging in distress sale much below the MSP of Rs.1525 per quintal. We have requested the government to relax the norms, said Mr. Kumar.The area under cultivation has shrunk and, consequently, the output of major crops has fallen sharply. Those relying solely on farming have been pushed to the brink.Farmers dont have enough to eat, forget about recovering the money for the cost of fertilizers, seeds, or selling it in the market. We were better off without sowing anything, said Munna Lal, a farmer in Hamirpur, who could only salvage two quintals of wheat after increased investment.The figures for the Chitrakoot Division explain it all. The overall output of wheat in the mandal has halved in the past three years. If in 2012-13, the output was 23.87 quintals per hectare, in 2015, the figure plummeted to 11.28 quintals. In 2016, it is just one-third. Chana dal (chick pea) also did not fare well. Production has fallen consistently from 3.25 quintals per hectare in 2014 to a meagre 1.75 quintals in 2015. The production of peas, masur and jowar has also fallen substantially.The total area under cultivation for the rabi crop in Chitrakoot division has halved in a year. In 2014-15, the cropped area was 8,90,982 hectares as against a target of 9,22,057, while 3,01,74 hectares were left uncultivated. The figures for the 2015-16 season are, however, much worse: against a target of 9,42,013 hectares, the cultivated area was a paltry 4,20,051 hectares. Significantly, 5,21,962 hectares were left uncultivated.The kharif crop production has been much below the State average. Rice output in 2014 was 16.17 quintals per hectare against the State average of 22.67, while bajra was 9.71 quintals per acre (State average was 19) and arhar dal (red gram) was only 3.85 quintals per hectare against the State average of 8.20.To address the crisis, the Akhilesh Yadav government has allotted Rs 867 crore for the damage to crops this year. The State suspended all revenue collection till March 31, while increasing the working days under MGNREGS from 100 to 150 days. From April, it also implemented the Food Security Act, under which food grains would be distributed for free for four months, and introduced 100 per cent coverage of all eligible families under the Samajwadi Pension Scheme. The government launched the Samajwadi Drought Relief programme, under which antyodaya families would get relief material of 10 kg of wheat flour, five kg of rice, five kg of chana dal (chick pea flour), 25 kg of potatoes, five litres of mustard oil, one kg pure ghee and one kg of milk powder.While observers have praised the State governments drought response measures, some feel the real test is in ensuring their implementation. While travelling for this story, this correspondent found that many villages were yet to even have their lists of FA beneficiaries ready. Officials blame the administrative mechanism and system of distribution for the delays and lapses."
58fa6554a3d24b44f321cb91,‘Progressive’ farmer shows the way to success in parched Bundelkhand,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/progressive-farmer-shows-the-way-to-success-in-parched-bundelkhand/article8525449.ece,2016-04-27,"In the parched, brown landscape of Uttar Pradeshs Bundelkhand region, where hundreds of distressed farmers have taken their lives in the past few decades or have been forced to migrate, Prem Singhs farm is an exception.In the fabulous green farm, there is plenty for everyone: abundance of water-bodies for animals to drink from, many fruit-bearing trees, a steady produce of organic products, healthy cattle, well-nourished soil and natural fertilizers and, importantly, a steady flow of income. The 32 bighas of land that Mr. Singh shares with his three brothers also boasts of a one-of-a-kind rural museum, the Humane Agrarian Centre. A farmer-activist based in Bandas Badokhar Khurd village, Mr. Singh believes that his experiment with sustainable and traditional farming could be replicated at a larger level, and could pave the way for a policy change.The idea is to ensure the prosperity of the farmers family, ecological balance and food security of the country.He calls his pioneering method of sustainable farming Aavartansheel Kheti. Loosely translated, as per a book he co-authored with Belgium environmentalist Johan Dhulster, it means periodic proportionate farming.Key elements of this approach are crop rotation, organic farming, animal husbandry, food processing, planting and research for improving soil fertility and seed development. The essence is to minimise the farmers reliance on the market while improving their standard of living.The farmer would have to utilise his farm by dividing it into three parts: one-third would be used for rearing fruits and crops, the other for growing timber and the remaining portion for animal husbandry. Mr. Singhs multi-pronged technique, pioneered and implemented by him for over a decade, is similar to the idea of farming Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been propagating in his addresses to farmers.The farmer, known in the area as pragatisheel or progressive, advises farmers to not directly trade their produce in the market but to sell the processed extracts. For instance, sell paneer but not milk, and so on. That will link the farm to the kitchen. And also give the customers a better quality and nutritious product, said Mr. Singh. Some of the popular products at his farm are amla pickle and candy, cow ghee, mustard oil, organic rice and flour (wheat, gram, and barley). Asked whether it was practical for small farmers, Mr. Singh said, yes, with certain adaptations and adjustments.Born in 1964 into a farming background, Mr. Singh studied philosophy in Allahabad University but soon turned to his ancestral vocation. In 1995, he adopted a traditional method of farming, triggered by his dismay at the negative impact of the Green Revolution.He says the Green Revolution and other policies played a big role in dismantling the traditional structure of farming and pushed the farmer to the mercy of unsustainable methods, which also harmed environment. Mr. Singh links it to the present crisis, where three consecutive droughts, with bouts of unseasonal rains and hailstorm, have devastated the morale of the Bundelkhand farmer.The outside knowhow of some experts was forced upon farmers. Till 1980, not a single bag of urea was purchased in Bundelkhand. But due to the governments policies, farmers were forced to abort traditional and more sustainable methods, eventually leading them into debt-traps, Mr. Singh said. Every time a farmer commits suicide, the government says he was burdened by debt. What is the key reason for the debt? The farmers are dying because they follow the schemes of the government. This is the real injustice.Droughts are not new to Bundelkhand. As per records, in the last century it witnessed 17 major droughts, 10 of them caused by deficient rainfall. But the traditional water-recharging methods, numerous ponds, and natural harvesting techniques of people then mitigated the scarcity. The steps taken by the government in the last three decades have nullified the work of the ancestors, Mr. Singh said.The crops grown then did not require much water. With the Green Revolution, underground water began to be extracted heavily to sustain the thirst of the seeds. The local seeds were tested and adapted to fight drought. But the seeds introduced by the government needed excess water and urea to grow. Tractors further increased the costs, Mr. Singh said.At the centre of it all, said Mr. Singh, was the ruling class apathy towards farmers, manifested in their lack of representation in policy formation. The farming sector was bearing the brunt of their mistakes and excesses of the industrial and service sectors.His farm has plenty of water, many trees bearing fruit and a steady produce of organic products"
58fef68e7be9e0420db2a385,Indian biologist discovers memory molecules in plants,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160427/jsp/nation/story_82485.jsp,2016-04-27,"New Delhi, April 26: An Indian biologist has discovered in plants special proteins, called prions, hitherto found in yeast, insects, and mammals that could explain the decades-old mystery of how even plants form memories. Sohini Chakrabortee, who spent three years scanning over 20,000 proteins in plants from the mustard family, has found at least one protein that behaves like a prion and is capable of building molecular memories, such as those of exposure to a prolonged period of cold that precedes flowering. Prions are a unique class of proteins that can alter their shapes, self-propagate by inducing other molecules of same protein to adopt their shapes, and cluster together. While prions were detected in the early-1980s playing a role in the transmission of certain neurodegenerative brain disorders, studies in fruit-flies and mice over the past five years have suggested that prion-like proteins may be essential in maintaining long-term memories in these organisms. ""This is the first evidence that a plant protein may self-replicate as a prion - this opens up the possibility of protein-based memories in plants,"" said Chakrabortee, who led the research as a post-doctoral fellow in the laboratory of Susan Lindquist at the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the US. Several studies over the past three decades have suggested plants also form memories of exposure to drought, heat, or prolonged cold. ""It is these memories that allow plants to distinguish between a single night of cold and a long winter,"" said Chakrabortee, who had studied plant biology at Delhi University before pursuing a PhD at the University of Cambridge in the UK. In their study, Chakrabortee and her colleagues searched a plant protein database and identified three proteins with prion-like properties involved in flowering - and found that at least one of these appears capable of forming molecular memories. ""When we talk about plant memories, we mean the plant that has a memory responds differently to a stimulus compared to a plant that has never experienced this before,"" said Can Kayatekin, a post-doctoral associate and a member of the Whitehead-MIT team. The study's findings described on Monday in the US journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, have excited biologists who have long been familiar with prions as primarily linked to neurodegenerative brain diseases in animals and humans. ""This is really, really significant, I have never, never heard of prions in plants - and I've been studying prions for about twenty years,"" Karim Adjou, professor at the Veterinary School of Alfort in France told The Telegraph in a telephone interview. ""If this is confirmed, it will open up a completely new area of research."" Prion research emerged in the 1980s amid discoveries that these self-propagating proteins can explain Mad Cow disease, spread through contaminated beef, and Kuru, another brain disorder linked to the practice decades ago of funerary cannibalism in a tribe in Papua New Guinea. Since then, prions have also been implicated in some other neurodegenerative disorders. But over the past decade, studies by the Nobel laureate neuroscientist Eric Kandel at Columbia University and India-born, Calcutta-educated neurobiologist Kausik Si at the Stowers Institute of Medical Research in the US have indicated that prion-like proteins can help build long-term memories. Neuroscientists believe long-term memories are stored in the brain through connections between neurons, or brain cells. But these physical connections need to be maintained for days, months, or years, for specific memories to persist. Kandel and Li are among scientists whose work suggests that prion-like proteins may be among molecules that can explain the persistence of memories. Prions tend to stick together and form sticky aggregates, or clusters. As long as these aggregates persist, long-term memories persist, Kandel had said last year in a media statement released by Columbia University describing his research. ""Prion aggregates renew themselves continually recruiting new prions into the aggregates - this maintenance is crucial for memories."" ""The finding of prions in plants could explain some unresolved puzzles of flowering,"" said Ranabir Das, a senior scientist at the National Centre for Biological Sciences, Bangalore, who has himself studied prions but was not associated with the Whitehead-MIT research. ""While the flowering process is generally understood, plants appear to somehow fine-tune their behaviour to external cues - and prion-driven mechanisms may help explain that,"" Das said. Jayant Udgaonkar, another senior scientist at the NCBS, said the identification of proteins with prion-like behavior in plants is an important development as it supports earlier work on other organisms showing that prion-like proteins have important physiological roles. ""The prion-like structure is part of a protein involved in flowering,"" Udgaonkar said. ""It is a likely candidate for a protein-enabled memory mechanism in plants that would enable plants to use the memory of external weather in the regulation of its physiology."" Chakrabortee, who has moved to the University of Birmingham to take on the role of a research administrator, says the most exciting aspect of the study is the finding of prion-like proteins in the plant kingdom."
58f5b5337be9e01a17c9f4b5,Of mangoes and their many faces,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/Of-mangoes-and-their-many-faces/articleshow/52061629.cms,2016-05-01,"All through the history of mangoes, there have been only two best known ways to eat the fruit - squeeze a fleshy, juicy mango with your bare hands and slurp up the happiness, and sneak up on your mother as she cooks her favourite preparation of mangoes, to steal a bite before anybody else.With traditional Goan homes almost considered incomplete without a mango tree in the backyard, the produce was plentiful, and this is evident from the number of tried and tested recipes that prescribe a method of consuming the fruit at each of its maturing stages.Till date, most Goans cannot resist taking home the very first raw mangoes of the season they sight in the market. They are immediately cut into tiny cubes and smeared with salt and chili powder, and at times asafetida. The crunchy mangoes add some extra spice to the summer fish curry and rice.Pickles made from raw mango can go from this simple preparation to the very complex chepnemchi toram. As the name suggests, the raw mangoes are first compressed under the weight of a stone before a coarse mixture of ground fenugreek, mustard, asafetida, pepper, chilli, turmeric and salt is stuffed inside. The aromatic masala is held intact by a thread tied around each of the raw mangoes, which are then stored in oil. If made the 'right way' it can last for a year or more, your mum will tell you.Another classic is the sweet mango pickle, made from semi-ripe mangoes, for which every Goan granny has a twist of her own. Siolim resident Ana Luiza Fernandes says that her grandmother would make her sugar syrup for the pickle with vinegar. ""Ground garlic and ginger is added to the syrup and later mangoes and chilli powder.""In Hindu kitchens, where the vinegar is non-existent, the semi-ripe mangoes are cooked with jaggery to a thick consistency and a fonn or tadka of asafetida, mustard seeds and green chilly is added.Saatt (mango leather) is another common preparation in Hindu homes, made from pulp of ripe mangoes. Here, the pulp of the overripe mangoes is simply cooked into a thick consistency and poured into as thin a layer as possible on steel plates. After two to three days of drying in the sun, a thin and sweet chewy replacement for toffee is ready for the children of the house.Ambya sansanv is also a must during the season in most Hindu homes even today.""Salt and jaggery is added to the pulp of mango and a finely-ground masala made from grated coconut, green chillies, dry chillies and mustard is added to it. The mustard is added to the masala during the last stage of grinding and this gives the dish its prominent taste. That is why the dish is named sansanv or mustard,"" says Mayem-based homemaker Malini Pandurang Shetye.Sansanv needs no cooking, so also with mango gozzu, where jaggery and a fonn of curry leaves, green and dry chilly and mustard is added.But till date the most popular preparation of ripe mangoes is the jam, known as mell or halwo, by Goans. While some like theirs cooked with cinnamon, others add cardamom for taste and yet others like ginger in theirs.The popularity of this preparation is understandable, for what won't a true blue Goan do to make the flavour of this favourite fruit last all through the year!"
58f71b76a3d24b0b70c32113,Snacktrack: A serving of semolina goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/snacktrack-discovering-bengalurus-rava-idli/article8547420.ece,2016-05-02,"There are times when the tummy rumbles and grumbles. You dont want to go in for something heavy, but are looking for that perfect snack that keeps your body light enough to keep working without feeling drowsy. So, we zero in on rava idlis.A staple, delicious food, the rava idli has become popular in not just Karnataka but also around the world. This idli is created from roasted semolina, mixed in sour curds and seasoned with mustard and curry leaves.After this the idli is steamed, topped with cashew nuts and served with a tangy coconut chutney, sambar or a vegetable kurma. Some versions also have tiny chopped pieces of beans, grated carrots or coconut and chopped coriander.To find the origin of this popular dish we take off to MTR (Mavalli Tiffin Rooms), on Lalbagh Road, which is associated with the dish for years. We meet Vikram Maiya, the Managing Partner, MTR, who narrates the history of rava idlis.As we wait for our dish to arrive, Vikram starts, The history of rava idly has been retold a number of times. It started off with grain middlings. When the grain is milled, whatever is left out is called semolina. We have wheat, maize and rice semolina. The story starts there. During World War II, there was a shortage of rice. It has not been documented, but my grand uncle  Yagnanarayana Maiya  who was a prolific cook, started experimenting with various ingredients and then zeroed in on the rava idli recipe. He created the recipe. It worked with curds and cashew and seasonings. The original ingredient is still used. Rava idli is now made pretty much the same way everywhere.Then about MTR he says, It started in 1924 as Brahmins Coffee Bar. My grand uncle worked as a cook and later started MTR in 1951. The rest is all history.Our rava idli arrives, piping hot with a sweet and tangy potato curry, coconut chutney and a tiny bowl of melted ghee. We generously layer our cashew-topped idli with the ghee and dip it into the chutney and then the next bite into the potato gravy and theres absolute silence for the next few seconds as we get immersed in our plates.The original recipe is followed everywhere, Vikram says. The consistency has also been followed as the recipe was written down and handed over to the cooks down the years.With our mouths full, we ask why it is not served with a kurma, and Vikram explains, I personally feel the aroma and the strong masalas of the kurma kill the subtle flavours of the rava idli.The rava idli does indeed feel lighter on the tummy and great on your palette. That is because it does not have urad daal or rice, making it a healthy, savoury option, beams Vikram. As he does most of the talking, we do most of the eating. Finally crunch go the roasted cashews in our mouths, adding that grand finale to the taste and the history of the famed rava idli."

The meeting, which will discuss how to contain prices, will include even vegetable and poultry wholesalers who are not under the purview of essential commodities. CMO sources told The Telegraph that chief secretary V.K. Pipersenia and the commissioner, food and civil supplies and consumer affairs, Rajesh Prasad, have initiated a slew of measures, including the formation of a task force/enforcement team in the 34 districts of the state, involving an executive magistrate, a representative of urban local bodies and two representatives from the supply department. The sources said as part of the ongoing drive, the food and civil supplies commissioner has convened a meeting at the circuit house here tomorrow. Even those dealing in items which are not notified as essential items have been invited to participate in the meeting. The move comes in the wake of reports that traders and retailers are charging exorbitant rates to recover the amount they had spent as donation to political parties in the recently concluded Assembly elections. However, chief minister Tarun Gogoi, having resumed office after a bout of illness, had sought a report from the chief secretary on the allegations and an action-taken report which, sources said, was submitted yesterday. ""The prices of essentials items such pulses, mustard oil, gram, peas, rice vegetable and poultry have risen but vegetable and poultry do not fall under notified essential items. Wholesalers dealing in these items, besides representatives of the agriculture and veterinary departments, have also been asked to participate and suggest ways to contain the prices of these items,"" a source said. Representatives from the railways and petroleum sector, which look after the transportation of food and petroleum products respectively, have also been invited to participate in the meeting, besides the chambers of commerce, wholesalers and retailers. ""Only a collective effort can contain prices in a consumer state like Assam. We are looking at what is fuelling the rise. Alertness and prompt action against those indulging in unfair practices can also contain price rise,"" an official said. Kamrup (metro) deputy commissioner M.

The two-day cow show at International Institute of Veterinary Education and Research in Bahu Akbarpur village of Rohtak was inaugurated on Friday.Nodal officer of the event Prem Singh told TOI that more than 620 cows have participated in the show and top 18 of them will participate in the beauty contest. However, prize money of the beauty contest has not been finalized yet. As many as 50 bulls have also reached the show but they won't be allowed to compete. Former sarpanch of Gangana village in Sonipat Virender Singh is hopeful that any of his eight cows will bag the prize in the beauty event.Singh said that this time, Gir breed cows - Jamna and Rani - have bagged first prize in milk production recording 17kg and 16.5kg in day. ""My cow from the same breed Bachhdi had bagged first prize in the cattle fair organized in Muktsar in 2015,"" he added. Singh said they give 6kg feed including gram and mustard daily to each of his cows. Only desi breeds of cows including Hariana, Sahiwal, Tharparkar, Rathi, Belahi and Gir have been invited for the show as the government has announced to promote indigenous breeds and build a brand for some particular breeds' milk.According to state animal husbandary minister Om Prakash Dhankar, bulls of Hariana breed are known for their beauty in rural areas while cows of this breed are the most beautiful bovine variety in the country. A few months after coming to power, the state government had decided not to inseminate indigenous breeds of cows with foreign breeds under the cross-breeding programme, which was being followed for the past four decades."

Sources said food and civil supplies commissioner Rajesh Prasad, who chaired the meeting, impressed upon the traders about the need to comply with the dos and don'ts issued by the local administration to check prices or face action. This after a section of sellers spoke about their ""limited"" role if prices are high at the source, their alleged harassment during ongoing raids and why there was no hue and cry when prices of petrol products fluctuated frequently. As reported in today's edition of The Telegraph, the meeting held at the Circuit House was attended by representatives of wholesalers, retailers, chambers of commerce, railways, Indian Oil Corporation and officials of supply, agriculture, Fishfed and veterinary departments. The meeting was necessitated following the bad press both the state and Union governments had been receiving over price rise. The meeting, sources said, was held in a ""cordial"" atmosphere and the stress was on ""identifying"" the problems and fixing it through ""all-round"" cooperation. A slew of measures (see chart) aimed at both officials and traders were initiated during the meeting where issues connected with the market came to the fore. Sources said vegetable, poultry and fish wholesalers said prices of their products were more or less stable but there was something amiss with the retail market. ""For instance, a kg of parwal/patal (pointed gourd) is Rs 18 kg in the wholesale market but the same item is being sold for Rs 60 a kg in the retail,"" a source said, quoting a wholesaler. There was a discussion to issue receipts to retailers. Vegetables, poultry products and fish do not fall under notified essential items. ""A slight rise in their prices adversely affects household budgets, sparking off heated discussions on and beyond the dining table. This is something we are witnessing now,"" one of the sources said. As part of the measures, the Assam State Agriculture Marketing Board was asked to set up 10 more shops by finalising the location of the plots with help from the district administration. ""There are two markets now. A committee has been formed to finalise the venues within May 10. The wholesalers were asked to upload prices on a daily basis so that it is in the public domain,"" the source said. The task force/enforcement teams in the districts will continue to raid places dealing in food items. Traders warned that prices of potato and pulses, which have stabilised, will see a rise soon because of likely rise in prices at source. ""A few more meetings will be held,"" an official said, indicating that the administration was unlikely to ease the pressure on those dealing in food items. Jorhat shop The Jorhat district wing of the Jatiya Mahila Parishad, a sister concern of the Asom Jatiyatabadi Yuba Chatra Parishad, today set up shop in front of Jorhat Court building and named it Modi Bazar in protest against the high prices of essential commodities. The shopkeeper and helper donned masks of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan. A list of essential items and their prices in 2014 was displayed in the shop, with a comparison with prices this year. Siba Kalita, central committee organising secretary, said prices of all essentials, pulses, lentils, sugar, flour, and especially mustard and refined oils had skyrocketed. ""Everything has increased by Rs 40 to 60. The acchhe din promised by Modi has turned out to be really bure (bad),"" he said. The list showed the price of masur dal to have risen from Rs 80 to Rs 110, arhar from Rs 68 and 74 to Rs 100. The organisation demanded an immediate bringing down of prices to the 2014 level, before the NDA government had come to power."

A key affiliate of RSS, BJP's ideological mentor, the Swadeshi Jagran Manch has decided to pass a resolution against the key economic reform measures of the BJP-led government at its national council meeting slated later this month. ""We are against the government's decision to allow FDI in e-Commerce and the food processing and marketing sectors. We will urge the government to take back its decisions as these will go against the interests of small shopkeepers. We will pass a resolution against it at our National Council meet,"" SJM's national co-convener Ashwani Mahajan told . The Manch has held the view that FDI in e-Commerce was coming in an ""illegal"" way earlier and allowing it now amounts to rewarding those who had been flouting the rules and circumventing the law. The Manch will meet in Bhopal for the annual meeting of its National Council on May 21 and 22. Mahajan said e-Commerce companies have been adopting ""predatory pricing"" by allowing heavy discounting on products which are adversely affecting the small Indian shopkeepers. ""These companies are incurring huge losses by adopting predatory pricing of products and their sole purpose in doing so is to capture the huge Indian consumer market, that will render the traditional shopkeepers jobless,"" he said.It is a reality that such transactions have made life easy and products come cheap, he said. He said though e-Commerce is not so prevalent in purchase of products of daily use, online buying is on the rise.The SJM leader said there are nearly 2,000 small and big portals involved in e-commerce, though most most transactions are limited to a few big ones. Mahajan apprehended if e-commerce continues to grow at the present pace, it may reach 4 per cent of GDP by the year 2020. In 2009, total retail business of e-commerce companies was hardly Rs 6,000 crore, which shot up to Rs 78,000 crore in 2013. The SJM leader said even chemists have been effected by it as some portals are also offering discounts on medicines in the Indian market. The SJM has been frequently opposing government's decisions. It had earlier protested against field trial of genetically modified (GM) Mustard crop and the policy on Intellectual Property Rights, among other issues. SKC SK DIP"
58f756f6a3d24b0b70c34172,The inheritance of loss,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/the-inheritance-of-loss/article8602080.ece,2016-05-15,"senior literacy activist once told me about how the great Shivaram Karanth wrote a set of stories in the 1950s to help illiterate adults learn to read. It was for a UNESCO project in Mysuru. Whether for children or adults, stories must be interesting if learners are to be engaged. It would be patronising to ask adult learners to read childrens books; at the same time, as beginning readers, they could not straightaway attempt Karanths novels.Hearing this, Karanth stayed up one night to write a set of new stories specifically meant for adult learners. The next morning, a pile of discarded drafts on the floor showed how carefully he had worked on these stories.Decades later, these stories by Karanth, illustrated with beautiful line drawings by the artist K.K. Hebbar, became part of the Dakshina Kannada literacy campaign. Karanth told the literacy activists that the books should be small in size and easy to hold, with large print for adult learners who would use them to learn to read. Like childrens picture books, but with deeply philosophical stories to which adults could relate.Parables of the mustard seedOne of the stories in Karanths primers was a retelling from the tales of the Buddha: the parable of Kisa Gotami and the mustard seeds. A woman came weeping to the Buddha one day because her son had died. She pleaded with the Buddha to give her some medicine to revive the child. The Buddha asked her to bring him a few mustard seeds from a house where there had been no death. Going from house to house in search of one where no one had died, the woman heard story after story of grief and loss  until she realised that death came inevitably to every home. Thus her grief was calmed.I imagined the learners sitting in a circle in some volunteers house, exhausted after a day of daily-wage labour but with a hunger to learn to read, slowly decoding the words, looking at the illustrations, making meaning out of the sentences, feeling a kinship with the grieving mother at the storys heart.I thought again of the story of Kisa Gotami and the mustard seeds on the day my mother died in a cancer hospital in Mumbai eight years ago. We had known for days, weeks even, that the end was near. My mother had slipped into a coma and the oncologist told us gently that her organs were shutting down one by one. There are standard phrases for these situations: she is sinking; the end is near; it will soon be over.We had not taken enough reading material to the hospital. I had a Muriel Spark novel; my husband read Alice Munros story The Bear Came Over the Mountain on his phone. The next morning I brought more books.And yet when it came  the end  I was unprepared. The death rituals gave us things to do and matters to arrange while our minds were elsewhere. Earthen pots were procured. Flower garlands. A bowl of rice grains. Coins. In the morning, my mothers body was sent into the furnace at the electric crematorium at Chandanwadi. That evening, we poured the still-warm pot of ashes into the sea at Breach Candy. No food was cooked in the house. A neighbour sent idlis , someone sent paranthas . A small mud lamp flickered in a corner all night and all day. On the tenth day, a young priest  he worked night shifts as a BPO staffer  texted on his phone while chanting shlokas . We arranged rice balls and unsalted food on a banana leaf and waited for the crows in order to (the priests said) turn my mothers drifting soul away from earth and towards heaven.As I imagined my mothers winged soul flying further and further away, I felt a mother-shaped hole open up in my heart. Would I ever see my mother again? Her tired smile, her quizzical look? Would she ever discuss Bertie Wooster stories with my husband again? Would I be able to joke with her saying, I knew you would say that! the way we did? Would I ever be her daughter, and she my mother, again?We all need our parables of the mustard seed.The mystery of deathI thought of the story again when I read Amitava Kumars moving essay Pyre, about his mothers death in Patna. The image that accompanies the memoir in Granta is one of marigolds  a broken garland, some petals  floating on water. I felt my stomach lurch when I saw this image. I remembered how we poured my mothers ashes, including pieces of bone, into the water, along with thick fistfuls of marigold petals.Because it isnt when the doctor is signing a death certificate, or when your mothers body goes into the fire, but only when you have poured the ashes into the water and tossed all the flowers into it and your hands are finally empty  it is only then that you begin to comprehend the loss. Your mother is no longer on this earth.I dealt with my sorrow by writing in my notebook, says Kumar. There is a long tradition of writing about mortality. Faced with the end, the writer reflects upon the life that preceded it. Joan Didion about her husbands death and her daughters illness ( The Year of Magical Thinking ); Cheryl Strayed about the loss of her mother and her subsequent journey of self-discovery ( Wild ); Paul Kalanithis memoir about his own mortality ( When Breath Becomes Air ); and most recently, Jenny Diskis cancer posts. Each ones treatment of the subject is vastly different. Didions prose is filled with taut clarity; Strayeds narrative is spirited, adventurous, wild; Kalanithis the measured, precise account of a medical professional. No syrupy self-help, no clich, no false promises in these memoirs. The writers are at their most thoughtful, but also unguarded and honest as they come up against the final mystery of death.In his essay, Kumar reflects on another short story, A.K. Ramanujans Annayyas Anthropology. A young Indian graduate student at the University of Chicago, sitting in a library engrossed in a book by an American anthropologist, sees a picture of a funeral ritual. On closer inspection, he discovers that it is his fathers body which is on the pyre. He realises that his father is dead.Apart from Ramanujans profoundly ironical point about Indian self-discovery in Western knowledge, adds Kumar: The story tugs at the immigrants dread that distance will prevent his fulfilment of filial duty. Not to mention the distance that lies beyond. Death is an individual grief; for others it may have only academic interest.I had been luckier than Annayya, reflects Kumar. But there is sadness in his words.Uma Mahadevan Dasgupta is in the Indian Administrative Service and currently based in Bengaluru.We had not taken enough reading material to the hospital where my mother was admitted. I had a Muriel Spark novel; my husband read Alice Munros story The Bear Came Over the Mountain on his phone. The next morning I brought more books.It isnt when the doctor is signing a death certificate, or when your mothers body goes into the fire, but only when you have poured the ashes into the water and tossed all the flowers into it and your hands are finally empty  it is only then that you begin to comprehend the loss"

She has set their imagination in ignition mode with a tale. They are wrapped in curiosity and suspense and then, suddenly, the room bursts into laughter. The joke is as infectious as her smile and soon, it's a laugh riot. The actors seem to have lost their focus. ""Ladies, gentlemen and all other species!"" she exclaims; trying to capture their attention. The laughter ceases and they regroup to stay with her till the end of the tale. So vivid is her skill of narrating, so intimate her gift of empathizing with the characters in her story, that when she's finished, the listeners have already lived the play in their minds.""The characters I write about actually live with me, walk with me and are continuously haunting me,"" says the story teller, Isabel de Santa Rita Vas. For nearly three decades and with over 60 original scripts, the playwright has left English theatre lovers in Goa awestruck with her engaging and thought-provoking work. The Mustard Seeds' recent production in February 2016, titled 'All Those Piped Dreams', received unprecedented applause and coverage, but for Vas, every play since November 1987 has been special.For years now, she has been accused of tip-toeing away from the photographer, shying away from the limelight. Theatre fans know her as a director who would rather stand in the crowd and applaud her cast than be on stage and bow to a standing ovation. She says, ""I like being this way; publicity isn't a necessity. I would value visibility for the plays and theatre work we do. Theatre is, to me, creativity-in-community. It's a collaborative art, not a solo game. A play needs to have a playwright, director, actors, light-and-sound technicians, musicians, choreographers, make-up artists and a production team to make it successful and I feel all deserve due credit and praise.""Her connection with the audience goes beyond theatre. She began her teaching career at Progress high school, Panaji, at the age of 19 and has since evolved into an institution of her own. ""I had a great time from day one. I still remember entering a Class X classroom consisting of huge boys. They were certainly amused by my presence, but were the kindest lot. My class proved to be funny and entertaining,"" she recounts her first day as a teacher, when she managed to cut ice with the naughtiest of students.""When I began teaching, I believed a great deal in the chalk in my hand. Today, I believe the duster makes space for learning: it welcomes and invites everyone to contribute,"" says the former vice-principal of Dhempe College of Arts and Science, Miramar, who taught at the institution for 39 years before retiring.The theatre group sprouted from a desire of her first play's cast to stay together, and 28 years later, though the family has grown, the group hasn't been allured by the commercial temptations and stayed true to its philosophy of making a change and contributing to the climate of thought. ""We were rehearsing for our first play and as we neared the performance date, we realized that it was all going to end soon. We didn't want to miss out on all the fun of doing theatre. I hope we continue to collaborate as we move forward and never stagnate,"" she says.Vas, who was awarded the 'Goa state cultural award for excellence in drama' for the year 2012-13, is now part of a new project, where theatre personalities and artistes from different linguistic and professional backgrounds have come together under the banner 'Play Fools', to listen, share and grow out of each other's experience.Not one to let the media scrutinize and analyze her choices, she has maintained a fine balance between her professional and her personal life. ""I appreciate being in solitude and this peaceful space is very important to a writer. Being alone is different from being lonely; I connect with different people and with a variety of friends,"" she says, as her immediate family of three dogs make themselves comfortable around her chair.Having spent most of her 65 years in Panaji, she knows the city and its roads since the colonial days. Rain or shine, you will spot her walking along the streets or catching a bus, picking up themes and dialogues. The humour, satire and emotion of these day-to-day ordinary human exchanges inspire her work. As her colourful personality camouflages into the bougainvillea plants in her garden, she reflects on the testing times for artistes in India. ""I am concerned for the climate of censorship of the arts. It's the artistes who nurture and preserve a society and if they won't ask questions, it would turn infantile.""... And Scene!When the curtains close and credits roll, Isabel de Santa Rita Vas will be remembered as a missionary of arts who dedicated her lifetime to not just teaching English literature but scripting her own masterpieces that nurtured English theatre in Goan society"

This is the Brahma Jnana, the highest goal attainable since it leads to liberation. But this Jnana is hard to attain and requires tremendous effort and persistence, pointed out Sri Goda Venkateswara Sastrigal in a discourse.One must have a burning desire to know the truth and engage in spiritual enquiry in earnest. The Bhagavad Gita makes it clear that among thousands of people, very rarely does anyone strive to attain peace of mind in earnest. Maybe one among such who strive thus is able to understand the truth of the Lord. It is only after many births that such a jnani understands and internalises the truth that Vasudeva is everything. Even if he begins to perceive this truth in theory and accepts to believe it implicitly, only when it pervades his entire consciousness does his jnana attain fruition. Such a person is a mahatma for, he sees the presence of God in every atom of creation. The Chandogya Upanishad explains the Self as something smaller than a grain of rice, smaller than a mustard seed, smaller than a canary seed or even smaller than the kernel of a canary seed. Yet this Self within the shrine of the heart of every being is greater than the earth, greater than the heavens and even greater than all the worlds. If the all-pervading Paramatma is beheld in ones heart, one can hold on to Him as is seen in the case of a Dhruva or a Prahlada who were constantly aware of His divine presence. Those who have the desire will surely succeed and realise that there is none bigger than Him and that He is always everywhere."

How can we increase our productivity without using science and technology, Union Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said here on Monday. The genetically engineered crops that received field trial approvals are cotton, rice, castor, wheat, maize, groundnut, potato, sorghum, brinjal, mustard, sugarcane and chickpea.Carrying out the field trials, however, depends on receiving a no-objection certificate from the states. Field trials of GM cotton, maize and mustard took place in Maharashtra, Punjab, Gujarat and Delhi from which GM mustard, developed by the Delhi University, came close to commercialisation. When the commercialisation proposal for indigenous GM mustard came up before the regulator, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) in February, Javadekar intervened before the regulator could decide.The minister stepped in due to opposition from the anti-GM activists and Left parties. The project was put on the backburner. The mustard proposal is still being studied, he said.The Environment Ministry has not yet released the biosafety data for GM crops as directed by the Central Information Commission. We will respond to the CIC, Javadekar said.The number of approved field trials as stated by the minister is far less than what an anti-GM lobby group estimated two years ago after the GEAC cleared a number of proposals in four meetings within months of the NDA government coming to power."

Initiated by the Society of North East Handmade Paper Development (SNEHPD), an NGO working for rural development, the farmers' clubs will have about 200 members each, covering 2,000 farmers spread over the subdivision. Prakash Thakur, who heads the organisation, said the richer farmers will teach others how to go about farming so that they can get the most out of the land they own. ""From our side we will be pushing for multiple cropping and will supply the mustard seeds to be sown after this paddy season (June-September). Assam Agricultural University has agreed to supply the amount of mustard seeds required. After that we will tell the farmers to grow potatoes. These are the three crops which we have selected for a year of cropping,"" he said. Thakur said gain was not the only objective of opening the clubs. ""Over the years our youths, instead of tilling the soil as their fathers had, prefer to go to towns and cities in search of jobs like waiters, watchmen, painters and the like. They even move out of the state in search of jobs as they feel agriculture does not pay. We would like these youths to remain rooted to the soil,"" Thakur said. He said the aim is also to keep the family engaged and, therefore, women will be taught to weave. For that, weaving clusters will be developed so that they can make a small profit. He said their children can also be engaged in looking after goats or pigs, growing vegetables in kitchen gardens, animal husbandry, fishery and horticulture. SNEHPD has collaborated with Nabard for promotional sponsorship, Titabar agriculture sub divisional officer for guidance and a couple of banks for loans. Thakur said banks were wary of lending to farmers as they already have huge outstanding amounts. He said six months ago, SNEHPD held loan recovery camps and were working towards total recovery so that banks start lending to farmers again. The clubs will be located at Xilikhabari, Mahimabari, Daani Gaon, Kamalpur, Gopalpur, Kosukhat and Xilikha Sanatan in Titabar subdivision. Mili Juli, Green Land, Garali Adorxo are some of the names given to the clubs, which will be formally launched at Xilikhabari tomorrow."

Patanjali took flak for ads of hair oil, mustard oil and washing powders.Patanjali Kesh Kanti Natural Hair Cleanser & Oil's advertisement's claim, ""mineral oil is carcinogenic in nature and may cause cancer"" was false and misleading by ambiguity and by gross exaggeration,"" said ASCI. The company's Kachi Ghani Mustard Oil advertisement's claim that most of the other edible refined oils and mustard oils are made using neurotoxin Hexagon solvent extraction process, as many companies mix cheap palm oil in mustard oil, to make profits at the cost of consumers' health, was also not substantiated and was misleading, ASCI added.Similarly, for its Herbal Washing Powder, Cake and Dishwash Bar, the claim of ""herbal washing powder, cake and dishwash bar"" was not substantiated with data regarding which herbal ingredients in the product provide the cleaning benefit and was deemed misleading by ASCI.Apart from Patanjali, ASCI upheld complaints against companies such as, ITC, Kalyan Jewellers, Johnson & Johnson and HUL, among others. Johnson & Johnson's advertising of Benadryl DR was pulled up. The advertisement's claim, ""sookhi khansi ko dobara aane se roke"" (stops dry cough from reoccurring) is an absolute claim and was not substantiated. Also, the claim does not convey a ""suppressive"" action and is misleading by exaggeration, said ASCI.FMCG major ITC's advertising claim for Aashirvaad Multigrain Atta that said, ""India's No. 1 Atta"", is misleading by ambiguity as the claim was for the mother brand Aashirvaad whereas the advertised product was only one variant  Aashirvaad Atta with multigrains. Also, the disclaimer was not as per Nielsen criteria, the watchdog said.For Kalyan Jewellers, the advertisement claim, ""Kalyan Jewellers is the biggest jewellery showroom in the world"", was not substantiated with comparative data of other similar showrooms and was misleading by exaggeration, said ASCI.In March, ASCI's Consumer Complaints Council (CCC) upheld complaints against 90 out of 156 advertisements. Out of 90 advertisements against which complaints were upheld, 32 belonged to the education category, 30 in the healthcare & personal care category, followed by 10 in the food & beverages category and 18 advertisements from other categories."

Picture by Ashok SinhaThe health departments food safety wing shut down two hotels and sacked an employee at another on Sunday after they were found cooking food in unhygienic conditions. Paal Hotel, located on Budhha Marg, was found to violate guidelines under schedule IV of the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, Rules 2011 that attracts a fine of up to Rs 2 lakh. We were shocked to find food being cooked near the open drain at Paal Hotel, said a food safety wing official on conditions of anonymity. Foul smell was coming from the kitchen. The hotel has been shut down till further orders and asked to build a kitchen complying with the norms. Officials of the food safety wing said samples of chana dal, arhar dal, cottage cheese, mustard oil and chowmein were collected from the hotel. The pulses looked polished but the cottage cheese and mustard oil looked to be of inferior quality. The pulses are usually polished with chemicals to keep them shiny. We will send the samples to national-accredited laboratories. Further action will be taken if the samples are found to be adulterated. Sources said last year the hotel was sealed for two days because of the kitchens unhygienic condition.Dr Diwakar Tejaswi said culinary items cooked near open drains can lead to contamination of food causing diseases like hepatitis A, hepatitis E, typhoid and diarrhoea among others. Amrendra Prasad Singh, a doctor in the medicine department of Patna Medical College and Hospital, said: It depends on the chemical with which the food was polished. Carcinogenic materials are often used to polish food items, which can cause cancer. Food safety officials also sacked an employee at Rajasthan Hotel on Fraser Road who was found to have fungal infections in his hand. As per the Food Safety and Standards Act 2006, for every employee who work in an eatery and has skin-related problems, the hotel has to ensure his/her medical check-up every six months, the official added. Sources said officials didnt find the mandatory licence at Dosa Plaza, located in West Gandhi Maidan, which is required to run a restaurant. We have closed the restaurant till further orders, the official said."

The earliest pillow was the crooked arm with the head resting on upturned palm. This was done by early man not only for comfort but also to prevent insects from entering his ears. In time, he found a better option, for Egyptian tombs show people using stone pillows. Then came pillows stuffed with straw or feathers, followed by those filled with cotton fluff or foam rubber.A curious practice in our country was laying the newborn baby on pillows filled with mustard seeds. This, it was believed, would confer a perfect shape to the developing head. What the helpless infant felt about this, no one can tell. What we do remember as children though is that pillows lent themselves to delightful and rollicking fights. Sparring with pillows was both exciting and harmless. Wisps of cotton flew and so did admonitions from irate parents. This hardly proved any deterrent though.Another delightful aspect of childhood is the fantasy of the tooth fairy. She is the sprite who eases the ordeal of shaky milk teeth. Gifts from her compensate the pain of having them pulled out. The fairy, of course, is none other than the fond parent. This harmless deception brings much joy, but it can also, as it did with my granddaughter, bring one face to face with harsh reality.She was very close to her grandfather and was still a vulnerable seven-year-old when he died suddenly. In the aftermath, no one realised the depth and sharpness of her grief. Then, she lost a tooth and, as usual, placed it under her pillow along with a request to the tooth fairy to restore her beloved grandfather to her. She was awake when, in the early hours of the morning, her mother crept in with a book and stealthily lifted her pillow. She was startled to hear the child say in a broken voice, Now I know there is no tooth fairy. Thatha wont ever come back.Pillows possess no power to bring back the dead but they are a sure source of support and solace. You can confide your fears and sorrows to yours. You can bang your fists on it and drench it with your tears. It will respond to you in sympathetic silence. Pillows are eminently huggable and take away pain, whether physical or mental.Your favourite pillow is as personal as the clothes you wear. No wonder then that an upscale hotel in Singapore presents its clients with a choice of sixteen varieties of pillows!"

My first interaction itself had me captivated by her compelling charm and I was caught in her magical spell.Her well-sculpted facial features with a small cute nose, soft hazel-brown eyes, an enchanting dimpled smile, and the thatch of thick tousled wavy haireach had an endearing quality about it. Her amiable demeanour and disposition further aggrandised her image.I still remember my first lunch with her at her place. In sabzis, the way carrots were kibbled with finesse, the beetroots cut into symmetrical cubes, the coconut grated without chunks, the seasoning done with rightly spluttered mustard and dals, fried to golden brown all these spoke of her painstaking efforts and care and, of course, her perfection even in minutiae. Truly, Suthi is a gourmet cook, who can, with expertise, rustle up epicurean delicacies in a jiffy.The ambrosial fare tasted even more delectable because of the high comfort levels that this zippy person was offering, wherein I was totally myself, without any inhibitions. Incidentally, her actual USP is her pure unadulterated mind, uncontaminated by any sort of envy. Her spontaneous appreciation of my apparel, accessories, or my crooning prowess, only reflected her own magnanimity in recognising any good in others.No wonder, with a mlange of her loving and caring attitude, she has always been a great wife, besides being an ideal daughter and sister to her family. Her abode is constantly a board n lodge to many of their relatives and friends, owing to the acme of hospitality that her guests enjoy. In fact, she treats even her domestic help with the same warmth and compassion.Well, after that gastronomic delight of lunch, as I was bidding adieu, Suthi handed me a sling bag stuffed with sundry things. On reaching home, I saw that it contained several containers. One had a tart and tangy chutney, another a piquant-tasting spicy pickle.Also, there were sealed packs of coffee powder and sambar masala  as she knew I had liked her perfectly brewed beverage and tongue-whetting sambar concoction.Indeed, I was bowled over by her abundant munificence, her bubbly self and, of course, her bountiful love, bereft of all facades, which we often witness between many relations today.Its believed teeny things speak tonnes about a person. In her case, each of her gesture speaks in titanic proportions  about her inordinate goodness, affable nature, immense love to all, her incredible generosity, innate warmth and her intrinsic capacity to radiate happiness around. Long live such rare gems, who are indeed a real bliss to this world."

It has decided to use Gambusia, or mosquitofish, that feeds on mosquito larvae, to stop malaria-carrying mosquitoes from breeding. Currently, 125 fish are being bred in a water body in Jacobpura. They will soon be released in water bodies across the city. Eventually, all 152 water bodies will be covered.According to the officials, they are also tying up with the fisheries department to ensure they have sufficient numbers of fishes, and to ensure their transition to the water bodies is smooth.""We have been breeding them since May 1. However, we will need assistance from the fisheries department to ensure more fishes, and their smooth release in the ponds,"" said Dr Snehlata, district malaria officer. She added these fish will released in the bigger water bodies where mosquito larvae-killing chemicals cannot be used.The department has already started spraying chemicals in smaller water bodies, to check the breeding of larvae. Among the 152 water bodies in Gurgaon 116 are regular ponds, while 36 are seasonal ponds.The mosquitofish has a lifespan of a year and breeds in the summer and rainy seasons. They are aggressive, and frequently attack native fish, nipping at their eyes and fins. ""However, ponds where the Gambusia will be released, do not have any fish, so there is no danger to local ecology,"" said Dr Snehlata.They also multiply quickly, colonising a water body. Gambusia also competes with native fish for food and have been known to eat native fish eggs. The Chennai Municipal Corporation had introduced mosquitofish in 2012 in its ponds and canals to check breeding of mosquito larvae. However, its success has been mixed.Dr Snehlata said a health department team will be teaching villagers to spread mustard oil on ponds to create a film on its surface, cutting off oxygen supply to mosquito larvae breeding in the water.This year, six cases of malaria have been reported so far in Gurgaon, against 66 cases recorded last year."

Express Archives In the last 96 months, around 250 regular sanitation workers of the civic body, largely regular workers and in the age group of 35 to 50 years, have died due to various ailments. Express ArchivesHEALTH AND safety of sanitation workers in the City Beautiful is not on the priority of the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation if the high rate of mortality is an indicator.In the last 96 months, around 250 regular sanitation workers of the civic body, largely regular workers and in the age group of 35 to 50 years, have died due to various ailments. Forty-five-year-old Hawa Singh, a regular sanitation worker, became the latest casualty on Saturday.Hawa Singh, the lone bread earner of family of six, vomited blood after returning home from his duty. Although the exact cause of death could not be ascertained as post-mortem was not conducted, his death underscored the fact that the sanitation workers are vulnerable and unprotected.The Chandigarh Municipal Corporation has a total of 3,374 sanitation workers, including those working on a contract basis. The corporation has failed to adequately address the health hazards related to the occupation.Slamming the corporation, Kishan Kumar Chadha, president of Akhil Bharatiya Safai Majdoor Union, points out that there is no health programme for the sanitation workers. Workers have to spend from their pockets for their treatment, he said.Medical officer health (MOH) Dr P S Bhatti said a general medical camp was organised recently where medical check-up of around 500 sanitation workers was done. They would start special health camps for sanitation workers shortly.The common ailments found in sanitation workers include skin infections, respiratory problems, lung diseases, chest infections and tuberculosis (TB).Satinder Singh, MC councillor, had taken up the issue of high death rate of sanitation workers in the House meeting held on July 22, 2015. The then MC commissioner Bhawna Garg had assured the House that a study would be got done from UT social welfare department to ascertain the main causes of death of sanitation workers and the status report would be placed in the House within two months. However, nothing has happened.High death rate is a serious issue and there is a dire need to take corrective steps. Sanitation workers need medical facilities the most. Dispensaries under the control of municipal corporation should conduct regular medical check-up of sanitation workers quarterly and the sanitary inspector should also ask the workers to obtain certificates from the dispensaries for their medical check-up.According to the standards of safety, workers should be wearing uniforms, rubber gloves and masks while performing their duty. Contrary to the norms, the workers are seen performing their duty without safety gear.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Urban Development, in its report which was tabled in Rajya Sabha on May 2, had observed that the workers were not provided any safety kits like gloves and masks while handling the waste for collecting or processing at landfill site. It has strongly advocated that the safety kits like gloves, masks etc should be compulsorily provided to the workers.However, Joint Commissioner Rajiv Gupta asserts that the workers have been provided all the safety gear, but they dont wear it as they feel uncomfortable in them. For their health, the civic body provides each sanitation worker six soap bars, 2 kg jaggery and 2 litre mustard oil per month.Surinder Bahga, a member of the sanitation committee of the Municipal Corporation, alleges that the sanitation workers deployed across the city are not provided with any safety equipment by the corporation. The corporation is putting their lives at risk by not proving them proper safety kits, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

58ff0d117be9e0420db2bf8f,Cull brings out VIP claws,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160610/jsp/nation/story_90410.jsp,2016-06-10,"Prakash Javadekar New Delhi, June 9: A war of words erupted today between two Union ministers over the environment ministry's decision to allow the selective killing of nilgai, or blue antelopes, in Bihar where the animals have been ravaging crops. The women and child development minister, Maneka Gandhi, decried the shooting of about 200 nilgai in the state over the past week, saying it reflected the environment ministry's ""lust for killing of animals"". But environment minister Prakash Javadekar said the culling which had been allowed on a request from the Bihar government was an element of ""scientific management"" of human-animal conflict. ""What has happened in Bihar is a big massacre of a protected animal,"" Maneka told television channels today. She said the environment ministry has been writing to all states asking them to name the species they want to kill, adding that they've permitted Bengal to kill elephants, Himachal Pradesh to kill monkeys, Goa to kill peacocks, and Maharashtra to kill wild boars. The claims prompted the environment ministry to deny that it had given permissions to kill elephants or peacocks and Javadekar to clarify that his ministry had merely responded to state requests. ""When farmers face difficulties because animals are destroying their crops and when states send us requests, we grant permission only for specific areas and specific periods,"" Javadekar said. A senior wildlife official said the environment ministry had not given any permission to kill deer, peacock, or elephant and that all permissions given have followed the standard operating processes laid down in India's Wildlife Protection Act of 1972. Under the law, state governments can submit proposals for culling if there are complaints about human-wildlife conflict. Maneka Gandhi ""Five states have submitted proposals,"" said S.K. Khanduri, inspector general of wildlife in the environment ministry. ""The ministry examines these proposals and allows scientific management in specific areas for a limited time. There have been complaints about wild boar, blue bull and other animals,"" Khanduri said. He said the ministry had approved proposals from Bihar, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, while the proposals from Maharashtra and Gujarat are still under examination. Scientists from the Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun, have in the past documented crop-raiding by ""overabundant"" populations of nilgai in several parts of the country. While the nilgai has been recorded in 114 protected areas in 16 states, a research paper from the WII had five years ago warned that Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand appear to be the worst-affected by their crop-raiding. The WII study had cautioned about extensive crop losses in farmlands caused by nilgai to wheat and mustard crops, not just through foraging, but also because of trampling of crops during the resting and movements of the animals. An assessment by WII research scientist N.P.S. Chauhan in 2011 had found wild boars causing significant damage to wheat, rice, sugarcane, maize, groundnut and chickpea among other crops. Chauhan had also counted 927 human casualties caused by wild pigs alone between 1990 and 2010, one-fifth of them in crop fields. The environment ministry documented 500 human deaths last year because of human-wildlife conflict."

His one inmate is used to -2 degrees Celsius, the other to 40-degree temperatures; the biggest weighs in at 2,500 kg, the smallest is lighter than 15 gm; one calls for wheelbarrow khichdi meals, the other for kheer. 176 acres, 1,500-plus creatures, 200 workers, and mercury grazing 50. If curator Khan is getting through his 29th summer at the National Zoological Park, New Delhi, it is on the strength of over 70 large coolers, 20 kg of glucose daily, some Ayurvedic medicines, and a summer diet chart.2 elephants; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for Asian elephants: 21-28 CIts 7 am and Heera Gaj (50) and Rajalakshmi (35) have woken up to a stunning sunrise, visible over the ruins of the Delhi Old Fort. Soon the sun wont seem as pleasant, but for now the two 10-ft tall elephants are taking a leisurely stroll, ears flapping, trunks swaying, through a verdant patch. Mahaut Kuliemimboro accompanies the two largest mammals at the zoo in their morning exercise. The walk, usually an hour long, has been cut to 45 minutes because of the heat.By the time they return to the elephant enclosure, a light breakfast, of 8 kg bananas, is ready. As Kuliemimboro explains, The bananas help maintain the water balance in body and protect Heera and Rajalakshmi from heat stroke. With experience, zoo officials know that keeping the stomach light is the best trick for summer.Watch Under The 40-Degree Plus Sun, Delhi Zoo Goes Into Summer ProtocolIn cooler times, the elephants are fed bucket-loads of un-ripe amla, which is rich in Vitamin C and builds immunity.Like the other zoo supplies, bananas are delivered daily by a supplier who got the contract via a tender.The food meant for the elephants. The food meant for the elephants.Around 9 am, the elephants are led for a bath, where they are hosed down with special pressure pipes. As he ensures water washes every part of their body, Kuliemimboro says, The shower is not just to keep them cool. It is to know whether they are keeping well in the heat. Are they energetic and sprightly? Or do they appear tired? The morning shower answers these questions. It also creates trust. When they are scrubbed, they love it.While Heera appears to be enjoying his bath, Rajalakshmi stands quietly under an umbrella-shaped shelter. Kuliemimboro doesnt think there is any cause for worry. The elephants, brought to the zoo 30 years back from Kanpur, have not reported any illness this year. Originally from Assam, Kuliemimboro himself has been here only a year and earns Rs 15,000 a month.To be a keeper for elephants or the big cats, one needs to be at least Class X pass and have minimum three years of skilled experience. Kuliemimboro, who also looked after elephants back home, is a permanent employee, which means his salary is indexed to the Pay Commission and he gets Central government dearness allowance. Many of the employees, like Kuliemimboro, live in staff quarters on the premises.Satisfied all is well, Kuliemimboro next leads the elephants to a big, open sand pit where Heera and Rajalakshmi roll around in the mud, to cool their thick skin that has started heating up.Heera again seems to be having the most fun. Visitors have started trickling in by now, and as they watch him, he scrubs himself and deposits sand onto his back with his trunk.In summer, the number of sand pits is increased. The dust also guards the elephants from harmful sun rays and prevents itching, says Kuliemimboro.A diet chart for the summer has been put up in a 1010 ft room located around 500 metres away. Kuliemimboro goes by it to prepare the meal for the elephants with the help of two others.Again, in concession to the weather, it is mostly khichdi these days. About 30 kg of rice is made separately and mixed with 10 kg of moong dal and mustard oil. The cooking starts at 11 am, for the khichdi to be ready before 2 pm. It is then transferred to a special wheelbarrow-like trolley, where it is kept for cooling for three hours. Only at five, after the zoo is closed for visitors, will the meal be served, says Kuliemimboro.As evening sets in, Heera and Rajalakshmi retire to a semi-conical enclosure, open on one side. There is a partition in the middle to ensure they dont fight at night. By now the weather is cool enough for them not to need any special arrangements  making them an exception for the zoo.2 adult tigers, 4 cubs; 22,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for white tigers: 20-35 COn September 24 last year, Vijay had grabbed headlines for mauling to death a 20-year-old man who had fallen into his enclosure. This summer, all efforts have been put in place to ensure that the 200-kg white tiger remains calm.Since the incident, Vijay, who was born at the zoo in 2008  in a case of mating the officials are proud of  has fathered four cubs. In the mornings, it is Kalpana and the cubs who are let out into the open space in the enclosure for public viewing. Once the temperature starts dipping by 2 pm, Vijay comes out. Care is taken to ensure that the cubs do not make any contact with the father.Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera. Vijay gets a morning bath in his special enclosure, which is the only one monitored with a CCTV camera.Says caretaker Yameen, Vijay can get aggressive in summer. This is to ensure that the four cubs do not get intimidated by him.His enclosure, with 20-ft high walls on three sides, is the only one in the zoo to be monitored with a CCTV camera. Besides, a private guard has been delegated at the spot from where the public views him.Four desert coolers operate round the clock in the area where he rests. On hotter days, Vijay can wade into a V-shaped artificial pond with a cement boundary. Water mixed with glucose is fed into the pool, where the tiger also drinks from, to keep him hydrated.Kalpana and the cubs stay in separate steel cages, each one with a cooler. While the female cubs are called Meeta, Neeta, Rita, the male bears a more majestic name, Tipu.Fateh Singh, 55, has been taking care of the tigers for 30 years. He says it is a skilled job, requiring special training, and that there are risks. However, working with the tigers doesnt get him any extra perks. Yameen, 27, joined Fateh recently as there are two enclosures to look after.Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures. Yameen after dropping food into the cage as Kalpana walks in. Her cubs with Vijay are in separate enclosures.At 12.30 pm, the tigers are served their only meal of the day. Ten kilogrammes of buffalo meat is divided and kept in each of their enclosures  2 kg less in summers than the rest of the year. I have to leave for namaz by 1.30 pm, Yameen says, adding that apart from lesser red meat, they also add white meat to the tiger meal in summers.The meat is delivered to the zoo by suppliers by 8 am everyday. At the meat house on the premises, it is segregated for different enclosures. It is then weighed and transferred into plastic buckets for transporting.P C Ray, who has been working with the zoo for 20 years, transporting the meat to the enclosures.

After some minutes, they sit down, only their necks visible above the water.Glucose again comes in handy. When the four come inside with their mother, we first give them glucose-mixed water in stone bowls. It is only after this that they are served the meal. They munch the meat for over four hours, Yameen says.Friday, when the zoo is shut, is one day of the week when the animals arent fed red meat.Vijay in a pond with glucose water.

However, its too hot for that law of nature to work.So, like the tigers, six-year-old Salman, who was born at the zoo, is also given glucose. Plus, its food has been rationed to 5 kg of buffalo meat daily, from 7-8 kg at other times.Apart from a cooler, a special green shade blocks the sun and provides Salman respite from the heat, while also giving the animal that is known to be very shy a feel of wilderness. Such special arrangements have also been made for jackals and hyenas  two other creatures of the night.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.The shade keeps out 75 per cent of the sun rays. You will never find a leopard in the desert, which has no green cover. This green shade helps it feel at home even during the dry summers in Delhi, says Balle Ram, who has been guarding this enclosure for over two decades.The 50-year-old is a father of two, both of whom work as daily wagers, and says he wont be happy to retire. Pointing out that he has seen at least a dozen leopards come and go, he remarks, Sirf mausam badla hai, aur kuchch nahin (Only the weather has changed, nothing else).1 sloth bear and 6 Himalayan Black Bears: 20,000 sq m areaIdeal temperature for sloth bears: 20-30 C; for Himalayan bears: -2 to 18 CHere is a wild one getting special attention these days since a fellow sloth bear, all of 6, escaped the Hyderabad Zoo a month ago. It was reportedly disturbed due to the extreme heat.Riaz Khan says they cant take things lightly with their own sloth bear now.Known to be a reclusive animal, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear lives in an enclosure where two coolers work round-the-clock. But with its thick black fur still making the Capital heat almost unbearable, their diet has to be more closely monitored than that of others.A special addition is bael, the Indian fruit known as wood apple, offered at regular intervals. The wood apple controls excessive thirst. It also has medicinal value. Outdoor cooling can contribute only a little to maintaining the heat balance of the animal. It is only through diet that one can solve the problem of heat stroke, says Khan.Apart from bael, the bear is fed cucumbers, water melons, melons, cheeku and beetroot (around 2.5 kg of food in all daily). In winter, this is changed to a lot of sweet potato and singhara.While bears are omnivores, the Delhi Zoo sloth bear is by now a vegetarian. However, notes Khan, it is given kheer, prepared in the pantry, and eggs.Not in summer though. The bread and milk content is being reduced. We have also stopped giving eggs, especially when the temperature is very high, Khan says.Apart from the tigers, Fateh Singh also takes care of the bear enclosure.The enclosure for the Himalayan Black Bears, which have a similar diet, is nearby. It has four females, but the authorities havent been able to shift the two males in. Brought from Himachal Pradesh in March for breeding, they are still in a temperature-controlled room at the zoos veterinary hospital, slowly adapting to the climate.During their first two weeks here, sources say, the Black Bears were kept at zero-degree temperature. The bears were then shifted to a cool temperature, maintained by desert coolers. Currently, they are in a room with fans. We are slowly making them adapt to Delhis climate. They are responding well and should be out by the end of August. The females (who have been in the zoo for five years) will not get to see their male counterparts this summer, a source laughed.100 antelopes; 62,500 sq m areaIdeal temperature for deer: 25-30 CIn a first for the Delhi Zoo, the deer enclosure now has a 360-degree sprinkler. It is meant for the zoos most vulnerable species, the black buck, also known as the Indian antelope.Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays. Leopard Salman has a cooler plus a special green shade to block out sun rays.Black bucks usually inhabit grassy plains and slightly forested areas. So this summer a hundred new plants were planned well in advance to make the enclosure greener.Due to their vulnerability, the special sprinklers are run once every two hours till the sun sets. So the enclosure is always moist and cool. After the installation, we have not received a single complaint from this enclosure during the summers, Khan says.The deer are fed green vegetables, bengal gram, wheat, maize and oats during the summer.Despite the special arrangement, it is here that the officials have had their biggest scare this time. In the last three months, 16 spotted deer have died due to suspected rabies. The enclosure is now out of bounds, with over 30 employees who work with them also undergoing a rabies vaccination programme.30 bird species; 8 cagesIdeal temperature for the birds: 20-30 CBefore the summer arrived, the bird enclave was given a complete makeover. This year the zoo has special glasshouses with agro net green shade. Besides, pipelines have been laid throughout to ensure that the water being delivered to the cages has glucose in it.Home to exotic birds with glorious plumes, Delhi Zoo knows this is one of the favourite areas for its visitors, especially children. From the macaw, known to be extremely intelligent and curious as well as friendly, to the critically endangered Blue Edward Pheasant, Khan says, they cant be too carefully with the diet of the birds.For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose. For birds, special glasshouses, water pipelines delivering glucose.The Illigers Macaw, endangered in the wild due to deforestation, feeds usually on seeds, fruits and nuts. During the summer, special apples and water melons are provided to keep them cool.For the Golden Pheasant, who usually live in small groups and are a hit as they prefer to run rather than fly, the diet is green vegetable salad, bread, chana sattu and gauva.The macaw has been provided a special wooden area near the water to give it a feel of its natural habitat. This is to ensure that they keep coming to drink water, Khan says.The curator says there is another reason he and his staff at the bird enclosure are excited this summer. The zoo is expecting eggs of at least 24 exotic birds to hatch soon. The arrival of these chicks is being monitored closely at the hospital. The Silver and Golden Pheasant have laid over a dozen eggs each, with an incubation period of 20 days.We must monitor the temperature as well as humidity levels, smiles Khan.200 employeesOver 50 of them work in the animal section, which is the lifeline of the zoo. They take care of the feed and wellbeing of the animals.Close behind is the security section, including over 20 employees, who keep in touch over wireless as they guard the different enclosures. A supervisor heads the team and monitors the CCTV cameras.The garden section has over 20 employees, responsible for greenery at the zoo. They also maintain the small vermin compost unit to meet the zoos manure requirements.It is the garden section which has the oldest employee at the zoo. Mahender Mali, who is over 60 years of age, has been keeping this part of the Capital green for years. For me, zoo is home, says Mahender. I will be retiring soon, but I wish to continue contributing.Around 4 pm, as the visitors hasten to catch their last glimpse of the animals before the zoo shuts its gates, Riaz Khan steps out of the office for his last round of checking. Over the next 30 minutes, he enquires about animals in 12 enclosures.By 6 pm, before heading home, the staff has kept food in enclosures for the nocturnal animals, including foxes and hyenas.On the eastern side, some soaked grams, fruits and vegetables have been left out in a bowl.Before long, a porcupine emerges. As the zoo quietens, it is the hour of its largest rodent to feed.Colombo to HamburgIndira Gandhi was part of an ad-hoc committee of some prominent nature lovers of Delhi, headed by the chief commissioner, which got down to giving Delhi a zoo in 1952.Major Weinmann, Director of the Ceylon Zoological Garden, Colombo, was invited to help draw up a coordinated plan for development of the park. He submitted a report along with a preliminary plan. As he was not available for continued consultations, the committee approached Carl Hagenbeck, owner of the famous Animal Park at Hamburg, West Germany, who gave the idea of the open moat enclosures. He presented a preliminary report in March 1956 and provided a general layout plan of waterways, roads and paths, animal enclosures and sewage system.The Government of India approved the final plan on December 31, 1956.Even while the final touches were being given to the zoo, state government and individuals started gifting animals. The animals, including tigers, leopards, bears, foxes, deer and birds, were initially kept in temporary enclosures around Azimganj Sarai, a courtyard built for travellers during the Mughal days.The park was formally inaugurated on November 1, 1959."
58fedcd97be9e0420db28a1f,Cattle cost high along Border,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160614/jsp/northeast/story_91029.jsp,2016-06-14,"Shillong, June 13: Heads of cattle from India are selling at a high price in neighbouring Bangladesh as smugglers continue their attempts to push cattle through the international border. According to inputs from the BSF (Meghalaya frontier), a calf fetches around Rs 5,000 to Rs 8,000 in India, but costs around Taka 20,000 to Taka 40,000 in Bangladesh. One Indian rupee is 1.18 Bangladeshi taka. Revealing the modus operandi of smugglers, a BSF official said the cattle are fed a mixture of mustard oil and salt which, the smugglers believe, makes them less likely to moo while crossing the border. He said the BSF had seized 46 heads of cattle from different parts of Meghalaya while smugglers were attempting to push them across the border. Acting on a tip-off, the BSF today seized 36 heads of cattle from Gopinathkilla in South West Garo Hills, the official said. Another 10 heads of cattle were seized from Lyngkhat and Balughat in East Khasi Hills. They were worth around Rs 4 lakh, the official added. ""The special ambush party of the BSF laid a trap while some smugglers along with heads of cattle were proceeding towards Bangladesh,"" the official said. However, the smugglers managed to escape. On the 36 heads of cattle, the official said those were purchased from Ampati by three suspected smugglers -Nandan Kaji, Nudu Miya and Reyazul Kaji. The trio hailed from neighbouring Mahendraganj and the heads of cattle were kept at Gujangpara village. ""They brought the cattle in a truck and were heading towards Gopinathkilla border for handing over the cattle to a Bangladeshi smuggler who has been identified as Anman Miya, a resident of Babula Kona village under Sherpur district of Bangladesh,"" the official stated. He added that apart from constructing border roads and putting up floodlights along the border, the BSF has also increased frequency of surveillance. Rebels held: Four NDFB (Songbijit) rebels, including two women, were arrested from three different locations in Kokrajhar and Chirang districts today, reports our Kokrajhar correspondent."

Well, Uthly is born. Having managed to twist every cuisine to suit the Indian palate, we have Indianised noodles, pasta and sushi too. Taking this a step further, the city has opened doors to fusion food, the final product of which is a mix of flavours, texture and aromas. The idea is to bring together two or more cuisines to get a funky yet appetising dish. So, pull together ingredients from across the globe and create a unique recipe that suits your taste buds.Chef Shailendra Kekade, from a Balewadi-based restaurant, knows his food and how. His latest experiment is the Thai Bombay duck fry. Ask him what made him introduce this and he says, ""A Bombay duck fry is a favourite but not everyone gets it right. The rawa preparation needs perfection to attain the bang-on taste. So, I decided to twist the recipe to get a more tempting outcome.""Bombay duck fried in chilli and Thai spices marinade deep fried in a tempura batter. The dish brings out the flavour of Bombay duck like never before.Are you bored of eating the same old burgers? So, here's a twist. Chef Manu Nair, from a Kondhwa-based restaurant, shares, ""With the introduction of Uthly we hope to get young consumers intrigued about the cuisine. Uthly is an innovative healthy alternative to a burger made from healthy South Indian ingredients.""A lip-smacking combination of seven layers of authentic South Indian goodies, right from toasted rice cake on the base, topped with crispy lettuce, garden fresh salad, Malabar croquettes, special sauce, podi-coated lentil cakes and finally covered with a toasted rice cake on top.A vada pav needs no introduction. It is always a hot favourite for a quick bite or snack option. Making this dish yummier is its meaty variant. Shailendra says, ""The meat instead of potato adds tadka to the all-time favourite vada pav.""A chicken patty marinated in mustard seeds, ginger, garlic, lemon juice, coriander and curry leaves. It is deep fried in besan and served with pav, like the original.Two years ago when Pankaj Gomase, from Kharadi, was relishing two of his favourite foods, the idea of Modak Chaat came up. Pankaj says, ""I love modaks and chaats. When I was relishing these, I thought of combining them. This is how modak chaat was born. It is a healthy anytime snack."" He also sells ragi gola and Pandarpur ragda pav.

He says, ""We wanted to create a new taste and serve a different recipe to our guests. It is difficult to acquire a new taste, however when you mix two yummy connotations (read paneer makhni and noodles) you are bound to get a winner.""Creamy, rich and tangy, paneer makhani gravy tossed together in a wok with noodles. The bland noodles get a lift in taste and aroma with the makhni gravy. You can experiment a little more by adding dollops of butter or fresh cream.Nothing can go wrong with tandoori chicken. A favourite among everyone the, dish gets a twist when combined with dimsums. Chef Vishwesh Khanna, from Pimpri, shares, ""The USP of a tandoori dimsum is the texture and flavour. The meat is cooked just right and the soft, slightly roasted covering adds to this flavour.""Tandoori dimsums are stuffed with shredded bits of tandoori chicken. The brownish tinge on the covering adds to the flavour. The strong flavours tickle your palate and the soft cover of the dumpling melts in your mouth. It is a perfect combination of spices."
58fed89d7be9e0420db28319,So near and yet so far,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160617/jsp/opinion/story_91586.jsp,2016-06-17,"ALL OF US IN OUR OWN LIVES By Manjushree Thapa, Aleph, Rs 499 In distant Canada, Ava feels a thread of longing for the ""jagged world"" that she was born in. Far away from her, in the deserts of Sharjah, the smell of fenugreek, mustard and chives evokes in Gyanu memories of the ""hard rock and soil of his childhood"". In another part of the world, while walking on a sidewalk in Paris, Indira thinks, ""The developed world was the developed world, and Nepal was Nepal."" In many ways the Nepal of Manjushree Thapa's All of Us in Our Own Lives is like Egdon Heath, it holds the characters of the novel captive. Ava, who was adopted from an orphanage in Nepal at a young age and taken away to a plush life in Canada, comes back to assuage her guilt for having survived Nepal. Others like Gyanu and Indira, whose lives have been shaped by the poverty and the parochial customs in Nepal, cannot wait to get out, it is their cross and their shame. In her 1976 travelogue, Dervla Murphy describes Nepal as a country that has emerged from centuries of isolation and is baffled about how to be a part of the modern world. It is to this Nepal, caught between tradition and modernity, that Ava comes back. She joins the International Development Assistance Forum to help the women in the land of her birth, but Ava is far removed from the ground realities in Nepal. Armed only with idealism and cold statistics - the novel is full of them, making parts of it sound like reportage - like the fact that more than 10,000 Nepalese girls are trafficked annually, Ava is out of her depth. In a culture that remains defiantly patriarchal, the problems ailing women are manifold. Women are born with the knowledge that they are not as good as the menfolk. Not only do they lag behind men in every respect, but they are also denied equal citizenship and the statute of limitations on rape is three months. Further, there are more than a hundred identity groups with their own unique difficulties. Indira, a liberated Nepalese woman and deputy co-director of an NGO, too, had been an idealist. Indira recalls how, on her first field trip, she had cried on seeing flies on the mouth of a malnourished child and had vowed to dedicate her life to helping the poor. Blinded by her ambition to become the director, she now shudders at the thought of going on a field trip. It is, however, hard to hold this against her as her ambition is the result of years of discrimination against and disregard for her hard work simply because she is a woman. Thapa uses Ava's naivet and Indira's cynicism to expose the latent hypocrisies in the world of international aid. Massive amounts of money are funnelled in by international agencies, a part of which leaks out at each level - and there are several - until almost nothing is left for the intended beneficiaries. Sitting in their ""hermetically sealed"" offices, with little besides a map of Nepal to indicate where it is situated, the self-serving aid workers care little about the dreams and aspirations of young Sapna, Gyanu's sister, from the small village of Butwal. Sapna and her friends act as the chorus, voicing the aspirations of the ordinary women of Nepal. Where Sapna dreams of starting a cooperative with the women's committee of her village, her friend, Chandra, dreams of a revolution and reads books on ""progress and materialism"" and ""historical necessity"", while another friend, Ritu, wants to marry a handsome, rich man so that she can leave her parents' home. Thapa weaves an evocative tale of loss - not only personal loss but also a loss of identity - and of ways in which connections forged with strangers can help one grow roots. Ava's returns to Nepal with memories of her ""total rejection"" of it when she had visited as a teenager, in search of her identity. This search in a foreign land, which, ironically, is her homeland, sets her of on a path of self-discovery. It is also a tale of yearning - for a sense of belonging, for comfort and also for freedom from the rugged land that holds the characters behind. Ava's personal struggle to belong in this complex society - Thapa claims to have been inspired by Life and Times of Michael K in this - is used as the lens through which the turmoil in one of the poorest countries in the world is portrayed. A country that waited for years for its Constitution, not knowing what kind of a country it would ultimately become. The reader discovers, along with Ava, a country whose natural ethos seems to be one of brooding and waiting for the ""Big One"" to strike. Scenic descriptions of this rough country are few and far between. Yet, Thapa cleverly manages to establish the deceptive quality of the picture of abundance that the greenness and fecundity of the terraced hills present. Also as a stark contrast to this ""beautiful, exotic, alien"" Nepal of the guidebooks, she portrays the ""dinge, the sprawl"" of Kathmandu, a ""concrete maze hemmed in by hills"". Like the mountains that forever loom on the horizon, the novel, at first, seems to be covered in fog. No sooner does one begin to grasp a subject, than it disappears. However, as the novel progresses, the fog lifts and the disparate pieces fall into place to show a people whose lives are shaped by an unstable polity and geography. If one looks closely, there is also an understated, but formidable, presence that controls the lives of the people in this land-locked state: India. With an open border that cannot be crossed and beyond that border a country that seems just like home, it is that place where all Nepalese men are addressed as ""Bahadur"". At times Thapa, writing from the solitude of Canada, seems as distant from Nepal as Ava initially is. Still, her passion for Nepal and the condition of its people, too, comes out plainly in her prose. Besides the feeling of homesickness that pervades the novel, one can also sense Thapa's desire to step out of the role of the privileged foreigner and fit into the community. The turbulent political situation is an intrinsic part of the lives of the ordinary Nepalese. Thapa's skill lies in the ease with which she makes every small, seemingly insignificant, statement made by these ordinary people count. (""Women are always crying in this land,"" says one taxi driver, ""everything that's gone wrong with our nation... is because of our political parties,"" says another.) Thapa should, perhaps, have left the 2015 earthquake out of the novel. She had finished writing before the earthquake struck and incorporated it into the plot later as she felt that it exposed the ""vulnerability, and... casualness with which life is devalued in Nepal"". But she hardly delves into the extent of the devastation caused by the earthquake, defeating the purpose with which she introduced it."

58f72740a3d24b0b70c327b7,“I want to make mainstream movies but not by losing myself in the process”,http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/%E2%80%9CI-want-to-make-mainstream-movies-but-not-by-losing-myself-in-the-process%E2%80%9D/article14395252.ece,2016-06-22,"It is arguable if Udta Punjab is Abhishek Chaubeys best work but it is certainly on its way to become his most widely watched film. During its month-long battle with the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), the film became the face of freedom of expression. The star-studded drug-drama set in Punjab, that released last week, has benefited from the controversy, agrees Chaubey. But he is ready to trade it with the nightmarish experience he had to go through to release his film without multiple cuts. When we met the 39-year-old filmmaker in a relaxed mood in his airy Versova apartment post-release, he opened up about various aspects of Udta Punjab, why it needed to be an anti-drug public service announcement (PSA), his penchant for mashing up genres and why love is crucial for rehabilitation.You have said that the idea initially was to make a drug-film set across India. But you chose to set it in Punjab because on account of being close to the border it is the most affected. Did that change the initial idea in some way?From the beginning, Sudip Sharma (screenwriter) and I were conscious about the fact that this in a sense was going to be the first Hindi movie exclusively about out and out drug abuse. We went to the Majha region of Punjab which is worst affected. We met a cross section of people. From health care professionals, law enforcement officers, super rich kids in rehabs, addicts in rural areas, including some very young kids. And some of them were harrowing experiences. That really changed our agenda for the film. Until then, we were feeling very cool about the fact that we were making the first of its kind drug movie in India, that we are doing something edgy, dark and trippy.Visiting Punjab changed those ideas because after seeing the reality there, we felt a sense of responsibility. To spout a clich and at the cost of coming across as sentimental, we realised that this is bigger than us. I mean, its okay if a world cinema buff sitting in Delhi or Mumbai rejects the film but when those kids in Ludhiana watch it they should be able to relate to it. Otherwise the purpose is lost. Hence, the Public Service Announcement [elements] in the film. I have read people saying that and I understand where thats coming from. If I was watching the film, Id be like, Dude, I know what drugs can do, you dont need to say it in so many words.Is that why the film is so overtly anti-drugs?Yes, especially anti-heroin and anti-opiate. Its not so much anti-cocaine if you notice. Its a party drug that rich kids do it, many great directors like Martin Scorsese, Oliver Stone have experimented with cocaine, have binged and come out of it. Many Bollywood stars have done the same. Coke is not a big deal. Marijuana doesnt even qualify. The name of Alias character as Mary Jane, a brilliant idea by Sudip, in fact is an allusion to marijuana. I mean any drug is bad per se but doing drugs is a matter of choice if you are 18 and above. But when it becomes a sociological problem, when somebody like Alias character or Balli (Diljit Dosanjhs brother in the film) doesnt have a choice in the matter, then you have to take a stand. And you have to go out there and do this. Hence, the film is so viciously anti-drug. There is a lot of MDMA and coke abuse in Lokhandwala, Andheri. But thats not breakdown of society, thats just people partying. Thats excess, debauched or decadent. But what is happening in Punjab demanded this of the film.We lost out on the respect of a certain kind of people, but I know that it has worked with the average youngster in Punjab. Thats also the reason why so much of the film is in Punjabi because there was no other way of doing it. I know that when those kids in Punjab hear  Nasha kalla banda karta hai and uspe poori family pe asar haunda hai they are going to get goosebumps. I know that because I met these people. Hence it was important that social agenda took over filmmaking agenda. If I was making a second or third film, I could have a lateral view on drugs. Here I am making the first drug film in Bollywood. So I am really trying to create the space and I have that responsibility. Now people will come and break this space and make a more evolved drug movie.Steven Soderberghs Traffic is considered a textbook for multi-track narrative. Was that a reference?Its silly for a filmmaker to make a drug film with multi-track narrative and not acknowledge Traffic. The reason why we went for a multi track narrative is not to ape Traffic. In fact we were worried about the fact that it may seem derivative. It really came from our experiences in Punjab. We had to look from two perspectives: the systemic and the individual. There is the cop and doctor in Sartaj and Preet. Drug addiction cuts across all social classes in Punjab. So in Tommy you have the wealthy, upper class drug addict, Balli is the lower middle class, Mary Jane is below poverty line.Despite the PSA-like theme, the film has a whimsical, mash-up quality: there are shades of dark comedy, narco-thriller, light romance, stoner caper. Thats true with all your films. In a previous interview, you have also expressed your dislike for the Wests obsession with tonal consistency.Tonal consistency is overrated. Even the foreign films I like take wild risks with tone. I can think of the Korean film Oldboy. It becomes a love story, almost operatic action film but it has a very dark emotional core. And there is humour in the middle; in fact the opening of the film is a joke. Martin Scorsese does that all the time when he does gangsters films with a lot of dark humour. Quentin Tarantino too. Even Bollywood does that. Vijay Anand is such a cool, sexy filmmaker. I like taking those risks. Sometimes I just cant help it. I have a weakness for it. For instance, when Tommy and the two junkies go into the hospital, I told the two guys to start imitating Tommys limping. Suddenly all three of them are limping their way into the hospital. If there is a space available while Sudip and I are writing we cant resist a joke or two. Just because Im doing an issue based film I need not  not be fun, sensuous and entertaining. I hope it comes from not taking oneself and the film too seriously. Or maybe taking it too seriously.You also seem to be quite musical. All the protagonists of your films have something to do with music: Krishna in Ishqiya, Begum Para in Dedh Ishqiya and Tommy in Udta Punjab. A crucial moment in the latter comes when Tommy rather unexpectedly starts singing in the hospital.It is tricky to have songs in films. When I started out I was very hard nosed about it. I mean I came to Mumbai from Delhi after working with Film Societies and watching movies in French and German centres. I would be like, why should films have songs and all that? What is all this crap? But you come and have to adjust to a new environment and you have to be mature about it. You have to look at how you can create your own space here. While its not a must but music is a very important part of our films.I have worked with Vishal Bhardwaj for a decade. And he, before anything else is a musician. Music is a foregone conclusion in his films. I mean, even Talvarhas songs. Keeping all those things in mind I have been honing my skills in using songs in films. I have no plans of being an obscure filmmaker; I want to go out and do it in the mainstream and connect with people. But not by losing myself in the process. Maybe one day if I make a courtroom drama I will not use music. I still find it uncomfortable to break into song and dance. So it helps if one of your characters is connected to music because it gives you the excuse to do that. Before a filmmaker I am a film buff, and I like a cross section of films genres and styles. But films that I really get emotional about and care are ones that use music in a certain way. The directors I admire and really enjoy like the Coen Brothers, Scorsese and Tarantino also use music very well.Whats with the trope of ending your movies  all three, Ishqiya, Dedh Ishqiya and now Udta Punjab  with a shootout?I dont know. Its a subconscious pattern I suppose. Of the films I wrote, Blue Umbrella and Omkara didnt have it, but Kaminey did. I think its because of the kind of structure of my films. All these films have one thing in common: they have multiple characters. While there are protagonists, the others story arcs also need a closure. That pre-climactic shootout is the only way I know I know to do it I guess.Why did it have to be love as a motivation for the reform of the characters of Udta Punjab?Firstly, if you look carefully at the angle between Tommy and Mary Jane, its not so much romantic love. He is amazed by her. Here is a guy who is extremely wealthy and successful who because of abuse has lost his muse and his bearings. He is talking about it to this girl saying things like, Life is over, party khatam, go home and all that when the girl turns around and says, What are you talking about? This is what has happened with me.Its not that he changes in that very moment. But he gets a window after meeting this person who talks about the immense hope that she has amidst all the darkness in her life. And his own story isnt a patch on her. A lightbulb pops into his head. He is blown by her. He goes to find her because that will in a sense, bring him redemption.That is the story. Just because its Alia and Shahid we tend to make it two plus two plus two that its a romantic story. When she kisses him, she isnt saying, I am in love with you. Its a violent peck on the mouth and she doesnt really enjoy it. Maybe they will fall in love after he comes out of jail but I am not interested in going there. I think too much has been made out of that in the response to the film.Secondly, it is the absolute truth that when abuse takes over you, de-addiction is one thing but the real solution  complete rehabilitation  is a process of human connection and love. What we are witnessing in societies in the form of tremendous amount of drug abuse is a symptom of a society breaking down rather than the cause of the societys breakdown. There is too much isolation. Whether you want to look at Spanish Harlem, Manipur or Kashmir what is common is that there is a social dystopia going on in all these places. There is social apathy and lack of human relationships. Therefore, it is important that a film that is highly dramatised and commercial and has Shahid Kapur in it, achieves the bigger point in this fashion. Through both these characters finding each other, the film also says that the individual battle against drugs can be won if there is human connection and love around you.As far as the system is concerned I genuinely dont think its a winnable battle. Nobody in the world has won the war against drugs. Nobody, its not possible.The opening sequence is quite something, when we see a Pakistani pehelwan discuss throwing a packet of heroin from across the border. How did it come about?Yes, the opening is quite energetic. It came out of research. There are two fundamental ways  I am sure there are underground ways also  of how heroin is smuggled across the border. One, they use really long PVC pipes, stuff maal and push it with a stick and there is something to pull it from the other side. The second one is our scene when you have small quantities to supply. I was blown when I heard about this. I was like, Yaar, this is fascinating. A guy throws it and someone else really catches it. Its a real thing! The Pakistan jersey is of course stretched. And about the discus-throwing bit, if you think about it, an ordinary person cant throw 1.5 kilos through that distance. And the pehelwans, who they call from akharas, are athletic. They arent criminals; they do it for some money.Most people have agreed that this is the most different portrayal of Punjab in mainstream Hindi cinema which has mostly treated the region like a fabled land of stereotypes.It was a by-product of the fact that we chose to set it in Punjab . Our main focus was never to break the image of Punjab as portrayed in pop culture. But of course, there was a surprise that yes, this is how real Punjab looks and feels like. What Bollywood has shown isnt entirely untrue. They have heightened it of course but people are also very zinda dil, warm and robust, khet hai hare bhare all of that is true. The mustard fields are there. We dont see so many pink dupattas running across those fields, there are broken syringes found there too. It became such a thing because a lot of Bollywood filmmakers hailing from Punjab, from both sides of the border came to Bombay post-partition. They had a sense of nostalgia about their land, like how NRIs think of India. Then the subsequent generations just took it up and thought this is how it is.Punjab has got a lot of unusually beautiful things too, which was beautifully captured in Anhe Ghode Da Daan. Its a wonderfully shot film and effective too. I kind of like that film. It was a visual reference point for me in Udta. It showed the other side of Punjab very artistically, that something mainstream audience wont enjoy. So although we were setting out to make what we thought is an exciting and entertaining film, it was important that we had the element of social realism. We have seen people like Mani Ratnam, Vishal Bhardwaj and Dibakar Banerjee do that very well in mainstream Hindi cinema. I mean if its a village in Punjab shoot in a village in Punjab, no? Whats the big deal about it? Why cant you make a film thats entertaining, engrossing and enjoyable that has people wearing what they really wear? Why do costumes have to be starched and colourful and the walls pink, blue, yellow or green?You offered to remove the shot of Tommy urinating on the audience, which is the only cut in the film. The line Powder ki Line o Ka Rakhega Kaun Hisaab from the song Ud Da Punjab was changed in the promo although it was an innuendo for cocaine. Why?Every nano-second of my film is important for me. However there was a feeling during the legal proceedings that there mustn't be anything gratuitous in the film because if there is, we would lose the right to defend things that weren't gratuitous and absolutely essential to the story. This was the one thing that the bench in the honourable High Court mentioned that could be perceived in the wrong light by the viewers. Hence we chose to voluntarily remove it.As for the song, it was a mutual call by everybody, including the producers because the same promo was going to be aired on TV and watched by children. But the line is intact in the album."

""Our team had details on various aspects of what we feel is a scientific fraud in the form of DMH-11 developed by Deepak Pental. Since we could not have even summarized our presentations in 20 minutes, we decided to opt out of the meeting,"" she said.Kuruganti feels that GEAC's behaviour is indicative of the non-participatory approach and biased attitude of GEAC. ""The committee knew that we had new evidence to challenge the claims of the DMH-11 developer and hence played this 'time game'. GEAC members don't have the courage to confront reality. This is the fourth time they have avoided us after calling us,"" Kuruganti said.Sharad E Pawar, former BARC scientist from Nagpur, who was involved in developing one of the parents used by Pental in creating the new hybrid, was also going to present new data and information. He told TOI that he had never felt so humiliated. ""When I told the GEAC that we knew what was wrong with DMH-11, the senior most committee member shouted back that we knew nothing. I have never faced such arrogance as a scientist,"" he said.Kapil Shah, secretary of Organic Farmers Association of India and pioneer of safe food campaign from Vadodra, is calling it a big shame for GEAC. ""If science in India is promoted in the most unscientific way, with unscientific data,it raises questions on the credibility of GEAC, which has gone to seed,"" he said.Interestingly, it is not just the scientists and activists who have such opinion about GEAC. Pushpa Bhargava, a Supreme Court nominee in GEAC, too was equally disappointed by the GEAC dealings. He told TOI a group in favour of DHM-11 headed by Chengal Reddy, a farmer, was given a patient 30-minute hearing. ""The committee knew that the other data would go against the claims made by Pental,"" he said.GEAC chairperson Amita Prasad declined to talk to TOI out of office hours."

Then we won the World Cup and suddenly everyone was an awesome leader.""In all honesty, it's all been said before.""Now his team must deliver.ryj/mw"

58fef3707be9e0420db29e74,Brewery boon: gene to tweak yeast behaviour,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160627/jsp/nation/story_93468.jsp,2016-06-27,"New Delhi, June 26: Scientists here have identified a plant gene that they say could be used to change the behaviour of yeast and increase ethanol production, a potential gift to industrial breweries worldwide. The scientists at the National Institute of Plant Genome Research (NIPGR) have shown that the gene from a mustard family weed when inserted into yeast boosts a process called flocculation used by breweries and wine-making industries. ""The genetically-engineered yeast cells can increase ethanol production up to four times the amount available from natural yeast,"" said Jitendra Thakur, a staff scientist at the NIPGR who led the research described as the first to use a plant gene to alter the properties of yeast. People have used yeast for centuries to process food and alcoholic beverages. It is the world's most industrially-exploited organism, primarily used as a tool for fermentation. But once the fermentation process is complete, the yeast cells need to be removed from the ethanol-containing broth. Breweries usually rely on flocculation - a property of yeast cells to tightly cluster into clumps - to remove yeast from the suspension. ""Yeast makes the suspension look translucent or milky and leads to a sweet, off-flavour taste. So it is important to remove the yeast to obtain clear ethanol,"" Thakur said. Conventional techniques of removing yeast depend on filters, chemical-induced flocculation, or centrifugation in which the solution is rotated at high speeds to push the yeast cells to form pellets. Some breweries also use yeast genetically engineered to raise the activity of genes that drive flocculation process. ""But these processes are time-consuming, expensive, or reduce ethanol output,"" said Thakur. Thakur and his colleagues P. Dahiya and D. Bhat who worked with laborabory yeast strains have shown that the gene called AtMed15 acts on multiple yeast genes that drive flocculation - leading to robust flocculation and an increase in ethanol production. Their findings have been published in the journal Scientific Reports. The early or premature flocculation of yeast cells hampers complete fermentation and results in loss of some key flavours of beverages. ""The use of the AtMed15 gene will not only yield more ethanol, it will also preserve some flavours lost when ethanol is made through conventional techniques,"" Thakur said. The NIPGR feat has impressed other scientists, but some point out that the technology has yet to be demonstrated on industrial strains of yeast. ""This appears promising, but the next step would be to establish the economics of applying this technique at the industrial scale,"" said Neel Sarovar Bhavesh, a group leader at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, New Delhi, who was not associated with the project."

The Church pastor and its members failed to convince him to shift, as the serenity of the place was disturbed. They we-nt on a one-week all-night prayer service seeking God's intervention. A week later, a terrible lightning struck down the pub.The atheist pub-owner sued the Church, holding their pra-yers responsible for the loss. When the church argued they were not responsible, the Jud-ge declared, ""This is the stran-gest case I have ever seen. An atheist believes in answered pr-ayers and a whole church congregation takes no responsibility for their prayers.""The real test of our faith is not to be surprised that our pr-ayers get answered but to be sure of the things we pray for. Faith defined in the letter to the Hebrews is ""confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see"" (Hebrews 11:1). Prayers are not a trial of the power of God, but a deep conviction that what is humanly impossible becomes possible with God. If we have even an iota of doubt over our prayers, they surely won't be answered.A village suffered severe dr-ought. People gathered in the church campus to pray for ra-in. The priest upbraided them, ""We have all come here to pray for rain. I see all of you with pr-ayer books and hymnals, but only one little boy with an umbrella here.""Jesus said, ""If you have faith as tiny as a mustard seed you can move mountains"" (Mathew 17:20). The analogy finds great meaning. Though it is one of the smallest seeds, the trees can grow up to 20 feet tall and 20 feet wide and can grow in arid, dry climates and thrive even in clay or sandy soil. It can grow in hot, dry weather or cool, wet climates. Even if it is cut down to the trunk, it can grow back again.The mustard seed is symbolic of our faith through life's ma-ny seasons of failure and success, joys and sorrows, pain and pleasure, poverty and prosperity, loneliness and companionship, betrayals and loyalties, brimming life and impending death.If a mustard seed can grow through thick and thin, our strong mustard-seed-faith can see us through life's mountains and valleys."

In a traditional kitchen, the answer would be a definite yes.Probably, when the rainfall lashed Goa far more mercilessly, making it difficult for our ancestors to travel too far for their food ingredients, they came up with ingenious dishes that could be prepared by simply sourcing raw material from the monsoon vegetation in their garden.Taukullo is one such vegetation whose use remains well-known even today, simply because it grows on any available patch of earth that rain can hit. Some mustard seeds and asafoetida are added to heated oil and then the finely chopped tender leaves of taukullo are cooked with water and a dash of jaggery and salt. Some grated coconut to garnish the dish and one could save a trip to the nearest market to fetch vegetables for the day.Also commonly found during the monsoon in Goa is the growth of the tere (tero) or allu leaves, with raindrops sliding effortlessly over its waxy leaves. Both are known to irritate the human mouth when not cooked the right way. But trust your grandmother to overcome this and turn the tere and allu into an unbelievably tasty delicacy.Grated coconut is roasted along with garam masala ingredients like cloves, pepper, cinnamon, garlic, coriander seeds and dry chili and ground into a paste. This masala is cooked along with chopped tere or allu leaves and generous amounts of tamarind - this being the key ingredient in cutting out the itchiness that this vegetable can cause. Any of the pulses like masur dal or green gram is added to the curry to add to the flavour and nutrition. A paste of ground fried onions is added later and the gravy, popularly known as tondak is brought to a boil, which is then enjoyed with hot steamed rice on a rainy day.Ankur is another monsoon growth found in marshy areas, which our ancestors learned to use as food. Ankur, which literally means sprouts (of the vegetation used for cooking purpose), makes for an excellent replacement for tere or allu in the tondak, giving the dish an entirely different flavour. The only difference in this preparation is the need for lesser amounts of tamarind, informs a housewife from Margao, Shantha Dhumatkar.Seeds of the favourite Goan summer fruit, the jackfruit, is what any wise grandmother likes to dry and store for the monsoon, so that it can be added in place of pulses, just in case the heavy showers affect their availability.Minus the pulses, the same masala makes a sumptuous dish out of seasonal mushrooms.Who doesn't like a plateful of hot pakoras or bhojim with their tea as the heavy showers lash our window panes? But in many a traditional Goan kitchen onions, potatoes and capsicum have a bitter rival in ridged gourds as the main ingredient in the pakora. Leaves of the plant, known locally asvotelao add a zing with its unique sharp taste to the pakora as we know ittoday. Votelao was commonly grown in the traditional garden for its medicinal use, especially in the concoction made to cure a cold.""Faglam is another vegetable which grows in the monsoon and is sliced and shallow fried after dipping it in rava, salt, chili and turmeric powder. These fodi make for a wonderful accompaniment in a vegetarian meal,"" says Purnima Kerkar, a researcher from Keri, Sattari. She informs that gol bhajji and kuddukechi bhajji are other green vegetables that grow in plenty during the monsoon and are sourced for eating in Goa.A resourceful lady of the house will always stock the kitchen well in the summer for contingencies during the monsoon.Salted gooseberries or avalo, raw jackfruit and tender portion of the bamboo shoot come in handy in case of emergencies on a rainy day.While the jar of salted avallo is opened to make a chutney out of it, when deseeded and ground into a paste along with garlic, grated coconut, salt and dried red chilli, the salted jackfruit is cooked like a vegetable.""One has to be very careful when storing the raw jackfruit. It is important that no water comes into contact with it when cutting and salting, or else it will rot. After cutting, the raw jackfruit is rubbed with salt and kept pressed under the weight of a stone. The resultant salt water that oozes out is discarded and the jackfruit is squeezed dry. It is then stored in a dry container, layering every layer of these raw jackfruit pieces (ghore) with one layer of salt,"" says Dhumatkar. She informs that the tender portion of the bamboo shoot (kil'l), which is salted and stored in a similar manner, is deep fried with rava during the monsoon as an equally delightful replacement for fish, when its supply dwindles in the monsoon.Who is worried about inflation when there is plentiful of the monsoon and an enterprising Goan running the kitchen in the house?From salted gooseberries to tender bamboo shoots, STOI samples rare monsoon delicacies unique to Goan kitchens"

The procession itself has worked as glue for many from the Walled City, keeping them attached to sandy pits year after year.""This year, Vijay Shinde, a Mumbai-based bodybuilder and gym trainer, is participating in the procession. He wanted to experience the energy and adulation, which a gym can't offer,"" said Rupesh Chauhan, 38, a resident of Dariyapur. ""That is the very reason why many of the youths, who are settled in the western city parts and work as gym instructors, can be seen at the yatra.""For Chauhan, akhada training started when he was eight. Today, he supervises training at the SVM Akhada, which is 65 years old. And he has been participating in the procession for three decades. ""We have kids coming to the akhada from areas such as Dariyapur, Shahpur, and Madhavpura. They get enamoured by the Rath Yatra platform,"" said Chauhan who attributes his success as a bodybuilder at the state level and a weightlifter at the national level to his training in the akhada.This year, his akhada is going to show off some new skills, such as balancing on a truck tyre and balancing on two chairs, apart from the usual exercise regime.Shirish Vaghela, a member of the Saraspur Sarvajinik Akhada, says that training for the Rath Yatra begins at least 45 days before the procession day. ""The intensity increases to develop muscles and also to gain the necessary fitness to last the entire day,"" he said. ""We meet after dinner for exercise and choose the best akhadians.""Akhada gurus don't mince words while talking about the infrastructure though. The traditional sand-filled akhada pits where participants used to wrestle have vanished from almost all akhadas as gym equipment have made a silent entry into many of them.Thirty akhadas have been, traditionally, an integral part of the Rath Yatra procession. Few know how that traditional 30 secured their place. But one tradition has kept the other tradition alive at least in the Walled City."

The owner of an edible oil mill on Wednesday threw caution to the winds as he jumped into the mustard oil storage tank to save his 'part time' employee who had fallen in. Owner Sanjoy Shaw , though, did not survive.It is not often when an employer risks his own life for the sake of a casual worker, but Garia resident Das (40) had always believed that a captain should lead from the front.For Das, the day started at 7am when he set out from home. Rahul Shaw reached the oil mill around 8. Shaw had just started to clean the oil chamber around 8.45am, when he slipped and fell in. His cries for help alerted Das, who jumped in to rescue Shaw. The commotion brought in the locals who stood at the edge of the pit helplessly.Das somehow managed to grab Shaw by the collar and hauled him towards the edge, where he was pulled to safety by those outside. However, Das himself fell unconscious because of the stench inside the unclean oil tank.Local residents tried to rescue Das, but none was equipped to climb down the 7.6feet-deep pit. The fire brigade and a disaster management team reached the spot after an hour. Finally, at 10.30pm, the body was brought up with no signs of life. Officials then sent it for postmortem.Das' wife Arpita and father-in-law Ashish Biswas were witness to the failed rescue operation. A visit to the grief-stricken Ushapally (Garia) in the afternoon revealed that local youths were lamenting loss of their Bhaida, Das' nickname in the locality.""It is really disheartening for us to have lost Bhaida. All our efforts to rescue him were wasted because we are not equipped to deal with such incidents. We let him die,"" said Runi Das , a local youth who joined hands with the fire department during the rescue operation.""When Shaw had stepped inside the oil pit, he began to moan loudly. It looked like he had inhaled some poisonous gas. It was similar with Das - as soon as he went in, he too was hit by a gas. Das, the heavier of the two, lifted Shaw and managed to push him out of the pit. A few of us used a rope and pulled Shaw to safety. However, it was his weight that went against Das as he unsuccessfully tried to lift himself up using the rope,"" Runi added.At home, Das's four-year-old son Saptak wasn't told that his father wouldn't come back from work. Arpita, who celebrated her 30th birthday last Sunday and was supposed to take Das out to dinner on Wednesday, is too grief-striken to even speak of the incident.The Bansdroni police have sealed the unit and have registered a case of negligence against unknown persons.

Sanjay Das, 46, and Rahul Sah, 17, were taken to a nursing home after being pulled out of the 6ft-deep tank by residents of the area. Sanjay was declared dead at the nursing home, while Rahul was shifted to Peerless Hospital in a critical state. Doctors said oil had entered the teenager's lungs, leading to a condition called pneumonitis. Sanjay is survived by his wife, two daughters aged 12 and five years, and a three-year-old son. Those who saw Sanjay and Rahul lying in the tank said oil was barely ankle-deep. Rahul, a Class X student who sells phuchkas in the evening to supplement the family income, has told police that he entered the tank to clean it. The teenager went to Sanjay's godown around 9am to buy oil, which needed to prepare phuchkas. Jagadish Das, a mason who was in the godown around that time, said he had just stepped out when he heard a worker cry out that Sanjay had had fallen into the reservoir. ""Initially, we thought the employee was playing a prank but later realised that what he was saying was true. We found Sanjay lying face down and Rahul on his back in the tank,"" Jagadish recounted. ""Both were lying still. Our efforts to pull them up were unsuccessful as their skin had become slippery. I fetched a rope from my cycle-van, looped it around Rahul's leg and pulled him up. Sanjay was pulled out the same way."" Critical care expert Ajoy Sankar, who is treating Rahul at Peerless Hospital, said there was oil in both his lungs. ""His blood pressure, pulse rate and heart rate are stable but there is a possibility that he might suffer respiratory failure, in which case he will need ventilator support."""

Overcoming the barriers of caste and even religion, tens of thousands of people came together to commemorate Aiyyanar, the guardian deity who protects the villages.A rigid code of conduct, which may sound strange, governs the Aiyyanar temple festival attended by the people of Navinipatti, North Navinipatti, Koothappan patti, Sathiyapuram, Muthirulanpatti, Perumalpatti and Kovilpatti located near Melur. People from various castes from the Hindu community and Muslims come together to conduct the temple festival, which is celebrated once in 10 years. All of them keep away from eating non-vegetarian food during the festival days. ""This year, the Aiyyanar temple festival coincided with Ramadan. All Muslim families have decided to stay away from eating non-vegetarian food, even the customary biryani. We will have non-veg only after the festival,"" S Kamaluddin, a college lecturer hailing from the village told TOI.There has been a tradi tion of paying respect to the representatives of all castes and communities residing in the villages during the culmination of the 15-day festival. At least three lakh people attend the two-week-long festival. People who have relocated to cities also return to take part in the festival. The villagers strictly fol low several customaries, some common and some, which may sound strange, during the 15 days, S Krishnan, a village elder, told TOI.""We do not eat non-vegeterian food and do not wear new dress. We cook food without thalippu' (process of heating oil and adding mustard seed) and don't break coconuts. We also do not use ammi or uralu (grinding stones) or their electric versions - mixer grinders.Our women do not wear bindi and stay away from using turmeric. Our men won't cut hair or shave their beards. No one is allowed to consume alcohol,"" he said.The villagers are clueless about the origin of these practices. However, they follow them since the festival is meant to bring peace and harmony to the villages.According to legends, the festival has been celebrated for the past 150 years.

But he was not satisfied. Hailing from a family of farmers, he wanted to do something different. Once, he visited an agri expo in Delhi and that proved a turning point in his life. He quit his job and started cultivating aloe vera and other crops on his 120-acre farmland.We are talking about Harish Dhandev, whose turnover from his farmland is from Rs 1.5 crore to Rs 2 crore per annum now. He has also opened his own company 'Naturelo Agro' at Dhaisar, 45 kilometres from Jaisalmer. Aloe vera grown in Thar Desert is being supplied in huge quantity to Patanjali Food Products Limited for making aloe vera juice.The quality of aloe vera grown in desert area is so good that there is a heavy demand for it in national and international markets. Experts at Patanjali found the quality of aloe vera so good that they immediately placed orders for its leaves. Dhandev's risk has paid off. He says that he had got a job of junior engineer with Jaisalmer Municipal Council, but his heart always craved for something else. So he resigned from his government job. He had land and water, but no idea. He wanted to grow something new. Last year, he visited an agriculture expo at Delhi, where he got an idea to grow aloe vera, amla and gunda. Generally , in desert, bajra, wheat, moong, mustard etc are grown, but he thought of growing something new. He grew 'babie densis' variety of aloe vera on his 120-acre field.This variety is so good that it is in high demand in Brazil, Hong Kong and America too.Initially, he had planted around 80,000 saplings of aloe vera, which now he has increased to seven lakh. He said that in last four months, he has sent 125-150 tonnes of processed aloe vera pulp to Patanjali factories in Haridwar.Dhandev also said that aloe vera leaves are processed in a modern way for which a facility has been set up."

",https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160713/jsp/bihar/story_96302.jsp,2016-07-13,"Workers sort roasted gorgon nuts and (below) 'makhana king' Satyajit Kumar Singh. Pictures by Ruchira Gupta Jugeshwar is a Mahadalit sharecropper living off the edge of a pond in a remote village in Araria. Satyajit Kumar Singh is the CEO of Shakti Sudha Industries in Patna. Both are 46-year- old Biharis. Their lives are interconnected by the euryale ferox. This water lily with bright purple flowers is a common sight in wetlands and ponds in north Bihar. It produces a seed, called makhana in Hindi and fox or gorgon nut in English. It has become one of Bihar's biggest exports. A wild food source during the Neolithic period, the makhana was traditionally offered to Goddesses during festivals with pan (betel leaf) and machh (fish) in the Mithila region. It is now eaten roasted and popped or in a raita or kheer in Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and West Asia. It is a unique high-protein, fat-free crop that helps strengthen the kidney and spleen to relieve diarrhoea, regulate blood pressure, and relieve numbness and aches caused by arthritis. The American Herbal Products Association has given euryale seed a Class 1 rating. Thanks to its medicinal properties and use as a new form of snack, the demand for makhana has shot up globally. At the time of India's Independence, it grew only in Darbhanga and Madhubani. Now it grows in eight districts and Bihar accounts for 90 per cent of the annual world production with a market value of Rs 500 crore. Four actors who did not know each other played a role in Bihar being able to match the global demand for this little-known seed. The first actor was the Indian Council of Agricultural Research. It found a technique for the field cultivation of euryale so that more areas could be covered by this crop and the seed could be harvested for over nine months between July and March. Earlier, the harvesting season was just August and September. Now Araria, Purnea, Katihar, Samastipur, Supaul and Saharsa have begun to grow this lovely water lily. The second actor was Jugeshwar, a landless Tatma by caste, who would eke an existence by cultivating vegetables on other people's fields. He used to watch makhana pickers from the Malla caste come from Darbangha, pitch tents near his village, wrap up their lungis and walk knee-deep into the jalkar (pond) and come out with a long stem that had a fruit at the end. He followed the Mallas into the pond. At first he was put off by the thorns around the fruit and on the underside of the leaf. But they told him they earned Rs 500 a day for removing the thorns and pulling out the seeds. They taught him how to avoid the thorns and to apply mustard oil on his hands if he was pierced. Now he is an ace makhana picker. This unique inter-caste mobility has led to a larger work force involved in the cultivation, harvesting, shelling, drying, pounding and roasting of the makhana seed. Earlier one caste picked the gudiya (seed), another broke the seed and a third roasted it. The third actor was the Bihar government that made jalkars or water bodies common property, free of the ownership of contractors or water lords, making it possible for people like Jugeshwar to cultivate and harvest makhana on an impulse. The fourth actor was Satyajit Kumar Singh who envisioned that this product would replace popular snacks like potato chips and cornflakes and that he could set up a multi-crore business based on a supply chain that would pay five lakh farmers/labourers like Jugeshwar a fair procurement price. He set the ball rolling with a Rs 7-crore agro-based project whose annual turnover is now over Rs 50 crore. It supports 12,000 farmers and producers organised as interest groups and farmer producer groups. In 2006 farmers would get Rs 60 per kilo and they had to sell on credit. A decade later his company pays farmers Rs 240 per kilo directly and right at the time of procurement. Most - 80 per cent - of his supply chain are women. His vision is to take the company to Rs 5,000-crore turnover in the next ten years selling in the Middle East, UK, US and Europe. With the supply chain that he has worked so hard to create and the roasting machine he has introduced to take care of the most arduous part of processing the makhana seed, he is likely to succeed.

(Express Photo: Prashant Pandey) Officials admit Basantpur tribals need new means of livelihood. (Express Photo: Prashant Pandey)Basanti Devi thinks little of having procured a child for a distant relative of her daughters for Rs 2,000. Bina paisa ke koi cheez kaise koi le lega (How can one get anything without paying for it)? she says.For Basanti, the calculation was simple. That woman she helped had five daughters, and wanted a son.For the 40-year-old mother of the child, of Basantpur village in Jharkhands Ramgarh district, too, the equation was simple. She was a widow and a mother of five, the baby was illegitimate, her Birhor tribe demanded the sacrifice of two goats worth Rs 10,000-12,000 for her newborn child, and here was an offer taking care of all her problems.Watch Video: Whats making newsHum liye do hajaar rupayaa aur bachcha diye Sonva Teli ko (I took Rs 2,000 and gave the child to Sonva Teli). Now you only tell me what is to be done, she says to questions about the future of the week-old infant, now returned to her after the controversy over his sale.What both find harder to understand is the brouhaha over the matter. I did not want this child, the mother says, claiming some people had forced themselves upon her and left her pregnant. Later they apologised, so she didnt file a complaint, she adds. I wanted to take the pill (for medical termination of pregnancy), but I was five months pregnant. I was told it could be risky.Basanti, of nearby Banjhi village, is more flustered. The sister of my daughters jethani had five daughters. She asked me to get a son in case his mother was poor and was not able to take care of him. I had talked to the Birhor woman. So when the child was born, I gave Rs 2,000 and took him away. Then they (the administration and media) began creating a lot of noise. So I got the child returned That woman has not even returned the money.Basanti sells vegetables and would often frequent the area where the mother lives.The focus on the case has caused local officials to rush to the mothers side. The circle officer, district welfare officer (DWO), executive magistrate, village mukhia, representatives of an NGO and others are all there making arrangements for her. One of the officers has given his vehicle to fetch a sack of grain, a jar of mustard oil and some vegetable, from the villages fair-price shop dealer for her.NGO Vikas Bhartis Arvind Kumar shows the mother a newspaper cutting saying they had adopted five Birhor women from Khunti, to convince her that she and her family could live at their ashram in Ranchi.The mother agrees after some cajoling. The officers heave a sigh of relief. If she is willing, it can be arranged. Her children could be better looked after and they could be given vocational training, says DWO Ramesh Kumar Chaubey.He adds that it would be wrong to conclude from this case that the government had abandoned the Birhors, one of Jharkhands eight primitive tribal groups. They are not starving, they have houses. Still, there is no denying that they live in poverty. There has to be some provision for a sustainable livelihood, he says.Though living close to a Tata colliery, the Birhors dont work in quarries and depend on forest produce, or make and sell ropes. The availability of plastic ropes in the market means demand has fallen for ropes made by them from natural materials. Once they also used to trap and sell monkeys, but that is virtually impossible now.Two of the siblings of the child who was sold study at St Roberts College in Hazaribagh, while one was married at an early age.Fellow tribals, who like the mother live in the colony built by the Tatas for those around its Ghato colliery as part of corporate social responsibility, are not as concerned about the child who was sold as the fact that the mother is still to sacrifice her quota of goats. The Birhors believe that the child is evil, and only a sacrifice would ward off evil from befalling them.Says a stern Sukkhu Birhor, who looks in his 70s, It has to be done. We do not know how the child came, her husband died long back. She has to arrange for the goats.Like the child she gave up and who has since been returned, the mother treats this too with equanimity. She would do as told by the community, she says.2 children for Rs 1,000; another for Rs 2,000There have been two other cases since June of tribals giving up their children for money to couples apparently wanting to adopt them. The staff of a health facility are under probe in one case:In June, a Sabar tribal gave away two of his children, aged three months and three years, to different childless couples for all of Rs 1,000. The mans wife had died after delivering the baby boy, and he was worried how to raise the six elder children . Later, when some villagers told him he could get into trouble for selling his children, he went to police and got back his children.On July 12, a tribal woman in Chakulia area of Jamshedpur was accused of selling her child for Rs 2,000 within hours of his birth. The paramedical staff at the facility where she delivered the boy was allegedly involved in fixing the deal with a childless couple, also tribal. The child has also been returned and the possibility of adoption is now being looked into.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The committee will be looking into an application for the commercialization of genetically modified (GM) mustard.Sharad E Pawar claims that RTI information obtained from the Bharatpur-based Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research (DRMR) shows that DMH-11 was deliberately compared with old and weak varieties to prove higher yields in the GM. ""This is in complete contravention to the GEAC recommendations. Non compliance of recommended protocol should actually deem the trial defunct,"" the former BARC scientist who was a part of the GM mustard trials told TOI.Pawar points out that in the initial trial conducted at 10 locations in 2006-07, DMH-1 was found to be superior to DMH-11 at 6 locations, 'Kranti' was superior to DMH-11 at 4 locations and 'Varuna' superior to DMH-11 only at 2 locations. Strangely, DMH-1 and Kranti were not part of subsequent trials conducted during 2010-11, 2011-12 and 2014-15.""We will not allow the GEAC to turn a blind eye to protocols that they themselves have laid down,"" said Kapil Shah, national secretary of Organic Farming Association of India.Shah claims that the technology developer Deepak Pental, the former VC of Delhi University, fudged the data for 2011-12 by reporting higher yield in the trials than what was obtained.""There is indisputable proof that Pental ignored the GEAC recommended protocols completely and manipulated trial protocols with dubious intentions to ensure that DMH-11 would show superiority over the 35-40 year old varieties which he used in the trials to compare,"" claimed Shah.Ecologist Dr Debal Deb, of Odisha, expressed concern over the quality of environmental risk assessment of the GM mustard. ""Trial reports suggest that the ecological study was very shoddily done, the data was doctored. There are huge statistical fallacies,"" says Deb."

If cleared, DMH-11 will become the first genetically-modified food crop in India.The anti-GM group claimed that CGMCP had committed a fraud by not disclosing that the three genes in the hybrid mustard were herbicide-tolerant, which will lead to increased use of chemicals and raise risks to human health and ecology.

The GEAC also agreed to look into inadequacies in regulation by the GEAC so far.Kavitha Kuruganti of Alliance for Sustainable Agriculture (Asha) and co-convener of Coalition for GM Free India told TOI that eight member groups comprising scientists, ecologists, farm leaders, consumers and farm activists led by her were given a patient hearing by the GEAC, chaired by Amita Prasad. ""The GEAC was very receptive. The GEAC, in fact, thanked the group members for drawing attention to several significant issues which were otherwise overlooked. The committee also assured scientific correctness in implementing the regulations,"" she said.However, Kuruganti also expressed concern over the general attitude of the GEAC. "" The representatives of activists and scientists were taken aback when the GEAC clearly stated that it was not concerned with other aspects of GM mustard except biosafety and environment-related issues. We are really concerned that in absence of any dedicated agency handling issues like consumer choice, farmers' sovereignty, effect of the crop on other crops etc, the farmer would be a big sufferer if GM mustard is given a nod for commercialization. Who is responsible for failures and risks associated with the GM crop? What is the redressal mechanism? And who will guarantee benefit and safety claims being made,"" she added.Nagpur scientist Sharad E Pawar, who was initially associated with the trials of the Dhara Mustard Hybrid (DMH), also made presentations to the GEAC on Monday. He said that had the GEAC done its job, the research work of Prof Deepak Pental from Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants and former Delhi University former VC, would not have reached the current status. ""Our group has demanded cancelling of approval for all three applications by the crop developer.Demands by activists* Reject DMH-11 application in toto and immediately including parental lines as the approved R&D in 2003 is not same as that being assessed now, the DMH-11* Fix liability on crop developers for false/incorrect evidence provided wilfully to regulators in addition to violations of biosafety norms laid down for field trials and blacklist such applicants in the regulatory system* Put out all documents pertaining to DMH-11 R & D from its inception into the public domain immediately* Investigate issues of male sterility and herbicide tolerance in GM mustard"

However, these crops are unlikely to be recommended for release anytime soon, officials told The Hindu .As part of an ongoing case on GM crops in India, a Supreme Court Technical Expert Committee has already recommended a ban on HT crops.A coalition of activists, opposed to GM crops, proffered evidence to the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) on Monday to show that GM mustard being tested was not superior in yield to existing mustard varieties.Weve heard them out and a sub-committee will look into the concernsbut these are not HT crops, said a GEAC official privy to the discussions. One of the genes is a marker used to differentiate hybrids from non-hybrids. It wont require more or less chemicals than existing mustard varieties, the official said.Beyond GEACs scopeAnother official, who also did not want to be identified, said issues of yield were beyond the scope of the GEAC. There are already other committees [within the agriculture system governance mechanism] tasked with looking at whether their yields are superior or they are fit for commercial release. So far, no fresh tests appear to be needed, the official said. The GEAC is an expert body of the Environment Ministry tasked with assessing if GM crops risk. While the body must approve every application to test GM crops, the most contentious crop on its table now is a type of mustard that contains three genes sourced from soil bacterium.It has had a tumultuous history with activists claiming that it would be a gateway to other GM food crops  tomato, rice, brinjal, etc  and that these may pose health and ecological risks. Currently, GM cotton is the only transgenic crop commercially available in fields. The GM mustard has been developed by Deepak Pental, a geneticist at the Delhi University, with support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology."

The Gujarati Chundo and Methiya Keri pickles (sweet mango pickles) are a true labour of love for its method of preparation and care taken that is evident in its final taste at the table, shares Bhatt, who says that the variety of mango used defines the pickle and hence insists on hand-picking the smooth and pulpy raw green Rajapuri variety of mangoes from her family farm in Gujarat for both the Chundo and Methiya Keri.Involving no cooking, these are then painstakingly grated and mixed with the perfect ratio of sugar and salt. Sundried and stirred for anywhere between 10 and 20 days, the mangoes are further treated to a generous dose of a secret spice blend of jeera powder, fine chilli powder and more, and allowed to mature for a week.The resultant bottled mix is a legendary combination of sweet, spicy and slightly sour that checks all the right boxes. Similarly her Methiya Keri pickle consists of chunky mangoes marinated in coarsely ground fenugreek seeds and mustard (kuriya) along with the spice mix. Sundried to perfection, the bottled brilliance is topped off with a thick layer of boiled pungent mustard oil. With neither any preservatives nor artificial colours, these naturally matured pickles have a shelf life of more than a year and are best paired with Indian staples such as parantha, dosa and khakhra and can even double up as a quick spread on your morning toast. While Bhatt is looking to make an online and retail presence next year, she currently delivers her goodies home.Rs 140 onwards(200 grams). Details: 9841014925"

In Kokrajhar district, over 6,500 people from 17 villages are taking shelter in relief camps. Under Kachugaon block in Gossaigaon sub-division, 5,002 people from 12 villages are taking shelter in make-shift camps. Similarly, 1,577 people from five affected villages are taking shelter at# relief camps built# along the roadside. The rising water level of major rivers - Sankosh, Sormanga, Gongia - and their tributaries have breached# many embankments in the district. The PWD blacktop road in the Charagaon area by Longa river via Umangar has been completely eroded by at least half a kilometre. In Chirang, 64 villages - 29 under Sidli revenue circle and 35 under Bijni circle - were affected by the floods with 13,045 people still taking shelter in 12 relief camps under Sildi circle while 16,954 people are housed at 10 relief camps under Bijni revenue circle. Altogether 68 houses under Sildi, seven under Bijni, four roads, a bridge and a school were damaged in the floods. The All Bodo Students Union (Absu) has appealed to the district administration as well as the district disaster management authorities to make a proper survey of the affected areas and provide adequate relief material and rehabilitation to those who are affected. General secretary of Absu Kokrajhar district committee Nion Mushahary said the people of North Patgaon (63 families) have been living in relief camps for the past seven days but are provided only 9kg rice, 1kg dal, a mosquito net, a bottle of Phenyl, half a litre of mustard oil, a blanket and an umbrella per family but are not provided with any medical facilities. He also said the affected people of Banglajhora (34 families), living in the relief camp for the past eight days, were not given mosquito nets or blankets and many affected people of New Banglajhora, Kashibari and west Banglajhora were not provided anything except 10kg rice and 1kg dal per family.

DIPRO/Kamrup(M) Officials feeding the starving golden langurs in Peacock island on Friday. DIPRO/Kamrup(M)It is a story of two men and five monkeys  five golden langurs. All five are inhabitants of Bhashmachal  said to be the smallest inhabited river island in the world  located in the heart of the mighty Brahmaputra in Guwahati. Cut off from the rest of the world for over 25 days due to rise in the water level, they were literally starving for the past week until the district local administration on Friday sent them food and other essential items.The priest and an assistant are the only human beings who live in the island and look after the Umananda Temple located there. Since boats and ferry services have remained suspended for the past 25 days, they ran out of food and were literally starving, until one of them got into contact with us through a family member who lives in the city, said Kamrup (Metro) deputy commissioner M Angamuthu. He in fact personally took a risky boat ride across the turbulent Brahmaputra on Friday, and took with him rice, dal, mustard oil, fruits and other foodstuff for them.Most affected were five golden langurs who have been living in the island and are solely dependent on fruits offered to them by hundreds of pilgrims who visit the island temple every day. But with no pilgrim going there since suspension of boat services, the langurs too were starving, deputy commissioner Angamuthu, who had taken with him several bunches of bananas and other food for the primates, said.The island, which has over the years come to be more popularly known as Umananda  because of the Shiva temple situated there  is just a 20-minute boat ride from the Kamrup (Metro) deputy commissioners office at Panbazar here. With an area of just about four hectares, the island in the mid-19th century appeared to the British to be of a peacocks shape, prompting the British administration to name it Peacock Island.The Shiva temple in the island was constructed in 1694 by Garhganya Phukan Handique, an Ahom official, under instructions of the Ahom king Gadadhar Simha. While the temple attracts large number of pilgrims during the Shivaratri celebrations, the boat ride is an additional attraction. The island once upon a time also had a male hoolock gibbon, which passed away in the early 1990s following old age.We are also grateful to two local dailies which had highlighted the plight of the two priests and the golden langurs, which prompted us to swing into action. Going around the island, we also noticed a few patches of erosion caused by the Brahmaputra. We will have to get those repaired once the flood-water recedes, deputy commissioner Angamuthu said. On Friday, the Brahmaputra was still flowing about 35 cms above the danger level.In the absence of a direct electric supply line, the tiny temple island fortunately has several solar lamps installed a few years ago. But for the solar panels, priest Bangshi Sarma and his assistant Khagen Kalita would have not been able to charge their mobile phones and contact the outside world, Angamuthu said.The island, which has a number of trees, also attracts a number of bird species especially during winter and spring. A study carried out by Shah Nawaz Jelil of Gauhati University and Pranjal Mahananda of Kalpadroom Foundation from mid-February to mid-April 2014 found 20 species of birds belonging to 17 species in the island. The list of birds spotted included blue-throated barbet, black kite, black drongo, rose-ringed parakeet, white-breasted kingfisher, oriental magpie robin, and rock pigeon among others.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

What sets this Murrah bull apart is its base price of Rs 5 crore. Its auction will take place on August 5.As the price quoted by the owner is unheard of in the hill state, people have started thronging the village to have a glimpse of the prized cattle.Located some 6 kms from Barthin town, Ghori Dhaviri panchayat has caught the attention of people ever since Naresh Soni, 44, decided to auction his Murrah bull, which weighs almost 1,000kg with 5'8'' height and stretching 13 feet in length.Soni, who runs two jewellery shops at Barthin, said if a Murrah bull, 'Yuvraj', of Kuruskshetra in Haryana can carry a price tag of Rs 9 crore, his 'Himachali Ranjha' could be easily be sold for over Rs 5 crore whose mother was also brought from Haryana for Rs 87,000.He said daily diet of Murrah bull includes apples, two-and-a-half kg soybean, two-and-a-half kg of chana (chickpea), 10 kg of cattle feed beside one kg desi ghee. To ensure that ""Himachali Ranjha"" keeps shining, two litres of mustard oil is used for his massage daily, Soni added.Soni said around Rs 1500 is spent on the diet and upkeep of Murrah bull daily.He said that to attract buyers from other states including Punjab and Haryana in the auction, he has posted the auction details on Facebook and other social networking sites.He said Murrah buffalo brought from Haryana for Rs 87,000 was sold for Rs 1.67 lakh at Kurali in Punjab last year. ""Himachal Ranjha has not mated so far and this fact would fetch good price for him in the auction,"" he added.To make the auction a ""grand affair"", Soni has also invited Bilaspur MLA of Congress Bamber Thakur along with others. ""I am going to Ghori Dhaviri on August 5, as I too want to see the Murrah bull carrying such a price tag,"" Thakur said.Soni said if August 5 auction fails to get the desired result, he would hold another auction in the future."

Jorhat deputy commissioner Virendra Mittal today told The Telegraph that the response from civil society in coming forward to offer aid to the flood-hit people was ""very encouraging"" with all sections of society participating for a humane cause. ""All kinds of organisations ranging from small clubs and traders' bodies to socio-cultural, voluntary and charitable groups belonging to different communities, apart from PSUs and several colleges, came forward to donate for flood victims in their hour of crisis, which should be acknowledged and reciprocated,"" Mittal said. He said to encourage such positive work and compassion shown towards the victims of a natural calamity, the administration has decided to present appreciation letters to all organisations who donated to the flood-hit. ""We will be giving an appreciation letter thanking each organisation for their humanitarian gesture hoping for such similar responses in the future,"" Mittal said. He said giving such a letter was also expected to send a right message within society. The deputy commissioner said he has also directed the Majuli sub-divisional administration to issue such letters to organisations which have offered aid to the flood-affected people. Jorhat additional deputy commissioner Bubul Lekharu said organisations donated items like biscuits, water bottles, rice, onions, potatoes, pulses, mustard oil, buckets, medicines, clothes and tarpaulin. Lekharu said Rs 27,000 cash was among the assistance offered to the administration to be spent in relief measures. He said some organisations directly distributed the items to the victims according to the administration guidelines while some organisations handed over the things to the administration. Jorhat was one of the 28 districts in the state which was badly affected by floods with Majuli island in the district being severely affected. A large number of villages under Jorhat west, east and Teok revenue circles along with a few villages under Titabar sub-division were also submerged. About two lakh people were affected and about 25 relief camps were set up. Majuli, being represented by chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal, this time seemed to get priority from the government, with Sonowal flying to the island on July 28 to take stock of the flood scene and rescue measures. Four officials posted in Majuli were suspended and many others were issued showcause notices by Dispur after victims complained to Sonowal regarding officials showing negligence in carrying out relief duty."

The judges of the contest have selected two of the 10 finalists - Mustard and Eva, whose guardians are Nandini Baruva and Karishma Deka respectively, both residents of this city. That's after sifting through hundreds of photographs of lovable cats as well as their rescue stories. ""Mustard (which is also the colour of his body) was drenched in the rain and dragging himself outside my house in Zoo Road Tiniali when I found him a year-and-a-half ago.

""So I knew I had to take good care of him. He was fed lots of milk apart from the medication that was needed. Now, while he still drags his hind legs, he has gained some strength and is playful. He has to be given two warm baths a day which he enjoys, unlike most other cats,"" she said. A designer, Nandini came across the Peta contest through Facebook. ""Mustard loves playing with bottle caps and is bossy. We are looking at gifting him a wheel cart for evening walks. He is already a winner for me,"" she said. The story of Eva is no different. ""I found Eva among a rubble of broken bricks near my residence in Ulubari on a stormy winter night. She was golden-coloured. But there were five street dogs barking at her. Her life was at risk and I had to step in. That was three years ago when she was barely a month old. Now Eva, named after a character in a movie, is a part of our family and a source of happiness for us,"" Karishma, a humanities student, said. The Peta contest encourages people to adopt animals from streets and shelters. One has to visit www.petaindia.com to read all the finalists' rescue stories and vote for their favourite by Thursday.

Fish ladders are a series of pools built like steps to enable fish to ascend a dam and enable them to migrate upstream over or through a barrier. The ladders will enable the fish to cross the dam and breed further up the river.Bharti is on record as saying once that happens, the fish, considered a delicacy in East India, will be available in the Ganga in regions as far as even the Chambal in MP and UP, as was the case in the past. Indeed, till the time the Farakka barrage was built in 1975, hilsa which only breeds in fresh water travelled hundreds of kilometres inland to breed. The building of the barrage barred their migration.The hilsa is now like a fish out of water in the Ganga. ""Gone are the days when we relished the choicest preparations of hilsa, which is revered as 'machher rani' (queen of fishes), amid monsoon spells. It is a thing of the past. Today, we can't afford this luxury and have to spend Rs 1,200-1,500 for a kg of fish,"" laments Gauri Das (75), a resident of Bengali Tola area in Varanasi.The last time Das bought hilsa was three years ago on a special occasion. Recalling the old days, when it was available in abundance in the markets, she said, ""Dishes like Shorshe Ilish (hilsa cooked in mustard paste) and Bhapa Ilish (steamed hilsa with chilly mustard paste) were common in Bengali households. Today, we are yearning for hilsa."" Those were the days before the Farakka barrage was built and the hilsa travelled long distances upstream.Das was elated at the thought that hilsa could be fished locally in the Ganga waters in the coming days. "" Sotti! Eta hobe?"" (Really! Would it happen?),"" she wondered with her wide open eyes. ""Hilsa is cooked in a number of ways,"" she said, adding that it can be fried, cooked in spicy tomato or ginger-based gravy (jhol), or mustard-based with green chillies (shorshe batar jhal). It can also be cooked with posto, doi (curd), seasonal vegetables, and steamed inside of plantain or butternut squash leaves."

58ff28877be9e0420db2dce2,Dentists’ nod to Baba queried,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160814/jsp/nation/story_102409.jsp,2016-08-14,"Ramdev receives the certificate in New Delhi on Saturday. Picture by Prem SinghNew Delhi, Aug. 13: Yoga televangelist Baba Ramdev today accepted endorsement from a dentists association for a herbal toothpaste made by a company he mentors and questioned the countrys advertising industry watchdogs authority to criticise the companys marketing campaigns. The Dentists Association of India (DAI) handed a certificate of accreditation to Ramdev, drawing criticism from an official of another private association of dentists. The Indian Dental Association (IDA) official called the event a marketing gimmick and questioned the ethics of dentists comparing different brands. DAI president Anil Dhalla claimed that research had shown that the herbal toothpaste brand Dant Kanti from Patanjali Ayurved was the most effective in anti-microbial action and reduction of dental plaque and gingival inflammation when compared with several other brands. Dhalla received words of gratitude from Ramdev, who used the occasion to question the authority of the Advertising Standards Council of India (ASCI), which has accused Patanjali of misleading or false advertisements for several products, including Dant Kanti. The council had last year said that Patanjalis advertisement claiming Dant Kanti Junior would save children from brain cancer, blood cancer, stomach cancer and skin and bone cancer caused by an ingredient in other toothpastes was either misleading, false, or not adequately or scientifically substantiated. Over the past one year, the council has also expressed concern about what it says are Patanjalis misleading advertisements on cow ghee, herbal medicines, natural hair cleansers and herbal oil. On a complaint from the council that Patanjali had made misleading claims about its mustard oil brands, the Food Safety and Standards Council of India sent a notice to the company earlier this year. The advertisement had claimed that most of the other edible refined oils and mustard oil are made using a neurotoxin...What is the ASCI? Does it represent the law? Was the ASCI sleeping when other companies advertised fairness creams? Ramdev said. This is being done to defame Patanjali. Our advertisements do not make any false claims.IDA secretary Ashok Dhoble questioned the DAIs decision to compare one brand with others. The IDA has over 75,000 dentists from across India as its members, and we would never compare brands, Dhoble told The Telegraph. What the IDA does through scientific research is examine the ingredients in individual brands to verify whether the claims made are justified or not. I would call this a marketing gimmick. A former member of the Dental Council of India, the dental education regulator, said a comparison of brands by a professional association was improper. Naming specific products in the market to say one is better than the other is dubious and unhealthy research, he said, asking not to be named. Dhalla, who says every dentist in India is a member of the DAI, said he was not answerable to the IDA.There are many associations of dentists. Let them (the IDA) say whatever they want, he told this newspaper. Any citizen or organisation is free to compare one brand with any other in the market: there is nothing wrong with this. We are not abusing any specific brands, nor are we against modern medicine. We have given this certificate on the basis of research. Dhalla said that certain foreign toothpaste brands marketed in India displayed the IDA logo. One brand, he said, has the words: IDA-accepted. He cited another toothpaste brand sold in India that has the words: Endorsed by the American Dental Association. Another DAI member said the IDA appeared comfortable with such endorsements. Dhoble said that such endorsements merely indicated that a claim about a toothpaste was justified. He added: We will not compare even different brands of the same company. The research Dhalla cited today is a January 2015 scientific paper by microbiologists from the E. Raghvendra Rao Postgraduate Science College, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, that compared the anti-microbial actions of several toothpaste brands. When we did this study, we had no connection with the dentists association. They probably noticed our paper and contacted us to present our results, said Dhirendra Kumar Shrivastava, head of microbiology at the Bilaspur college who led the study. Patanjali has been selling Dant Kanti for about a decade, a senior company official said."

The GM mustard is like a Trojan horse waiting to attack, they said.The Government of India plans to approve GM mustard (three different types) developed by the Delhi University. The application for approval is at an advanced stage of processing by the Indian regulators.The mustard sowing season is fast approaching and the central regulators could take a decision on the matter any day soon. So we urge the Tamil Nadu Chief Minister to look into this. The AIADMK government in its manifesto highlighted that it would not permit GM foods, said Kavitha Kuruganti, Convenor, Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture. According to Ms. Kavitha, even neighbouring States should say no to GM mustard or it would enter the Tamil Nadu market.Dhanapal, president of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Association, said that every family in Tamil Nadu consumes a minimum of 5 gm. of mustard per day. So one should be cautious about what they eat. GM mustard would not only impact people but also spoil the soil, he added.T. Vellaiyan, president of the Tamil Nadu Traders Association, asked: When we have ample mustard what is the need for the GM version.Members of the various associations expressed concern that the Centre is processing an application for a GM crop that is herbicide tolerant. According to them, This will increase chemical usage in our farming in addition to displacing poor agricultural labourers from employment. This has direct implications for all consumers with greater toxic residues in our food. It is all the more shocking as the matter is pending in the Supreme Court of India.They also said allowing transgenic mustard will open the flood gates for dozens of other similar crops and jeopardise farmer livelihoods and bio diversity.Mustard is mainly grown in the North-West parts. Rajasthan, U.P. are the major producing States. The Rajasthan output is highly monsoon-dependent. The other important producers are M.P., Haryana, Gujarat, West Bengal and Assam."

58ff26467be9e0420db2d9be,Italian diplomat relishes first taste of a city friendly & foodie,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160819/jsp/calcutta/story_103235.jsp,2016-08-19,"DAMIANO FRANCOVIGH, the new Italian consul-general in Calcutta, talks food and wine, golf and tourism with Chandreyee Chatterjee. Picture by: B. Halder Is this your first visit to Calcutta? Yes, this is my first ever visit to Calcutta. In fact this is my first time in India. Why did you choose Calcutta or did Calcutta choose you? Well, you can say it happened both ways. I already had an experience in Asia, because I had been posted to Vietnam in the past and I liked the environment. I am a friend of Cesare (Bieller) who is my predecessor here, who told me that the place is actually very nice and it was worth coming here. As diplomats we can apply for a new posting and I was lucky enough to get this. Apart from Cesare, did you talk to anyone with a Calcutta connect before arriving here? Yes, I got to talk to some friends of mine who were posted to India. Like Joel Melchiori, who was the consul-general here before Cesare, and he also told me that the city was very pleasant to work in for a tenure. I spoke to other colleagues who had served in India, trying to understand what kind of environment and what kind of challenges I would find in the city. What has been your first impression of Calcutta? When I came in February I was happy to see that everything I was told about the city was actually true. The people of Calcutta are so warm and friendly and welcoming and the social environment is also very friendly, and I would say even hectic. And the food is so good! I play golf and I have discovered that there are two clubs with 18-hole courses. I play at RCGC and it is very nice and really professional. I believe it is the first British golf course opened outside the British Isles, and they tell this with great pride and rightly so. I can confirm that the tradition is well maintained even after two centuries. It is a wonderful place to spend a few hours playing golf. Even the bad things they told me about Calcutta are not so bad after all. Like the weather. Everybody told me that the weather was a negative factor. Of course there are some periods of the year when the weather is not good but, at the end of the day, it is not worse than it was in Vietnam. In fact, it is better. And the good season is really good. In February when I arrived, and a part of March, the weather was really fine. The traffic was another negative factor I was told about, which it can be during some periods of the year, some special days and some special hours but for the rest of the time it is acceptable. I come from Rome - I am not from Rome but being a diplomat we serve in Rome - and I will tell you that traffic in Rome is a negative factor because we spend hours moving from one part of the city to the other. Calcutta is not worse than that. If there is anything negative here it is the quality of the air. It seems to be not so good because of the pollution. It is a factor that should be addressed because it affects the lives of citizens. You said how hectic the social life in Calcutta is, did you expect that? Well not so much. They told me, but I did not expect it. For example the races, it is a very special tradition beautifully preserved, which I like very much. The tradition of clubs is also something very unique to Calcutta, which says many things about the culture of the city. In these beautiful mansions used as clubs you can find an atmosphere that takes you back a hundred years. It is really something special. Another factor that is special to me is the food. I love Bengali food and Indian food. We Italians have our food tradition that is very well known and spread throughout the world, so when we talk about food we want to be sure that what we have on our plate is actually good. And I must tell you that I haven't found anything here in Calcutta that isn't very high level. The local tradition of food and the special dishes is just wonderful. Bengali cuisine uses ingredients like fresh fish and seafood, which is among my favourites, so I am very lucky. Also the spices you use here like mustard for instance, and you fry in mustard oil, which is something very strange for us but it very tasty and I like it so much. I have been in five-star hotels eating Bengali food and it was delicious and I've been to other restaurants in town and it is the same. I noticed the great attention given to the freshness of the ingredients and also the presentation of the food. How are you looking to engage with Calcutta on culture? We hope to be able to organise something special in November when the minister of foreign affairs launches the first week of Italian cuisine worldwide. As I said earlier, we have our food traditions and you have yours. To my understanding, Italian food is very much appreciated in Calcutta. We will also have discussions and exchange of views on local dishes; we will be inviting someone to present some ideas on Italian cuisine to a local audience. We are looking forward to organising other events like concerts and the screening of a silent movie with music at the end of the year. Is education going to be one of your focus areas? Yes. For example, after having this week of Italian cuisine, I would like, if possible, to take it to the next step like trying to bring Italy to the schools here that teach hotel management. We would like to bring in teachers from Italy working in this sector to see if it is possible to arrange some sort of coordination and cooperation. We have many collaborations with institutes here and many students are applying for student visas for Italy to study in universities like Bocconi and Politecnico, both in Milan and Turin. The figures are smaller as compared to other parts of India but they are increasing. We have cooperation in the area of education and research thanks to the centres of excellence in Italy in fields like physics and I see that there is continuous exchange of researchers. This is an important tool for strengthening bilateral relations. In terms of business and trade what are your focus areas? This is a sector where I think we should concentrate more than we have in the past. Bengal has great potential. There is attention towards attracting investors and in improving the business environment. The business summit in January 2017 will be an important event in that regard. I think it is the right move from the state government to attract investors in all sectors but in manufacturing in particular. By the way, Italy has great expertise in the area of small and medium enterprises. The backbone of Italian economy is based on SMEs and this is something that connects Italy and India. SMEs could explore their full potential because they were working in clusters, exchanging ideas, exchanging labour force, exchanging pattern and modes of production which made the SMEs more agile and flexible than the big companies. This is an experience that I think could be replicated over here. West Bengal is a great hub of leather industries and even for Italy that sector is very important. This is a specific area where we can concentrate on strengthening our bilateral cooperation. We would also like to introduce more Italian wines to Calcutta. Wine is an important tradition in Europe and though Calcutta has a love for strong alcohol, especially whisky, many people are becoming more and more interested in tasting wine. So this is another area in which there is scope for cooperation between the two places. I am very happy to hear that Calcuttans are becoming more interested in good wines and I hope that it will be possible to bring more Italian wine labels to the city. Every Calcuttan on a Europe trip stops in Italy but do you have any plans to encourage tourists from Calcutta to spend time in Italy? This year we are having the Jubilee celebrations so it is turning out to be an attraction for a number of people in Calcutta. And there's the ceremonial canonisation of Mother Teresa as well. That is also when we will have the visit of the chief minister (Mamata Banerjee) to Italy. We have already received many applications for visas - pilgrims and tourists travelling to Rome for this special occasion. I am sure that on September 4 we'll see that St. Peter's Square will be crowded and most of the crowd I think will be made up of Calcuttans! My suggestion to people who are interested to travel to Italy is: I understand that most of the people, when they prepare their itinerary they think, 'Okay, 10 days in Europe? Value for money is visiting at least five countries so I can say I visited five countries'. But when you go so wide you cannot go in-depth. And Italy has so many different things to see. The food, as we were saying, is a factor. We are also one of the countries in the world with the most important heritage monuments. We can offer people a chance to enjoy wonderful mountains as many tourists like to go trekking or on walks in the mountains. Also the Alps from the Italian side has wonderful places that can be visited like Trentino-Alto Adige in the north-east of Italy. The landscape is wonderful, nothing less than Switzerland or Austria. For those who are interested we have wonderful beaches as well. If you go to Sardinia you'll see that we have places almost as beautiful as Thailand for swimming and sunbathing. The pleasure of walking around in ancient and historical towns and sunbathing and swimming in the sea on the same day, it is an experience that you cannot get everywhere. Love for food apart, do you see any similarities between Italians and Calcuttans? For Italians family is very important and in India also you have very close-knit large families. In Italy now the families are smaller in size but still the ties in the families are very strong. The other thing of course is that we both have a long and rich history. It is something that brings us closer despite being thousands of kilometres away. Also both Italians and Calcuttans are very happy people. This is a common thing we have which is also a positive thing and something to be proud of. The consulate has moved to a new office (5G, New Road, Alipore), will there be an expansion in the services the consulate provides? Well the idea is that since we now have this location in Alipore we will be using this as a hub for organising events, which would bring together people who love Italy or Italian culture and food. It can be a place where they and even Italians can meet and spend some time together. The Indo-Italian Chamber of Commerce office will also shift to the new premises. This will become the hub of Italy in Calcutta. What is your 'welcome to Calcutta' message for the Italian consul-general? Tell [email protected]"

In fact it crops up in many things but not in its beautiful slender intensity. The Vanilla pod!I grew up in a small working class town just outside of Manchester England so luxury and the most beautiful ingredients werent something that Id know until I started my culinary journey at 16, and in all honesty it really was that whole sweet dessert and pudding thing that made me want to be a cook in the first place.The first time I realised that vanilla wasnt just something you poured out of a bottle and was actually more plant than chemical was when I first started working in London at 20. It was a revelation in its sweet sticky wonderfulness that connot be compared to anything that comes out of a bottle. From fresh custards to crme Brulees, something to lift the flavour of any fruit with a squeeze of lemon cooked in a compote or just some of those heady pearls scraped into a cake mixture before baking.They are a revolution to any Pastry chef! And although not something youd consider so much with savoury dishes but I think fresh vanilla and sresh seafood such as sea scallops or lobster can also make for one of those beautiful food marriages.They are a little expensive I know but you can get great quality Vanilla pods grown in south India for around Rs 3,500 per kilo but if you dry the pod after scraping and using the seeds, and blitz them in a spice grinder and use the powder as you would the seeds. Youll get three times your moneys worth.We use fresh vanilla in many items including the butter cream and vanilla delice tn Mustard and Cress. Vanilla Pannacotta has an interesting vanilla scented coconut chutney served with half a dozen prawn skewers that would go great with a nice vanilla vodka based cocktailShaun Kenworthy, Director, F&B, the Biere Club"

""We want immediate intervention of the state government in the case of GM mustard as the Centre would take a decision on this soon,"" she added.The anti-GM crop campaigner said this crop is not in the best interest of small and marginal farmers. ""The bio-tech companies, which have the patents for production of GM crop seeds, will rule the market. It will pose a threat to indigenous and traditional seeds of the country,"" she added. Kuruganti said she had filed an RTI application before the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), a central regulator on biotech, to get information regarding this crop, but it refused to share any information as it was in the process of reviewing the data.Representatives of six farmer outfits said Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been affected badly after failure of bt cotton. ""We don't it to happen in Odisha,"" they added.Saroj Mohanty of Paschim Odisha Krushak Sangathan, a farmers' body, said they will mobilize farmers and college students to oppose the crop at the grassroots level. ""We don't want to lose the originality of our traditional crops. So we will not allow GM mustard,"" he added.He said the crop would not only affect the environment, but also affect reproductive health, immunity and disease- resistance capacity of the people."

Farmers are stuck with old technology, yields are at a fraction of world levels, cultivable land is shrinking and weather patterns have become less predictable, experts say.But political and public opposition to lab-altered food remains strong amid fears that GM crops could compromise food safety and biodiversity.Some grassroots groups associated with Modi's nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party have also opposed GM crops because of the reliance on seeds patented by multi-nationals like Monsanto, DuPont, Dow Chemical and Syngenta, which is to be taken over by a Chinese company.India placed a moratorium on GM eggplant in 2010, also after an experts panel had given its clearance, effectively bringing the regulatory system to a deadlock.Modi, however, who was instrumental in making Gujarat state India's leading user of GM cotton when he was chief minister there, cleared several field trials for GM crops soon after taking office in New Delhi in 2014.The GM mustard developed by Delhi University scientists makes use of three genes already incorporated in rapeseed hybrids in Canada, the United States and Australia.Extensive biosafety tests have revealed no cause for concern, according to a field trial report submitted to the government and seen by Reuters."

It further said that environmental safety testing, bypassing rigorous agronomic evaluation, cannot be considered as a valid basis for yield claims related to DMH-11, which is the main basis for the introduction of this GMO.Under pressure from civil society, farmer groups and scientists, the environment ministry in February this year did not give permission for commercialization of GMMustard and sought more details from developers."

However there are multiple approvals still required for any likely clearance.Multiple sources told The Hindu that a document  called a safety document  detailing the sub-committees findings as well as the data it had perused in assessing DMH-11, the genetically modified (GM) mustard hybrid developed by researchers at the Delhi University, would be made available online for public comments next week.The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) is an Environment Ministry body whose clearance is mandatory for testing GM crops in farmer fields. For DMH-11 it had consulted with plant biologists, ecologists and environmentalists before tasking a sub-committee with compiling all evidence  and addressing key questions  on DMH-11. Earlier too in 2010, the GEAC had cleared Bt brinjal but its decision over-ruled by the then Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh.The GEAC has approved the subcommittees report and is now with the Minister [Anil Madhav], a key official told The Hindu , GM mustard being a sensitive issue, its on his deskfingers crossed. We cannot put curbs on research.Mr. Madhav, in a press statement, emphasised that no final decision has been taken as yet on the issue and that in a meeting held on August 11, 2016, it has appraised the Safety Document prepared by the Sub-Committee that would be put up on the website of GEAC inviting comments from the public. Moreover, a GEAC approval doesnt mean the States  who have the final says on agriculture seeds  are compelled to clear it their fields.The imperative to make public bio-safety data around DMH-11 follows a reprimand by the Central Information Commissioner earlier this month to the government for not making bio-safety data around genetically-modified organisms and mustard public.The mustard in question has been developed by a team of scientists at Delhi University led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental under a government-funded project. In essence, it uses a system of genes from soil bacterium that makes mustard  generally a self pollinating plant  better suited to hybridisation than current methods. A similar sequence of genes has been used in imported canola oil. This means local crop developers can more easily develop different varieties of hybrid mustard, like in say GM cotton, and confer traits like pest resistance and potentially improving yield.Yield no better: ActivistsActivists have however maintained that publicly-available data on DMH-11 shows that its yield is no better than existing varieties. Moreover the government has consistently stone-walled attempts, according to Kavitha Kurugnati of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, to obtain complete data on the tests done on DMH-11 in multiple States over the years.Proponents of the technology said that Indias dependence on edible oil imports made it necessary to harness GM-mustard. Annually, India spends about $12 billion on imported edible oil. The edible oil deficit will continue to widen with the increase in population and per capita income. To address this challenge, India needs to increase productivity of oilseed crops. DMH-11 is one of the promising technologies to improve mustard yield in India, which is almost stagnant since the last two decades, said a statement by the South Asia Biotechnology Centre."

This comes days after the ministry was rapped by the Central Information Commission (CIC) for withholding crucial information.The Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) under the green ministry has decided to put up the safety document on its website, inviting comments from the public, said an environment ministry official here on Thursday. The GEAC is Indias topmost regulator on genetically modified products.The decision comes two weeks after the CIC issued show-cause notices to two ministry officials for not disclosing the biosafety information on the GM mustard in violation of an earlier CIC order.A technical panel under the GEAC scrutinised the safety document and gave its go ahead for the public disclosure. The decision was taken at the GEACs last meeting on August 11, days after Anil Dave took over the environment ministry.The indigenous genetically engineered crop, developed by scientists at the Delhi University, is under the government's consideration for commercial release. But as anti-GM activists were up in arms against it, Daves predecessor Prakash Javadekar put it hold seeking further consultation."

""Cement manufacturing companies have increased the prices of cement bags up to Rs 370. At the same time, they are supplying cement at rates between Rs 210 and Rs 280 to companies which are engaged in the Centre's works. In West Bengal and Bihar, cement costs around Rs 100 less per bag. How is that possible?"" Gogoi asked.Last week, CM Sarbananda Sonowal held a meeting with representatives of 25 cement companies and asked them to control prices.According to a KMSS survey, the price of a cubic metre of sand has gone up from Rs 1,300 to Rs 1,600 in the city. The same amount of sand would cost around Rs 700 and Rs 980, respectively, three months ago. He added that 2,500 pieces of bricks would cost Rs 15,000 about three months ago. Now the price has increased to Rs 19,000.""Not just construction materials, pulses and mustard oil also cost more. The new government will soon complete 100 days. If we do not see any steps to arrest prices within the 100th day, we will start an agitation,"" Gogoi said."

These idols are made of red soil, organic fertilizers and seeds, which when watered during immersion, turn into regular potted plants. They start growing within a few weeks of watering. In short, the Ganesha idol takes the form of a tree after immersion.While the concept is being dubbed as one of the latest green trends in urban Maharashtra, many are unaware that several families in Khandesh (north Maharashtra) have been doing this for generations. The only difference is that the clay idols are of bulls and the farmers worship them on the occasion of Pola (Shravan Amavasya), one of the biggest agrarian festivals of India.""In Khandesh, Pola is celebrated to express gratitude not only towards the bulls but also the entire livestock. Families with farming background prepare clay idols of bulls, cows and calves every year. They use soil from farms, cow dung and mud to prepare these idols. While making these idols, they add seeds of sesame, mustard or maize in them,"" said professor Namdeo Koli from Kudgaon in Jalgaon district.""After the formal worship on the day of Pola, the farmers shift these idols to their farms and keep them at a particular place. During rain, the idols get dissolved and seeds start developing into plants. The plants are later used as fodder to cattle while their seeds are used as food,"" said Koli, who has done a proper research on the traditions of Khandesh-based farmers through North Maharashtra University.""There are many local legends associated with this tradition. But it seems the main motive is nature-worship practised in Indian culture since generations,"" he said.This year, Pola will be celebrated on August 31. Senior women in farmers' families living in Deola, Kalwan and Satana tehsils of Nashik and almost every village of Jalgaon, Nandurbar and Dhule districts have already started preparing the clay idols of cattle. Those who could not make their own idols at homes for some or the other reasons, purchase the same from village potters.Many Nashikites, who have their roots in Khandesh, follow this tradition even today. One can see a number of people from nearby villages selling such mud-made idols, mainly in white and pink, on the ghats of the Godavari.""These idols give us that homely feel as they look similar to what we used to worship in childhood, but they do not have seeds in them. These professional makers could not add seeds as they prepare idols at least two weeks in advance. The seeds could start growing into plant by the time of Pola,"" said Chandrakant Gaidhani, a resident of old city.Still, the traditional-looking and not-so-furnished raw idols of bulls are popularly worshipped by many even in cities."

(Express Photo by: Raj Kamal Jha)A Chhapra court Monday sentenced the Gandaman primary school principal to total 17 years of imprisonment in connection with the 2013 midday meal tragedy in which 23 children had died after eating poisonous soyabean curry.Additional District Judge II of the Saran court, Vijay Anand Tiwari, ruled that Mina Devi will serve 10 years in prison on charges of culpable homicide not amounting to murder (IPC Section 304) and another seven years for criminal negligence (IPC Section 308). It ruled that both sentences will run consecutively and not concurrently.The court treated it as rarest of rare case and decided to run sentences consecutively and not concurrently as done in most cases. The court has slapped a fine of Rs 2.5 lakh under Section 304 and Rs 1.25 under Section 308 on the convict, Public Prosecutor Surendra Singh told reporters.While Singh expressed satisfaction over the verdict, Mina Devi said she would challenge it in the high court.Explaining the judgment, senior Patna HC lawyer Tuhin Shankar said: Though, I have not seen Chhapra verdict, the severity of crime makes a court decide consecutive punishment.While convicting Mina Devi on August 24, the court had acquitted her on charges of murder, attempt to murder and criminal conspiracy despite the Special Investigation Team claiming that there was a strong case against her. The court, meanwhile, had acquitted Mina Devis husband, Arjun Yadav alias Arjun Rai, of all charges.The school principal, who used to store the midday meal grocery at her house, had allegedly kept mustard oil in a container that had some amount of pesticide in it. Devis husband, a sugarcane farmer, used to store pesticide at home for his sugarcane crop. On the day of the tragedy, the principal had ignored a warning by cooks and some students who had pointed out that the oil being used for cooking the soyabean curry was black in colour.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

However, if agriculture authorities are to be believed, there is no such threat to paddy crop in rest 13 blocks of the district.A couple of days back, the district agriculture authorities had informed the State Government about the possibility of crop damage in Tangarpali, Sundargarh, Lefripara and Hemgir blocks.Deputy Director of Agriculture (DDA) RN Satpathy said Tangarpali block was largely affected with inter-cultural (beusoning) operation being held up in 700-800 ha of upland and bonded upland. Similar condition prevails in rest 1,200-1,300 ha in Sundargarh, Lefripara and Hemgir blocks.He said deficit rainfall delayed the inter-cultural operations while growth of heavy weeds in affected farm fields seems to trigger less crop yield. In majority of the affected areas, roots of weeds have tightened and removing them would require huge labour and cost. Affected farmers have been advised to forgo paddy crops and plough their farm fields in September to cultivate til and mustard that are capable of surviving in residual soil moisture, he added.Satpathy said affected farmers would be supplied with subsidised seeds and claimed that there is no threat to paddy crops in rest 13 blocks as inter-cultural and transplanting operations are nearing completion.In this kharif crop season, paddy cultivation was taken up in 63,000 ha of bonded upland, 95,000 ha of medium land and 55,000 ha of low-land.Sources said in August, the district received average rainfall of around 300 mm against the months normal figure of 393.9 mm with Tangarpali getting 214 mm followed by 175 mm and 274 mm in Sundargarh and Lefripara blocks respectively.Although Hemgir block received a total of 434 mm in 27 days, the distribution was erratic with 255.6 mm received in the first week while four other days got 130 mm. But there was no rain for eight complete days and remaining eight days saw a mere total of 52 mm rainfall.Meanwhile, on request by affected farmers, Sundargarh MLA Yogesh Singh visited Tangarpali block on Saturday and assured to help them."
590473dd7be9e04154df7130,The land of picture postcard grief,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/extraordinaryissue/the-land-of-picture-postcard-grief/,2016-08-31,"Years ago, when the world was much younger and there was poetry in the air, lots of magic and music, we grew up believing we could actually change the way we were with our words and songs. And hell, we tried.I remember this young poet from Srinagar who kept writing to me, sending me his work for the tiny poetry magazine I occasionally put out. Poets have this habit of reaching out to others and sharing their work. Publishers were few in those days. Publishers of poetry even fewer. So everyone reached out to everyone and, once in a while, when I could put together some money I would publish some of them. There was no internet then. So this emerged as a small but exciting platform and gave many poets their first break. As years went by, our readers grew and the poets became famous. Other, bigger publishers picked them up.But there was something arresting about that young Kashmiri poet. There was sadness in his lines. There was hope, often reluctant. There was melancholy and longing. I began to like his poems so much that I would wait for his letters to come. For every letter brought me new poems. Through his words, his eyes I began to discover a Kashmir I had no idea about. A Kashmir very different from the boringly beautiful, picture postcard Kashmir I saw in the movies.Agha Shahid Alis Kashmir was also beautiful, but achingly so.His world was far removed from mine. His poetry was different too. He was quiet, introspective, pained. I was angry, defiant, always ready to take on the world. So, even though we wrote in the same language, were part of the same generation, and citizens of the same nation, we belonged it seemed to different worlds. His mother tongue was Urdu. My mothers tongue was Bengali. But we wrote in English, a language we both laid claim to as Indians.Bengal was on a boil at that time. Kashmir was quiet, or appeared to be. It was certainly not in the headlines. Yet his poems spoke of the anguish and pain of his people; their alienation. There was another kind of alienation taking place in Calcutta. The Naxalbari movement had torn our lives apart. Many of my classmates had vanished into the countryside, in search of a new politics. I had quit Presidency College and, while I was struggling to make ends meet, I knew my destiny lay somewhere in the dark, desperate universe of the written word. So I wrote furiously. Love poems. Angry poems. Poems of protest. I was lucky; there were publishers ready to bring out my books. But I knew it was not easy for others. So I tried to publish as many of them as I could.And then the Emergency came. Our lives changed. Poets and writers went to jail. I turned to journalism and lost contact with Agha Shahid Ali.Today, as Kashmir stays locked down for days and so many lives are lost in this agonizing conflict between the people of the Valley and those who want to rule over their sad, incomplete lives I remember his words. For even though he left Srinagar and went away to the US to teach and write, he remains one of the most original voices of Kashmir. His words are still with me 15 years after he passed away. His melancholic poems still haunt me. For he knew how Kashmir ached, long before we bothered to find out.Listen to him:Again Ive returned to this countrywhere a minaret has been entombed.Someone soaks the wicks of clay lampsin mustard oil, each night climbs its stepsto read messages scratched on planets.His fingerprints cancel bank stampsin that archive for letters with doomedaddresses, each house buried or empty.Empty? Because so many fled, ran away,and became refugees there, in the plains,where they must now will a final dewfallto turn the mountains to glass. Theyll seeus through themsee us frantically buryhouses to save them from fire that, like a wallcaves in. The soldiers light it, hone the flames,burn our world to sudden papier-mchinlaid with gold, then ash. When the muezzindied, the city was robbed of every Call.The houses were swept about like leavesfor burning. Now every night we buryour housestheirs, the ones left empty.We are faithful. On their doors we hang wreaths.More faithful each night fire again is a walland we look for the dark as it caves in.The poem is from his book The Country without a Post Office. Post offices no longer exist. We talk on email. But in Kashmir the internet stays switched off. Voices get silenced every day."

""We have come here to seek Nitish Kumar's intervention at national level to prevent the introduction of GM mustard. He had earlier vehemently opposed the introduction of Brinjal in 2011,"" Kuruganti said.She said the application for introduction of GM mustard is in advanced stage of processing by the regulators. ""After the moratorium on Brinjal, more scientific evidence emerged to show that GMs are unsafe and unwarranted,"" she added.Kuruganti said ASHA will continue to oppose the corporatization of agriculture, chemical utilization and free trade. ""We feel Bihar CM is the right person because he understands the repercussion of the GM crops which have an adverse impact on the environment and lead to heavy lobbying and corporatization of agriculture. World over, the activists are working towards prevention of genetically modified crops,"" she added.The ASHA member claimed that the current sets of three GM mustard are herbicide tolerant crops. But the GM application does not declare them so, nor test them in the context of herbicide tolerant crops. Rapid emergence of super weeds (weeds that cannot be killed by herbicides anymore) due to excessive use of herbicide tolerant GM crops is well documented, so are the impacts on beneficial non targets like bees and butterflies and soil microbes.""Genetic engineering is an unnatural and imprecise breeding technology. There is much scientific evidence to show that it is unstable, unpredictable, irreversible and uncontrollable technology. Environmental release of GMs increase risk in agriculture and takes away choices of both the farmers and consumers,"" said Kuruganti."
58ff24527be9e0420db2d705,The gift of rising prices,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160901/jsp/northeast/story_105604.jsp,2016-09-01,"It seems the Independence Day celebrations have provided a new domain of freedom to prices of essential items, apparently embarrassing the party in power. The BJP, a fierce critic of the unprecedented price rise during the Congress rule, had promised to maintain the prices of the essential commodities. Despite the increase in VAT, they promised the people of Assam that markets would be under strict control. The picture seemed different when I entered the Azara bazar. To my utter surprise, the prices of vegetables, poultry and fresh fish had skyrocketed in the past 15 days. Mohammad Ismail, a vegetable vendor, however, said the high prices of vegetables at this time of the year was nothing new. Cauvery Barkakati, the deputy commissioner of Hojai district, said she had been examining this phenomenon from market to market in her district in accordance with the directive received from chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal to monitor prices. If we go by the views of Ismail, how do we justify the rise in prices of rice, pulses, mustard oil and for that matter even cement? The situation reminds me of Naseeruddin Shah's statement in the film A Wednesday!, ""Hame ghar chalana hai saab (We have to run our families, sir)."" With the BJP-led government completing 100 days in office and with ministers waiting in queue to submit their report cards to the people like schoolchildren trying to draw the attention of their teacher, a volley of questions is certainly around the corner. We agree that 100 days is no time to make a significant mark, nor can it be a genuine assessment of the government's performance. The chief minister has claimed that in the 100 days, his government has come nearer to the people. Though the euphoria of ""Congress- mukt Assam"" seems to be almost over, somewhere down the line it is still marginally felt across the state. The 100 days could be a point of drawing the BJP's attention towards the fulfilment of their obligations and promises to the people. The unprecedented price rise may be attributed to various reasons. There has always been a macro-explanation that globalisation has reshaped and repositioned the State in such a way that it is no longer in a position to maintain its control over the market. The market has turned out to be such a robust institution that even the State has become subordinate to it. The BJP leadership and the government have to be commended for the maturity demonstrated in trying not to politicise the communal issue. But at the same time the template the BJP had successfully built up prior to the Assembly elections, highlighting the very question of the Assamese identity seems to be gradually disintegrating. No doubt the ministers will reel out statistics like receiving crude oil royalty, an exclusive tea park in Guwahati, dredging of the Brahmaputra (with funding from World Bank) or the proposed Chief Minister's Samagra Gramya Unnayan Yojana. The government has also received Rs 200 crore sanctioned for Diphu Medical College. But the people and the youth in particular are still expecting something on the job front. There should also be focus on the alarming issue of unprecedented floods this year. Is it not time that we have a national policy and perspective on flood, erosion and other natural calamities that threaten the region every year?

Here are some Ganesh devotees who have gone the extra mile to celebrate the festival in an extraordinary manner.Idols made of cow dungKeeping environmental concerns in mind and to raise awareness about water pollution, students of KPB Hinduja College of Commerce, Charni Road, along with volunteers of NGO Surbhi Kutir Udyog Foundation have made water-soluble idols from cow manure this year. The money earned from the sale of these idols will be distributed among artisans and villagers to encourage them to adopt and take care of non-milking cows. To take this social initiative further, the students have undertaken a social media campaign on platforms such as Facebook and WhatsApp, said Dr Minu Madlani, the colleges principal.These idols are not as environmentally damaging as the plaster of Paris ones. Besides, when they dissolve, they will provide nutrients to aquatic plants and animals. The idols have been kept for sale on the college premises. Its prices will start from Rs150, said Madlani.Eco-friendly spicy idolA Ganpati idol made using discarded newspapers and rice starch in Malad and decorated with Indian spices such as clove, cinnamon, chilly, cardamom and mustard seeds. (HT Photo)Keeping with the legacy of making creative eco-friendly idols for the past five years, members of Shree Sai Darshan Mitra Nandal, Malad (West), have made an idol using pulp from discarded newspapers and rice starch. Whats more, the idol has been decorated with Indian spices such as clove, cinnamon, chilly, cardamom and mustard seeds.Weighing approximately 190 kgs, the idol consists of nine kg clove, 20 kg cinnamon, six kg cardamom, two kg chilly and a kg of mustard seeds.It took us over a month to put together the idol, said Montu Ruia, organiser of the mandal. The Spice Ganesha idol will also educate children about different spices used in Indian foods. Over the years, we have made idols of wax, chocolate, toy cars, erasers and pencils, among others.Also read: Ganesh mandals want jetty, boats at Girgaum Chowpatty for idol immersionDonate pens and books, not jewelleryMoving away from the traditional donations such as gold and silver this year, a Ghatkopar-based mandal has asked all its devotees to donate a book and pen during their visit.Members of Parshiwadi Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal, Ghatkopar (West), will be distributing all books and pens they collect through donations among less fortunate students across schools in the city and hand over some of the books to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation to distribute them among civic schools.We are expecting a minimum of 60 books and pens per day from devotees, said Onkar Sawant, secretary of the mandal. We have a small 5-ft idol this year and we want the theme for this years celebrations to be the importance of education for all.A 6 ft papier mch idolResidents of Vikhroli (East), part of the Phirozshah Nagar Sarvajanik Ganeshotsav Mandal, are the first ones to go eco-friendly and have been celebrating the festival by taking environmentally conscious measures for the past three years. This year, the mandal ordered a 6-ft Ganesh idol from sculptors at Kurla that put together a frame of bamboo sticks stuck together using natural gum. The idol was created using a mash of tissue paper and newsprint as environment comes first for Ganpati organisers.The entire pandal has too been decorated using only recyclable material such as cardboard and natural colours. We avoided using any material that could pollute the environment, said Swapnali Chavan, a member of the mandal, adding, The idol will be immersed in an artificial pond at Bhandup on the 10th day of the festival.Bringing a chocolatey GaneshaRintu Rathod with the 5-feet-tall chocolate Ganesha idol she made. (HT Photo)A resident of Santacruz, Rintu Rathod, a baker by profession, has made a 50-kg chocolate Ganesha that stands five-feet tall. While the idol has been made with chocolate, the jewellery and other adornments ave been painted with food colours. This is third consecutive year when she has made the chocolate Ganesha, which is a major attraction for children from her neighbouring areas.The idol will be immersed in around 100 litres of milk on the fifth day of the festival. The idea is to share the chocolate milk with underprivileged children from across Mumbai, said Rathod, who took nearly six days to make the idol.Idols stuffed with fish foodThe nine-inch idols that are although made of clay but have vegetarian fish food in them have been made as part of the God Save the Ocean campaign. (HT Photo)A city-based group has created an alternative to plaster of Paris, clay and paper mch idols by sculpting idols from corn and vegetable powder  ingredients that can easily decompose in water and can be food for aquatic organisms  and coloured with organic substances such as turmeric, chandan and geru (coloured soil).Sprouts Environmental Trust along with college students from Mumbai have made the nine-inch idols as part of the God Save the Ocean campaign. After the amazing response we received last year when we made 120 idols, we decided to increase the number by 40% this year, said Anand Pendharkar, the groups founder . The exterior of the idol is made of clay, but the cavity contains vegetarian fish food. The colour used to paint the idol is natural as opposed to paints on PoP idols that could contain toxic metals.The group also trained 200 students from various city colleges to make their own idols this year.Green immersionThe idol made with red soil, organic fertilisers and shadu clay and filled with holy basil (tulsi) or ladyfinger seeds that will grow into a plant after immersion. (HT Photo)Lower Parel resident Dattadri Kothur has sculpted unique eco-friendly Ganpati idols that are filled with seeds. With 400 idols this year, Kothurs concept is by far the most unique as he makes them with red soil, organic fertilisers and shadu clay filled with holy basil (tulsi) or ladyfinger seeds that will grow into a plant after immersion. Made atop earthen pots with a base of red soil with size ranging between 12 and 20 inches, each idol is filled with 15 seeds.In place of broken idols littered across beaches in Mumbai, I wanted to create an idol that gives something back to worshippers, said Kothur, who calls these idols Tree Ganesha. It takes about seven to eight days for the idol to completely dissolve in the 18X5-inch pots. However, the seeds begin sprouting by day five. Holy basil and ladyfinger seeds were chosen because they grow the fastest, he said."

The committees report has been put in public domain inviting comments from all stake holders.From the toxicity and allerginicity studies, it was concluded that the GE mustard, the parental lines and hybrid DMH-11, does not raise any public health or safety concerns for human beings and animals with respect to overall nutritional characteristics, said the 133-page report.Civil society groups have been opposing clearance to the GM Mustard on several grounds including serious concerns with male sterility and herbicide tolerance and inadequate testing.The report says that although GE mustard hybrid DMH-11 contains the bargene, conferring resistance to herbicide Basta (Phosphinotricin), it is not exhibited as a functional trait till Basta is sprayed on the plants.In any case, farmers are not required to spray Basta in the hybrid GE DMH-11 field for weed control as Basta is not a recommended herbicide in the package of practices for mustard cultivation in India, it said.It further said that food and environmental biosafety assessment did not reveal any measurable risk, for sustained use of technology in breeding for newer hybrids some post-release monitoring precautionary measure like honey bee behavior be conducted."

The current biosafety assessment itself appears quite inadequate in establishing the safety of a GMOs release into the environment, said Kavitha Kuruganti of ASHA, an alliance of several NGOs.The subcommittee has found that no harm to environment and health is posed by the mustard hybrid, DMH-11 developed by Delhi University former Vice Chancellor Deepak Pental led Centre for Genetic Manipulation and Crop Plants (CGMCP).Given that any environmental release of GMOs is also a release into a socio-politico-economic space, the letter pointed out that risk assessment should be beyond technical aspects and should adequately and comprehensively assess impacts that are socio-cultural-economic, and begin with a needs and alternatives assessment.As you are aware, transgenic technology is also about livelihood security, trade security, seed and food sovereignty. Socio-Economic Considerations are an integral part of Risk Assessment even in the Cartagena Biosafety Protocol to which India is a signatory, it added.The civil society groups also wanted the government to assess that whether there are mechanisms or regimes in place which ensure that choices of farmers and consumers are protected and upheld like segregation and labeling, liability-redressal-remediation and ensuring that state government decisions are not violated by any decision that the Central Regulators take.In the absence of any other inter-ministerial as well as State-Centre level institution to regulate on these grounds, and given that GEAC is regulating transgenics without well worked out policy directives, and also given that many of these matters are sub-judice, the group requested GEAC not to give approvals or safety certificates for open release of GMOs including for field trials."

That was not done. The GEAC appointed the sub-committee to draft the report so the report should have come to us first. Also, this is not the biosafety study, it is only an assessment of the main study. This information is scanty. I think the ministry is superseding the system,"" he told TOI. GEAC is the apex body on GM crops.MoEF states on their website that the assessment published is an abridged version of the entire biosafety data which will be available only at the MoEF office, on appointment, only during work hours. But anti-GM activists who had demanded the entire biosafety data under RTI recently, said the ministry's actions are in complete violation of the Central Information Commission's (CIC) April 6 order.CIC had said ""this public authority is attempting to keep vital information out of public discussion. It amounts to prevention of constitutionally guaranteed freedom of speech and expression of the appellant, who are interested in discussing the pros and cons of GMO related issues of GM Mustard, which if permitted would cause serious impact to public health,"" CIC also show-caused the ministry as to why maximum penalty should not be imposed on officials or not divulging data.Kavitha Kuruganti, a member of the GM free coalition said ""They are asking people to take an appointment to go look at the vast information at their office. The ministry held a meeting with civil society organisations on July 18 but never uploaded the minutes or even shared the minutes with us."" Many activists and scientists were even more shocked when they couldn't print or copy text from the sub-committee's report that has been uploaded on Monday. ""First they don't share the entire report and now they have made it impossible to print it too,"" said another activist.Bhargava who is also SC nominee to GEAC said ""the assessment doesn't tell us on what basis the sub-committee has arrived at their decision that the crop is safe.""A senior official of GEAC denied the allegations. ""I don't know what Mr Bhargava is referring to. Findings of the report were discussed with all members. Mr Bharagava did raise some additional queries,"" she said adding that ""the entire biosafety information cannot be released because it runs into 4,000 pages. People can come to our office to look at it but they will be not allowed to print or copy from it. As far as printing the abridged version is concerned, we are trying to make it printable.""Several stakeholders including farmers have raised concerns about the process of approval. Rampal Jat, president of Maha Kisan Panchayat had said ""BJP's 2014 election manifesto had promised clearly that GM crops will be brought in only after full scientific evaluation of their impacts on citizens and environment - but that's not being done."" If cleared, GM mustard will be the first transgenic food crop in India. It's developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP), Delhi University."

This strain has been developed by a team of scientists at Delhi University. It uses a system of genes from common non-pathogenic bacteria that makes mustard better suited to hybridisation. If given the final clearance, DMH-11 would be the first GM food crop in Indian fields. As of now, the environment ministry has made the biosafety report of DMH-11 public for scrutiny and comments.The history of GM crops in India has been a turbulent one. Much of this has been because of politics rather than science. In 2010, GEAC had cleared Bt brinjal. But its commercial release had been over-ruled by then environment minister Jairam Ramesh following opposition from civil society groups. For a certain section of activists continue to believe that commercialisation of GM crops will harm biodiversity, negatively affect farmers livelihood, and lead to market monopolies in seeds and loss of food sovereignty. Some of these fears have been brought on by Indias experience with Bt cotton. Cotton yield more than doubled since Bt cottons introduction in 2002. But subsequent controversies over pricing and intellectual property rights made people wary.However, theres a need to untangle the policy issues from the science of GM crops. And the science is unequivocal that GM crops can be safe, sustainable and desirable. For example, a 2014 analysis of GM field trials across the world by researchers at University of Gottingen, Germany, found that use of GM technology boosted crop yields by 22% and reduced chemical pesticides by 37%. As far as introduction of GM mustard is concerned, every year India imports millions of tonnes of soyabean and rapeseed oil originating in GM crops.Adoption of GM crops ought to be a pivotal strategy in increasing agriculture yields and ensuring Indias food security  launching a much-needed second Green Revolution. But for that to happen politics needs to be kept at bay with science forming the sole basis of formulating policies regarding GM crops. With hunger still a major challenge, government needs to ensure an enabling environment for GM technology research and adoption."

However, GEACs decisions can always be negated by the Union Environment minister as was done in the case of Bt brinjal around six years ago.After the Bt eggplant, the genetically engineered mustard, which claims to have higher yield than conventional varieties is the second GM food crop under the governments consideration for commercial release. Currently the only GM crop allowed for cultivation is Bt cotton.Based on the history of safe use of the host and donor organisms, transgene expression analysis, composition analysis, acute and subchronic toxicity assays of purified proteins and whole leaf and seed respectively, it can be concluded that the use of leaves, seed and oil derived from GE mustard line is not likely to pose any risk to humans and animals, says the report on the assessment of food and environment safety for environmental release of genetically engineered mustard (DMH-11).The GM oil seed is based on three genes  bar, barnase and barstar  which were used in rapeseed for 20 years with no adverse effects. The mustard oil does not contain any proteins, which are expressed in either negligible or non-detectable quantities in the edible parts of the plant.The report also made it clear that how the GM mustard experienced a large number of regulatory tests since 2003 when the first field trial took place. The last two rounds of biosafety trials took place between 2010-12 at three locations (BRL-1) and 2014-15 at three sites (BRL-2). None of them showed any adverse effects.Anti-GM groups, however, continue to oppose the GM mustard, which it said will harm agriculture. The activists claim the report does not carry raw data and details of the protocol for any independent scrutiny. The ministry said that detailed biosafety data is available for anyone to examine."

Pradhan told HT he voluntarily sat out of all meetings concerning GM mustard. So there is no question of conflict of the interest, he said.A GM crop is one in which a gene has been altered for new traits, such as pest resistance or nutritional value. GM mustard, a public-sector developed variety, is the second transgenic food to come up for regulatory approval after BT brinjal, which was indefinitely suspended by the previous UPA government despite being cleared by the GEAC.Regulators linked to industry-backed non-profits or who have been privately funded GM developers said they were open about their affiliations. They denied any ethical problem because they acted in accordance with the regulators rules. Critics however say this is a serious case of a compromised regulatory framework.Such officials include the GEAC co-chair K Veluthambi, B Sesikeran, a nutrition scientist, and crop scientist SR Rao.Rao is on the Golden Rice Humanitarian Board funded by an agri-business MNC, among others. Sesikeran is a member of the International Life Sciences Institute (ILSI), a global non-profit partly funded by firms to promote science in agriculture, including GM technologies. According to its website, ILSIs funding comes primarily from its corporate membership and supporting companies. These include GM crop companies.Being a regulator doesnt mean you are here to destroy GM science. If you are an airline regulator, does it mean you have to destroy the airline sector? We are here to promote GM science and there is nothing secret about it, only thing it has to be scientifically sound and safe, Sesikeran said.GEAC co-chair Veluthambi is a scientist behind a GM rice project. Both Veluthambi and Rao could not be reached for comments. However, their colleague Pradhan said: How can you go on suspecting public scientists? GEAC has to depend on the same scientists because they are the only ones available.Mere stepping out of meetings does not address the problem of conflict of interest, said Kavitha Kuruganti, who represents an anti-GM advocacy group. According to her, the regulatory body needs risk-assessment experts as regulators, not GM crop developers.There is only one reason why modern biotechnology needs regulation  that of protecting us from risks. That function is not being fulfilled with industry-affiliated and other crop developers working as regulators, Kuruganti said."

They have kept working away at genetically modified (GM) crops despite much Kafkaesque red tape, regulator uncertainty and political opposition. Remember that in more than a decade since Bt cotton was introduced here, not a single new GM crop has been approved for commercial cultivation  and even field trials have faced a huge struggle.But light can again be seen at the end of the tunnel. A technical sub-committee of the regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee, has given the safety nod to a GM variety of mustard: The risk assessment performed after examining and considering the existing information in literature and data provided in the dossier submitted by the developers, against the background of available knowledge in the subject areas, it is clear that GE mustard lines Varuna bn 3.6, EH-2 modbs 2.99 and the hybrid DMH-11 do not pose any risk of causing any adverse effects on human and animal health and safety.The environment ministry which houses the regulator has put this risk assessment report in the public domain, seeking suggestions over the next 30 days. Unless these suggestions provide evidence of some way in which bio-safety has been ignored, GEAC should recommend the new GM mustard lines for commercial cultivation, and the environment ministry should approve the recommendation."

Other than the overburdened donkey, we see sewing machines and kitchen implements.Ranjeeta Kumaris first solo, Labour of the Unseen  Sujani  Nihilism in the Craft , which is on at Clark House, Colaba, looks at workers who toil endlessly so that our lives function without a hitch. The 33-year-old artist asks the urban milieu to reconsider the dismissal of this labour force  their lives, hopes and ambitions  and the claim that they exist only to increase slum populations and demand pay raises every year. Through videos, installations of borrowed, bartered or found objects and photographs, and a collaboration with her mother, Kaushalya Devi, Kumari shifts the view to what she terms the labour of the unseen.Kumaris impulse comes from her own life-experiences and the views of her Marxist father. Born and raised in Patnas Harijan colony, Kumari was one of the few children with access to education. Growing up with the inequities her community faces, she found herself keenly following the lives of people in the Domkhana, near the Patna College of Arts & Crafts, where she completed her Bachelors in Fine Arts. The Domkhana (colloquially an informal settlement of the untouchable caste, Doms) was filled with cane craftspersons who made objects for religious and ritualistic ceremonies at low prices. However, they were shunned by the very people who used the objects.Motifs of artThese experiences seem to be the crux of what drives the conversation in Labour of the Unseen. The show begins with a series of watercolour paintings of the donkey, bringing to mind the most common words associated with it: labour, transport, lazy, stubborn. The well-executed portraits (one of them even brings to mind Raghu Rais famous portrait of a donkey) set the tone of what is to come: a donkey is often more useful than a horse, but still considered somewhat secondary to the horses beauty and taciturn nature.The motifs the artist uses are fairly self-evident, but at times so removed from urban reality that they throw the viewer off for a minute. Other than the often-overburdened donkey, we see sewing machines, water drums, construction tools and implements from the Indian kitchen. When we visited the show, at least three other people in the gallery at the time could not recall the word for the chakla , the flat circular board on which chapatis are rolled across India.Cultural evolutionsThe donkeys lead us to meditations on the evolution of cultures. The famed Grand Trunk Road, a 2,500-km stretch from Kabul in Afghanistan to Tamralipti in West Bengal during the Mauryan Empire, exists in modern forms and is still in use. It passes Dadri in Uttar Pradesh (most recently in the news for the beef-related murder of Mohammed Akhlaq in 2015), where Kumari completed an MFA at the Shiv Nadar University.Like an archaeologist, Kumari leaves us snapshots of items used by the worker, by the former farmer, by the now-mechanic, without so much as a trace of the person it may belong to.Take the series of photographs and installations around economic activity in Dadri, where she saw tradition clash with industry in an obvious way. Photographs of small mechanical repair shops cover the wall: a series titledTools(2016). Shops now run by those who have given up or lost their access to farmlands or cant survive on income from farming alone due to various inequities.Tools of tradeFurther ahead, another set of photos,Marks on the Land(2016), documents marks left by construction on a patch of land. Each new set of marks (messy tyre treads from trucks mixed with construction dirt moving to cemented order) feels like it is erasing its predecessor, making you wonder: does the cemented patch remember the dirt patch it used to be?And so it goes as you take in the stacks of bindas : or rolled up scraps of cloth and cement bags labourers stack on their heads as ballast when they carry heavy objects. The installation Unseen City (2016) is accompanied by recorded interviews with labourers whom the artist bartered with for their bindas. The artist recounts how she at first tried to make them new ones, but they preferred their own techniques and began to ask for cloth and material to make new ones of their own. Along with the installation are a set of photographs: items of daily use by the labourer: a tiffin, a gamchha , and so on.Farming of the Fundamentalis more direct. It references the Constitution of India, speaking of the inspiration and hope it and the writings of Dr. Ambedkar induced in a person born to a lower caste background.Kumari also speaks of the dislocation and dissonance felt by those who worked on farmlands slowly turning into a township.The video shows us a clay replica of the Constitution, in which she plants mustard seeds. The video documents the growth of the seeds into plants over three months and how they eventually die out. There is a touch of confusion in what the dying out could imply, but imagining the once-bright fields of mustard (and jowar and bajra) makes you think back to a time when your own hometown (or, in my case, Mumbai) used to be a patchwork of farmland surrounding a station and administrative buildings.A few works in between falter: the drawings of the river, while quite exquisite, dont quite lend to the context as well. The chakla , on its own plinth, retelling a conversation between the artist and her mother: is the world your home or is the home your world? It sits with a sari Kumari has block-printed with images of old sewing machines (a lot like the ones seen in theTools) and a sujani (quilt) hand-made by the artist and her mother. The sujani is a reminder of more unseen labour, womens labour, which is seen and registered even less. Together, these three somehow lack the impact ofAcross the Line, a tightly shot video of the artists mothers hands grinding daily masala (turmeric, red chilly powder) on a grindstone. Once again, evidence that speaks to the labourer a lot more than perhaps the chakla, which seems simplistic in response. In some places, the work feels it lacks contextualisation and one wonders if there need to be notes on hand for a better understanding of the work and the spaces it inhabits. However, these are small infractions that a lengthier viewing might address.The show is not just a little victory for the fairly young Shiv Nadar University, with its faculty of contemporary artists, but also a witnessing of thoughts and work from the Indian heartland that throw up challenges to an urban perspective.Labour of the Unseen  Sujani  Nihilism in the Craft will show at Clark House, Colaba, till September 29.The author is a freelance writer"

Various products of the banana plant are included in such celebrations, with fodi from ripe bananas being a common food item served at such occasions. A now not-so-commonly-used product of the plant, though, is the flower of the banana fruit, or keli bondi.For many families in Goa, a dish made from this banana flower is a must in the plate of food offerings made to Lord Ganesh , and so the keli bondi is a commonly sold item even today at matoli markets.It takes some effort to collect the consumable part of this large, purple-coloured bondi and is possibly the reason the upkari made from it is reserved only for special occasions.On removing the outer purple layer of the flower, tiny, yellow-headed florets can be seen, which have to be collected for the dish. One has to keep peeling these layers to gather the florets, until the inner part of the flower, which is nearly white in colour, is reached. This tender part of the bondi has to be finely chopped for the upkari. The florets, too, have to be similarly finely chopped, but not before they are 'cleaned'.""Each of the little flowers have to be gently opened to pull out the growth inside, which resembles a matchstick. This has to come out along with its stem as this part doesn't cook . Don't forget to apply coconut oil on your palms before cleaning and cutting the banana flower in order to prevent discolouration of the skin. The chopped bondi has to be left in water, with salt added to it, for about half an hour,"" Sushma Lotlikar , a homemaker from Margao , says.After 30 minutes, the chopped bondi must be squeezed dry and the water discarded.""Cook tur dal till flaky. It should not be mushy like when it is cooked for preparing dal. Keep this tur dal aside. Heat oil and add mustard seeds, cumin seeds, hing, dry chillies and bay leaves. Once the fonn is ready, add the chopped bondi and let it cook. Once the bondi is cooked, add the cooked tur dal, grated coconut, salt and a hint of jaggery to it. Let it cook for a bit and the banana bondi bhaji is ready,"" says Lotlikar.Tur dal can be replaced with other pulses as well, depending on each individual's choice.This upkari is used as a side-dish in a fully vegetarian meal, which includes varan, rice and other veggies, during festivities.So, if you have the banana plant in your garden, make sure that it is used to the optimum."

Activist organisations from Greenpeace to the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture have protested over decades that using herbicide-tolerant genes in plants locks farmers into using select brands of agrochemicals.Dr. Pental, however, said such an argument was bizarre. Germany uses four times more herbicide than India  There is no agriculture without herbicide in Western countries  even in countries that swear by organic farming, he told The Hindu .Enables hybridisationDr. Pental perfected a system over two decades that allows seed companies to develop hybrid mustard varieties more easily. This is done using a system already perfected in the 1990s and employed in Canada to make hybrid versions of rapeseed, he said.Two genes  that were not patented in India  called barnase and barstar are used to make mustard varieties more amenable to becoming hybrids. Crossing Indian and East European varieties of mustard improves their yield.Weve perfected this system  and I have only applied for an Indian patent, Dr. Pental said.With these, Indian seed companies can take wild mustard varieties, those that have generally been hard to make into hybrids, and tweak them to develop new kinds of mustard that could be made to yield more oil or more seeds.The third gene, called the bar gene, was necessary because when seeds varieties are crossed to make hybrids, only a fixed proportion of the next generation of seeds carry all the desirable genes.Spraying these seeds with the herbicide Basta would ensure only the right kind of seed remained."

Today, at 12, the soft spoken son of a milkman is one of the most talked about golfers in his age group. After having won a series of tournaments in different parts of the world, Shubham bagged the World Junior title in Pinehurst, North Carolina, in the US last month. ""I had won many tournaments before, but this one in the US was like a dream coming true,"" Shubham told The Telegraph on Wednesday. ""Twice before I finished runners-up in the world junior meet in my age group. This time, I was determined to return home with the winners' trophy,"" he added. ""Everyone else in the area where I come from are wrestlers. My grandfather advised me to pursue a different sport. So I started playing golf in a mustard field. From there I have come a long way...

58ff15327be9e0420db2c65c,Anti-GM activists question safety assessment by green ministry panel',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160916/jsp/nation/story_108521.jsp,2016-09-16,"New Delhi, Sept. 15: Activists opposing genetically-modified (GM) crops claimed today that a Union government panel had raised ""serious questions"" about GM-mustard under appraisal for cultivation, but labelled it as safe for human and animal consumption without receiving adequate answers. The Coalition for a GM-free India has claimed that documents made public by the Union environment ministry suggest that a subcommittee constituted by the ministry's regulatory panel on GM products had raised serious questions then turned away meekly without any scientific or satisfactory answers. The environment ministry had earlier this month invited public comments on the subcommittee's observations that the GM mustard developed by plant biologists at the University of Delhi is safe for human and animal consumption and does not raise public health or safety concerns. The ministry's Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the regulatory body to examine applications for release of GM products, had set up the eight-member subcommittee to examine the safety and performance dossiers of the GM mustard. ""The subcommittee made some hard observations and even hinted at additional studies required. However, there is no evidence in its report that all such questions have been answered, observations responded to, and new analysis presented,"" the Coalition for GM-Free India said in a statement released today. The University of Delhi scientists have claimed that laboratory studies and field trials suggest that their GM mustard promises 25 per cent to 30 per cent higher yields than standard cultivated mustard varieties and will thus help reduce India's edible oil imports. The Coalition said its analysis of the minutes of GEAC meetings and the subcommittee's assessment of food and environmental safety report does not explain how the subcommittee gave a clean chit to the GM mustard after raising various concerns, including issues relating to possible toxicity and impact on soil bacteria. ""The procedures through which this subcommittee declared the GM mustard as safe have been opaque and unexplained,"" said Kavitha Kuruganti, a member of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, a part of the Coalition for GM-free India. ""The subcommittee needs to explain its observations after raising questions."" Professor K Veluthambi, professor of plant biotechnology at the Madurai Kamaraj University, Madurai, who chaired the subcommittee, said the GEAC will take into account all such comments and concerns and respond appropriately. He declined to respond to queries about the specific questions the subcommittee had raised. The Union environment ministry has set October 5 as the deadline for public responses to the subcommittee's proposal for the authorisation of the release of GM mustard for cultivation. ""The process of appraisal is still under way, the GEAC will examine these issues and will respond,"" Veluthambi told The Telegraph. The mustard from the University of Delhi is the second edible GM crop that Indian regulators are assessing for possible commercial cultivation after a similar exercise with GM brinjal in 2009-2010. The environment ministry under former Union minister Jairam Ramesh had imposed a moratorium on GM brinjal after activists and some scientists questioned claims that the plant had adequately cleared all required environmental and biosafety assessment studies. The moratorium has disappointed sections of the biotechnology industry that believes India must invest in GM crops to improve yields and feed its population. India, which allowed the cultivation of GM cotton in 2002, has seen dramatic yield increases in cotton over the past decade. Crop biotechnology scientists say GM crops will be essential to boost yields."

The cultural event will include performances by poet Sambhaji Bhagat and a qawali troupe.Tourism Minister Kapil Mishra said the government is organising the festival to make the public aware of its stand on GM mustard.The government also plans to invite State Agriculture Ministers, religious and political leaders, and members of Parliament and Legislative Assemblies to give their views on mustard.GM mustard has reportedly been given a safety stamp by a technical sub-committee of Indias apex regulatory body called Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee [GEAC]. The GEAC is collecting public feedback till October 5 on the report of the sub-committee before taking a final decision, a Delhi government spokesperson said.The Delhi government, given the various technical and other concerns pertaining to the safety and other issues related to GM mustard, has already taken a stand against any potential approval for its commercial cultivation.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia has written to the Prime Minister elaborating these concerns and urged him not to compromise with the livelihoods of farmers, agriculture, the health of citizens and the environment in any manner."

PHOTO: AFPIslamic State (IS) forces have fired crude chemical weapons at U.S. troops in Iraq, the Pentagon has confirmed, a startling disclosure that U.S. officials promptly downplayed as resulting in no deaths or injuries.The attack came from a powdered mustard agent delivered in a mortar or rocket shell and fired on U.S. forces on Tuesday at the Qayyarah West air base near Mosul. The air base, recaptured from the IS in July, is a pivotal staging ground for a highly anticipated attack on Mosul.Mustard weaponMustard, a banned chemical weapon, is most dangerous when concocted in a gas form, but Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman stated on Wednesday evening that tests performed indicated that the IS had delivered the imprecise and crude weapon in a powdered state.The use of chemical weapons on U.S. forces, however ineffectual, raised ominous echoes of the ultimately false rationale cited by the George W. Bush administration for invading and occupying Iraq from 2003 to 2011. While Saddam Hussein turned out to have destroyed his chemical stockpiles before the invasion, some older unconventional weaponry had survived and was used on a handful of U.S. soldiers and marines, T he New York Times has reported .Precursor materialsSome chemical agents and precursor materials for their manufacture had been stored on Iraqi territory formerly controlled by IS. The U.S. military has insisted since 2014 that there is no evidence IS obtained access to them. Alternatively, some of Syrian President Bashar Al-Assads substantial chemical stocks have been known to survive a 2013 agreement brokered by Russia and backed by the U.S. for their destruction.Although the indirect-fire attack did not harm U.S. forces, it appeared to foreshadow what U.S. and Iraqi forces are in for when the long-delayed offensive to retake the vital city of Mosul begins.

It accused the committee of thrusting a toxic product on the people, disregarding its impact on future generations.The letter addressed to Amita Prasad, Chair, GEAC, pointed out that GEAC had sought public feedback on the new variety without releasing the full biosafety data. Only the Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety (AFES) document has been published on the official website. It does not have details of the study protocols or data generated, on which feedback is being sought.Describing GM mustard as a Trojan Horse for other GMOs, the Coalition for a GM-free India, an informal network of advocacy groups, has alleged that the field tests were fraudulent, unscientific, inadequate and unreliable. It said there was evidence that various tests required to assess risks and impact had not been performed and the claims of yield increase were rigged.A public interest document issued by the group said the government was seeking the environmental release of GM mustard without declaring it as a herbicide tolerant (HT) crop. Use of HT crops results in more herbicide use and higher toxic residues in food, it prevents mixed cropping, and damages crops in neighbouring farms.The coalition said the biotech regulator had allowed the crop developers to prescribe test protocols for themselves and failed to publish the results for public scrutiny.Calling for the publication of the full biosafety data on the website, Programme Director, Thanal, R.Sridhar said, The government cannot expect every citizen to visit the ministry to access the data. Why have all these restrictions? What is the government hiding?Noting that the 30 days given for submission of feedback was totally inadequate, Mr. Sridhar demanded extension of the deadline to 90 days from the day the full biosafety dossier was published on the website."

While this smaller sour variety of ambade are found during the winter months, the larger ones, known as godd ambade, are available earlier in the year  during the latter half of the monsoons.As the name suggests, godd ambade have only a hint of the sourness its better known relative carries. And if one still feels like relishing ambyachem sansanv after the mango season is over, the sweet-sour godd ambade make for perfect replacement.The matoli markets set up during Ganesh Chaturthi are where one is sure to find these hog plums as godd ambadyachem sansanv is a preparation many families offer during the festivities. This version of the sansanv bears a stronger taste than the one made from mangoes, with the sweetness, sourness, coarseness of the gravy all heightened to make for a pleasurable assault on the tongue.""Wash and skin the godd ambade and cut each into four pieces as these ambade are bigger in size to cook them whole. Its fibrous part is softer than in the smaller variety too and is easy to cut through. Boil these pieces in water with salt added to it. Once boiled, drain the water and some of its sourness goes out with this water,"" says Margao-based housewife Shobha Kare.Water and salt are added in smaller quantities again to the ambade, along with jaggery this time, and it has to be cooked further. In the meantime, roast urad dal in oil along with few seeds of fenugreek and dry chili. These ingredients are to be ground along with grated coconut and turmeric powder into a coarse paste. This masala is then added to the ambade that are cooked in water and jaggery.It is the fenugreek seeds that add the aroma to the dish, while these fenugreek seeds together with the urad dal will give the preparation its coarse texture.A fonn of bay leaves and mustard seeds complete the dish. There are other variations of the sansanv with some adding hing to it, says Preeti Madkaiker of Santa Cruz.Godd ambadyachem sansanv is not to be mixed up with the more popular ambadyachem karamb, made during Diwali in Goa. The sansanv, of course, other than being made from a sweeter variety of ambade, is sweeter and its gravy is thinner in consistency than the karamb, which is made sans all the aromatic ingredients of the sansanv like fenugreek,and bay leaves."

58ff25e27be9e0420db2d935,Kaziranga villagers resist eviction,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1160919/jsp/northeast/story_108970.jsp,2016-09-19,"Banderdubi (Kaliabor), Sept. 18: Every morning Musamot Honsa Khatun joins a motley group of villagers who squat on a tarpaulin spread on the road leading to this village on the fringes of Kaziranga National Park. This has been the 50-year-old's morning drill for the past few days, ever since the Kaliabor subdivisional office ordered them to shift from the village lock, stock and barrel within September 21 in pursuance of an order passed by Gauhati High Court last year. Khatun and the others, have, however, dug in their heels and are refusing to budge. The tarpaulin spread on the road is their stage. Men, women, children and the elderly, all are there to protest. ""We have been staying in this place for over 60 years...I was born here.... They suddenly cannot ask us to leave...where will we go?"" Khatun asked, sobbing inconsolably as she narrated the miseries of the villagers of Banderdubi after they were asked to leave following the high court order. The court's view is that the villagers are well-acquainted with the areas and movements of animals in and around the national park. Therefore, they are in the perfect position to poach animals or abet poachers. Even the government's promise of compensation could not sway Khatun. ""But what will we do with the compensation? Where will we go?"" she asked. The 190 families of Banderdubi, located about 2km north of National Highway 37, depend mostly on mustard cultivation, which they carry out during the dry season on the floodplains of the Mora Diphlu river, a tributary of the Brahmaputra. Across the river is Kaziranga, the home of the one-horned rhinos. Another villager, Nurul Islam, said the authorities have branded them Bangladeshis and have threatened to use force if they do not vacate the area. ""Why had they then issued land pattas to us in the first place? The authorities had also set up a lower primary school way back in 1960. It is their fault and we will not leave this place at any cost,"" Islam said. ""Besides, wherever we go, we will be hunted down as Bangladeshis and not allowed to live in peace,"" he added. That the authorities are determined to carry out the eviction drive could be gauged from the fact that the lower primary school has been shut down and the two teachers have stopped coming. About a 30-strong posse of armed policemen has been positioned near the highway for the past few days as a symbol of the administration's resolve. ""We are no match for the police personnel, but we are ready to get shot than to leave this place,"" Islam said. Not everyone is as brave as Islam though. The sight of the policemen and their occasional strolls into the village have had the desired effect on some villagers, who have started dismantling their houses and shifting their valuables to residences of friends and relatives. ""I don't want to take any risk... if they bulldoze the dwellings, my few valuable items would be destroyed,"" said Kabir Ali. The seven Hindu families of the village, who live closer to the highway, far removed from the cluster of dwellings of the Khatuns and Islams, have, however, come to terms with the reality they face. ""We are ready to vacate this place for the sake of Kaziranga,"" said Duleswar Kalita. ""The government has assured us compensation and we will shift to another suitable location,"" said Dipak Kalita, Duleswar's elder brother. These seven families, like their Muslim counterparts, have been living in the village for several decades. The denizens of Kaziranga do frequent Banderdubi, especially during the floods, and the villagers have learned to live with the animals. But the villagers would have never guessed that one day they would have to leave so that the park's animals could live in peace."

Similarly, the watchdog slammed online hotel aggregator goibibo for its refer-and-earn scheme.""The claim offer, Refer friends to download app and get free hotel night stay for 1st referral plus 1,000 goCash, is misleading by ambiguity and implication as in reality, the advertiser is only giving a Rs 1,000 discount for that one night stay,"" it added.Chinese technology major Lenovo was also pulled up over its claims of its android smartphone Lenovo Vibe P1M for being being water-resistant and other features.""The advertisements claims, Water-resistant build... protection against sudden drizzle and accidental spills were not substantiated adequately and are misleading in absence of a qualifier,"" the ad regulator said."

The chicken satay with chilli sauce and peanut sauce was also good.It was followed by mahi aanarkali tikka -- fish tikka, pomegranate seeds, chilli, garlic paste and mustard oil -- that fish lovers will relish.For the main course, the obvious choice was the nasi goreng -- fried rice with shallots, chicken, seafood and a fried egg on top. ""It is still argued whether nasi goreng is an Indonesian or a Malaysian dish,"" Teuku said.However, there was no argument about the taste of the nasi goreng that was served.

We urge you to extend the public feedback time to 120 days, to get the regulators to put out the full biosafety dossier in the public domain for independent scientific scrutiny as has been done with other GMOs in the past, said the NGOs in a letter to Dave.They also wanted feedback to be collected in all forms without any prescribed formats. More than 90 non-government outfits and some prominent citizens associated with civil society movements are among the signatories.On September 5, the green ministry published a report on the food and environment safety of GM mustard developed by the Delhi University, seeking public comments in a prescribed format.The report suggested GM mustard would not cause any ecological damage and is superior to the conventional mustard varieties being cultivated in India. Scientists at Delhi University created three genetically engineered varieties of mustard, which they claimed, would provide better yield than conventional varieties.The claims were questioned by the NGOs, which also raised objections towards the GMOs carrying a herbicide tolerant gene. While scientists observed the herbicide tolerant gene was used only as a marker and did not have any functional role, the anti-GM lobby did not believe the developers. We are also alarmed at the non-scientific, opaque and deceptive processes being adopted by the regulators in the name of collecting public feedback on GM mustard. Only 30 days of public feedback time has been given, without placing the biosafety dossier in the public domain. There are also restrictions on how such feedback is to be given, they wrote in the letter."

DDA officials said they plan to free 4,806 acres of such land within the next few days.While the farmers, whose crop was destroyed, said their livelihood and shelter are both lost now, the authority said the land belongs to DDA and the demolition was being done on an National Green Tribunal (NGT) order.Officials claimed NGT had prohibited cultivation of crops on Yamuna floodplains as the vegetables grown there could be ""highly contaminated"" and their consumption could even lead to cancer.Crops of radish, spinach, okra, bitter gourd, brinjal and mustard were destroyed by the bulldozers early in the morning. ""DDA has wrongly taken away the joint agricultural land of the village. We had recently sown the crops and the seeds were expensive. Instead of targeting our farmlands , the government should raze down the illegal colonies on the floodplains,"" said Sultan Singh, a farmer.""In 1995, the government gave us Rs 27 per bigha as compensation when they acquired some land. We were promised alternate plots and jobs, but the promise has not been fulfilled,"" said Rajinder Singh, another farmer.Independent studies have shown that the alarming levels of pollution in the Yamuna has had an adverse impact on soil and groundwater on the floodplains. The farmers, however, claimed they do not used the polluted water from the river but irrigate the crops through borewells. They added that they don't use insecticides.A 2012 study carried out by TERI had indicated the presence of heavy metals in vegetables grown with water from the Yamuna. This prompted many cases to be filed in courts against the farming activity. NGT had passed the order in response to a petition filed by activist Manoj Misra of NGO Yamuna Jiye Abhiyan.Mishra, however, said the order says that farming should be stopped only if it harms the environment. ""Using the NGT's directive to evict farmers is wrong,"" he said. He added that if the farmer leased the land from the government then it can acquire it, but not under the shield of the NGT order."

A second test was negative, and a third sample has been sent to a proper laboratory for definitive analysis.The official downplayed the seriousness of the incident, saying the shell would have been ""militarily ineffective.""""Our concern is not much greater after seeing this,"" he said.Still, the troops who handled the fragments went through a standard decontamination procedure.US-led coalition warplanes last week destroyed a factory near Mosul suspected of being used by IS to make chemical weapons.Observers have repeatedly alleged IS has used chemical weapons, and the Pentagon has confirmed the militants have deployed chlorine and sulfur mustard devices.Iraqi security forces, backed by coalition air power, are in the final weeks of ""shaping"" operations ahead of an assault to recapture Mosul, which IS seized in 2014 and which remains the militants' last main stronghold in Iraq."

A fire at the plant in 2003 burned for a month and released half a million tons of sulphur dioxide into the air, damaging the ozone layer, leaving hundreds of people in hospital with breathing problems and killing vegetation for miles.It is described as one of the worst man-made disasters in history.""They're going to throw the kitchen sink at any army that comes near Mosul,"" said Col de Bretton Gordon. ""It'll be catastrophic.""Haider al-Abadi, Iraq's prime minister, said this week that the army was preparing to begin the battle for Iraq's second city, held by Isil since 2014, next month.In a sign of what could be to come, the jihadists fired a rocket containing suspected mustard gas at the base in Qayyarah on Tuesday, their first chemical attack on US servicemen in Iraq.US officials said the soldiers were as yet not suffering any symptoms.Initial tests showed a mustard agent, a banned chemical that can burn the skin and lungs. It has been sent to a lab for definitive analysis.""It was mustard agent in a powderised form - the same thing we have seen [Isil] use to little effect many times in the past in both Syria and Iraq,"" said a Pentagon spokesman, adding that the agent was ""low-grade"" and poorly weaponised. ""The device, likely a rocket or mortar, was imprecise and crude.""Russia yesterday (Thursday) rejected US proposals to halt military flights over Syria, saying fragile ceasefire could only be restored if Washington pressured rebel groups."

Expressing solidarity with the State government, leaders of the Kerala Jaiva Karshaka Samithi, Kerala Paristhithi Aikya Vedi, Thanal, and the Salim Ali Foundation, have decided to stage a satyagraha at all district headquarters in Kerala on October 2 .At a meeting held in Thrissur on Thursday, leaders of these organisations resolved to launch a campaign against GM mustard on social media. A signature campaign is also being organised.Negative value cropMeanwhile, Kisan Ekta, a grouping of farmer associations across the country, has called for a ban on GM mustard by the Central and State governments.Pointing out that Indias tryst with GM crops had landed cotton farmers in a deep crisis, a joint press note issued by 35 associations said that any attempt to release more transgenic crops in India would endanger not only farmers but the countrys trade, exports and the environment as well.GM mustard is a negative value crop while organic mustard will have huge value appreciation that is advantageous for the farmer, trader and consumer. No sensible nation will squander away this advantage, the statement said.Countering the argument that GM mustard hybrid would improve crop productivity, Kisan Ekta said it was less productive than at least five different varieties.The organisation has also urged the government to relaunch the Technology Mission on Oil Seeds, with a focus on organic farming, higher assured prices, and increased protection from cheap imported oil."

While scientifically, the cucumber finds itself in the fruit category, gastronomically it lends itself beautifully to a wide range of cooking techniques. From being able to be eaten as is with just a dash of salt and chilly powder, cucumbers can also be pickled, used in salads, soups, savoury dishes and even desserts.These days, the local market abounds with locally-grown cucumbers; from the tender ones that are amazingly refreshing eaten raw, to the seasoned ones that can be cooked. Traditional Goan cooking, incidentally, boasts of numerous cucumber dishes, right from the delicious fodd where cubes of cucumber are cooked in a temper of mustard seeds, onions, turmeric and other spices of choice and then garnished with freshly grated coconut, or a curry-based preparation akin to caldinho. A few prawns added to a cucumber caldinho works well to raise the flavour up a few notches.A popular Goan dish that celebrates the cucumber is tavsali , or cucumber cake. A steamed cake, this one finds its origin in Saraswat cuisine.""All you need for this dish is grated cucumber, jaggery, wheat or rice semolina (rava), grated coconut, ghee, flavourings such as cardamom or turmeric and cashewnuts for garnish. A tavsali can either be baked or steamed, as per one's preferences,"" says Ponda-based homemaker Ashwini Tendulkar To make tavsali, one needs to the combine grated cucumber, coconut and jaggery in a large vessel and cook till the jaggery melts and the mix starts boiling. In another pan, roast semolina and ghee till the former assumes a golden-brown tinge. This mix must then be added to the cooked cucumber mix and stirred till the mixture thickens. Following this, the mixture is transferred into a baking tray lined with either parchment paper or, if you want to keep it traditional, with turmeric leaves. Bake till it is ready.While tavsali is best eaten hot, it also stores well in an airtight container for close to a week. In this case, all you need to do before eating it is toast on a hot tava for about half-a-minute on each side.""The most important thing to keep in mind when cooking cucumbers is to remember not to cook them for too long. As the fruit is high in water content, it can easily turn mushy and that's not a very pleasing texture to eat,"" says chef Subhash D'Souza. About five to eight minutes is ideal cooking time for cucumbers, he adds.Bearing testimony to the versatality of the cucumber, Aldona-based Mabel D'Sa, whose green fingers have ensured that she always has an abundant harvest of cucumbers, uses the fruit for various preparations such as salad, raita, vegetable dishes and even jam.The Gujarati kadi is also another amazing cucumber dish prepared using diced cucumbers cooked in a besan and buttermilk-based curry. The kadi pairs amazingly with hot steamed rice."

Afterwards, he allegedly defaulted on payments. ED officials stated that Agarwal is one of the 25 defaulters in the case.On Saturday, Aggarwal was produced before an ED court which sent him to the custody of the agency till September 29.According to sources in NSEL, Aggarwal is among the key accused allegedly responsible for duping 13,000 investors of Rs 5,600 crores in 2013 by raising money from them and never returning it back.Kailash who along with his son Anubhav Aggarwal had raised Rs 719.21 crore on the pretext of trading in commodities like wool, paddy, wheat, mustard oil and had projected that they are in physical possession of these commodities at their various warehouses based in Ludhiana, Samrala and Nawanshahr.But the duo allegedly invested the money in real estate and siphoned off the majority of the amount overseas. After the NSEL scam came to the fore, both father and son were booked by Economic Offences Wing (EOW) Mumbai; ED Mumbai and Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) under various sections of fraud and money laundering.The sources also informed TOI that Kailash Aggarwal was earlier arrested by EOW, Mumbai and was currently out on bail. EOW is said to have already attached 82 properties (a majority of which are in Ludhiana and Nawanshahr) belonging to Aggarwal which are valued at Rs 102 crores.According to a source in ED, Aggarwal has transferred a majority of Rs. 719.21 crores abroad and if found guilty he can be imprisoned for 7 years.Sources in NSEL said that his son, Anubhav, is absconding for a long time and he is currently living in Dubai where he is said to have married a Russian national.This is the third arrest by the ED in the NSEL case. Earlier, the agency had arrested Financial Technologies India (FTIL) promoter Jignesh Shah after registering a case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) in the scam. Shah was later released on bail in the ED case. However, the CBI arrested him on Tuesday in a separate corruption case involving officials at market regulator Sebi Suspecting illegal trading in NSEL, the government shut down all deals two years ago. This led to a payment crisis with companies defaulting on investors' payments. Officials stated that they are following the money trail between FTIL, NSEL and other entities. They suspect that many of the transactions in the scam could be only on paper and they are still examining the details.In May 2014, the Economic Offences Wing (EOW) of the Mumbai police too had arrested Shah after registering a fraud case in the NSEL scam.The ED case relates to the NSEL offering spot exchange trading in commodities, where it allegedly asked people to invest money in certain companies to earn attractive returns.The suggested companies used to claim that they had goods worth crores of rupees in their godowns to lure investors.Kailash who along with his son Anubhav Aggarwal had raised Rs 719.21 crore on the pretext of trading in commodities like wool, paddy, wheat, mustard oil and projected that they are in physical possession of these commodities at their various warehouses based in Ludhiana, Samrala and Nawanshahr.But the duo allegedly invested the money in real estate and siphoned off the majority of the amount overseas.Both father and son were booked by Economic Offences Wing Mumbai; ED Mumbai and CBI under various sections of fraud and money laundering.Kailash Aggarwal was earlier arrested by EOW and was currently out on bail.

In fact, the very basis on which this GM mustard is being pushed  its yield superiority  has not even been verified by the regulators, Ramadoss wrote.However, another lobby group, South Asia Biotechnology Centre, reached out to 750 parliamentarians informing them why the country requires the GM mustard. Those opposing GE mustard are conspiring to stop Indian mustard farmers from becoming competitive. They are conspiring to keep our farmers poor and to increase Indias dependence on imported GE canola and GE soybean oil, said the biotech centre in its letter.It informed the lawmakers that its members were willing to meet the MPs personally and brief them about GM mustard and its benefits. The centre was set up by C D Mayee, former director of Nagpur-based Central Institute of Cotton Research, one of the laboratories under the Indian Council of Agriculture Research, and Bhagirath Choudhary, national coordinator for international service for acquisition of agri-biotech applications, a biotech industry supported forum for South East Asia.India is a major importer of GE canola (Canadian mustard) oil and GE soybean oil. India has been consuming GE cotton oil produced domestically by our cotton farmers for the past 14 years. We consume approximately 50 lakh tons of GE edible oil as cooking oil every year. GE Indian mustard oil is no different from imported GE canola and soybean oils, it noted.The beekeepers too threw their hats in the ring, protesting against GM mustard. We produce around 90,000 tonnes of honey, out of which around 35,000 tonnes are exported at an estimated value of Rs 750 crore. Almost 50-60% of total honey produced in India is mustard honey. GM mustard will jeopardise this sector completely, said an officer from the confederation of the beekeeping industry, Devvrat Sharma."

We must also think about an inch of land and a bunch of crop as the government is working with the aim of doubling the income of farmers by 2022, Modi said here on Monday at the platinum jubilee anniversary of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).India will celebrate its 75th year of Independence in 2022. The prime ministers comments asking scientists to innovate in farm research comes during an ongoing debate on the commercialisation of indigenous genetically modified mustard varieties created by scientists in Delhi University.If you can develop varieties of dal (pulses), then it can be used in rain-fed areas and give a boost to production. It will also help address shortage of proteins in the body, Modi said.Modi released seven new plant varieties developed by CSIR laboratories to the farmers in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Himachal Pradesh, Assam and Jammu and Kashmir. These varieties include citronella, rose-scented geranium, lemongrass, calla-lily, new turmeric, vetiver and gerbera.The prime minister underscored the need to find technological solutions to address major problems being faced by the farmers, not only in terms of increasing the yield of the produce but also in growing crops in wasteland areas. There is a need to connect science with common citizens of the country, he said. Indias most well known research and development organisation CSIR was set up in 1942 to mainly provide technical support to large engineering and scientific projects besides generating trained manpower. The council now has 37 laboratories and 39 field stations.CSIR is under pressure from the Modi government to generate more revenue and carry out more socially relevant research. Sometimes, we keep on conducting researches on things which will be used after 50 or 100 years. We should use science to combat problems we are facing now. This is important for a country like India, he said."

""All of this is under the command of Prime Minister Abadi.""The United Nations warned that military operations there could cause up to a million people to be displaced.Last week, US President Barack Obama said US-backed Iraqi troops could be in a position ""fairly rapidly"" to liberate Mosul, though he warned ""this is going to be hard, this is going to be challenging.""Separately, the US military concluded Tuesday that a rocket fired earlier this month at the Qayyarah air base, which houses hundreds of US troops, contained no mustard agent, as initially suspected.In neighboring Syria, hundreds of US forces are deployed alongside Kurdish and rebel fighters to battle IS, which is also facing air raids by the international coalition.The Pentagon has expressed concern IS fighters could use mustard gas to defend Mosul.Even after Mosul is retaken, the war against IS will be far from over.The jihadists are likely to revert to insurgent tactics, such as bombings of civilians and hit-and-run attacks on security forces, following the demise of their ""state"" in Iraq."

Among the five higher yielding mustard varieties are three in the same DMH series. The productivity of DMH-1 is higher by 11.35%; DMH-4 by 14.70% and DMH-3 by 3.54%.No wonder, the civil society groups under the banner of Coalition for GM-Free India that made a presentation before the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the nodal agency whose clearance is obligatory, had rubbished the productivity claims of 26% higher yield being made for GM mustard. They had accused the developers of falsifying the data and comparing the yield performance of GM mustard with some of the useless varieties.I therefore cant understand how will a GM variety with low productivity eventually help in cutting down on edible oil imports? In any case, the reason why India turned into worlds second biggest importer of edible oils over the years is not because of any shortfall in domestic production but because the country had encouraged cheaper imports by lowering the import tariffs.Thirty years ago, then prime minister Rajiv Gandhi had laid the foundation for what was later called `Yellow Revolution. The Oilseeds Technology Mission he launched in 1986 converted India from a major importer to become almost self-sufficient in edible oil production by 1993-94, in less than 10 years. In 1993-94, India was producing 97% of its edible oil requirement within the country. Only 3% of its edible oils need was being imported.And then began the downslide. India happily bowed to World Trade Organisation (WTO) pressures to kill its Yellow Revolution. In fact, the demise of the Yellow Revolution is a classic case of how a promising domestic edible oil sector was sacrificed at the altar of economic liberalisation.Severe cuts in import tariffs brought in a flood of cheap imports thereby pushing farmers out of cultivation. Import duties from a bound level of 300% were slashed to almost zero in a phased manner. As a result, farmers abandoned cultivation of oilseed crops and the processing industry too pulled down the shutters. India today imports more than 67% of its edible oil requirement costing a whopping Rs 66,000 crore.Let us therefore be clear. Its not because of any shortfall in oilseeds production that India imported Rs 66,000-crore of edible oils in 2015. Its simply because we wanted imports to be encouraged that the country is finally saddled with a huge import bill.Although the sub-committee of the GEAC has cleared three varieties of GM Mustard (including DMH-11 and two parental lines) as being safe, the fact remains that the safety data is being kept hidden. This had prompted the Central Information Commission (CIC) to direct the GEAC to share safety data with the public.The safety data has since then been partly uploaded on the GEAC website and people have been asked to travel to New Delhi, seek permission, if they want to view the complete dossier. In addition, public comments are sought in a period of 30 days and too in a truncated manner in a proforma that has been posted on the net.Interestingly, the GEAC members are not at all perturbed that GM mustard will increase the usage of chemical herbicides. They agreed that technically speaking, DMH-11 is a herbicide tolerant mustard crop which means it will require the application of only one brand of herbicide to eradicate weeds but they feel that herbicide being expensive will not be used by the farmers.Herbicide tolerant genesIn fact, what is not being explained is the clever stacking of herbicide tolerant genes in GM mustard favouring the herbicide being sold by a multinational company, Bayer. Even Bt cotton had increased the application of chemical pesticides. Regardless of what the industry claims, the fact remains that the usage of pesticides has gone up in India.According to the Central Institute of Cotton Research (CICR), in 2005, Rs 649 crore worth of chemical pesticides was used on cotton in India. In 2010, when roughly 92% of the area under cotton shifted to Bt cotton varieties, the usage in terms of value increased to Rs 880.40 crore.In China, where Bt cotton was promoted as a silver bullet case, farmers apply 20 times more chemicals to control cotton pests. In Brazil, which has recently taken over Argentina as far as the spread of GM crops is concerned, pesticide usage has gone up by 190% in the past decade.At a time when cotton farmers in India have moved away en bloc from the genetically modified Bt cotton after the 2015 debacle with whitefly attack and the crop becoming susceptible to bollworms, I thought the Ministry of Environment would have learnt a lesson. The harmful impact of GM food for human health and environment notwithstanding, I see no reason why the controversial GM technology be introduced in food.There is no shortage of mustard in the country and if the government is keen to reduce the import bill of edible oils it needs to bring back the policies and approaches that helped India launch the Yellow Revolution. Raising import tariffs to at least 70% and providing farmers with an attractive procurement price is what will help India turn the corner."

The culinary skills of Odia cooks and their spell of magic has been mentioned and complemented upon by many great personalities in several books,"" said Usharani Tripathy , food historian and writer.One of the major ingredients associated with Odia food is its connection with gods, temples, rituals and festivals.The Jagannath temple in Puri attracts lakhs of devotees from across the globe not only to see the Lord but also for the delicious 'Mahaprasad' served there.The oldest organised kitchen in the world has the capacity to cook for one lakh people and 172 types of dishes in a single day, each with its own characteristic and taste.Interestingly, food also plays a significant role in religious events which are organised throughout the year when certain special dishes and cakes are made.The festival of Raja is held for making Poda pitha, Chitau amabsya for chitau pitha, Gaintha pith during mangala osha, ghanta tarakari (mixed veg curry) on Dwitibahan Osha, Muan on Dhanu Sankranti and several others. In a nutshell Odisha celebrates at least one festival associated with a food item every month.""We Odias are very fond of food and the culture and geography of the state complement it brilliantly. There is an abundance of vegetables, sea food, fish, mutton and chicken, and the diverse culture in different parts of the state led to a huge variety and diverse taste and cuisines,"" said Ritu Mohanty, a food blogger. His Facebook page has over 6000 members who post recipes on different food items every monthWithin the state different regions have different food habits. While people in coastal region prefer fish, crab, prawn, dalma (lentils cooked with vegetables), pakhal (water rice) and pithas, those in the north are fond of mutton curry with mudhi (puffed rice) while people in western Odisha enjoy bamboo shoots, special soups (letha) and lots of chattneys with rice.Pancha phutan (Combination of five different spices including black cumin, coriander, fenugreek, fennel and mustard seeds) is primarily used in Odia delicacies, and are healthy as well as easily digestible.Mostly Odia cooks avoid using rich and hot spices and use simple techniques, but the end product is always lip-smacking.""No tricks are required to cook Odia food as we use very little spices. We cook mutton curry in a simple way and it's still tasty. Even simple vegetables can be cooked in different ways,"" said chef and Odia food specialist Susanta Kumar Dash.He is the new breed of chefs who are making an effort to bring the lost flavours back to the table and more and more people are lapping it up. As interest keeps growing, a number of hotels and restaurants have started promoting Odia food and organising food festivals, giving those staying in Odisha and away a taste of the past.""During the recent Ganesh Chaturthi I was invited to cook in Mumbai where people literally hugged me and kissed my hand after eating Odia food. Even in marriage parties people are opting to have simple Odia cuisines instead of rich north Indian dishes,"" Dash added."

This comes in the wake of stiff opposition by a section of scientists, activists and public outcry against GM food crop as it poses a serious health hazard.""We are against the entry of GM food crops as they pose serious health hazards. We are also opposing the Centre's plan to permit field trials of GM mustard,"" agriculture minister V S Sunil Kumar said.""We have cited seven reasons for opposing GM food crops, which are GM crops would end original species diversity, GM food is scientifically proven to cause health hazard, GM seeds induce sterility so existing seeds will be lost, multi-national corporations will run seed companies and take monopoly , traditional agriculture sector will disappear, GM food crop is not productive and it will affect the existing production,"" he added.Sunil Kumar said if the Centre permits field trials of GM mustard, it will contaminate other food crops. ""With that the Centre would give ap proval for other GM food crops, which is dangerous. Every citizen has a right to safe food and entry of GM food crops is in violation of that,"" he said.GM mustard called `Dhara Mustard Hybrid 11' has been developed by Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants, University of Delhi, with support from department of biotechnology and National Dairy Development Board.GM mustard was developed by genetically engineering bacterial genes into selected mustard parental lines to create male sterile parent plants and to induce herbicide tolerance.It is used for production of hybrids seeds which are then sold to the farmers for cultivation.Green activists said that GM crops were already banned in Europe, Japan, China and Gulf countries. Mustardgrowing states like Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi have raised their protest and stopped field trials of GM crops.Leading ecological scientist, Western Ghats ecology experts panel member and Salim Ali Foundation chairman V S Vijayan said, ""If GEAC approves GM mustard as the first GM food crop, following that 71 GM food crops are lined up for approval and that will prove disastrous for agriculture and end safe food"".MNC Bayer has tied up with Monsanto and is behind the move to push for GM Mustard nod by GEAC in India, scientists said. Green activist Sridhar Radhakrishnan said that GM seeds induce sterility in plants, thus forcing the farmers to buy seeds from these companies every time and it will also end organic farming. With that India will lose its niche in global market of organic products and will be forced to get a `GM-free certificate' for every export, which is a costly affair."
58f649f3a3d24b0b70c29e92,Seeds of discontent?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Seeds-of-discontent/article15006575.ece,2016-09-30,"On September 5, the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) released an Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety for genetically modified (GM) mustard on its website, and gave the public a month to respond with comments and concerns. This review report was put together by an expert sub-committee of the ministrys Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The public consultation is likely to be the penultimate step before the government takes a final decision on what might become Indias first GM food crop  Bt cotton seeds, though also crushed for edible oil, were not explicitly approved as food; Bt brinjal is unlikely to emerge out of the moratorium issued by former Environment Minister Jairam Ramesh any time soon.GM mustard represents the culmination of over a decade of painstaking work by a team of Delhi University scientists led by the noted biotechnologist, Deepak Pental. Mustard, a self-pollinating crop, is difficult to hybridise, that is, cross-pollinate. Pentals team has genetically modified an Indian mustard, Varuna, and an East European mustard line in order to cross-pollinate them. They have sought permission to commercially release the resultant hybrid named DMH-11, and to use the two GM parental lines for developing new hybrids. They claim that by virtue of being a hybrid (rather than a GM crop), DMH-11 yields about 30 per cent more than a reference mustard variety. Given Indias huge import bill for edible oil, they argue, this effort to boost mustard yields must be welcomed. Indeed, this may well be a moment for us to appreciate government-led scientific efforts  except that the case for GM mustard is not as straightforward as the government makes it seem.Biosafety and socio-economic impactGM mustard is resistant to the herbicide glufosinate, and thus a herbicide-tolerant (HT) crop. A farmer growing DMH-11 can potentially get rid of weeds with a blanket spray of glufosinate (sold in India by Bayer under the brand name Basta), which will kill all the plants except the mustard crop. The technical expert committee appointed by the Supreme Court in an ongoing public interest litigation (PIL) concerning GM crops had found HT crops completely unsuitable in the Indian context in its final, majority report. The principal reasons were that herbicides adversely impact the vast constituency of manual labourers, for whom weeding provides livelihood, and generate selective pressure for the emergence of herbicide-resistant or super weeds. The aforementioned MoEFCC review report on GM mustard makes light of these concerns, and simply notes that farmers are not required to spray herbicide on GM mustard fields  which is neither here nor there.Second, there are concerns that the yield advantage of GM mustard has been over-estimated by comparing it with dated mustard reference varieties. Sharad E. Pawar, Fellow of the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences, has analysed the yield data of DMH-11 and shown that it has no yield advantage over varieties and hybrids released in recent years; a view also held by the governments own Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research.Transparency and public participationThese and other concerns (such as over gene flow, impact on biodiversity) might have been addressed if the government had made public the details of its case for GM mustard  and by making public, I mean making its case freely and widely available, even to those who cannot access websites or read English. However, having uploaded the review report, the MoEFCC has made the primary data on agronomic and biosafety assessment available only to those who can visit the GEAC secretariat in New Delhi by prior appointment during working hours before October 5.Equally serious is the fact that withholding the full biosafety dossier violates the governments own commitments given to the Supreme Court on April 8, 2008 in the hearing on the aforementioned PIL. Consequently, we do not know, for example, if sociologists considered the impact of GM mustard on agricultural labourers; or if ecologists, toxicologists and nutritionists investigated the wider impact of potential glufosinate use on mustard fields. In April and again in August, the Central Information Commission ordered the MoEFCC to release complete information on GM mustard and other GM crops. The Commission also ordered the GEAC to disclose the agenda and full, detailed minutes of its meetings, which the Ministry had stopped doing since 2012. The Ministry continues to disregard these orders.Thereby, the MoEFCC is reducing public participation to a farce. Denying citizens a voice in this matter is all the more serious considering that no labelling regime is in place in India. That is, if commercialised, citizens will not have the choice of opting out of GM sarson da saag, for instance.Perhaps, developers of GM mustard and the government fear that releasing the biosafety dossier will lead them down the path of Bt brinjal, but this fear is misplaced. The government is within its rights to take a strategic decision to commercialise GM mustard despite opposition, but this cannot come at the cost of transparency and fidelity to the law. At the minimum, the full biosafety dossier for GM mustard must be uploaded on the Ministrys website, the GEAC should disclose its full agenda notes and minutes for each of its meetings, and the window for public consultation should be extended beyond 30 days.As the distinguished biotechnologist, mustard-breeder, and former Director-General of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research V. L. Chopra wrote some years ago, greater transparency and wider public participation may be the most effective way of allaying fears and building confidence in our regulatory institutions.Aniket Aga is Assistant Professor at the School for Natural Resources and Environment, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor.

Farmers, doctors, scientists and environmentalists in at least 150 locations across the nation questioned the safety clearance given to GM Mustard by the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee 's (GEAC) technical subcommittee.Adding star power to the cause were filmmaker Vetrimaran and actor Rohini, aside from soil biologist Sultan Ismail, Supreme Court special appointee for TN food security Dr V Suresh and state traders union president Vellaiyan. The regulatory process of approval for GM Mustard is secretive, non-participatory, and unscientific, claimed scientists.City-based Newton Science Club founder P Ilangovan Subramanian explained, ""People need to understand the ill-effects of genetically-modified seeds. If you want greater yield, we create hybrid varieties. In the case of genetic modification, greater yield is achieved by crossing a mustard seed gene with an herbicide gene.""""The farmer will have no choice but to buy new seeds every year. The biotech companies are guaranteed large profits at the expense of poor farmers' food security."" Said Ilangovan.The protestors expressed alarm that the Centre is processing a GM application that chose not to reveal the fact that the genetically-modified organisms in question are herbicide-tolerant crops. ""This will increase chemical usage in our farming in addition to displacing poor agricultural labourers from their employment. This has direct implications for all consumers with greater toxic residues in our food,"" said Ismail, adding that data from data from field trials of the GM crop has not been made public.Given that mustard is widely used in all cuisines across India, the protesters objected to moves by the Centre to approve transgenic mustard in the name of yield improvements. Alternatives to GM Mustard exist for yield improvements such as non-GM hybrids available in the market, in addition to agronomic innovations like System of Mustard Intensification (like System of Rice Intensification).Vetrimaran expressed his support to organic farming and voiced his opposition to GM foods entering the country. Rohini said, ""When Bt brinjal was approved, a people's movement broke out and the government was forced to ban the transgenic brinjals. The case of GM Mustard must be taken up the same way."""

As a person who loved to eat good food, I knew that I had to learn the techniques to make it myself. The first dish I made was along with my mother; the traditional fried rice with chicken, egg and shrimp.Chef Teuku, executive chef, Park HyattHailing from Indonesia, the food culture has always intrigued me. Every island has its own food culture. For example, the food in Sumatra is different from the cuisine in Java. In eastern Java, the food is made sweet and in several other islands, the food has a little bit of influence of south Indian cooking. The use of curry leaves, mustard seeds, and coconut milk can be seen in a few places, but, surprisingly, there are islands where rice isnt used at all! They use corn and cassava as their main staple as opposed to rice.I love to cook with khafir lime leaf and lemon grass as they induce a different texture and flavour. But, unlike a few chefs, I make sure that I remove it after adding the flavour to the dish. I also love cooking with chilli, but I use very little of it as I have a sweet tooth and cant take too much spice! (laughs)Since I am from Indonesia, its natural for me to have an inclinational towards Asian flavours and food. But I like Peruvian cuisine and someday want to visit Peru to see the place where the cuisine originated and get some inspiration. People in India are yet to open up to this cuisine as most dont have a palette for those kind of dishes. For example, raw Ceviche (a popular seafood dish from Latin America)I dont think a lot of people would relate to those flavours here.But when it comes to Indian flavours, I have seen a major shift in the cuisine that I prefer. I used to eat a lot of north Indian and Tandoori when I worked in Dubai, but now, I vouch for south Indian cuisine. Chettinad Chicken tempered in curry leaves and spices, anyday! Since I have a sweet tooth, the Wattalappam dish from Kerala  a caramel pudding with coconut milk, jaggery and served with coconut ice cream  is a recent favourite.Though I love experimenting with new ingredients and flavours, Im not a fan of the fusion confusion (laughs). The best ingredients can be used to bring out different flavours in a dish, but mixing two different cuisines makes them lose their identity  thats my opinion.My journey has been interesting since I worked in the same company for 20 years, but in different places. Meeting new people and exploring different cuisines has kept my pulse beating. My advice while cooking is: experiment, do your best with passion, serve good food, make others happy and be happy!"

They claim the process of calling for any comments by the public till Wednesday by the GEAC itself is flawed as is the science behind the development of the GM hybrid DMH-11 (Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11).Calling the invitation of comments as an eyewash, they are claiming that GEAC subcommittee, working on the issue, has still not put the biosafety data in the public domain.Besides these objections, the issue has also gained momentum by a fresh submission in the Supreme Court on September 30 by Aruna Rodriques, who is already fighting a case against GM crops in the court. Her petition calls for complete prohibition of open trials and commercial release of DMH-11 and all other herbicide tolerant (HT) crops. The petitioner has contested that Glufosinate, the herbicide used on the crop, is a neurotoxin which is in the process of being banned by the European Union.Rodriques told TOI that, in her submission to the SC, she has demanded a direct moratorium on the commercialization of any GM crop. She has also demanded a fresh inquiry into the field trials and the application of Deepak Pental, the GM developer. ""The SC appointed technical expert committee (TEC) in the ongoing case had already recommended that HT crops should not be allowed in India. This is nothing less than contempt of court,"" she said.Another activist Kavitha Kuruganti, who has been pursuing the issue, has many serious objections with the GEAC. ""Of the seven members in the GEAC subcommittee, four have conflict of interest. The bias of these members is evident as the committee has already assumed that the DMH-11 is safe for human and animal health in the document put up on the GEAC website inviting the comments,"" she said.Kuruganti claims that the committee has no independent health expert. ""The person who has been given this responsibility is associated with a Monsanto funded agency,"" she said.Scientists and activists opposing GEAC say that though the committee had held one meeting with activists including Kuruganti, a few scientists including SE Pawar from city, farmers' organizations representatives, it has not taken the issues raised by them seriously.""It is a complete compromise on the scientific rigour and integrity. The biosafety data has never been put in public domain in the name of its volume whereas the committee knows that the data has been rigged. The data was many times bigger in case of Bt brinjal. But Jairam Ramesh, the then MoEF minister, had ensured that all information was opened to public and was well debated across the country bringing a moratorium finally. I don't understand the haste in this case,"" said Kuruganti.Pawar too has serious objections on the DMH-11 being a HT crop and the issue of the male sterility. ""If GM mustard is given a nod, the technology will easily be translated in other crops like rice, wheat etc. This will force the country to accept the monopoly of multinationals manufacturing the herbicides. It will also affect other crops and bring in male sterility in them as it is a self pollinated crop and will affect all varieties being grown nearby. It will adversely affect the biodiversity of crops,"" said Pawar.A national scientist, not willing to be quoted, said that giving a nod to GM mustard is not in nation's interest at all. ""But even if it is released, I am sure the technology will fall flat on its face. In fact, the technology will do what the scientists and the activists couldn't do all this time. In the present form, the hybrid will not be accepted by farmers,"" he said.Arguments over GM mustard's sustainiablity*GM mustard developer Deepak Pental claims that his DMH-11 increases yields by 25 to 30%* Experts say it doesn't contain any genes for high yields* MoEF website says that ""The data revealed significantly higher shoot and root weight in handmade non-GE hybrid (VEH2-F1) as compared to the GE hybrid DMH-11 under field conditions""* Scientists say Pental deliberately avoided the non-GE hybrid (VEH2-F1) and other good high yielding varieties and hybrids, and instead chose old varieties for comparison* Pental's report claims yields of 'GM-Varuna-Barnase' were equivalent or more to non-GM-Varuna* Experts say it was impossible if the 'GM-Varuna-Barnase' is genuinely male-sterile* Mustard is a self pollinating crop and bee pollination can happen only by 11 to 17.5%. Hence GM-mustard claimed by Pental may not be GM at all* The GM hybrid DMH-11 and its GM parents 'Varuna-Barnase' and 'EH-2-Barstar' contain genes for herbicide tolerance (HT) against 'Glufosinate'* Hybrid seed cannot be produced without spraying herbicide on the GM-parent varieties* Identical GM-mustard with same set of genes was tested and released as HT crop in Canada, but in India, it was never been tested as per norms for HT crops* This is blatant violation of biosafety testing procedures* Pental's report claims that ""DMH-11 pollen travelled only up to 20m""* Experts find this baffling since pollination in mustard happens due to insects and bees which are known to travel miles* Pental's report claims that there will be no effect of crossing with neighbouring crops but expert say 'barnase' transgenes from DMH-11 would contaminate all native varieties cultivated in vicinity by introducing male sterility genes into them* These genes can never be removed from varieties again and will reducing yields progressively over the years"

This comes after an MOEF sub-committee in its report last month has said that GM Mustard is safe for consumption and the ministry has put the report in public domain for feedback for only 30 days.Truth is being shielded and the government is being misguided about the safety, yield, and IPR (due to patented genes).

(Source: PTI) Activists holding a Sarson Satyagraha outside the Ministry of Environment against GM mustard in New Delhi. (Source: PTI)Politics is a strange thing and during election time, the strangeness factor is more pronounced. Add science to this and it makes for a potent mix.While mosquitoes have for the past many years been doing their seasonal job, spreading dengue and chikungunya in India and zika elsewhere, geneticists have worked at modifying the same mosquitoes genetically to stop them from multiplying.Watch What Else Is Making NewsThe technology is conceptually simple. A gene is inserted into male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes that transmit the viruses causing dengue, chikungunya and zika fever. This gene produces a protein that can switch off the activity of other genes key to the insects survival. Adult males carrying the self-destruct gene are, then, released in large numbers in endemic localities to mate with normal female Aedes aegypti mosquitoes and produce offspring that cannot survive beyond larval stage. It is important to note that the lethal gene here is expressed only in the offspring. The adult male is fed an antidote  the antibiotic tetracycline  to prevent the self-destruct mechanism from operating, so as to ensure its own survival and mating with female mosquitoes. In a matter of weeks, the mosquito population drops drastically, as the offspring inheriting the gene without the antidote die.The above genetically modified (GM) mosquito route to control dengue or zika has been approved in countries from Brazil and the US to Cayman Islands and Panama. Trials have also been happening in China, Australia and Indonesia on infecting male Aedes aegypti mosquitoes with naturally-occurring Wolbachia bacteria and releasing these into the environment for copulating with females in areas where dengue is endemic.Politicians  including in India  have been pretty receptive to GM technologies for control of dengue and chikungunya. In October 2015, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government in Delhi sent a team led by the vice chairman of its Dialogue and Development Commission, Ashish Khetan, to southern Chinas Guangzhou province to study the latters success in rooting out dengue through mating of GM male mosquitoes with female carriers of the vector-borne disease. The commission also allowed GBIT, the Indian partner of Oxford Insect Technologies  the UK-based developer of the earlier-mentioned self-destruct gene technology for controlling Aedes aegypti mosquito populations  to make a detailed presentation during a dengue vector control meeting on April 7 this year.Such political support for GM mosquitoes is not surprising for a country that reported nearly one lakh cases of dengue and chikungunya with 200 deaths in 2015. This year, over 3,000 people in Delhi alone were infected by chikungunya. There is near unanimity over the need to replace age-old techniques of fogging and spraying pesticides with new approaches that could include even GM.Such openness to GM for addressing problems of urban India is, however, in marked contrast to the outright hostility when it comes to application of GM technology in crops grown by farmers in rural areas. We are seeing this currently in GM mustard, a technology developed indigenously by a team of scientists at Delhi Universitys Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants. This technology not only promises higher yields through crossing of Indian and East European mustard lines, but also allows for introduction of new traits relating to quality (oil with zero erucic acid content) or resistance to disease (alternaria blight and stem rot). There are limits to achieving these through conventional breeding.Today, India has roughly six million mustard farmers with commercial yields averaging 1.2 tonnes per hectare  one-third that of Canada and Australia. Mustard accounts for over a quarter of domestic edible oil production. A doubling of yields will not only benefit our mustard growers, but also help cut the countrys 16 million tonnes edible oil imports costing it $10.5 billion a year.It is strange, then, to find the same politicians, so gung ho about introducing GM mosquitoes in cities, being totally opposed to planting of GM mustard by six million farmers. This, despite the former being based on videshi technology and the latter developed by desi scientists.On October 2, Mahatma Gandhis birthday, the AAP government in Delhi held a Jashn-e-Sarson fair in support of so-called organic mustard that few farmers anyway grow. The party has even sought to make GM mustard an issue in the forthcoming Punjab Assembly elections, with one its ministers Kapil Mishra claiming that it was a direct attack on the identity of Punjab.AAPs not alone. The Swadeshi Jagran Manch and Bharatiya Kisan Sangh  affiliates of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh that has a powerful influence on the ruling government at the Centre  have also thrown their full weight behind opposing clearance for commercial cultivation of GM mustard. This, even after a subcommittee of experts constituted by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee  the apex government regulator that approves proposals relating to trials and commercialisation of GM organisms  found the technology to be safe for human and animal health and unlike to pose any risk to biodiversity and the agro-ecosystem.Again, consider the irony. Here, we have swadeshis opposing a GM mustard technology indigenously developed by Delhi University, unmindful of the fact that doing so will only increase Indias dependence on imported edible oils (a significant part of which is GM anyway!). Surprisingly, the same politicians have no issues with GM mosquitoes even if the technology is borrowed from Oxford University or China.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Forage crop scientist C Babu (right) with CMD of Hatsun Agro R G Chandramogan (left) and animal husbandry specialist John Henry Niezen (centre) at a Co-5 fodder trial field at Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.For roughly a decade from 2004-05 to 2013-14, Indian farmers experienced rising incomes from higher crop prices year after year  something they pretty much took for granted. That party ended with the crash in global commodity prices, hitting agricultural exports hard and translating into lower farm-gate realisations for most crops.Watch What Else Is Making NewsBut there has also been a second, domestic, factor: the adoption of inflation targeting by the Centre and RBI, entailing a formal commitment to limit the annual rise in the consumer price index to not more than six per cent. Since the target is based on an index in which food items have a combined 45.86 per cent weight, it inevitably leads policymakers to grant lower minimum support price hikes, impose export and stockholding restrictions on farm products, and open up to duty-free imports. Weve seen a lot of these in the last two years or more.That, then, leaves farmers with the only other way to protect margins and incomes: cutting costs. Some work in this direction is thankfully already happening on the ground, at least in milk.A farmer growing Co-5 hybrid fodder in his coconut field at Seerepalayam village near Coimbatore. A farmer growing Co-5 hybrid fodder in his coconut field at Seerepalayam village near Coimbatore.Farmers now tend to give animals too much of costly compound cattle feed (CCF) and de-oiled cake/meal from groundnut, mustard or cottonseed. An adult cow requires about 800 grams of crude protein (CP) daily for its basic body maintenance and mobility. In addition, 100 gm is needed for every litre of milk production. So, for 12 litres, the total CP requirement is 2,000 gm or 2 kg/day.CCF with 18 per cent CP content is today priced at Rs 20-21 per kg. De-oiled groundnut cake, containing 40 per cent CP, costs twice as much. The cost/kg of CP through either of these, thus, comes to Rs 100-115 or Rs 200-230 for 2 kg. Since 12 litres of milk sold at Rs 25/litre only brings in Rs 300 revenue, no sane farmer would obviously supply the cows entire 2 kg CP requirement through CCF or de-oiled meal. What he does, instead, is supplement costly feed/meal with some green fodder or straw. Alternatively, he may over-feed the cows in milk and ignore the calves, though that is counterproductive: A calf should ideally come to puberty and be ready for insemination in 13 months, for it to start giving milk after 22-23 months. An underfed calf will not only take 5-6 months longer to lactate, but also grow into a cow with reduced milking potential.This is where an alternative approach  of farmers growing high-yielding proteinaceous green fodder  can make a difference. Tamil Nadu Agricultural University (TNAU) in Coimbatore has developed Co-5, a bajra-napier hybrid grass yielding an average 360 tonnes per hectare (145 tonnes/acre) of green fodder with 22 per cent dry matter and CP content at 12 per cent of the latter. The annual cultivation cost of this hybrid  a perennial grass that can be harvested 75-80 days after planting with subsequent cuttings at 40-days interval for the next six years  is estimated at around Rs 30,000 per acre.The cost of CP from Co-5 cultivation works out to not even Rs 8 per kg. An animals 800-gm daily CP requirement for body maintenance-cum-mobility can practically be met by giving 30 kg of this fodder, while CCF is needed mainly for milk production, said R G Chandramogan, chairman and managing director of Hatsun Agro Product Ltd.The Chennai-based private dairy has been promoting cultivation of fodder grass hybrids bred by TNAU, in what is a rare instance of university-industry public private partnership. For us, lowering farmers milk production costs is a priority. One way to do it is to reduce their reliance on CCF, which is why we have taken the trouble of sourcing stem cuttings of TNAU hybrid fodder for multiplying and distributing to our farmers, noted Chandramogan, whose company procures an average 27 lakh litres of milk daily from over 3 lakh producers.Delivering 800 gm CP to cows from Co-5 fodder grown by farmers themselves would hardly cost Rs 6.3, as against Rs 80-plus through purchase of de-oiled cake or CCF. That, on 12 litres of milk, translates into savings of Rs 6-6.5 per litre.Co-5 is basically a cross between indigenous fodder bajra (Pennisetum glaucum) and exotic napier grass (Pennisetum purpureum) largely of African-origin.They belong to the same Pennisetum genus, but different species. Napiers advantage is its high biomass (250-300 tonnes/hectare), ruggedness and capacity to yield fodder round the year. Bajra yields only 20-25 tonnes fodder annually in a single cut. But it is easily palatable and digestible unlike napier, which has serrated leaf margins and spines that animals dont like. When you cross the male napier with the female bajra, the resultant hybrids express the enhanced traits of both parents and also yield 350-400 tonnes per hectare, explained C Babu, head of TNAUs Department of Forage Crops.Prior to Co-5, TNAU had released Co-4, Co-3, Co-2 and Co-1, which were all bajra-napier hybrids. Between Co-1 (released in 1992) and Co-5 (2012), average green fodder yields have increased from 300 tonnes to 360 tonnes per hectare. Moreover, the CP content has gone up from 10 per cent of dry matter in Co-3 to 10.7 in Co-4 and 12 in Co-5.All this is a result of improved breeding, but the credit for propagating and taking these to the farmer goes to Hatsun, admitted Babu.Till last year, I was giving my animals 30 kg of Co-4 fodder and 5 kg of CCF daily. But now, I feed 30 kg of Co-5 and have reduced the CCF ration to 3 kg. Yet, they are yielding the same 15 litres with more fat and SNF (solids-not-fat) content, claimed Vijayalakshmi, who has 80 cows and grows Co-5 on seven out of her 30 acres land at Agrahara Nattamangalam, a village in Salem.According to John Henry Niezen, a Canadian animal husbandry specialist engaged with Hatsun, India should leverage its tropical country advantage that allows round-the-year fodder cultivation. This is something that New Zealand or European countries having extended winters cannot easily do. If farmers take to growing good-quality green fodders  thereby reducing, but not replacing, expensive CCF  it will help significantly bring down milk production costs.We are recommending feeding of 40 kg of green fodder per animal per day. That includes 30 kg of grasses/cereal fodders and 10 kg of legume forages (desmanthus, lucerne and cowpea).

Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for petitioner Aruna Rodrigues, alleged that Centre is sowing the seeds in various fields and without performing relevant prescribed tests.The Supreme Court on Friday stayed the commercial release of Genetically Modified (GM) Mustard crop for ten days and asked the Centre to take public opinion on such seeds before releasing it for cultivation purpose, even as government approval is awaited.A bench of Chief Justice T S Thakur and Justice A M Khanwilkar said the Centre will not commercially release the Genetically Modified (GM) Mustard crop till October 17 when it will hear the matter in detail.Additional Solicitor General Tushar Mehta agreed that no commercial release of the seeds will be done till October 17 and views and suggestions of the public should be taken and put up before the appraisal committee before releasing them.Mustard is one of Indias most important winter crops which is sown between mid-October and late November.Mehta said the Centre needs to file reply to the petition and refuted the allegation that sowing of the seeds was being done without relevant tests.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for petitioner Aruna Rodrigues, alleged that Centre is sowing the seeds in various fields and said the bio-safety dossier has to be put on website but this has not been done yet.He alleged that without doing relevant tests, they were carrying out field trials of the crop and sought a 10-year moratorium on them.Bhushan said a Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report has said that the entire regulatory system was in shambles and 10-year moratorium should be given.Rodrigues had filed the plea on Thursday seeking a stay on the commercial release of Genetically Modified (GM) Mustard crop and prohibition of its open field trials.The plea had also urged the court to prohibit open field trials and commercial release of Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crops including HT Mustard DMH 11 and its parent lines/variants as recommended by the Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report.Since the claimed yield superiority of HT DMH 11 through the B&B system over Non-GMO varieties and hybrids is quite simply not true, in fact a hoax, as will be amply demonstrated, there is no purpose to this GMO HT mustard for India, the petition said.The plea also said that the contamination caused by the mustard HT DMH 11 and its HT parents would be irremediable and irreversible.The contamination of our seed stock and germ plasm as will happen with mustard HT DMH 11 and its HT parents will be irremediable and irreversible making our food toxic at the molecular level without recourse, it said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(ANI) Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar speaking to the media. (ANI)Amid reports of clearance given to GM mustard by a government panel, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has sought intervention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to overrule the approval considering its ill effects on human health. In a letter to the Prime Minister, Kumar has sought Modis intervention to immediately overrule the clearance to GM mustard seeds given by a technical panel of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee.He expressed apprehension that approval to GM mustard would open a gate to several genetically modified food crops being developed by public as well private-research bodies like GM rice, maize, rice, brinjal, wheat, tomato among others which are at various stages of approval process. Kumar said GM mustard was a herbicide tolerant (HT) crop. Any gene making the plant resistant to a herbicide locks farmers into using select brands of agro-chemicals. The full adverse implications of HT crops are apparent world over.It is unclear why this herbicide tolerant (HT) GM mustard, which seeks to promote itself as a hybridisation technology, is even being considered by the Government of India when we already have non-GM hybrids available? he wondered.He said, I had already writtent to Union forest minister in January, 2016 pointing out that when the interested parties have failed to win the confidence of the farmers of the country, they are pushing the technology through public institutions. It is surprising that this so called public sector GM mustard came into being a year after a MNCs GM mustard was rejected by the Indian regulators in 2002.Strongly opposing genetic modification of crops, the Bihar Chief Minister told the Prime Minister that Bt cotton, which had been cultivated in the country for 15 years now demonstrated amply that GM was a failed technology. Bollworm, a cotton pest for which GM technology was brought in for pest control has developed resistance against the Bt cotton and is able to survive and wreak havoc on Bt cotton crop. Thousands of farmers have incurred losses in the country due to this, he told the Prime Minister in the letter.Reminding Modi about stress given by him on cooperative federalism and need to uphold federal policy, he said, This issue of GM crops is an important area where this has to be demonstrated urgently.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
59208ce07be9e04a40be67a6,GM mustard may be stalled indefinitely,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/GM-mustard-may-be-stalled-indefinitely/article15474157.ece,2016-10-07,": Even though transgenic mustard (GM mustard) may have been declared safe by a government sub-committee, it may yet remain in the can for an indefinite period.On Friday, the Supreme Court is expected to hear a petition by anti-GMO (genetically modified organism) campaigner Aruna Rodrigues, who argues that the Centres preliminary clearance to GM mustard, named Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11), contravenes a 2013 report by a Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee.This committee had said, among other things, that herbicide-tolerant crops ought not be permitted in India. One of the genes in DMH-11, developed by researchers at the Delhi University under a publicly-funded project, contains a gene called bar that confers herbicide tolerance. This makes plants resistant to a class of weedicide containing the chemical glufosinate. Critics say glufosinate is toxic and makes farmers dependent on certain brands of crop chemicals. If the court sees merit in the argument, then this could indefinitely stall GM mustard, said a government official closely involved in the GM mustard-appraisal process.The Supreme Court is yet to pass an order on an older petition by Rodrigues on whether GM crops ought to be tested at all in India.A sub-committee of the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)  Indias regulator of GM crops and an environment ministry body  said in August that DMH-11 was an effective hybrid and the bar genes presence wouldnt practically affect mustard farmers. They put up their report on the ministry website for public comments until October 5. The process is ongoing... now we have to take a considered decision, Environment Minister Anil Dave told The Hindu , adding the sowing season is almost over... I dont see it as being available this year.800 comments receivedIn a press statement on Thursday, the Environment Ministry said it had received about 800 comments from farmers, scientists and non-governmental organisations. The GEAC would now go through the comments, convene a full sitting of its members and pass a verdict, and this too will be vetted by the Environment Minister and possibly the Prime Ministers Office, said a person familiar with the procedure."
58f67d40a3d24b0b70c2c03f,Not simply a vision thing,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/Not-simply-a-vision-thing/article15281727.ece,2016-10-07,"Monsanto recently decided that it would stop the release of new genetically modified (GM) cotton technology because of uncertainty in the business and regulatory environment. At the same time, it was reported that GM mustard has moved closer to obtaining clearance for commercial cultivation in India following a key committees favourable assessment on issues of soil suitability and risks to health and ecology.The issues involved are complex and contested, and the challenges and contradictions may be evident to even the most casual of observers. Bt brinjal itself may have faded away from public discourse but the debacle over its introduction is not something that will be forgotten in a hurry. The contestations over Bt cotton continue to be alive in scientific research, in experiences on the field, and in policy debates. The seed industry has, in fact, split down the middle over a reorientation of the regulatory and policy frameworks related to Bt cotton. And yet, for a certain prominent section of the science and technology (S&T) establishment of the country, the promise of GM mustard trumps all scepticism.ContestationsThe conundrum here is not so much about the technology itself as it is about the promise that imbues the technology and which holds the present and the future together. Building promises is very similar to building facts, notes Cynthia Selin who studies the intersection of science, technology and society. It is the promise and vision of the future that then becomes key in generating a constellation that provides social and political legitimacy on the one hand, and much-needed financial resources on the other. Bt cotton, Bt brinjal and many technologies of the future exist through the expectations they generate and mobilise about the future. The act of developing a technology, therefore, is as much work inside the laboratory as it should be of engaging with the state and society and with their various concerns and questions. This will not be possible if the public is seen as ignorant or ill-informed, and the activist reactionary or an agent of vested interests. The contestation is, in fact, over the vision of S&T, of society and, for that matter, of the future itself.In the case of GM mustard, work was done at Delhi University using public money provided by the government. And yet it needed the Central Information Commissioner to say that biosafety data around GM organisms should be available in the public domain. There are some key questions here. What explains, for instance, this deficit of trust in the public and in democratic mechanisms set up by the very institutions that provide the resources and the legitimacy for these new technologies? Is it an anxiety about failure of the technologist or of the technology itself? Or is it about the stakes involved in the socio-technical-economic system that has been mobilised to create the legitimacy in the first place? Does it say something about the potential failure of an imaginary technology that is based exclusively on the promise of the future? Can the narrative be one of hope and promise alone with no space for doubt or the possibility of any failure at all?Technology Vision 2035This indeed is the premise one sees embedded in Indias Technology Vision 2035 (TV 2035), a vision produced by the Technology Information, Forecasting and Assessment Council (TIFAC), an autonomous organisation under the Department of Science and Technology. Released earlier this year by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, TV 2035 charts out trajectories for society through various technologies that will help make India a developed country by 2035. The vision is both an account of a future and a route to that future where technology delivers, provides and secures. Risk and vulnerabilities that are inherent to technology and therefore to our increasingly technological cultures, as Professor Wiebe Bijker, sociologist of science and technology, calls them, are part of the narrative in only a very marginal manner. There is little, if any, doubt about the capacity of technology and the different technologies to deliver the goods. TV 2035 sees people opposed to certain technologies like nuclear and big dams as a barrier to their dreams. These then need to be addressed through better governance and not better technological design because bottlenecks lie in policy and not technology.The past and the present, we know, are full of various dilemmas, challenges, even failures of technological promises and yet, a substantive engagement with the ethical, legal and social (ESLA) issues of research, development and deployment of technology is conspicuous by its virtual absence.When failure and risk are integral parts of the technological enterprise, why is it that technological visions like TV 2035 have such little space for including and discussing them? It may not be a conscious choice, but it is not an innocent one either. The particular question here is not whether GM mustard is acceptable, which is a rather different debate. The point is to note that the promise and the promissory visible frontstage in advocating a GM mustard is complemented by a vision backstage that is unwilling or perhaps unable to look at anything but that promise. The ideal of the democratic in scientific and technological choices, while desirable, is certainly not an easy one to realise because the messy issues of the ethical, legal and social have to be dealt with both frontstage and backstage.Political and democratic promiseAn illustration of this is visible in a situation where the technological only appears marginal at first glance. On a visit to Kashmir, a conciliatory Home Minister Rajnath Singh offered to engage with anyone who was interested in finding a solution to the crisis there. I will be staying at the Nehru Guest House. Those who believe in Kashmiriyat , Insaniyat and Jamhooriyat are welcome, he tweeted in an effort to reach out to all. It was as much an invocation of the political and the democratic promise as it was of the technological promise of modern communications. The irony only came forth when he was asked how this message of the Home Minister would reach the people when the government itself had blocked Internet services.What more can one say of the inextricable intertwining of the political and the technological with the social, legal and ethical? The technological has promise, no doubt, but it is not untethered to chart territories of its own making.Pankaj Sekhsaria and Naveen Thayyil are researchers at the Department of Humanities and Social Sciences, IIT-Delhi. Vanya Bisht, also a researcher in the department, contributed to the piece. The views here are their own.The promissory frontstage in advocating a GM mustard is complemented by a vision backstage that is unwilling to see anything but that promise"
58ff3c177be9e0420db2eebc,Modified crop irks CM,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1161008/jsp/bihar/story_112525.jsp,2016-10-08,"Nitish Kumar Patna, Oct. 7: Chief minister Nitish Kumar has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking immediate cancellation of a clearance given to genetically modified (GM) mustard by a technical sub-committee of the central Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The committee's clearance certifies genetically modified mustard as ""safe for human and animal consumption"". Nitish requested the Prime Minister to intervene in the matter and ensure that attempts towards its commercial release are not taken without prior consultation and the state government's consent. ""I strongly urge you that GM mustard application which has been cleared by a sub-committee to GEAC must be overruled instantaneously,"" he wrote to Modi. ""Further, no decision on GM crops should be taken in haste, as it can harm the interests of the farmers and the people of India at large."" In the missive dispatched on October 6 - a copy of which is with The Telegraph - Nitish has also pointed out that ""interested parties"" were trying to push in an unproven technology and the states must have a decisive say in its use. Narendra Modi ""We strongly feel that as per existing policy, Government of India should consult and seek no objections from the state government before conducting field trials of any GM crop. The states must have a decisive say in the use of the technology and any dubious technology should not be thrust on farmers,"" Nitish wrote. The chief minister's opposition to GM seeds and crops is well known. He had been at the forefront, opposing field trials of transgenic Bt brinjal (brinjal with a gene inserted from bacillus thuringiensis to make it pest-resistant) and genetically modified maize, mustard and other crops. He has documented the Bihar government's opposition to GM crops and expressed dismay that ""the unscientific push for GM mustard"" was continuing despite previous communication in the matter. Nitish said that if transgenic mustard gets final approval it will become the gateway to a host of other GM food crops, including maize, rice, brinjal, wheat and tomato among others. The chief minister's worry stems from the fact that mustard is an important crop for Bihar and its oil is used for cooking, seeds as condiments in dishes, leaves consumed as a winter delicacy and cakes (residue after pressing seeds to extract oil) as animal feed. Its yellow flowers serve as food for honeybees during winter. ""Mustard is an important crop for states like Bihar and we'll not be able to escape the consequences of the technology,"" Nitish said on the use of transgenic mustard. ""When it comes to food crops, the country has to be particularly cautious. Health impact on consumers cannot be ruled out."" So far, the only GM crop granted final approval is Bt Cotton; cultivated in cotton-growing areas of Maharashtra, Gujarat and elsewhere since 2002. Nitish argued that the case of Bt Cotton amply demonstrates that GM is a failed technology, as bollworm, a cotton pest for which it was brought, has developed resistance against the Bt toxin and is wreaking havoc on cotton crops causing heavy losses to thousands of farmers across the country. He also questioned why GM mustard is seeking to promote itself as a hybrid technology when non-GM hybrids are available. ""I had written to the Union minister of environment and forests in January saying that interested parties who failed to win the confidence of farmers (on transgenic crops) are now pushing the technology through public institutions,"" Nitish said. ""There have been conflicting claims on the superiority of GM mustard and there is ample proof provided by the Indian Council of Agricultural Research and civil society that the tests were misled to obtain favourable results. This particular GM mustard variety was tested against 40-year old varieties,"" Nitish added. He said GM mustard is similar in yield to latest hybrid varieties of mustard available in public and private sectors. He reiterated that agriculture was a state subject and urged Modi, who has been emphasising on cooperative federalism, to demonstrate by cancelling the nod to GM mustard. GM crops have come under severe opposition from advocacy groups and non-government organisations, who say its risks have not been adequately examined and sufficient testing not possible, as the regulatory authorities and scientific bodies in various countries are too closely tied to private sector industry. Some studies claim genetically modified crops could harm consumers."

Sunil Kumar has written to the Centre, calling for consultation with the States before promoting technologies with the potential to impact agriculture and farmers, besides food, biodiversity, environment, and trade.Pointing out that the countrys self-reliance in edible oil production had been compromised by flawed trade policies, he said GM technology could not be expected to reverse the situation.In a representation to Union Minister for Agriculture Radha Mohan Singh, he said the GM hybrid mustard was being promoted as a more productive crop and a solution to the growing oil import crisis in India.Less productiveBut this variety is actually less productive than at least five different varieties or hybrids already in the market. Moreover, this technology that uses three different genes inserted unnaturally into the plant is potentially harmful and has serious bio-safety concerns. It could even wipe out all the indigenous varieties in India.GM crops, he warned, would impair the countrys shift to organic farming and destroy the trade advantage offered by high-value organic produce.Seed wealthExpressing reservations about the herbicide-tolerance technology used in developing the GM mustard, the Minister said it would force farmers to use more and more herbicides to combat super weeds. It also had the potential to wipe out the indigenous seed wealth of our country, he added.The letter urged Mr.Singh to request the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change to refrain from giving approval for cultivation of GM mustard.Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has also written to the Prime Minister seeking a ban on GM mustard."

Express Photo by Renuka Puri Nawazuddin Siddiqui at his home in Budhana. Express Photo by Renuka PuriMaybe I need to be more careful. Sitting on a cot on the terrace of his ancestral house in his native town, Nawazuddin Siddiqui says this is the thought going through his mind.This is the longest break he has taken in Budhana since he moved to Mumbai to pursue a career in films 16 years ago. The family house, minimalist but sprawling, with construction still underway in parts, shows the success he has achieved since. The rooms in the front are full of visitors, being attended to by Siddiquis family. Above the terrace where he sits cross-legged, in a grey T-shirt and canvas shoes, his German Shepherd is angrily circling, keeping watch.However, this Thursday evening, a day after he was forced out of his village Ramlila, Siddiqui seems a world away from the trappings of stardom. I am a simple man who enjoys getting into the skin of different characters. But recently some incidents have forced me to contemplate about things I need some change Maybe I need to be more careful, says the 42-year-old, the eldest of nine siblings.The sounds of hawkers calling out to customers, while carefully avoiding open drains in the narrow lane dotted with kirana shops, travel up to the terrace of the two-storey house. The generators all around add a constant hum, helping fight some of the humidity in this power-starved area. Today evening too, there is a power cut.The incidents Siddiqui refers to are the protests by the Shiv Sena to him playing the character of Ravanas brother Maarich in the Ramlila, and the police complaint filed by Siddiquis younger brothers wife against him and his parents, alleging torture.Siddiqui says he was always fascinated by the character of Ram. I had a friend called Madan Mohan who played Ram in the village production, and somehow, in real life too, he exuded that grace and charm. We were all terribly naughty in school, but not Madan. He would walk around asking people to behave Everyone respected him. That was also the first time I thought of becoming an actor, I wanted that kind of respect too, he says, asking one of his nieces to get him a cup of green tea. The others in the house, including the guests, are having the regular chai, with milk and sugar. Thoda weight ka dhyan dena padta hai (I need to watch my weight), Siddiqui smiles.Pointing to a roof across his house, where his relatives live, he says they were some of his biggest dectractors when he dropped out of his M.Sc course in Baroda to join the National School of Drama. During the days of my struggle, they mocked me for being short, dark kehte the kya actor banega (they said look who wants to become an actor). Even when Gangs of Wasseypur released, they told people in the village that it wasnt me, but a lookalike. he laughs.Between 2000 and 2006, I only made two trips to the village Bahut sharam aati thi (I felt embarrassed), he adds, rising from the cot in the middle of the conversation to wave to a few children, who have been sneaking glances at the actor from behind boundary walls of the neighbouring terraces.That hesitation ended with the critically acclaimed Gangs of Wasseypur. Siddiqui believes his role of Faizal Khan in the film got him noticed in the industry, though he counts his role in Raman Raghav 2.0 as his best so far. Now, Siddiqui makes at least one trip in six months toHowever, he still doesnt travel with the entourages associated with Bollywood. Just two people: his manager and a security person. Pehle zaroorat nahin lagti thi, par ab security zaroori hai. Kuchch bhi ho sakta hai (I didnt feel the need earlier, but now security is needed. Anything can happen), Siddiqui says.Back in the village, he fills his time with farming. My father was a farmer All through my school and college years, I helped him on the fields. It comes very naturally to me. Abhi kuchch dinon mein sarson ki kheti shuroo hogi (In a few days, mustard farming will begin).While he can fit in anywhere, he adds, Bombay Budhana Cannes, The conversations here are different Shadi-byah, kiske ghar mein kya hua, sabko sab kuchch janana hai (Marriage, whats happening in other peoples homes, people want to know everything). It is a small community. It is not the same in Mumbai.A rare blush across his intense face, Siddiqui adds, Yahan sab bahut cool hain (People here are very cool) They are always happy to see me.Budhana is a peaceful place. Even during the Muzaffarnagar riots (of 2013), this was the only area that was unaffected People were dying 2-3 km from here. But nothing happened in our kasba. Even for the Ramlila, people here were so excited to see me perform. But then I didnt want any trouble.As darkness descends, people on the nearby terraces start retreating indoors. The Ramlila is set to begin in a few hours. Will he attend the show? No, no, says Siddiqui, rising. There have been many rejections in my life, this is a small one.

With the transgenic variety of mustard unlikely to be released for the coming Rabi (winter crop) season, the focus will be on non-GM varieties to help increase production.Transgenic mustard not getting cleared in the near future may disappoint agriculture scientists but it will not affect the country's research in public institutions on non-GM high-yielding hybrid and non-hybrid seed varieties.After all, the efforts of Indian agriculture scientists saw the nation record a five fold increase in foodgrain production in six decades -- from 50.8 million tonnes (MT) in 1950-51 to 252.22 MT in 2015-16.Although net sown area also increased during the period (from 119 million hectares to over 141 million hectares), high-yielding seed varieties played a key role in increasing production.Expansion of irrigation coverage too helped in increasing production but it was supported by the development of a number of drought and water-logging resistant varieties of seeds in the country's public research institutions like ICAR, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and state\central agriculture universities.These institutions, over the years, developed more than 2,000 seed varieties of cereals, including rice, wheat, maize and millet and over 700 varieties of oilseeds, which led to the phenomenal growth in foodgrain production.""Conventional plant breeding has given India very good sustainable agricultural production in major food crops like wheat and rice. Good varieties, which have better adaptation and yield, are quickly adopted by farmers,"" K V Prabhu, IARI's joint director of research, told TOI.Prabhu, the chief breeder of high-yielding wheat varieties like HD-2967 and HD-3086, said, ""Such varieties will continue to meet our needs provided pests like `Karnal Bunt' and `spot blotch' in wheat or `brown plant hopper' or `aphid' in mustard do not assume epidemic proportions as it can under vulnerable climate.""However, he emphasised that GM technology was ""the most viable option"" if India wanted to continue its self dependence in foodgrains in the scenario where crops face various kinds of stresses.Allaying concerns over release of transgenic seeds, Prabhu said, ""Our bio-safety and environmental safety regulations have evolved as dependable systems to facilitate research, product delivery and commercial spread, integrating conventional research with complementary support of GM technologies for food security .""He noted that the other avenues of increasing production may work, provided crops are insulated from biotic and abiotic stresses and it can be done through intervention of GM technology.At present, farmers have to depend on heavy use of chemical pesticides to save their standing crops from biotic stresses like pests and insects.Indian public research institutions have over the years come out with high-yielding varieties which are developed to resist different kinds of stresses -- drought, high temperature, salinity and water logging -- and increase productivity.The varieties which played key roles in making India self-sufficient in cereals includeHD-2967, HD-3086 and WH-1105 among others of wheat and Pusa Basmati 1121, Pusa 1509 and many others of Rice. These varieties made India not only self-sufficient in foodgrain production but also substantially increased its export potential.All conventional seed varieties are not in the active seed production chain. Every year new varieties replace the older ones in different agro-climatic zones. The ongoing research helps the country getting new verities every year."

Source: Sahil Walia A farmer tilling his fields after burning paddy straw at Charuni village in Kurukshetra. Source: Sahil WaliaPlumes of smoke are rising from the fields on National Highway 1. By the end of October or sooner, the smoke will be a thick blanket in the air over Haryana, extending all the way to the national capital. Its the season for paddy stubble burning.In this district of Kurukshetra, harvested paddy fields are now black with ash. In between the wheat-paddy cycle, some farmers grow potatoes or mustard. The sowing of these crops has already started at some places.Karambir, a farmer at Charuni Jattan village, follows the wheat-paddy cycle every year. Having harvested paddy from half of his six acres of land, Karambir did what a majority of other farmers in his village are doing. He set the paddy stubble on fire.The farmers have no option but to burn the stubble. Earlier when we were harvesting with our hands, the crop was cut in such a way that we could make bundles of stubble to be utilised as fodder or send to cardboard-making factories. Now, when we use combines for harvesting, the stubble that remains is of no use. Rather, it creates problems as it does not mix in the soil. The only option is to burn the fields and then turn the soil before sowing the next crop, said Karambir.Most farmers The Indian Express spoke to here share Karambirs opinion. They say while they know burning fields robs the soil of its nutrients, they have no alternative.At a little distance from Karambirs fields are four acres owned by another farmer, Shakti. Standing on his burnt field, Shakti says labour for cutting the crops manually is not easily available. Further, the labourers charge Rs 4,000 per acre for harvesting and take around three to four hours. On the other hand, those giving combines on rent charge Rs 1,200 per acre. With the use of combines, an acre can be harvested in half an hour, says Shakti, adding for the farmers this is more economical.During the 2015 harvest, the Haryana State Pollution Control Board did a survey in 10 paddy growing districts in the state with the help of Haryana Space Application Centre (HARSAC), an agency of Department of Science and Technology. The districts surveyed were Ambala, Fatehabad, Jind, Kaithal, Karnal, Kurukshetra, Panipat, Sirsa Sonipat and Yamunanagar.The survey showed a decline of around 21 per cent in crop burning practice in the past three years. In the year 2015, stubble burning took place in 163 thousand hectares, which was 14.4 per cent of the total rice cropped area. A year earlier, in 2014, stubble burning was witnessed in 168.9 thousand hectares or 15.7 percent of the rice cropped area. The figure was 208.3 thousand hectares or 20.3 per cent of the rice cropped area in 2013.The survey said the total paddy stubble burning area in the 10 districts had come down by 3.5 percentage points as compared to 2014 and 21.8 percentage points as compared to 2013.In eight districts, there was a marked reduction in stubble burning. In Kurukshetra and Yamunanagar alone, there was an increase. The decline appears to have not made a significant impact on the air quality in those two years. The report also indicated that early rice stubble burning in major area takes place during second to fourth week of October in Karnal, Kaithal, Kurukshetra, Ambala and Panipat. While late burning in major areas takes place during first week to third week of November in rest of the districts.A farmer at Chanarthal village in Kurukshetra, who also burnt the stubble in his fields, said he wanted to plant mustard in a day or two, but it would be impossible if it were not for the burning. The officials take decisions without knowing ground realities. If the government wants us to stop burning the stubble, they should provide some alternatives. What do we do with the stubble, he said, not willing to be named.President of Bharatiya Kisan Union in the state, Sewa Singh Arya, says, The stubble that is left after harvesting using combines is not usable as fodder. Using a tractor shreds it to pieces. If the stubble is not set on fire, then the next crop cannot be sown. There is a need for the government to provide some incentives to the farmers.The Haryana State Pollution Control Board has prepared a strategy to tackle the problem. All Deputy Commissioners have been advised to issue necessary directions to all the revenue field officials like BDPOs, tehsildars and patwaris to instruct the sarpanchs and panchs in the villages for persuading and educating the farmers on the ban and on the harmful effects of such acts.All DCs have also been advised to direct the gram sachivs and patwaris to bring all the incidents of burning of wheat stubble or paddy straw and other agricultural waste in the open fields to his notice within 30 minutes of the occurrence of such incidents. In case they fail to do so, it shall be treated as dereliction of duty and disciplinary action would be initiated against them.Apart from HARSAC being asked to monitor stubble burning in the 10 districts, Central Pollution Control Board has also been requested to share the satellite imagery reports / data obtained from ISRO on a daily basis.The government has decided to launch a pilot project for paddy straw based biomass power project. An official said government or panchayat land would be explored for setting up of the project and storage of biomass.Further, power utilities will buy power from the biomass power projects on the HERC tariff or better tariff. The agriculture department will support the setting up of bio-fertilizer plants using biomass and would devise a scheme to provide subsidy and to buy the fertilizer from such plants.Haryana Agriculture Minister O P Dhankar said awareness is being created among the farmers. He added once a biomass power project is set up, the farmers will have an incentive not to burn the stubble.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58fd402b7be9e06c93717fee,Activists up in arms against cultivation of GM mustard,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/tamil-nadu/2016/oct/13/activists-up-in-arms-against-cultivation-of-hybrid-mustard-1527417.html,2016-10-13,"CHENNAI: The State government has already taken a policy decision not to allow any GM crops. The commercial release of the GM mustard in Tamil Nadu is out of the question. However, that should not make the official machinery complacent; instead the authorities should tighten the measures to prevent its entry into the State and also promote measures to grow native varieties of mustard, said organic farming activists.Permission for any GM crop would pave way for other GM crops in due course. In the overall interest of food safety, the State government should register its opposition to GM mustard and convey it to the Centre in unequivocal terms, said M Ananthoo, coordinator, Tamil Nadu Safe Food Alliance, a network of 400 organisations. With food being a State subject, Centres efforts to introduce GM mustard would infringe upon the rights of the State governments, he stressed.The claim of yield increases has also failed to convince activists. Ananthoo pointed out that non-GM hybrids were available in the market, besides agronomic innovations like System of Mustard Intensification. Given that there are many alternatives to genetic modification for yield improvements in mustard, the move to approve transgenic mustard in the name of better yields would be disastrous for a crop that is widely used in all cuisines across India, he added.Activists are also concerned that although the government has a policy disallowing GM crops, there is no mechanism to check individuals bringing them into the State. Ananthoo has filed a writ petition before the Supreme Court seeking to quash the notice of Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) inviting public opinion on this.According to him, the committee had invited public opinion without publishing on its website the bio-safety dossier relating to GM mustard which runs to over 4,000 pages.The whole public consultation is a sham and farcical. Public are expected to go all the way to GEAC office in New Delhi, to read the 4,000 plus pages of documents before submitting their feedback, he added.Senthamizhan, writer, agrees. The public hearings are nothing but an eyewash. Food being the very basic requirement of the people, it requires a public hearing akin to that of a public election before introducing a genetically modified crop. These public hearings, however, will not reach all sections of the society. First, there must be an awareness about GM crops and then those who support and oppose it should put forth their arguments in public domain before arriving at a decision.According to Senthamizhan, in the absence of such an informed debate, there is no use in even holding such hearings. Senthamizhan urged fellow activists to go to the people with viable alternatives and solutions to garner unfailing support. A protest without solution will be reactionary, he pointed out.Moving toward organic farms The Supreme Court recently stayed the commercial release of GM mustard till October 17, and asked the Centre to take public opinion into account before releasing the seeds Sikkim has declared itself as an organic farming State, and 13 states have released an organic farming policy. Tamil Nadu is yet to formulate such a policy Tamil Nadu grows less mustard than northern states and has to import it. There are a few native breeds and some tribal communities also grow mustard for their own use Anti-GM activists observed Gandhi Jayanti as the National Day of Action Against GM Mustard across the country with hundreds in Tamil Nadu taking to the streets in as many as 45 locations"
58f55c1e7be9e01a17c981bc,Government looks to press ahead with GM mustard,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/Government-looks-to-press-ahead-with-GM-mustard/articleshow/54822355.cms,2016-10-13,"NEW DELHI: The government will be guided by scientific evidence and ""larger interests"" of consumers and farmers in deciding commercial use of GM mustard even as it works to narrow the gap between opponents and supporters of the genetically engineered crops.In keeping with its commitment to the Supreme Court that has stayed a decision on commercial release till October 17, the government is looking to reengage public opinion and non-government organisations. A sub-committee of the central biotech regulator Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has, meanwhile, been examining the 800-odd stakeholders' comments it received during the 30-day period (September 5 October 5).The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee will take its final call only after going through the subcommittee's report on stakeholders' comments. A plea claiming that the crop had no advantage over non-GM crops and was, in fact, likely to introduce contaminants is being heard by the SC.Though the forthcoming Rabi season may be ruled out, the government is trying to tackle differences with anti-GM mustard groups that include the RSS-affiliated Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM). The SJM's decision to join hand with antiGM notables like Vandana Shiva, Kavitha Kuruganti and Aruna Rodrigues does pose a problem for the government but it intends to link its final decision to scientific reports and possible gains of the crop in terms of food security .Consultations at the highest levels in government have concluded that the GM crop has benefits and it would help farmers as well as consumers and these are strong reasons to move ahead if safety issues are addressed. Though there might be some delay as the government re-engages anti-GM opinion, the direction seems to be in favour of commercial release. The previous UPA government took a different view of GM crops as it was more influenced by NGOs campaigning against genetically modified crops.The GEAC had in 2010 cleared Bt brinjal but the decision was not accepted by then environment minister Jairam Ramesh Swaraj Abhiyan leader Prashant Bhushan and others have challenged the release of GM mustard in the SC alleging that the regulatory mechanism was not functional and sought a ruling against Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crops including GM mustard (DMH 11) and its parent lines and variants.Even if the Centre clears GM mustard, it will be up to states to decide whether to use the seed. But the goahead will mark a big step towards breaking the logjam and open the doors for commercial use for other food crops too.The opponents of GM mustard have claimed that the technical committee's report was flawed and pointed to SC-appointed member of Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) Pushpa Bhargava's criticism that allowing commercial use would be disastrous as multinational organisations would take over Indian agriculture.The government, however, feels the concerns are overstated and that scientific evidence would be the arbiter as GM crops can hold out the possibility of increased agriculture production and help reduce food deficits."

During the last hearing, Additional Solicitor GeneralTushar Mehta agreed that no commercial release of the seeds will be done till October 17 and views and suggestions of the public should be taken and put up before the appraisal committee before releasing them.Mustard is one of India's most important winter crops which is sown between mid-October and late November.Mehta said the Centre needed to reply to the petition and refuted the allegation that sowing of the seeds was being done without relevant tests.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for petitioner Aruna Rodrigues, alleged that the government was sowing the seeds in various fields and said the bio-safety dossier has to be put on website, which has not been done yet.Alleging that field trials were being carried out without doing the relevant tests, he sought a 10-year moratorium on them. Bhushan said a Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report has also said that the entire regulatory system was in shambles and 10 year moratorium should be given.Rodrigues had filed the plea yesterday seeking a stay on the commercial release of Genetically Modified (GM) Mustard crop and prohibition of its open field trials.He had also urged the court to prohibit open field trials and commercial release of Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crops including HT Mustard DMH 11 and its parent lines/variants as recommended by the Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report.""Since the claimed yield superiority of HT DMH 11 through the B&B system over Non-GMO varieties and hybrids is quite simply not true, in fact a hoax, ... there is no purpose to this GMO HT mustard for India,"" the petition said.It said the contamination caused by mustard HT DMH 11 and its HT parents would be ""irremediable and irreversible"". ""The contamination of our seed stock and germ plasm as will happen with mustard HT DMH 11 and its HT parents will be irremediable and irreversible making our food toxic at the molecular levelwithout recourse,"" it said."

Picture by Animesh Sengupta The onslaught of vector-borne diseases, particularly dengue, in Jamshedpur this year has sparked a bright idea to battle the sting. The East Singhbhum health department will spread conventional wisdom this Diwali, asking revellers to light traditional diyas - ideally with mustard oil and camphor - instead of Chinese lamps that are powered either by battery or electricity. ""People may decorate their homes with strings of lights available in the market, but they must light diyas or at least candles for an hour on the day of Diwali, which falls on October 30 this year,"" said district civil surgeon S.K. Jha, adding that the flame and smell of burning wax, oil or camphor drives away mosquitoes and insects. ""They act as natural repellents."" The civil surgeon said employing the traditional way of celebrations to curb the vector menace was the brainchild of Sahir Pall, the district officer for the Centre's integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP). ""At an informal meeting today (Tuesday), Pall suggested that we appeal to people to use diyas to light up their homes on Diwali. The same, he said, would serve twin purposes. One, it will take care of mosquitoes and insects. Two, it will indirectly help potters who suffer when people buy only Chinese lamps,"" Jha said, adding that a formal appeal to residents of Jamshedpur would be made soon. Although cases of dengue have declined considerably over the past fortnight, health officials remain concerned because the often fatal disease has been stalking the steel city since 2011. While 167 patients were treated across hospitals this year, a 28-year-old pregnant woman died of dengue-allied complications at MGM Medical College and Hospital in Sakchi on August 13. Pall said after a gap of 10 days, they had sent 13 blood samples to the microbiological department of MGM Medical College in Dimna last week. The reports arrived on Monday, which showed four had tested positive. ""Dengue may be on the decline because fewer number of suspected cases are coming to our notice. But, we want to weed out the vector-borne disease from the city forever,"" Pall said, underscoring how Diwali could go a long way in achieving that objective. ""Chinese bulbs are both attractive and cost-effective. But, shunning our traditional ways of celebrations can cost people dear. The lamps are often power by electricity. Diyas can save power and drive away insects. So, let us all light clay diyas this Diwali for a healthier environment,"" he appealed. Will you light diyas at home on Diwali? Tell [email protected]"

There are no restrictions, but trends can guide you in a certain direction, she says.When it comes to furniture, nobody knows upholstery and upkeep better than these two women. We recommend re-upholstery only if a piece has sentimental value, or made to fit. If not, its better to buy a new piece. As the sofa ages and wears out, re-upholstering isnt necessarily less expensive than buying a new one, says Poonam.Amrita, has a few tips to help get us by: Scotch guarding minimises damage to your fabrics. Waterproof polishes for wooden table tops are essential.The designers certainly agree on the ruling colours this season. Shop for smokey shades of blues, earthy tones of mustard and neutrals like taupe, greys and pale pink. Its always good to work with fabrics like linen and cotton, which are eco-friendly, Poonam says, adding that simple straight lines are the key to any room to look classy.Poonam and Amrita will be available for consultation throughout this month at Elan.

On Thursday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee was present to hand over the physical possession of land, as she distributed the land deeds to farmers on September 14.She also spread mustard seeds as a symbolic measure to restart farming on 997 acres, which was stopped in 2006, when the erstwhile Left Front government acquired the land to help set up the Tata plant.Even though local Trinamool Congress MLA and former agriculture minister, Becharam Manna, claimed the state government is returning the land in a cultivable state, agriculture and soil experts express doubts that after lying fallow for a decade, the land is not likely to retain its fertility. While the plant stood on more than 250 acres of the total acquired land, since the area was low-lying, its height was increased by piling tonnes of sand, fly ash and solid waste.While this process itself would have rendered the land infertile, Manna claimed around 400 acres are ready for cultivation.Mamata handed over 23 plots spread over 6.71 acres on Thursday, with plans to hand over 50 to 60 land plots everyday.The government is also installing 50 mini-deep tube-wells for better irrigation, besides distributing free seeds, fertilisers, and providing a one-time grant of Rs 10,000 to each farmer.Farmers like Ganesh Koley, Naba Kumar Ghosh and Jugal Kishore Ghosh, however, did not seem to share the governments confidence over the lands renewed cultivability. Jugal said that the government decided to start with mustard because crops like mustard, sesame and pulses release nitrogen and help land gain fertility.Weve to grow such crops for a few years till the land regains nutrition. It could take as long as four years for the land to be properly cultivable so that we can grow potato or rice, he said."
58f63a8b7be9e031f13b0b25,RSS affiliates share an uneasy relationship with Modi government,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/RSS-affiliates-share-an-uneasy-relationship-with-Modi-government/articleshow/54949980.cms,2016-10-20,"This Vijayadashami, on October 11, when the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) celebrated its foundation day the Nagpur-based nationalist volunteer organisation donned a new uniform.Sangh cadres and officials turned out in coffee brown trousers which replaced the flaring khaki shorts that had been the most distinct marker of the Sangh identity for over 90 years.In his speech that day, Sarsanghachalak Mohan Bhagwat said RSS' mission was to equip individuals ""with the aim of taking this sacred Hindu nation to the pinnacle of glory in the world"".Bhagwat said ""Shakha Sadhana is at the core of cultivating physical, mental and intellectual faculties through common and simple programmes"". The RSS deputes such trained men in different spheres of national life to do the required work, he said.Such men have built up the formidable Sangh Parivar which now straddles every sphere of society, most notably running the federal and several state governments. Until now, willingness to wear the anachronistic khaki shorts on any occasion distinguished ""hard core"" RSS men from the ""moderates"". That filter has now disappeared to accommodate even the hesitant.""Many people, including prominent local BJP faces, who turned up in Sangh uniform for the Vijayadashami celebration in Nagpur this time shied away from wearing it earlier and used to sit out as guests,"" says Dilip Deodhar, a Nagpur businessman and swayamsevak (RSS volunteer) who was close to several top RSS leaders, including former Sarsanghachalak Madhukar Dattatreya Deoras.Deodhar had run a ""full-pant"" shakha in 1970 which was attended by Deoras as well as the then Sarsanghachalak MS Golwalker and the current chief Mohan Bhagwat who was then a young volunteer.The 94-year-old RSS ideologue MG Vaidya is one of the few people alive who have worn the very first uniform; khaki shorts worn over a khaki shirt until around 1940. That year was also when the RSS changed its original prayer in Marathi and Hindi to Sanskrit.""Until then Sangh was limited to Maharashtra. Since its work was expanding to other parts of the country it was considered necessary to change the language of the prayer to Sanskrit, which has commonalities with other Indian languages,"" Vaidya told ET.He said that decision was taken at a meeting of the Sangh leadership the previous year. The then Sangh leadership of KB Hedgewar, Golwalker, Deoras, Appaji Joshi and a few others gathered at the house of another leader Nanasaheb Talatule at Sindi near Nagpur for a Chintan Baithak, or brainstorming meeting, in 1939 where several key decisions were taken, including changing the prayer, shakha language and structure, use of media, approach to politics and expanding the organisation to all walks of life. Until then, RSS shakha drills and uniform were identical to the British army and the commands and band were English. The meeting decided to change all of it to Sanskrit.One of the key issues discussed was the Sangh's participation in politics as at the time of the meeting, the Hindu Maha Sabha led by VD Savarkar had just given a call for a satyagraha against the Nizam of Hyderabad.The deliberations are captured in a document originally prepared by Bapurao Varhadpande who was present at the meeting. Senior RSS leader Moropant Pingley later gave it to Deodhar who now intends to publish the minutes.In it Golwalker is quoted as suggesting that swayamsevaks stay away from politics but Joshi points out that RSS has a close relationship with the Savarkar brothers.""The Maharashtra sanghachalak and other volunteers favoured Savarkar and it would be difficult to ask them to stay away from them,"" Joshi is quoted as saying.The Sangh's wariness with politics is evident as Deoras suggests that the Sangh will have to think about the impact on its cadres because of the heady nature of electoral politics.Intervening decisively, Hedgewar, who was in the last year of his life, said they will think about electoral politics when elections happen but volunteers could participate in satyagrahas.However, if any RSS office bearer wanted to participate he would have to take permission and hand over temporary charge to someone else so that shakha work is unaffected.All of them agreed that political participation cannot happen at the cost of the fundamental work of the RSS, which was protecting Hindutva. While the RSS formally did not participate in politics in the formative yearseven staying away from the Quit India movement of 1942it was instrumental in floating the Bharatiya Jana Sangh in 1951, the Bharatiya Janata Party's former avatar.The Sangh now has 39 affiliates, according to the RSS Delhi communications chief Rajiv Tuli. ""They are organisations started directly under the Sangh's initiative. There are scores of others that are started by swayamsevaks,"" Tuli told ET.Undoubtedly the BJP remains the most visible and powerful spearhead of the Parivar. However, being in power brings its own dynamics to play that often ruffle the feathers of associates. The RSS' shakha strength has waxed and waned with the BJP in and out of power but the fortunes of other organisations have depended on the party's electoral compulsions and government policy priorities.A leader who heads one of the key RSS programmes told ET that many in the Sangh were unhappy with the government's economic policies which they, including himself, see as pro-rich.There was also much consternation among the Sangh cadres when the government opened up several sectors to foreign investment. Similarly, many in the Sangh Parivar were incensed when Modi likened cow protection to a business.It immediately drew sharp comments from the Vishwa Hindu Parishad which soon toned them down, reportedly on the directive of the RSS leadership. Bhagwat himself referred to the issue in his Vijayadashami speech and seemed to agree with Modi that there are fake cow vigilantes.He said the administration should be careful to not weigh the genuine and fakes with the same scale.Whenever, associate organisations have complained to the Sangh leadership, they have been encouraged to work according to their stated agenda but to take care not to embarrass the government, according to multiple sources in different organisations.See accompanying stories for the ups and downs in the Sangh Parivar since the BJP returned to power after 1998.1)Arguably the most influential and biggest arm of the Sangh Parivar, the Bharatiya Janata Party displaced the Congress as the largest party on the national stage two years ago.After Narendra Modi led the party to a spectacular victory in 2014, the government and the party have continued to dominate the political space even as rivals struggled to match its swagger.Multiple sources in the RSS told ET that the Sangh's top leadership is firmly behind the party and the government even though there are murmurs of disapproval and disappointment with the government within the rank and file of the Sangh.Many issues have been raised at closed door RSS meetings where the leaders have been questioned about some policies of the government.One particular issue that rankles cadres is the prime minister's statement praising Mother Teresa and the external affairs minister's presence at her canonisation ceremony in Vatican September 4.Last year, Mohan Bhagwat had said, ""It's good to work for a cause with selfless intentions. But Mother Teresa's work had ulterior motive, which was to convert the person who was being served to Christianity. In the name of service, religious conversions were made. This was followed by other institutes, too.""India's largest trade union was angry and frustrated in the first few months of the BJP-led national Democratic Alliance government's innings in 2014.They were neither consulted nor taken into confidence on issues related to labour. Then, the BMS decided to join hands with other trade unions affiliated with the Left and the Congress and corner the government on major labour issues.The Parivar trade union, founded by forceful RSS ideologue Dattopant Thengdi, has since got its way as it has become the primary interlocutor with the government on labour issues.When BMS threatened in August that it would join other unions in a September strike, the government invited it for talks the very next day. BMS leaders claim that it was its efforts that resulted in getting the minimum wages raised as well as other concessions from the government. Subsequently, it withdrew from the strike even though other unions went ahead. Rivals grumble that BMS is batting with the government.3)When the NDA first came to power under BJP stalwart Atal Behari Vajpayee in 1998, it picked up the threads of economic reform from where Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh had left in 1996.One of the strongest opponents of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government's economic policies, especially privatisation and foreigners investing in India, was SJM. So incensed was Dattopant Thengdi, the founder of SJM, that he once called Vajpayee a ""petty politician''. The organisation has, however, been unable to have any signifi cant impact on the Narendra Modi government.It has watched with consternation as prime minister Modi criss-crossed the globe wooing foreign investors and offering every possible help to businessmen to kickstart industrial activity.Though the SJM has often expressed its dismay at the red carpet rolled out by the government, its fi repower is clearly diminished. Recently when biotechnology regulator Genetic Engineering Approval Committee sought public comments on safety aspects on a genetically modifi ed mustard variety, the SJM was up in arms. Its co-convenor Ashwani Mahajan said, ""We do not need any genetically modifi ed crops including GM mustard.''The self-anointed guardian of the Hindu faith in the Sangh Parivar has been rather quiet ever since the Modi government came to power. The VHP was at the peak of its power during the Ramjanmabhoomi movement that eventually culminated in the destruction of Babri Masjid.But it has been asked to lie low by the RSS leadership even though it continues to work politically behind the scenes.The idea of the BJP having an electoral tie-up with the Sree Narayana Dharma Paripalana Yogam (SNDP) of the Ezhava community in Kerala was a brainchild of the late VHP leader Ashok Singhal.Last elections, the party tied up with BDJS, a political party fl oated by Vellapally Natesan, the general secretary of SNDP. But VHP has been asked to tone down any rhetoric that may embarrass the government.When Modi said he ""gets angry at those who are in the Gau-raksha business"", VHP leader Pravin Togadia immediately retorted: ""You have shamed us."" Within two weeks, he stepped back saying, ""VHP welcomes the government of India's action to ensure a complete ban on beef export. We are confi dent that there are many ' gau bhakts' in the central government and the BJP who have taken a pledge for cow protection.""5)Founded in 1969, BSM has vowed to infuse 'Bharatiyata' into the country's education system which it believes is ""entirely contrary to Indianness"".The organisation's infl uence in the education sector is growing by the day and it is perhaps the most important one in the Parivar today as education is at the core of the Sangh's objective of ""character building and organisation of the entire society''.Its rising importance could be gauged by the impressive turnout when it organised an international conference at Nagpur where it is headquartered.It was inaugurated by the then education minister Smriti Irani and attended by Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis, and union ministers Prakash Javdekar, who now oversees the education ministry and transport minister Nitin Gadkari.RSS ideologue S Gurumurthy, NITI Ayog member VK Saraswat and former ISRO chairman Madhavan Nair spoke at the conference.BSM is deeply involved in helping formulate education policies at the centre and states and has already been successful in infl uencing research guidelines in at least half a dozen universities to conform to the 'Bharatiya' philosophical and educational traditions."

In some 65 acres, concrete structures have to be removed. The process of land return would be completed by November 10, the TMC supremo said after symbolically commencing agriculture by sprinkling mustard seeds on the land.Land records to all the 10,436 farmers and 800 cheques to uncompensated land-losers were distributed on September 14.Singur would be a model for land struggle for the rest of the world. A monument for the Singur farmers would be built here, she said.Recalling her 26-day hunger strike, the West Bengal Chief Minister said, Back on September 24, 2006, I had just asked about transparency in cheque distribution and we were attacked. Later, it has come to fore during survey that bogus cheques were issued then.Education Minister and Mamatas close aide Partha Chatterjee said, Mamatas 26 days of hunger strike, 14 days of dharna and martyrdom of 10 people have not gone waste.Likening Singur land struggle with pre-independence Tebhaga movement, Panchayat and Rural Development Minister Subrata Mukherjee said, The struggle was of Mamata Banerjee, the victory is of Singur farmers.The Supreme Court had on August 31 ordered that Tata acquired land in Singur to be returned back to the farmers within 12 weeks.The bench also ruled that the land acquisition process in Singur for the car project was faulty and was not for public purpose.""Most of the portion of the Nano car shed has been razed to the ground.

The bench had ruled that the land acquisition process in Singur for the car project was faulty, and was not for public purpose.Of the 997 acres which will be returned, besides 65 acres, the rest have been converted into cultivable land.

She personally handed over land to 21 farmers.She added that out of these 65 acres, construction had come up on 36 acres, which would be cleared. The land would be made cultivable before returning it to the farmers within the deadline given by the Supreme Court, said the CM. Asked about the low turnout at the event, Mamata said: Only those who are getting back their land need to come.Mamata, who had steered the agitation against forcible land acquisition in 2006, said: Singur will be a model before the world, and a monument will be constructed here I have asked the DM to find a place. The monument will remind us what the people here had gone through It will contain photographs of Tapasi Malik and Rajkumar Bul, the two martyrs who had laid down their lives in the struggle to save their land.The CM talked to the farmers and enquired about the condition of the land and the kind of crops they plan to harvest in the days to come.

(Above) On November 26, 2006, she had planted potato seeds in the same area to protest the acquisition of land for the Tata car plant. (Pradip Sanyal) Singur, Oct. 20: Mamata Banerjee today scattered mustard seeds to symbolise the return of farming in Singur, a day before her scheduled meeting in New Town with industrialists. Mamata delivered an address of triumph as farming was set to resume on a swathe of land acquired for a Tata car plant 10 years ago. Tomorrow, Mamata will meet businessmen at Eco Park in New Town for a Vijaya Sammilani that is an annual affair, a sequence that underscores the chief minister's compulsions to strike a balance between her pet themes and the demands of governance. At Gopalnagar in Singur today, Mamata said: ""It gives me great joy that Singur is smiling again.... The movement will become an international model for land rights."" In all, 2,216 farmers got documents for 103 acres. Sources in the administration said Gopalnagar was chosen for the first lot for land return because most of the plots that were acquired in this area were untouched in the intervening 10 years and returning land from here was easier. Trinamul leaders such as Haripal MLA Becharam Manna, however, said Gopalnagar was chosen as it was the first site of acquisition for the factory in 2006. Mamata said the government had already made 931 acres out of the total 997.11 acres arable and 10,436 farmers would get their land by November 10, 33 days before the Supreme Court set deadline of November 23. ""Singur teaches us that we should never run from a fight and that rights are not served to you on a platter. You have to snatch them,"" Mamata said, before scattering the mustard seeds on their plots. Mustard, according to agriculture minister Purnendu Bose, was chosen because it is a dry season now. Mustard cultivation, he said, does not require major irrigation as slightly moist land is enough. CPM central committee member Mohammad Salim questioned the reason for such celebration. ""What was she celebrating? The decimation of the hope of Bengal's reindustrialisation? She is sending out all the wrong signals to industry, which she shouldn't if she is serious about drawing industry to the state,"" Salim said. Mamata, who has visited Singapore, England and Germany to court investment and is slated to visit Thailand next month for a business meet, has been sending out bureaucratic delegations to various countries in Asia and Europe to boost participation at the Bengal Global Business Summit. A senior functionary in a city-based trade chamber said that although many industrialists now understand the importance of Singur and Nandigram to Mamata, she can no longer afford to make mistakes on industry in her second term as chief minister. 'Impostors' The chief minister said many of the people yet to receive the record of rights for the return of land were impostors who had taken compensation cheques 10 years ago. When the government tried to locate these ""willing"" farmers, they were nowhere to be found. ""These were impostors who posed as willing farmers to take the compensation. A lot of these malpractices took place back then. We are looking into these things,"" she said. Unlike in her September 14 address, she did not say FIRs would be lodged against such people."

The state machinery is working overtime to clear the land so that it can be handed over to its owners by the November 15 deadline set by the CM.On August 31, the Supreme Court had asked the state to wind up the handover within 12 weeks.""We had three bighas of land at the project site. Today, I was handed over 5 cottahs,"" said Malati Ghosh, a landowner. ""It was a three-crop land, which included paddy and potato,"" she said. The CM handed her a bagful of mustard seeds, something Malati has never grown before. Mustard usually doesn't need any fertilizer; it also needs less water (only two inches a week).Mamata said later: ""I know a little about cultivation. My childhood was spent in a village. The crop that farmers can cultivate immediately is mustard. Today, I am distributing mustard seeds. In time, you will sow potato and paddy as well.""""Save greenery, create greenery and bring smiles in Singur again is our theme. For those who wanted to save their agricultural land, it is a dream that has come true. I am sure that as far as the issue of agricultural land is concerned, Singur will be the model for the world,"" she added."

This has also prompted States such as Bihar  an important cultivator of mustard  to challenge GM mustard. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi earlier this month asking him to overrule clearance to GM mustard.Clearance questionedAnti-GM activist groups say that the technical clearance to GM mustard opens the crop to imminent commercialisation that will contaminate Indias mustard gene pool. They also allege that results of tests on GM mustard werent fully open to public scrutiny and the clearance violates recommendations of a Supreme Court-constituted expert committee on how GM crops ought to be tested. The Supreme Court is yet to pass an order on these issues.GM mustard has several hoops to pass before a likely clearance. It needs to be cleared by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee, the apex regulator, and then also a possible approval by the Environment Minister. Bt Brinjal was cleared by the GEAC in 2010 only to be vetoed by former Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh. Incumbent Environment Minister Anil Dave had earlier told The Hindu that mustard, being a winter crop, was unlikely to be ready for field tests this year. Even if the GM crop were to be cleared, the States have the option of disallowing it in their fields.UNEP funds consultationA senior official told The Hindu that Fridays meeting with the States was only attended by Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, though several more States were invited.The consultation with States was part of a three-year long project funded by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) to educate a variety of stakeholders on biosafety.Many States had challenged clearance to genetically-modified mustard"

We have favoured that the GM crops in pulses should be allowed since we have not got technological breakthrough to spur the production, said NITI Aayog member Prof. Ramesh Chand.He stated that Argentina took an edge through technological advantage in the productions of vegetable oils and canola even while India stagnated in their productions. We almost import two-third of our vegetable oil requirements, which may be from the GM crops as well.One cannot stop import of the GM varieties in the times of liberalised trade, said Prof. Chand.Incidentally, the Delhi University had developed a GM variety of mustard seed, which the Central government is keen to introduce for trial."

Critics were asked to give comments.Only 50-60 responses are scientific in nature. The detailed biosafety data was available with the environment ministry for anyone to examine, but none from the anti-GM lobby came forward to have a look at the data, sources said.However, 29 individuals  most of whom are not linked to any lobby groupreviewed the data at the ministry and gave their feedback.The GM hybrid DMH-11, developed with funding support from the National Dairy Development Board and the Department of Biotechnology, has been undergoing trials since 2003. In the regulatory trials, it gave better yields than the national check (a variety known as Varuna) and zonal checks (Maya and RL 0359). The yield may be comparable with the current national check.But the introduction of DMH-11, sources said, will pave the way for creation of better GM hybrids with higher productivity like what happened with Bt cotton.It will lead to a reduction in Indias edible oil import bills. A large portion of the imported oils are GM soyabean and GM canola oil seeds.Last year, India imported edible oil worth Rs 65,000 crore, which is the third largest import bill after crude oil and gold.Indias mustard output has remained stagnant in the last two decades even though 97 varieties were introduced by the Indian Council of Agriculture Research since 1967, when the council began its all India coordinated programme on rapeseed and mustard.Of 28 million tonnes of oil seeds produced in 2015-16, mustard contributed to 6.8 million tonnes."

Memories of the run-ins Bhagwats predecessor, K Sudarshan, had with prime minister Atal Behari Vajpayee hadnt faded yet.Two years on, things have proved very different. Bhagwat and Modi go back a long way. Both were born in September 1950 and Modi was groomed in the Sangh by Bhagwats father  Madhukar  who was the prant pracharak of Gujarat. Bhagwat is known to have pushed Modis candidature as the BJPs candidate for prime minister over LK Advani. His reasoning was that the old order had to change.His preference for younger leaders was clear when he ensured that Nitin Gadkari became the BJP president in December 2009. At 52, he was the youngest-ever party chief.Even as RSS number two, Bhagwat had felt it would be difficult to deal with senior functionaries. At an RSS meeting at Kolkata in 2004, he had suggested that Vajpayee, Advani and other senior leaders step aside and let the younger leadership take charge of the BJP. Ten years later, this plan had been accomplished.Read | Why RSS will not like PM Modis comment on cow vigilantesAnd that could explain the smooth interface between the RSS and the government, whatever critics may read into the motives for Bhagwats call for a relook at the reservation issue before the Bihar assembly elections and his recent remarks in support of gau-rakshaks, which could read to be in direct opposition to what Modi had said about them.Bhagwat is known to be a man of action  he was for years in charge of physical training in the RSS as its sharirik pramukh. Close associates speak of his controlled aggression and point to his taming of VHP firebrand Pravin Togadia, who had started a campaign against Modi. They say Bhagwat has in key organisational posts deployed people who would toe the Sangh line and at the same time be non-confrontationist.His success in effectively mobilising the RSS ahead of the 2014 elections added to his stature. The RSS believed the BJP could win 272 Lok Sabha seats on its own and form a government. Led by Bhagwat, RSS strategists and key BJP leaders sifted through data and noticed that the BJP had won at least once from 278 seats across the country. There were 70-75 seats where the party was a close second. RSS chalked out a strategy to focus on these 350-odd seats. The results were unprecedented.The RSSs intentions were clear when Bhagwat spoke openly on the issue in his customary Vijaya Dashami speech on October 15, 2013. He had made a strong and fervent appeal to the people, especially the youth, to fulfill their responsibility of being a part of the worlds largest democracy and pledge to bring about a desired change in a country riddled with many problems, says Dilip Deodhar, a veteran RSS analyst, who was previously associated with the BJPs ideological mentor.The formation of the Modi cabinet and its expansion in November 2014 also had a visible RSS imprint with over a dozen ministers associated with the Sangh Parivar being inducted. Among them, Hansraj Ahir, a four-time MP from Chandrapur  Bhagwats native place  found a place in Modis team. Ahir, known for exposing the coal block allocation scam, is considered to be very close to Bhagwat. The inclusion of Manohar Parrikar in the Union cabinet and the promotion of Prakash Javadekar to the HRD ministry recently also show the rising clout of the RSS within the government. By elevating Javadekar as HRD minister, a close associate, he wanted to push the RSS agenda in the education system.Though Bhagwat tries to avoid confrontation with Narendra Modi and his government, but on some issues the sangh seemed to be non-compromising, such as its opposition to genetically modified (GM) crop. This was reflected when the Swadeshi Jagaram Manch, the economic wing of the sangh, opposed the move in a national symposium held in New Delhi last month. The speakers, most of them RSS leaders, explained in detail how GM crop may affect entire ecosystem if companies are given access to Indian market.Read | Is Modi preparing to defy RSS outfit on GM mustard rollout?There are bound to be differences between the sangh and the way Modis government functions. But both seem to be accommodative. While the government allowed the sanghs views in education, culture and to a certain extent dealing with troubled neighbours, the sangh on its part has been supportive of the governments economic policies that it may not subscribe to in entirety. Having a familiar government in Delhi was a necessity felt by the sangh after the poor show in assembly polls and now, there seems to be a clear understanding between the two  to let Modi govern the country and sangh pursue the Hindutva agenda.Insiders say the RSS appreciates the Centres move for a uniform civil code. Besides, a proposal to set up a Ramayana museum at Ayodhya and Modis Vijay Dashami address in poll-bound UPs capital Lucknow that began with a robust chant of Jai Shri Ram also has RSS observers believe that Modi was pushing the sangh agenda, albeit guardedly.A veterinary doctor, Bhagwat left a post-graduation course in veterinary medicine from Akola half way and became a full-time pracharak in 1975. His family has been associated with the RSS for three generations. A senior RSS swayamsevak close to Bhagwat said that both Modi and Bhagwat would turn 75 when the saffron organisation celebrates its centenary in 2025 and could step down to set an example regarding their policy of a retirement age for Sangh Parivar leaders. Bhagwat is known to be ruthless in pursuing the Sanghs goals. A no-nonsense man, he doesnt even spare his close associates when the question of discipline arises.Read | Law-abiding good people: RSS chief backs gau-rakshaks, differs with ModiAnother senior swayamsevak recalls a simple, uncomplicated man with no airs. In the 80s when he was among the top 10 leaders in the RSS hierarchy and held the post of sharirik pramukh, I saw him several times sleeping on the floor at the RSS headquarters, he says. A voracious reader of detective books in his student days, Bhagwat, a Maharashtrian Brahmin, was a non-vegetarian till his elevation to the post of sarkaryavah in 2000. A good singer, he rarely misses his yoga and routine exercise, whether he is in Nagpur or elsewhere.However, a section of RSS activists here also feel how a leader of Bhagwats stature failed to keep the flock together in the RSS Goa unit and failed to rein in Subhash Velingkar who decided to float a political party against the BJP."

Besides, the company officials will get an opportunity to interact with the farmers in 'jajam' (informal gathering).Officials claim that though the company has been invited, it will not be allowed to showcase its GM products or talk about it with the farmers. ""This firm is into a lot of other agriculture activities too. We are aware about GM crops and know that it is a touchy issue,"" said a senior official of the agriculture department.Some other officials who are part of organising GRAM, though, claimed that any technology (including GM crops) should be welcomed and left over to the farmers' choice (to adopt it or not). BJP had earlier opposed the trial of GM mustard crop and protested against the previous Congress government's decision to send expert teams to research GM crops."

We will face whatever happens,"" Basit Soren, the headman of neighbouring Jaigaon village told The Telegraph. Soren has been asked to get all the 13 households in his village vacated. ""My father settled here many years ago. During the violence in 1996, we had to flee and spent nearly 10 years in Jaipur relief camp (near the highway). But after we came back here, we were tagged as encroachers,"" said Chandar Kisku, headman of Kyajharna (40 households). Basit and Suniram Soren, headman of Paharpur (10 households), who sat with eviction notices in their hands, echoed him. All the 1,251 households, comprising over 6,200 settlers including 2,831 children, in Lunsung and Deosri forests under Ripu and Chirang reserve forests in Kokrajhar and Chirang districts, are facing the threat of eviction. A portion of Lungsung reserve forests falls in Chirang district. The forest department says these settlers must be evicted as they cut trees. Fear gripped the area after Dispur evicted settlers from a village near Kaziranga National Park in September and two persons died during the protests. Adivasis in 59 settlements here lack basic amenities - there is no government school, hospital, electricity or road - as they are ""illegal settlers"" on forestland. The eight primary schools and one Middle English school (Classes VI to VIII) run by NGOs have only tin roofs. The NGOs have engaged teachers, provided books and uniforms. However, the children do not get midday meals. The villagers mainly cultivate paddy and mustard for their livelihood. Many households have been provided solar power panels and bamboo toilets by NGOs. There is no medical facility. ""We have to carry the patients on bicycle or palki (palanquin) to Runikhata or Saralpara health centre about 3km away,"" Basit said. ""Good morning, sir,"" shouted Class II student Antina Bara and others at Salbari primary school as their teacher Johan Logun arrived on his bicycle. It is quite a struggle for two teachers to manage 64 students in the single room. Villagers contributed money to buy the desk and benches but the schools lack toilets. ""The dropout rate is high as we have only one ME school. We have to close the school during rains as there is no wall,"" he said. On forest minister Pramila Rani Brahma's comment that they would be evicted despite protests, Suniram Soren of Paharpur turned furious: ""Then why did she promise in a public meeting here before the Assembly elections that no one would be evicted? Now that the election is over and she became a minister, she has forgotten her promise."" The president of the Adivasi Students' Association, Stephen Lakra, demanded that the settlers be rehabilitated as many are victims of the 1996 violence. ""As the government did not resettle them and they lost their land, many settled in the forests out of compulsion,"" Lakra said. Mangal Murmu is one such victim. His family had to leave their home during the 1996 conflict and live at a relief camp at Jaipur. They, however, bought land and settled there. Raju Kumar Narzary of the North East Research and Social Work Networking, an NGO, said eviction without a proper rehabilitation plan would not solve the problem. The NGO has engaged 12 youths as community facilitators for educating the children."

Picture by UB Photos Banderdubi (Kaliabor), Nov. 3: At another time, in a few months from now, the vast acres of land located 2km north of National Highway 37, adjacent to Kaziranga National Park, would have turned into a swathe of dazzling yellow. Literally. Figuratively, yellow is also the colour of the economy in these parts, driven by mustard cultivation, a winter crop. But Banderdubi will not grow its mustard this winter on the flood plains of the Mora Dipholu river - a tributary of the Brahmaputra - across which Kaziranga National Park is located. In fact, colour went out of the lives of Banderdubi's residents after they were evicted lock, stock and barrel from their home of many years, in September in pursuance of an order of Gauhati High Court. ""We see only darkness all around us. There is no colour in our lives anymore,"" said Abdul Rajaq, a former denizen of Banderdubi village. Ever since the authorities carried out the eviction drive at this village, removing nearly 190 families on September 19, these lands have remained untended. Banderdubi itself is now not much more than a name in the revenue department's records. A few security personnel at the battalion camp, which has come up at the lower primary school building to prevent resettlement, and a partially demolished mosque are grim reminders of what was once a human habitation. Electric fencing has also been installed along the road which cuts through the village to prevent wild animals from straying out of the national park. The eviction was necessitated as the court observed that the villagers were well-acquainted with the area and animal movements and therefore would be in a position to poach or abet poaching. ""Wild animals from Kaziranga are frequent visitors to these areas and as such it was necessary to erect the electric fence,"" a security personnel at the camp said. About 2km south from Banderdubi along the national highway, Musamot Honsa Khatun squats under the warmth of the morning sun and stares at the empty vastness where once stood her home. Khatun, 50, has been staying at a makeshift camp which they have set up on a plot of land at Pub Deopani offered to them by a well-wisher so that they can stay there till they get compensation from the government. Though they were promised compensation within 40 days, they are yet to receive it. ""We have no work, no food and no place to go. We have not received any compensation till today. We simply have no idea what to do,"" she said, tears rolling down her eyes. Recalling the black day when the authorities forced them out of their homes - in fact two persons died in the police firing when the settlers refused to vacate the land - Honsa said her house was burnt down. ""I spent that night in a nearby village with my son and shifted here two days later,"" she said. N. Ahmed (Bhaijan), president of Kaliabor unit of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS), which has been supporting the protest by the villagers, wondered whether these people would get compensation. ""I approached the authorities only a couple of days back and I was told that the process was on. It's really surprising,"" he said. He said even if the villagers were given compensation, it would not be enough since they have nowhere to go. The government should rehabilitate them somewhere. Otherwise, where will they go?"" he asked. Rajaq, on the other hand, said many villagers who were evicted have been surviving with relief material provided by various organisations but some others have had to borrow money to make ends meet. ""Even if they get compensation, a large chunk of the money would have to be given back to moneylenders,"" he said. It is time for lunch and Honsa calls out to her son engaged in conversation with a couple of his friends a short distance away. She has had a bath and there were no traces of the tears that had flowed freely a little while ago. She had changed into a fresh sari, too - the colour of mustard."

A decision on this is still awaited amid strong opposition from green activists.Citing safety concerns and divided opinion among scientists, state agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini said the state government has decided not to permit field trials of GM mustard in three districts and will not allow its commercial cultivation. ""Many courts in other countries including European Union have not allowed, be it GM brinjal, GM mustard or GM peas or tomato. It is no and never in Rajasthan if there is no unanimity on this issue,"" he said. The minister said Rajasthan is a leading state in mustard production and there is no need for GM variety which can disturb the traditional seeds and create imbalance in nature. ""I am not against this (GM) but farmers' welfare and human beings' safety is my priority. So, our chief minister and I have decided not to allow unless there is unanimity,"" Saini told reporters on sidelines of an event here to announce a three-day agri-tech meet in Jaipur next week.He said the state government has not allowed field trial of GM mustard in three districts -- Bharatpur, Alwar and Hanumangarh.""We have denied permission for field trials. We will not allow now because there will be a problem of pollination through bees, air or bird. We will not allow unless we ascertain the benefits,"" he said.Asked will the state allow if there is consensus on GM mustard, he said, ""If there is consensus, then there will be problem. We are looking at side effects. Madam (CM) is deliberating on this. ""If it is in the interest of humanity and if there is decision at national level, even then we will think. Agriculture is a state subject. The state will decide what crop to grow. If the current crop is benefiting, then why we need to disturb that,"" he said."

But today, the idyllic landscape is marred by an ugly patchwork of smouldering black earth next to the green fields, its air heavy with the suffocating stench of burnt straw.TOI reporters fanned out across Punjab and Haryana to assess the ground situation as Delhi continued to choke in one of the worst smog attacks over the past 17 years.They found out that despite the concerns raised by the Punjab and Haryana high court and the National Green Tribunal (NGT), farmers haven't stopped setting fire to paddy straw, the agricultural waste left over from the harvest season. The farmers told TOI that they were well aware of the ecological hazards of stubble burning, but insisted that the alternatives to the practice were beyond their reach.When a TOI lensman started clicking pictures of farm workers setting straw on fire near Talhan village in Jalandhar, a group of women working nearby reacted angrily. The farm labourers beat a hasty retreat, meanwhile, not wanting to get caught red-handed as the state government has imposed a fine on the practice. Clearly, the farmers in Punjab are aware that stubble burning is illegal. But they continue to be defiant.""Let the authorities demonstrate, on our fields, the solutions they are talking about in their air-conditioned offices,"" said Harinder Singh of Gandhawan village, near Phagwara. All the fields next to his have turned to ash. ""Combine harvesters (see accompanying story) came on the scene several years ago, but none of the experts showed us how the remaining straw would be effectively dealt with,"" he added. ""Though a couple of solutions are being suggested, their success is limited and the costs involved are heavy,"" Harinder added.Gurpreet Singh, a farmer from Loharka Road in Amritsar, said he was aware of the fact that stubble burning had adverse effects on not just the environment, but also his land. ""But crop prices are already not viable, and there is inflation... how can I spend extra on machinery to remove stubble? It is easier to burn it,"" he added. Another farmer, Preetam Singh, who had set stubble on fire over his sevenacre field, said: ""If the government is so concerned about Delhi's pollution and holds stubble burning responsible for it, then it should study all the aspects and address the issue on priority. But you just can't impose fines on us.""""Forget Delhi; there are times when even we have trouble breathing on account of the smoke. But all this has become a part of our lives now,"" said Sukhwant Singh of Bir Talaab village near Bathinda. Bathinda deputy commissioner Basant Garg said orders banning stubble burning had been issued, and added that 11 cases were registered within one day, on October 27, in the district. However, the farmers claim that the Punjab government is going soft on the issue, with assembly elections just a few months away.(Inputs by I P Singh, Yudhvir Rana and Neel Kamal.

To address these issues, science and technology is very important. But while finding solutions to these problems, we should not ignore sustainable development and conservation of biodiversity, Modi said at the first international conference on agro-biodiversity attended by 900 delegates from 60 countries.Cautioning against the extinction threat to plant and animal species, he stressed on the need to adopt a shared vision for conserving them through focused research and proper management of genetic resources.Terming pesticides as a major concern in agri ecosystem, Modi said, The use of pesticide not only kills pests but also those insects necessary for the entire eco-system. Therefore, there is a need to audit developments in science. In the absence of audit, the world is facing various challenges.The prime ministers comments come at a time when commercial release of genetically modified (GM) mustard hybrids are under the governments considerations. While the loss of biodiversity is not an issue with GM mustard, one of the reasons for not releasing GM brinjal by the UPA government was the fear of loss of brinjals biodiversity."

Xalxo has set an example for other traditional farmers with his gradual shifting to mechanised farming.Assured water availability helped him cultivate ICAR 1509 variety of scented Basmati paddy during third week of June. Crop cutting was completed in four days by October 10 and he got an yield of about 25 tonnes.Xalxo said he has also cultivated Swarna variety of paddy for personal consumption on another six acres and crop cutting would be completed in a month.Unlike other traditional farmers, who usually get one crop in a year,Xalxo gets three crops. A former army man and sitting Lathikata Sarparch, Xalxo has bought a Rubberised Sheller machine at `2.4 lakh at 75 per cent government subsidy. It would ensure minimum damage during removal of husks and produce fine quality of long and slender Basmati rice which would fetch him at least `40 per kg.District Agriculture Officer (DAO) RK Mangal said, Xalxo is a role model for others and without entirely depending on Government he is making a difference. Agriculture Department is encouraging him with all possible support, Mangal added."

(AP Photo/Bebeto Matthews)UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon expressed alarm at the weakening taboo against using chemical weapons in Syria where the international watchdog said it is studying several recent cases of alleged use of the banned agents, according to a letter circulated Monday.The UN chief said in a letter to the Security Council transmitting the monthly report from the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons that he is gravely concerned that the use of chemical weapons could become normalized in this or any conflict, present or future.Watch what else is in the newsIt is imperative that those responsible for the use of chemical weapons should be held accountable, Ban told the council in the letter.The OPCW said in its report covering the period from Sept. 23 to Oct. 22 that its fact-finding mission is studying four widely reported allegations of chemical weapons use, and is investigating the alleged use of a chemical agent in Aleppo on Aug. 2 at the request of the Syrian government.OPCW Director-General Ahmet Uzumcu said the organizations fact-finding mission continues studying all available information of alleged chemical weapons use with a particular focus on widely reported incidents in the Saraqib in Idlib governorate, and three incidents in the Aleppo governorate  in Aleppo city, Zubdiya, and Al Sukkari.He did not provide details but said the intensity of the ongoing conflict in Aleppo is a major challenge to the missions work.Uzumcu said an OPCW team was sent to Damascus from Oct. 12-19 in response to the Syrian governments request to investigate the alleged use of chemical weapons on Aug. 2 in the area of Al-Awamid in Aleppo. He said it will continue to work with Syrian authorities to gather more information.The OPCW has a mandate to carry out fact-finding missions to determine whether chemical attacks occurred in Syria, but not to determine responsibility. In September 2014, the Security Council established an international body to assign blame for chemical attacks.That body, the Joint Investigative Mechanism, or JIM, has already determined that the Syrian government was behind three attacks involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State extremist group was responsible for one involving mustard gas.Syrias government has been repeatedly accused by the United States and other Western countries of using chemical weapons on its own people, even after the Security Council in 2013 ordered the elimination of its chemical weapons program following an attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of civilians.The council last year also condemned the use of toxic chemicals like chlorine after growing reports of barrel bombs filled with chlorine gas being dropped on opposition-held areas. Chlorine is widely available and not officially considered a warfare agent, but its use as a weapon is illegal.Uzumcu said poor security has prevented the destruction of Syrias remaining declared chemical weapons production facilities. He said questions also remain over its initial declaration of its chemical holdings.Ban retierated the need for the Syrian government and the OPCW to work together to resolve all identified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies in the declaration.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Considered to be 'heaty', kulatachi pithi used to be consumed widely in the past, particularly in certain regions in the Western Ghats, as it was believed to increase body temperatures during the cold season.Horse gram, known as kulith locally and Macrotyloma uniflorum scientifically, is a leguminous, protein-rich lentil that got its name from being used as a staple for horses and cattle. While it was once grown and consumed in various parts of Goa, cultivation of the pulse crop is presently confined to Mencurem, Sal, Dhumashe and a few other remote villages. Its quick, dense growth is known to play a vital role in curbing soil erosion.Kulatachi pithi is prepared by roasting a cup of dry horse gram until brown and grinding it to a powder along with peppercorns, cumin and mustard seeds. This mixture is then soaked in water for a while and later boiled with salt, garlic cloves and groundnut oil. Water can be added if the gravy becomes too thick. A garnish of finely chopped coriander leaves completes the dish.Another delectable preparation is kulatacho ros, which involves soaking horse gram in water for 12 hours and then bundling the seeds into a muslin cloth until they sprout. Red chillies, coriander, cinnamon powder, dried garlic cloves, ginger, grated copra, pepper and cloves are then roasted in a shallow pan on low flame. Water and salt is added to these spices along with the sprouted horse gram seeds. Once ready, kulatacho ros can be relished with boiled rice or chappatis.Thanks to the anti-oxidant, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal properties of horse gram, several people incorporate the pulse into their cooking, especially individuals suffering from kidney stones, high blood sugar, cold and asthma."

The situation is equally distressful in states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.Soon after daybreak, driving through the forests of Sonitpur district in Assam in late 2005 we made a quick U-turn when a herd of around 15-20 elephants, young ones in tow, emerged from the forest to forage right next to the road leading to the fishing camp at the Nameri Tiger Reserve. The night before, we watched as elephants raided paddy stocks in a village near Balipara, unafraid of the mashaals (fire torches), drums and yells of the distressed villagers. Even as we turned, the matriarch followed our vehicle for 20 metres or so, trumpeting protectively from around 30 metres to make sure we got her message loud and clear.I know this part of India well and before my eyes, I have seen some of Indias most precious forests sacrificed to satiate political expediency using mistaken notions of tribal rights as a fig leaf to exchange land for votes. On a site visit to the same area 10 years later, I found myself speechless at the sheer destruction. In a decade, virtually the entire standing forest on the right bank of the Jiya Bharoli river had vanished. In its place were sparse mustard fields and scattered tree stumps that spoke of once-tall hardwoods whose trunk girth would have been three or four metres at the very least.Similar stories unfold across vast areas of Sonitpur. We had predicted such disaster when the Forest Rights Bill was being debated way back in 2004-05. We asked, at the very least, a consensus be arrived at that individual rights not be included. A leading NGO, Kalpavriksh, amongst the most vociferous supporters of the flawed FRA, agreed with us in principle but went forward with other groups who threw such suggestions to the wind. Today, much too late, Kalpavriksh agrees that a site-specific amendment to Section 3 (1) of the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, should have been made in Sonitpur to roll back the 2005 cut-off date to 1980, in consonance with the Forest Conservation Act. Subsequent to that admission, no further action was taken.As we have seen happen time and again with urban slum rehabilitation and regularisation schemes, the horse had bolted. The barn door was never shut. What ails the FRA?To begin with, the Act was intended only for tribal communities, but this was later extended to all forest dwellers. Second, individual rights trumped community rights which is evident from the statistics taken from the website of the ministry of tribal affairs from the report on FRA implementation. According to these statistics, people are predictably keen to claim individual rights as this enables them to encash real estate and other financial opportunities. Third, no time limit was definitively set. Had a cut-off date been effectively applied, we would not be in a position where even today deforest, encroach and claim rights continue unabated because gram sabhas would have finalised all rights within two years. And the date was 1980 in the first version of the bill.Here is what the learned Supreme Court judges had to say in an order passed in response to Writ Petition(s)(Civil) No(s) 109/2008 and 50/2008.Mr Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the petitioner placed before us certain statistical data which indicates that as on September 30, 2015, approximately 44 lakh claims for recognition of the rights under the above-mentioned Act and grant of pattas came to be filed before the authorities competent to deal with those claims in various states out of which some of the claims were accepted and some were rejected. From the information placed before this court by the petitioners, it appears, approximately 20.5 lakh claims were rejected in the above-mentioned 44 lakh claims. Obviously, a claim in the context of the above-mentioned Act is based on an assertion that a claimant has been in possession of a certain parcel of land located in the forest areas. If the claim is found to be not tenable by the competent authority, the result would be that the claimant is not entitled for the grant of any patta or any other right under the Act but such a claimant is also either required to be evicted from that parcel of land or some other action is to be taken in accordance with law.Nevertheless, encroachers are not being evicted even after their claims have been rejected. What is more, most lands allotted are unfit for agriculture, condemning claimants to work as landless labour on the properties of richer landholders. The allotment of such lands means that the tribal families have to survive on sustenance farming without access to water, sanitation, health, education and medical facilities.Even today, the cutting of trees continues. None of the cutting was or is legal. The tribals never had and still do not have title to the land. The elephant herds have vanished, but every once in a while, they return to raid crops. As many as 30 were poisoned in Sonitpur by angry farmers. Neither humans nor elephants are safe any longer. The Kameng-Sonitpur Elephant Reserve (KSER) offers refuge to elephants, in a small measure, but almost daily, as a direct result of human interventions, reports of wild elephant herds creating havoc in Sonitpur, appear in the media.The situation is equally distressful in states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Here, too, in order to grow food on forestlands, locals were encouraged to deforest areas with political patronage. The objective is achieved by burning trees and ground vegetation, then planting food crops on the ash-fertilised remains. But, because the vast bulk of the forest nutrients are quickly washed or blown away, such farms are incapable of offering anything more than borderline livelihoods to farmers. This is precisely what gave rise to marginal farming, coined by economists to describe millions condemned to penury. Far from creating self-sufficiency, this has ended up eroding Indias food security, in part because downstream farms find themselves deprived of the flood, drought-control and nutrient-spread gifted by upstream forests.As I write, the discussion seems Daliesque. The FRA provides a 90-day limit for filing claims. The Act was passed in 2005 (Rules in 2007). Can we seriously be discussing new claims even today? Surely we should collectively agree that no limits be allowed or extended under any circumstances? Remember, that our protected area network barely covers three per cent of our land and acts as an insurance against climate change, floods and droughts. Under no circumstances should such lands be open to the claim of any private rights whatsoever. In fact, it is vital that the long-pending rules to define Critical Wildlife Habitats be framed without further delay and that those deemed to be encroachers vacate such biodiverse lands.Social activists and wildlife groups must both accept that no rights can be championed, nor wildlife saved, if the forests at the centre of the tussle vanish. Social activists talk of harmonious co-existence. But I ask  can 6,000 people live in harmony in 600 sq km with 60 tigers and over 600 elephants with the nearest market for forest produce being six km away? Given that the FRA is a reality and without going into the merits or demerits of the legislation itself, I wonder whether it might be possible for those living next to forests to form cooperatives with the singular purpose of restoring eco-systems back to health on their own lands. This may be easier said than done, but it is possible if a basket of benefits can be channelled to communities that opt for eco-system farming, instead of bajra, wheat or paddy. If this is achieved, the answer to the rhetorical question Can the Forest Rights and Wildlife (Protection) Acts be friends? might well be Yes!.

But given the importance of the decisions, it did trigger coverage.Newspaper and magazine archives of the 1946 decision do not seem to be available online. Therefore, I relied on Reserve Bank of India commissioned history of Indias central bank to get an idea of how a stakeholder perceived the decision.The following extract of RBIs history volume is sourced from Mostly Economics, a blog on economic developments in India.According to RBIs relevant volume:Sir Chintaman Deshmukh (governor) felt that we may not get even as much as Rs. 10 crores as additional tax revenue from tax evasion and that the contemplated measure, if designed to achieve such a purpose, has no precedent or parallel anywhere. If value is going to be paidfor value (no matter whether such value is in lower denomination notes), it is not going to obliterate black markets. His advice is that we should think very seriously if for the object in view (as he deduces from the declaration form) whether this is an opportune time to proceedwith the scheme. Provided Government are satisfied on the points of (i) sparing harassment to the unoffending holders and (ii) a worthwhile minimum of results in the shape of extra tax revenue, he does not wish to object to the scheme as drafted, if Government wish to proceed with it notwithstanding the administrative difficulties involved.It was not the first time an RBI governor was skeptical of governments move to strip currency of legal tender characteristic at short notice.In 1978, when Janata government proclaimed an ordinance, some of the media coverage of the development was available online.A Times of India report (sourced in-house) published on 17th January 1978 said:A press note issued tonight said that the ordinance had been promulgated because there was reason to think that high-denomination notes were facilitating the illegal transfer of money for financing transactions which are harmful to the national economy or which are for illegal purposes. There has been concern in recent months over the behaviour of agricultural prices particularly of edible oils. In spite of a bumper harvest agricultural prices are ruling much higher than after the poor harvest of 1976- 77. Massive imports of edible oil have failed to bring down prices and the mustard oil price control order has failed miserably to give the consumer his requirements at the specified rate. There has been a feeling that a considerable amount of black money has gone to finance hoarding and speculation. The demonetisation of high denomination currency notes will hit black money hard.An analysis of the move was written by Jay Dubashi in one of India Todays February editions. Dubashi reported that the ordinance had a ripple effect on other markets such as gold and diamond where prices slumped by 5 to 10% within a week. In addition, the old notes were going at 70% discount in Bombays Zaveri Bazar.In his report, Dubashi wrote:Politics apart, the demonetization is unlikely to curb black money in circulation, for the simple reason that no one really knows how much black money there is in circulation and, even more important, whether black money can really be defined in precise terms in all its shades.I.G Patel was governor of RBI when the ordinance was promulgated in 1978. He was not happy about the government move.Mostly Economics quotes the relevant part from Patels memoirs which are as follows.such an exercise seldom produces striking results. Most peoplewho accept illegal gratification or are otherwise the recipientsof black money do not keep their ill-gotten earnings in the formof currency for long. The idea that black money or wealth isheld in the form of notes tucked away in suit cases or pillowcases is nave. And in any case, even those who are caught nappingor waitingwill have the chance to convert the notesthrough paid agents as some provision has to be made to convertat par notes tendered in small amounts for which explanationscannot be reasonably sought. But the gesture had to bemade, and produced much work and little gain.It is early days and the context of 2016 is different, but history does not give us reason to be optimistic."

He has specialised in bonsai gardening.For those of you who dont know, bonsai is a Japanese art form of growing trees in containers.Damle says that a love for gardening runs in the family. I saw my father gardening as a child. During my holidays, I visited my aunts place and she had a huge coffee estate and a beautiful garden. My grandmother too was into gardening. In fact, she used to say she has green fingers, he says. His first memory of gardening is planting mustard seeds in cotton, in a saucer and watching them grow. I think that inspired me to take up gardening later, he says.His passion is also driven by the primacy of plants. Caring for them, watching them grow gives me satisfaction and a sense of well-being. The sense of calm that I guess Nature enjoys is transferred to me, he saysBonsai is an unusual choice for a gardener, but Damle says he was drawn to it when he mistook it for magic as a child. When I was 11 years old, my uncle gave me a Readers Digest Crafts & Hobbies book, he says. I have always been a creative kid. In this book, there was a section on bonsai gardening. I initially thought it was magic. It was only later I came across bonsai trees and so, I made my own bonsai garden.Damle has managed to inspire a young boy, in his neighbourhood to try his hand at bonsai gardening too. My neighbors boy used to visit my home, he says. He would come along with his friends to play with my nephew and they would all see me gardening. He is 17 years old today, and has his own bonsai collection, about 20 plants. Damles young neighbours friends too have started gardening.Though Bengalureans complain of the citys changing and harsher weather, Damle frets little over it. It is ideal, he says. Bengaluru has a temperate climate, good sunshine and decent monsoon. The sun isnt harsh here and neither are the rains incessant.Tips First, basics: The soil should be grainy so that it doesnt get clogged. Best is a well-balanced mixture of sand, clay and humus. Location matters. Also, dont move the plant many times. Once a plant gets used to a place, let it stay there. A slow release fertilizer is the best for your plants. It promises the right amount of nutrients on a long-term basis and avoids the feast and famine effect. For beginners, dont collect too many species. Larger number of same species visually has a greater effect."

But, his supplier, a wholesaler, refuses extend that courtesy to him. Subhas Mondal's worry is on the same lines. His problem is that the wholesaler he buys from isn't chasing him for payments, fearing he will be dumped with old currency. ""But where will I generate cash to pay our wholesalers, especially when we are accepting Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes from regular customers,"" he asked. There are hundreds of retailers who are facing the same predicament as Shao and Mondal after the demonetisation of high-value currency was announced a week ago. Mondal said he wasn't sure if he would be able to stock up food-grain and edible oil at his shop next month. ""As we are dependent on cash transactions, both with our customers as well as wholesalers, we cannot suddenly switch over to doing business in cheques. Moreover, we have to look after the interest of our regular customers too. Hence, we are left with no option but to accept banned currencies,"" he said. Several other retailers claimed that wholesalers had stopped supplies. ""I had gone to bring 10 tins of mustard oil, but returned with only two as the wholesaler refused to give me the stuff on credit.

""We do our business with rice traders in Bengal, Odisha and Chhatisgarh in cheque. We also pay our traders in cash, but when the government has banned Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, why should we accept them from the retailers,"" he asked, adding that they were following this practice since the morning of November 9, the day after the demonetisation was announced. Bhalotia said the government was in the process of releasing new Rs 500 and Rs 2,000 notes. ""Let retailers come with these notes and we will resume our business.

About 260 ha have been taken under Government programme in which farmers are provided with seeds, bio-fertilizer and need-based pesticide. About 1,500 mini-kits have been provided to beneficiaries, he said.Sources said above 6,000 farmers in the district are involved in mustard cultivation during the season with majority of the area having irrigation facilities. The m ost ideal time for mustard farming is October to November while the crops get ready for harvest in 100 to 120 days. Farmers with efficient field and crop management capabilities may end up getting yields of 8-10 quintals per ha at maximum production cost of around Rs 10,000 per ha including labour component.Bijay Xalxo, a progressive farmer, said he has targeted to cultivate mustard on 40-45 acres and seed sowing has been completed on eight acres. This time, he is more focused and exuded confidence to harvest 12-15 tonnes. If everything goes on expected line, he would get Rs 4,500 per quintal, Xalxo added.Panposh District Agriculture Officer (DAO) RK Mangal said with efficient management, a farmer can get four quintals from an acre at a maximum production cost of Rs 4,000. He said farmers in the district usually extract oil for personal use. They also have the option of selling oil after extraction which additionally ensures return of above Rs 1,500 against a quintal of byproducts. Farmers have also option to sell mustard seeds to oil mills and traders for Rs 3,500 to Rs 4,500 per quintal, Mangal added.The DDA claimed that the district is most suitable for mustard crop with winter usually extending till February, but lamented that sunflower cultivation has been reduced for lack of marketing link, inadequate seeds and processing mills to extract oil."

On the credit front, the 3,000-odd branches of cooperative banks in the state are unable to offer loans because they are not getting enough funds from lead banks (public sector banks) that are busy servicing the crowds at their own doorsteps. The impact is already telling on the ground. The state agriculture department today decided to shelve midway its campaign of drawing farmers to the banks to obtain loans through their Kisan Credit Cards. The one-month campaign was supposed to have been carried out between November 7 and December 7. ""But we decided to stop the campaign from tomorrow as farmers are not getting loans from banks, not even the cooperative banks on which they depend heavily,"" said an agriculture department official. According to an estimate, around 2,000 of the 3,345 gram panchayats in Bengal depend solely on cooperative banks. The lead bank scheme had been launched to strengthen the cooperative banks after it emerged decades ago that nationalised banks shared only 1 per cent of the burden of institutional credit in agriculture. The lion's share was shouldered by the cooperative banks. ""But as the commercial banks themselves are stressed following the demonetisation, the cooperative banks are facing a crunch and the rural people have no place to go,"" said a source. ""We usually withdraw Rs 10 lakh a day from our current account at our lead bank during the peak season. But in the past one week, we got a total of Rs 8 lakh.... So, it's not possible to meet the demand for loans from the farmers,"" said the manager of a cooperative bank in Rampurhat, Birbhum. The cooperative banks' large customer base, made up mostly of farmers, faces a crippling problem on deposits, too. A cooperative department official said the branches of cooperative banks have stopped taking deposits in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes following an RBI notification issued on November 14. The RBI notification said: ""No exchange facility against the specified bank notes (Rs 500 and Rs 1,000) or deposit of such notes should be entertained by them (district central cooperative banks)."" An official in the state cooperative department said: ""It appears that as the majority of the cooperative banks did not make KYC (know your customer) mandatory, the RBI has prevented them from accepting deposits.... The decision has affected nearly 2 crore account holders of the cooperative banks."" He said: ""The two problems are enough to kill the rural economy.... The rural populace, more than 70 per cent of whom depend on agriculture, are forced to go to faraway places to exchange their old notes, which is causing a loss of mandays. The non-availability of loans is bound to hit the rabi (winter) cultivation this year."" Usually, around 10 lakh hectares are cultivated during the rabi season, whose produce includes potatoes, other vegetables and oilseed. ""Our estimate is that the area under cultivation would shrink by 30 per cent and the total sown area would be below 7 lakh hectares this year,"" said the official. The plight of Seikh Nijamuddin, a Birbhum farmer who has 22 bighas of cultivable land, tells a story. He had taken a loan of Rs 25,000 during the kharif (monsoon) season from a cooperative bank. He had arranged for Rs 27,000, all in Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes, to repay the loan and apply for a fresh loan of Rs 48,000 to sow mustard and potato seeds. ""But the cooperative bank is not taking the old currency notes, and I have been unable to exchange the notes even after visiting banks located 20km from my village as the exchange limit is only Rs 4,500,"" Nijamuddin said. The farmer said that if he did not get the loan within the next seven days, his cultivation plans would be thrown into disarray."

But, at Caf Dalal Street in Connaught Place, it is business as usual. The restaurant recently launched new menu on the completion of its one year in the food market. The year saw plenty of new options in the famed Connaught Circus, but Cafe Dalal Street has managed to tide over the inflation of culinary options in the area. So, the foodie in me accepted the invitation and went for a gastronomic journey to this vibrant restaurant. One of the owners and my host Himanshu Gupta was there to guide me. He said, We are celebrating one year of our restaurant through introducing some new options to our menu. Himanshu suggested me to try and start the evening with lamb brisket. The soft and tender delicacy won my heart. The breast of lamb was cooked to perfection. I liked the taste of light spices in it. This lamb dish and DJs music set the evening and my mood.Chef Jiten and chef Hemant are behind the new menu of the restaurant. They said, We have created new menu with 19 different dishes. When they came to know about my love for prawns, they suggested tempura prawns. So my second serve of the evening was crispy and sweet tempura prawns cooked with Italian herbs. Hard to achieve, the crispiness of prawns was almost perfect.As the evening progressed, one could feel the young vibe in the restaurant. Himanshu said, This is the right place for people who want to come with their friends and enjoy different cuisines, drinks and music. I picked dahi kabab from the new menu. I liked the taste of spices (garam masala) and the aroma of green coriander. My virgin mojito mocktail was going well with food.After a pause, I moved to the Moroccan roast lamb. This lamb was cooked in harissa paste with different spices and I loved both the presentation and taste of this delicacy.Himanshu said, Our new menu is the result of the appreciation we get from our customers. Good food and customer satisfaction inspired us to bring something new. The restaurant serves European, Asian and Indian cuisine. On Himanshus suggestion, I tried grilled fish. The fillet of sole fish was grilled with lemon mustard sauce. I liked and enjoyed the tanginess of mustard sauce. I also tried burnt chilli crispy chicken and chicken mushroom tacos. And then moved on to something absolutely desi  Amritsari chur chur naan with chhole. They had the earthy flavours that I was looking for. The authentic taste of this North Indian food almost completed my evening. But there was more. A sizzling brownie with vanilla ice cream proved to be a rich finale to a fulfilling experience.Address: Cafe Dalal Street, M 89/90, Outer Circle, CPMeal for two: Rs. 1600 plus taxes"

Non-germination has forced the farmers to go for re-sowing, causing them financial losses and harassment.After numerous complaints, the university has also ordered an internal probe in the matter. The mustard seed (variety name RH-749) was produced by the prestigious Ram Dhan Singh Seed Farm of HAU and was sold at the varsity's sale counters in September. Farmers had sown the seed in October. They are now approaching the agriculture officers after it failed to germinate.Though that university is claiming that it could not quantified the exact losses but source told TOI that university had sold the seed for around 3,000 acres and maximum sale was witnessed during 'Kisan Mela' organized by the university on September 9-10, when farmers across the state had visited institution.A detailed report has also been prepared by the local agriculture officers and has been sent to senior officials of the department. Farmers are complaining that seed failed to germinate because it was of 2015 lot and HAU authorities had cheated the farmers by selling old seed.Talking to TOI, some farmers even shared the tags pasted on the seed packing clearly showing that it of 2015 lot.Rajender Singh, a farmer of Bidhwan village in Bhiwani district, said not even 5% of mustard seed sown in eight acres germinated. ""I had purchased only 15kg for Rs 60 per kg. The issue is not the loss of amount spent on purchase of seed but the problem is that we have gone past the ideal sowing period due to this,"" Rajender added.Kuldeep Singh, a resident of adjoining Matani village, said he had purchase 40kg mustard seed for his 27-acre land, which had not sprouted. ""Most of packing of seed given to me was of March-2015 lot, I have given complaint to the agriculture department along with bills and tag,"" he added.Various farmers are disappointed because they never thought that seed purchase from HAU would also be of such quality. Some farmers also claimed that seed in 3kg packing having the 2016 lot tag has full germination and the problem was only with the 5kg and 15kg packing having the tag of 2015.Atma Ram, deputy director (agriculture) Bhiwani, also confirmed receipt of complaints. Accepting the problem, director of research, CCSHAU S S Siwach told TOI that a committee has been constituted to probe what has gone wrong.He, however, claimed that seed was sold only after it was cleared by notified laboratory and there can be some climatic factors or wrong sowing patterns that might led to non-germination. On the charges of selling 2015 lot seed, Siwach said that it was sold only after re-validation from the laboratory. He added that some teams have also been constituted to visit the farmers and probe the issue."

In the modern world which has witnessed mushrooming of oil mills, the indigenous machine has become a hit among the visitors.People are making a rush to not only explore the oil extractor but also avail pure edible sesame, mustard and almond oil.While the traditional 'Ghana' is on the verge of extinction, the Cuttack Mahanagar Tailika Baishya Samaj has attempted to popularise it at the Baliyatra fair. The body distributed sesame oil to more than 600 people free of cost on the opening day of the fair.Prasant Kumar Prusty (28) of Chainpur village in Dhenkanal district has set up his Ghana at the fair. Prasant has engaged two bullocks for pulling the instrument for extracting oil manually.Prasant said he adopted the profession from his father. Despite modernity, many in Chainpur have taken up the traditional hereditary profession of extracting oil manually through Ghana, he informed.A few years back, there were more than 25 Ghanas in the village. However with the passage of time, some have shifted to other profession. At present, there are only four to five Ghanas left in the village, said Prasant.At least three litre of edible oil can be extracted from manual grinding of about seven kg of sesame, mustard and almond seeds. Unlike the edible oil available in market, the oil extracted in Ghana is pure, he said.''We are selling sesame and almond oil at `240 per litre and mustard oil in the range of `240 to `260 depending upon the two qualities of mustard seeds,'' Prasant said and added that a large number of customers is showing interest for these products.Kamala Kanta Swain, a resident of Berhampur, said he has purchased two litres each of sesame, mustard and almond oil for household use as there is no adulteration in the process."

If inhaled, chlorine gas turns to hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by burning lungs and drowning victims in the resulting body fluids.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington. The Security Council backed that deal with a resolution that said in the event of non-compliance, including unauthorized transfer of chemical weapons, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, it would impose measures under Chapter 7 of the UN Charter.Chapter 7 deals with sanctions and authorization of military force by the Security Council.

(PTI Photo) Opposition members protest in the well of Rajya Sabha during the winter session of Parliament in New Delhi on Friday. (PTI Photo)At dawn all the clocks stop, and a shooting star appears in the sky. Midnight instead of dawn, ATMs in place of clocks, and this amazing sentence could be a satirical riff on the chaos of demonetisation, and the extraordinary rah-rah cult which it has ignited among the believers. Actually, it is a tweet from @MagicRealismBot, a machine which dreams up sentences reminiscent of Borges and Marquez every two hours.In India this week, reality has been doing better than magic realism. The ruckus on Rajya Sabha TV was more gripping, even, than a BBCs Hardtalk with Patricia Cornwell, which was running at the same time on Thursday. There were the cheeky subterfuges, for instance, by which the UP Congressman Pramod Tiwari kept repeating the names of certain tyrants in the House, in close conjunction with the name of the prime minister. And the satisfaction with which Venkaiah Naidu said that they had been struck off the record, quite forgetting that Tiwaris speech was broadcast live and had already been shared on the internet, which is the only public record which really matters. This list of autocrats who demonetised their currencies is going to hurt as much as Sitaram Yechurys Modi Antoinette, an internet meme which owes originally to a very talented graphic artist.All this excitement, just to bring back socialism? After all the denunciations, Nehru is back. The queue is back, Nehrus most durable legacy, with the exception of the Bhakra Nangal Dam. Shortages are back. The demonisation of prosperity is back, something that Indira Gandhi had turned to advantage and that the Left can identify with. In a sarcastic speech televised two years ago, Narendra Modi had told Sitaram Yechury that he recalled the days when the CPI(M) told voters that their blood fuelled the cars of the rich. Yechury got his own back this week in the Rajya Sabha. But going by the behaviour of the Treasury benches, and by the Prime Ministers determination to keep away in order to attend less important events, the government may not agree. They are inside a bubble as opaque as the one which once housed Mrs Gandhi.The media have battled valiantly to make sense of a senseless situation. We have struggled with the strange drama of prime ministerial speeches and the incontrovertible evidence of nationalism and sacrifice seen in queues. And invisible soldiers. They crop up in every discourse these days, even in conversations about ATMs.Talk show panels are still out on whether this was an economic or political project. Are we seeing intelligent design or ignorant bungling? For days on end, headlines about a surgical strike dominated newspapers and television, when the real story was precisely the opposite  massive collateral damage among innocents. And it took days for the reality to sink in, in cartoonish form  the government has only variable geometry policy du jour. The rules are changing every day in response to media reports, and since the hapless Urjit Patel is missing in action, the equally hapless Shaktikanta Das is trotted out to convince the press that it all makes sense.Meanwhile, Ramdev tells Shekhar Gupta that the BJP blundered into the wedding season because so many of them are bachelors. The Finance Minister is married but clueless nevertheless, protesting about unnecessary panic. What we are seeing and experiencing ourselves is not panic. This is concern for family and friends who may not be equal to the new religious requirement to stand in line for hours to get ones own money. And the concerned are not likely to forget Arun Jaitleys put-down.In the middle of all this, there have been flashes of insight. CNBC reported as fishy the rise in deposits in state-owned banks. Former RBI governor Duvvuri Subbaraos warning to the central bank against using deposits to remonetise banks and offset the burden of non-performing assets gained wide traction. But Arun Jaitleys intervention on NPAs in the Rajya Sabha, in the light of reports that banks are writing off thousands of crores borrowed by wilful defaulters, wasnt really examined. He clarified that a writeoff did not imply that the government had cancelled the liability. In that case, why arent all dodgy loans written off and recovery pursued nevertheless?In this bizarre political landscape, the Prime Minister has pulled it off the improbable yogic balancing act of playing hell with the markets while resurrecting the ghost of the long-forgotten index of Opposition unity. If the Sainiks and arch-anarchist Arvind Kejriwal marches with Mamata Banerjee, it could be the beginning of something interesting, as they compete for constituencies which became collateral damage to the surgical strike. Meanwhile, we have all learned to live on credit, from housewives shopping for sarson ka saag to farmers buying mustard seeds. Our government, which is focused on economic issues and came to power on the promise of growth, may recall that credit is a polite word for debt.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Teachers associations have claim that schools in villages are falling short of low denomination currency to purchase vegetables, mustard oil and to pay for the LPG connections. Every school has a School Management Committee (SMC) which looks after mid-day meal operations of that particular school.The SMC is authorized to draw money from the school bank account. As the ban has resulted into long queues, the amount withdrawal from the school accounts have literally stopped. ""The problem has just started as schools have replaced veggies by rice and soup. The SMC members have expressed inability to draw money from the bank due to long queues and dried up ATMs. This has been communicated to district education officer,"" said a school teacher in Barmer.State feeds mid-day meal to 62.50 lakh students from Class I to VIII. Three agencies are responsible for feeding these students. The SMCs account for about 58.58 lakh students, centralized kitchen is for 2.22 lakh students and others for 1.70 lakh students.Prakash Mishra, secretary of Rajasthan Teachers Association, states that if the problem continues then all SMCs will face the same problem. ""It is natural that SMCs members will first draw money for themselves.

Provision stores have hiked the price so much that islanders have started mulling alternative ways to procure salt.Cash-strapped farmer Dimbeswar Pegu exchanged pumpkins for a few packets of salt from a 'mahajan' (a term used by Mishing tribes for shop owners) in Barbil. With a poor literacy rate, islanders do not have access to ATMs. Ever since the notes were declared illegal tender, Pegu and his neighbours have been scrambling for notes. The long queues at banks have discouraged them from pursuing the exercise of swapping notes.""We are supposed to be busy tilling the land for Rabi crops, but we are queueing up at banks to exchange notes to buy ration essentials. We have never seen such a crisis. Almost everyone has been hit. We are not able to buy rice. As it is Barbil lost its paddy to floods and now this crisis,"" said Dimbeswar, who resides on the flood-prone area of the island. His residential area comes under the Bihpuria assembly constituency in Lakhimpur district.Before the monetary crunch hit the market hard, the people in Barbil were getting their regular supply of rice and financial help from the mahajans. But with mahajans running out of money, the people have been affected. They cannot buy in bulk from wholesalers.Dimbeswar's wife Premalata described her experience of going to the bank to exchange the old notes as harrowing. ""We have to cross the Luit (the Brahmaputra in local parlance) to reach the bank and grocery shops. After walking for nearly 14 km when you see a never-ending queue, what do you do?"" she asked.Premlata returned home without swapping her notes. She is dejected as she cannot fetch grocery. ""Can people outside the island, imagine our plight?"" she asked in despair.The Rabi crop is the only hope for the farmers of Majuli this year. They are eyeing mustard cultivation this winter to tide over the crisis.Even though mustard seeds cost more than rice, for the mahajans and the people of Barbil, both are of the same value. ""The price of a quintal of rice is about Rs 2,200. But the price of the same quantity of mustard seeds is more. We exchange mustard for rice. But this year the mahajans may not be able to give us rice,"" said Dimbeswar."

Experts with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons also believe the so-called Islamic State group may have itself manufactured mustard gas used in attacks in Syria and Iraq, the bodys director general Ahmet Uzumcu said.Watch What Else is Making NewsIt was an extremely worrying development for the OPCW, he said, as the organisation marks its 20th anniversary in 2017 having overseen the destruction of 94 per cent of the worlds declared chemical weapons.With the United States and Russia now on target to destroy their last remaining stockpiles within the next seven years, Uzumcu said stopping jihadists and individual groups getting hold of chemical weapons was a challenge which was at the top of the agenda for the organisation based in The Hague.He was speaking exclusively to AFP only hours after the UN Security Council extended the mandate for another year of a special joint UN and OPCW panel to allow it to investigate chemical attacks which have been reported in Syria this year.Since August 1 there had been a number of allegations, by both the Syrian regime and the opposition rebels, of the use of chlorine and unidentified agents in Aleppo and in northern parts of Syria such as Idlib, he said.The OPCW is already collecting information and analysing it, the OPCW director general said, to see if the allegations are credible or not in order to deepen our investigation.The number (of allegations) is quite high. I counted more than 20, said Uzumcu, revealing that even yesterday the Syrian authorities had sent to the OPCW fresh reports of chemical weapons use against them.The panel set up by the UN, known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, has already determined during a year-long probe that Syrian government forces carried out three chlorine gas attacks on villages in 2014 and 2015.It was the first time that an international inquiry pointed the finger of blame at President Bashar al-Assad and his forces, after years of denial from Damascus since the start of the civil war in 2011.The joint panel also found that Islamic State, which captured a large swathe of Iraq and Syria in 2014, was behind a mustard gas attack in Syria in August 2015.Samples of mustard gas taken from attacks in Syria and Iraq have been analysed by the OPCWs laboratories in The Netherlands and the findings do suggest that this substance may have been produced by ISIS itself, said Uzumcu.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

They claimed that scientists rigged the trial data to claim higher yield for the GM mustard.The charges were refuted by the researchers who stated that since the field trials were conducted under the supervision of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), they could not fudge the data.All the field data has been generated and submitted by the ICAR under its All India Coordinated Research Project on rapeseed mustard, Dave said in a written answer, responding to a query from CPM member K K Ragesh.Countering another argument from anti-GM activists, who claimed that GM mustard carried herbicide tolerant traits, Dave said there was no proposal to introduce herbicide tolerant crops.GE Mustard is assessed through a step-by-step process for safety assessment. A detailed Assessment of Food and Environmental Safety document was placed on the (environment) ministrys website inviting comments from all stakeholders, including the state governments, for 30 days.

One of the largest vegetable markets in Sector 26, wears a deserted look as the number of customers has come down drastically. There is a big fall in the price of green vegetables because off-take by vendors has come down substantially. Due to this reason, vegetable growers (farmers) have been hit hard. The price of cauliflower in the wholesale market has come down to Rs 200-250 per quintal from Rs 1,500-2,000 a quintal during the past 10 days, says Paramjit Singh, a vegetable grower from Jangpura village.WATCH VIDEO: How Demonetisation Impacts Rural PopulationThe business has taken a serious hit since the announcement of the decision to invalidate Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes. Customers have virtually vanished from the market. The business in the market has come down to 20 per cent as of now. There is no money in the market with the people and with me as well to do business, said Hari Om, a commission agent in the market.Similarly, small vendors say the sales have gone down.Consumers have cut down on buying vegetables and other stuff. The price of green coriander was around Rs 20 per small packet but now 2 packets of coriander fetch Rs 10, said a seller, Ravi.Tomato, which used to be around Rs 40 per kg, is now Rs 20 per kg, spinach which used to be Rs 20 per bundle now costs Rs 10 for two bundles and mustard leaves have come down from Rs 20 to Rs 25 per bundle to Rs 10. Another small vendor, Ashok said, Today, we are seeing some customers, perhaps because it is Sunday. Otherwise, for the past 5-6 days there were no buyers.

John Dorrian, a military spokesman in Iraq, said in an email on Monday, using another name for the terror group. ISIL has used them in Iraq and Syria in the past, and we expect them to continue employing these types of weapons.Col. Dorrian said the IS ability to use chemical arms is rudimentary, and that American, Iraqi and other allied troops are equipped to deal with the impact of these chemical attacks  typically rockets, mortar shells or artillery shells filled with chemical agents. The effects of these chemical munitions thus far have been limited to the immediate area where they land.The IHS assessment was set to be made public on Tuesday. The New York Times obtained an advance copy of the assessment and the location of the 52 reported chemical attacks. The analysis did not break down the cases by type of chemical attack.More attacks likelyIn an effort to blunt the IS ability to make the weapons, the U.S.-led air campaign has bombed militants associated with overseeing their production and the facilities where chemical ordnance is manufactured. In September, for instance, allied war-planes attacked a converted pharmaceutical factory in northern Iraq thought to have been a chemical weapons production facility.As Iraqi forces advance into Mosul, analysts warned that the IS could unleash more chemical attacks as they cede control. Iraqi forces have reclaimed about one-third of Mosul, Iraqs second-largest city.As the Islamic State loses ground around Mosul, there is a high risk of the group using chemical weapons to slow down and demoralise advancing enemy forces, said Columb Strack, a senior analyst and the head of the IHS Conflict Monitor.

Parmar, vice-chancellor of University of Horticulture & Forestry, Solan, Himachal Pradesh; a honey bee Jorhat, Nov. 24: An exotic honeybee, successfully acclimatised by the Assam Agricultural University here, promises to provide honey bounty to beekeepers. Ataur Rahman, the project's principal researcher, said the honeybee ( Apis mellifera) had been brought from Punjab where work had been done to adjust it to the Indian climate for 30 years. ""We worked to make the bee adjust to the climate since 1990. Diseases which affected it here have been tackled and cured. It was first released in Himachal Pradesh's Kulu valley, after which it was taken to the plains of Punjab,"" he said. The research project on honeybees and pollinators under the Indian Council of Agriculture and Research was awarded the best research among 28 centres in the country. The bee, which is bigger than the local ones, produces almost three times more honey in two migrations for cross-pollination (for example mustard followed by litchi). Rahman said the western bee produces on an average 25kg honey per hive per annum compared to only 10kg by local species. ""Moreover, it can forage a distance of 2km compared to the local species which can forage only 0.81km, thereby increasing cross-pollination of crops by 2.5 times,"" he said. Rahman said the project had standardised the pollination requirements of different cross-pollinated crops like oil seeds, fruits and vegetables and has enhanced productivity from 57.1 per cent to 249.53 per cent,"" he said. Rahman said trials were carried out extensively for the past 20 years before the bee was released to beekeepers. ""To keep the purity of the bees intact, we have begun selective breeding under which we can select only the best drones and queen bees,"" he said. The university has conducted 137 apiculture training sessions for 4,325 beneficiaries. Rahman said other work conducted under the project included finding the epidemiology of Thai sac brood disease of the Indian bee, developing effective management practices, diagnosing the nosemosis disease of the western bee and working out an effective control.

He wrote an entire series. Called Taranath Tantrik, these are tales of the supernatural, dealing with tantriks, kapaliks (black magic practitioners), hauntings and evil spirits. They are unputdownable.The format these stories are told is remarkable: the setting is Calcutta of the late 1930s and 1940s, when WWII is raging and inflation is eating up Bengalis incomes. On monsoon afternoons, under lowering skies, two friends, the narrator and his friend Kishori Sen, visit elderly Taranath, a former tantrik, now reduced to fortune-telling to make a living.They carry small gifts  telebhaja (deep-fried veggies in batter), a packet of Passing Show cigarettes, on one occasion rabri, which Taranath cannot afford any more. In return, they get endless cups of tea and a scary tale from Taranaths past.Apart from suspense and thrills, these addas offer rare glimpses into east Indian beliefs, customs and the economy at the turn of the 20th century. In one tale, Taranath mentions that in those days one could buy an entire goat for 6 annas, a little less than 40 paise. I was reminded of this on a visit to the local butcher, who sells mutton for Rs 500 per kg.These tales say when the finest rice tastes bitter in a mans mouth, he is about to die within days. I learnt that the best bait to catch fish is a little bit of the honey of the mustard flower, mixed with other ingredients. That, just a hundred years ago, consumption of tea was a rare luxury, even in Calcutta.Taranath is not the only exemplar of the fiction as adda genre in Bengal. In 1945, Premendra Mitra, a prolific writer, published a yarn called Mosha or Mosquito in a magazine. This gave birth to the tall, scrawny Ghanada, a resident of the mess at 72, Banamali Naskar Lane in Calcutta. Though penurious, Ghanada has a colourful past, with adventures that span science fiction, mystery, historical thrillers. Sudhir, the narrator, Shibu, Shishir and Gour comprise his fan club, coaxing Ghanada to disgorge his tales in return for  what else  cigarettes and tea.Then, theres Rajshekhar Bose, a Bengali polymath who majored in chemistry, wrote the first Bengali dictionary (Chalantika), and spun hundreds of satirical stories based on his knowledge of the scriptures (he also translated the Ramayana and Mahabharat in Bengali) under the pseudonym Parashuram.Among the many tales told in his freewheeling, adda style, is one called Dhusturi Maya or Datura Magic. It involves two friends, the wealthy Udbhab Babu and his less well-off buddy, Naren Babu.

Remember, Satyajit Rays first film after the Apu trilogy was Parash Pathar (The Philosophers Stone, 1958), based on an adda-style Parashuram story of the same name.The Bangali adda is, therefore, a potent cultural phenomenon with many knock-ons: in politics, education, literature and filmmaking.Auteur Mrinal Sen has written an adda memoir: among the gems, his  and other directors  struggles to get into the film industry without any resources; his recollection of friend Ritwik Ghataks smoking habits. Sen and friends smoked cheap cigarettes, 2 paisa for a packet of 10. Ghatak smoked bidis.At the time a bundle of 25 bidis was 10 paisa. But Ritwik had already drawn up credit worth Rs 80 at his bidi shop, wrote Sen. Thats two lakh bidis.Crowd wait to get into a session in Times Lit fest 2016, at IHC, in New Delhi, on Saturday. Photo Piyal BhattacharjeeThe late writer, Sunil Gangopadhyay, another well-known addabaaz, writes about the social stratification of chatting. While intellectuals and future politicos would blow off at Calcuttas Coffee House or in salons hosted by writer Buddhadeb Bose or poet Bishnu Dey, the gifted Kamalkumar Mazumdar would spend his talk time at Khalashitola, a down-market bar, originally intended for sailors, in existence for at least 100 years.In 2004, the Oxford English Dictionary incorporated adda as a noun; descriptors ranged from a place where people go for informal intellectual exchanges to an illicit drinking place. That spans it, across most cultures. The mohalla gathering is an adda, as is talk at Pramod Swains Presidency College canteen.People love to communicate, face to face. Its easier to have a conversation than messaging on a social network group. So, today, we have a new form of adda  the wildly popular literary festivals that started with Jaipur and are now hosted by The Times of India.All addas need a venue and a bunch of kindred souls. Today, with so little people time, this is probably the future of adda."

The 35-year-old and husband Devendra Singh (42) were apprehensive, but also excited. With a Rs 2,000 coupon, they for the first time stepped into a supermarket on November 27 to shop for daily items. But, the universe that lay before them, neatly arranged into shelves, didnt come cheap.What brought the Singhs to the Big Bazaar at Agras Sanjay Place, 23 km from home in Loha Karera village of Runakta tehsil, was the coupon given by the owner of the shoe factory where Devendra works, to cover for his weekly wages of Rs 1,000. Asha says she had never shopped for groceries at any place other than their village baniye ki dukaan before.Watch What Else Is making NewsShe was apprehensive about the quality of products they would get  big stores stocked things for days, she had heard  but Devendra was confident they would get the best price for their coupon.Like other small sectors, the Agra leather industry is feeling the heat of scrapping of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes. However, where the shortage is pinching the most is payment of weekly wages of labourers.Around 50,000 labourers are employed in Agras shoe manufacturing units, while in unorganised small-scale factories, the number is more than 2 lakh.According to the Agra Footwear Manufacturers and Exporters Chamber (AFMEC), which accounts for 30 per cent of Indias total shoe exports at Rs 3,500 crore per annum, there is no cash to pay daily labourers, and the lack of a workforce is in turn hitting exporters hard.Agras small-scale manufacturers are estimated to make 60 per cent of all shoes sold in the country.Said Sanket Thakur, a supplier of shoe soles in Mantola area of Agra, My earnings right now, at what is the peak time of our trade, are nil. After Diwali, till Holi, the sale of shoes is high due to winter as well as other festive occasions. But demonetisation has hit us hard. We are not able to clear our dues, let alone make new shoes.While he supports the government move to flush out black money, Puran Dawar, AFMEC president said, Since our labourers are paid wages in cash and on a weekly basis, we have not been able to pay them. Besides, they do not have bank accounts.Dawar said he had requested the government to give them at least six months to get bank accounts for the daily workforce, so that they could be paid online.In the meantime, AFMEC decided at a meeting on November 22 that factory owners would tie up with supermarkets such as Vishal Mega Marts and Big Bazaar for coupons to give to labourers so that they could meet their daily needs.Dawar said he understands that some of the workers might find it intimidating to shop at Big Bazaar, and so had also offered them to find shops of their convenience with which AFMEC could tie up.We have bought Rs 2 lakh worth of coupons from Big Bazaar, paying them online. We are also trying to get small-value coupons like for Rs 500 and Rs 200 to make things more convenient for our labourers, said Ravindra Singh, production head, Dawar footwears.Chandra Dev, the store manager at the Sanjay Place Big Bazaar, said, Many firms, all from the leather and footwear industry, are approaching us for cash coupons. Our customers have increased almost 30 to 40 per cent and the influx on weekends is enormous.However, the owner of a renowned shoe factory in Sikandra, who did not want to be named, said that this cannot be a long-term measure.Quoting the higher prices at some of these supermarkets compared to what the labourers get near home, he said, The labourers are not able to spend this. We are allowing them to go back to their native villages because they at least have homes there.Rajesh Sehgal of Om Exports added that they are not forcing their workers to take Big Bazaar coupons. We give them two options, either take a cheque or take the coupons. They are free to decide, he said.At the Sanjay Place Big Bazaar, the Singhs first decided to buy oil. At the local village shop, they get loose oil for Rs 80-85 per litre. Here mustard oil was for Rs 110 per litre. At Rs 90-100 per litre, refined oil cost almost Rs 30 more. After much debating, Asha and Devendra bought a 5-litre container of mustard oil and a litre of refined oil.They next headed towards the counter of soaps and washing powder. Asha was surprised to find that there were no soaps available for Rs 10. Sab 25, 40, 50 ke hain. Kitne lein (All are for 25, 40, 50. How many should we take)? she asked Devendra. He lifted the soap packets one by one to check the price, and then confirmed the same with a man standing next to him. Teen le lo, he said. Phir baad mein dekhenge (Buy three. We will see later).Everything was costlier, said Asha, whether sugar, ghee or dal. They couldnt buy toothpaste as the powdered one wasnt available.Seeing them struggling to balance the things they had picked, a Big Baazar employee rushed over with a basket. The couple were surprised, and delighted.Wanting to know how much money they had still left in the Rs 2,000 coupon, they headed for the payment counter. Dekhte hain, agar kuchch paise bache to bachchon ke liye kapde le lenge (We will see. If we save some money, we will buy clothes for the kids), said Asha, talking of their four daughters, Bhawna (12), Sadhna (9), Aastha (6) and Preeti (3). She and Devendra had promised to get them something from their trip to town.I will also buy some liquor with the left-over money, smiled Devendra.At the cash counter, watching closely what the others were doing, they handed over their products to a man behind the counter. The operator managed to pack all their things into one bag and handed them a bill. The Singhs looked at each other in dismay. The bill was for Rs 1,870, leaving them only with Rs 130, with some things still left to buy.Devendra asked the man at the counter to return him Rs 130, but he refused, saying they would have to buy goods for up to Rs 2,000 or more, since they werent returning any change.Asha nudged her husband, asking if they could instead pick up some namkeen (snacks) for their girls. Quietly, Devendra said yes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

58e50cd1a3d24b4437c4a958,"From Dubai, with love",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/From-Dubai-with-love/article16734454.ece,2016-12-01,"Chef Himanshu Saini is all of 29. The Chandni Chowk boy already has five years of work experience with chef Manish Mehrotra, and is the name behind the citys molecular gastronomy destination Masala Library and Delhis Farzi Caf.Now executive chef at Tresind, a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai, Saini was at the Four Seasons Hotel, Mumbai, last week as part of Cellar Doors pop-up. When we tell him that he looks younger than his age in pictures, he smiles, I have put on a bit of weight.Mumbai pop-upIt was during a meal at Tresind last year that included a wagyu kebab served with a chimichuri, that convinced the Cellar Door team that Saini was the right fit for their Mumbai pop-up. They clubbed the pop-up with an invitation to take part in the Food With Benefits event held at Atul Kocchars NRI recently.Each dish was unique, something I had never tried before, which was exciting, says Cellar Doors Nachiket Shetye. His partner Mangal Dalal adds, Contemporary food in India has become a very casual street food affair without the finesse. Saini stitches a story with his dishes. Saini, too, was itching to showcase dishes in Mumbai. We are pretty well-known in Dubai, but in India, not many know of our work. I know Mangal and Nachiket well, and it was a right fit of ideas, he says.Saini owes his expertise to Mehrotra. Whatever I am today is because of him. He is strict in the kitchen when it comes to quality, precision and following procedure: he will make you cry. Saini was selected as a trainee in his kitchen right after culinary school. At the end of five years with Indian Accent, Saini was promoted to sous chef. Itching to experiment with molecular gastronomy, he moved on to set up Masala Library in Mumbai in 2013. I always had the ambition to do something of my own, and many of my ideas didnt make it to the Indian Accent menu, as the chef believed the guests were not yet ready to accept them. Saini then set up Zorawar Kalras vision of a molecular gastronomy fine dining as well as Farzi Caf with friend and chef Saurabh Udinia.Sainis route to Dubai, however, went via New York, when he won a competition by Vermilion, a Latin American and Indian fusion restaurant in Chicago. He gave up his role at Farzi Caf and took up the offer to run their New York restaurant. Not all went well. Back in India, I was used to working with 20 chefs, and here was a mere team of three chefs, two of them being Mexicans who didnt understand a word of English. How was I to cook Indian food with them? I left within two months, he says.It was a regular customer at Masala Library who opened the next door. In 2014, Bhupendra Nath was setting up a modern Indian restaurant in Dubai and I took the chance to head the kitchen there. Dubai suits me best: there is a perfect mix of East and West, with a decent Indian crown, and Europeans and Arabs who love good food.Saini says molecular gastronomy goes deeper than the eye can see. I work with molecular gastronomy only when I am convinced it will enhance my dish. His creation of wild mushroom chai is still a bestseller at Masala Library. I have added it on my Tresind menu too. It is a consomm of dark mushroom, simmered in the oven for a few good hours. We served it as a tea set, the milk powder is actually an absorbent that turns to truffle oil when it hits water, and the tea leaves are dehydrated mushrooms. When you mix it all, it is the most comforting soup ever, he says, serving us what looks like a green balloon. We shuck it into our mouths like an oyster, but the burst of flavours are pudina, tamarind and chaat masala. Its a pani puri gubara with some crunchy boondi and weve been transported to Chandni Chowk. Sainis expertise shows off more in the false samosa. Its a samosa filling in a potato canola, with an ash of freeze dried chutney. It comes in a mini ash-tray, looks like a cigar, and has a bed of ash too. Yet, it tastes like the good old samosa.Since we are on the topic of chaat, in comes life is short eat dessert first, a jalebi on a bed of chaat. I recommend eating this with your hands, he smiles, and we follow suit. The cracker jalebi adds the sweet element to the otherwise tangy and spicy papdi chaat laden with a yogurt mousse. While jalebi and fafda and jalebi and samosa are a staple breakfast option in Gujarat and north India, clubbing it with chaat is a smart idea.Pullinji, a south Indian ginger and tamarind stir-fried prawns, is a dish that wins our attention with its glazed palm sugar crust, and curry-leaf flavoured tuile.Whats new?Earlier this year, in September, Saini launched his second eatery, Carnival by Tresind, a post-modern Indian restaurant in Dubai. Vineet Bhatia started the modern Indian cuisine at his London restaurant Zaika 20 years ago. What is life after modern India? It isnt more science, but in fact, goes back in time to traditional recipes without losing its fine dining avatar. My pop-up menu includes dishes from both the restaurants, says Saini, pointing to the table that has around 20 bowls of masalas: mustard oil, brown onions from Lucknow, farsan, papad churi from Rajasthan, kesar and red onions from Kashmir, and even south Indian curry leaves tempering. All these will go into the pot of khichdi we have cooked for over eight hours, he says.Saini is greatly influenced by street food. I grew up in Chandni Chowk, he laughs. From Mumbai, he loves the tava pulao, the lesser known street food that has even made it to his Dubai menu. We wonder if chef Mehrotra has tried his food now? He has come to all my restaurants, but his visit to Tresind and Carnival by Tresind is pending. Till date, I shiver out of respect when I am serving him."

58e531087be9e05a951f55c9,Govt scraps import duty on wheat,http://www.telegraphindia.com/1161209/jsp/business/story_123724.jsp,2016-12-09,"New Delhi, Dec. 8: The government today scrapped a 10 per cent duty on wheat imports to put a lid on rising prices and guard against lower winter crop yields on account of the cash crisis. In September, the Centre had reduced the duty on wheat to 10 per cent from 25 per cent even as prices rose to about Rs 2,200 per quintal in December from Rs 1,550 a quintal in July. Prices started to rise after traders discovered that government procurement was significantly lower at 22.9 million tonnes (mt). They also started doubting the government's estimate of wheat production for 2015-16 at 93.50mt and have said actual production would be nearly 10 per cent less. Harpal Singh, a leading Delhi-based grain trader, said, ""Private companies have already firmed up orders for import of 5-6mt of wheat."" Companies, which are believed to be in the fray to ship grain include Cargil and Glencore. Private millers have already imported 1.72mt wheat from Australia, France and the Ukraine since September when the duties were reduced. ""The bigger problem is that the winter crop of grain and rice can be expected to be lower as sowing has been delayed in many areas. Secondly, farmers who have been hit hard by the cash crunch have neither been able to use their normal mix of fertilisers nor could they hire sufficient hands,"" Singh said. After demonetisation, restricted flow of new money and the limitation on withdrawal from Jan Dhan accounts also hindered cash flow in rural areas. In November, the government had announced 6-16 per cent increase in the minimum support price (MSP) for winter crops - wheat, barley, gram masur, mustard and safflower - for the 2016-17 season. The MSP is the price at which the government buys grain, pulses and oilseeds from farmers to keep a reserve stock for rainy day and for sale through the public distribution system. The government has set a farm target of a record 270.10mt for the 2016-17 crop year (July 2016 to June 2017), an increase of 6.7 per cent over the output of 253.23mt in 2015-16. However, analysts feel these targets may not be reached."

Thus, there's need for the forest department to increase vigilance in the area. We want to protect the wild animal, so presence of an expert in the village is necessary. Our village is densely populated, and we don't want a man-animal conflict here.""Experts also demanded increased vigilance in the area. Jitender Bhadana of NGO Save Aravalis said, ""Since November 24, we have been writing to all authorities to protect wildlife, but there has been no response. There's a need to deal with the situation very carefully now, and spread awareness about co-existence of humans and wild animals, as the big cat has been visiting Mandawar and surrounding areas regularly.""Ground staff of the forest department, though, had no clue about the pugmarks till TOI informed them. District forest officer (DFO) for wildlife, Shyam Sundar, was unavailable for comment. A source in the forest department said, ""The sightings of leopards have definitely increased in the area. Although we have still not seen the pugmarks, I think there are two leopards and two cubs in the area.""Residents of Mandawar and neighbouring villages Kherli Lala and Harchandpur, have claimed several sightings of the big cat in the last 15 days. On December 8, the forest department had confirmed they had found pugmarks of a leopard and two cubs in a private farm in Harchandpur. Kherli Lala and Harchandpur have a population of over 4,000 each. Mandawar has about 1,000 residents.Panic gripped residents of Mandawar on November 24, after a leopard attacked several villagers. It was later killed by a mob of villagers."

Picture by Bijoy Kr Sharma Dhubri, Dec. 14: A group of youths from Bengal are creating a self-employment buzz in Assam, as they collect honey with mechanised beehives in Dhubri district. Five youths from Malda district of Bengal, who have received training in apiculture under Bengal's state skill development scheme, have set up 250 mechanised beehives along the mustard fields of Baladmara village. The group's leader, Sudeb Haldar, said the five of them had entered Assam with 250 mechanised beehives last month and planned to stay in the state for over six months. ""It is easy to attract bees to the hive in winter, particularly in mustard fields, as swarms of bees feed on the flowering mustard. So, honey is collected in a huge quantity,"" he added. The youths said they would keep moving from one field to another, including flowering paddy and farm areas, during their stay in Assam. Another member of the group, Swapan Mandal, said on an average they collect 20 litres of honey from each hive in six months. So they expect to collect 5,000 litres from 250 beehives during the period and then sell it to companies such as Dabur or Zandu in bulk. Though the youths were reluctant to quote the selling price, a source said the honey collected was normally sold between Rs 150 and Rs 200 per litre depending upon its quality. ""So the group as a whole will be able to earn between Rs 7,50,000 and Rs 10,000,00 in six months, fetching Rs 1,50,000 to Rs 2,00,000 per person,"" the source said. Dildar Hussain, a social activist of Alomganj area near Baladmara, said if the Assam government imparts training in apiculture to youths and provides loans to them to start beekeeping, the district's youths would be hugely benefited as it would help them become self-reliant. Raghunath Das, director of Dhubri Uco Bank Rural Self-Employment Training Institute, said they planned to impart training in beekeeping in the near future. ""If we get a group of 30 youths, we will provide training on beekeeping. I plan to motivate 30 youths for the training,"" he said."

The leopard attacked three people near a canal in Mandhana village on Monday. However, the forest department was this time successful in shooing away the big cat to the green.In fact, the leopard was first spotted by a villager in a mustard field around 3.30 pm, who raised an alarm. Soon, several villagers gathered there and started pelting stones at the animal. The leopard got scared and while trying to escape into the forests after forest officials reached the spot, it attacked three persons near the village pond, who sustained minor scratches on their hands. They were rushed to a government hospital and discharged after preliminary treatment.""We also got information about leopard sighting around 3.30 pm, while leopard had strayed into the field an hour back. Before a forest team could reach the spot, people had gathered there and decided to deal with the situation themselves. Some people started pelting stones at the leopard. Thankfully, a team of forest officials reached on time and managed to send the leopard back to the forest area,"" said an official from the forest range office of Narnaul.""The attack could have been easily averted if villagers had shown some patience and vacated the spot,"" a forest guard told TOI.Villagers, on the other hand, alleged the forest officials reached the spot late ""and so we were left with no other option than to do something to get rid of the leopard"". ""We couldn't risk our lives and thus tried to send the leopard back to the forest area,"" said Vikram, a villager whose nephew was attacked by the leopard.""As leopard sightings have increased in the area, we have formed five special teams, with three members in each team. The teams will be deployed in Gurgaon, Rewari, Mahendergarh and Palwal. We have also alerted the forests guards in these areas,"" said an official of the wildlife department, requesting anonymity.Some villagers informed that apart from the forest officers, they have also started 'thikri pehra' (community watch) to keep an eye on the movement of leopards in the village.Located some 120 kilometers from Gurgaon, Mandhana village is very close to a forest area. With a population of nearly 3,500 people, the village is situated close to the Haryana-Rajasthan border, about 130 km from Sariska National Park."

Just like the curious visitors, the young artists behind the works were also busy observing their reactions. Questions like, 'What does this signify?' saw the artists turning into story-tellers. Urging the audience to see anything from the perspective of art and sharing their takeaways from this unparalleled event with Kochi Times, these emerging artists are surely making their voices heard.Students at the Biennale say that you can't predict how your work would 'click' with your audience. ""What is expected out of the audience at an event like this is beyond the demands of traditional art, and I learnt that being an artist here can be equally challenging and fun,"" said Binita Limbani from Surat School of Fine Arts. Her installation is that of a skull, and her question is simple, why so much prejudice associated with it? ""It's part of each of our bodies and gives our bodies a beautiful shape and a personality. Making the audience understand my purpose through this work has been an exciting experience, but at times quite challenging too,"" she confesses.At the same time, her friend and artist Milan Patsala narrates how certain visitors shared similar thoughts after he explained his work, a rotating glass installation that symbolised one's movements on a landscape which follows a pattern. ""I was thrilled when I learnt that many visitors too felt the same, though not at an aesthetic level. It's more like these motions create a bigger meaning, or art work, eventually,"" said Milan.Sanvika Khanvilkar from J J School of Arts was told to base her installation on 'skilled labour', when she was chosen for the Biennale. ""For a while, I was stuck, being a normal youngster who hardly needs to think about such areas of work that exist in our society, I found it challenging,"" she says. However, when she visited the work area of metal fabricators she was able to find an artistic side to it and an idea for her installation 'Marching Moulds'. ""At the worksite, the supervisor told me 'These people are just robots, they do what I ask them to do.' But I could see that the bigger picture isn't so. Yes, one metal piece might be irrelevant just like a single labourer, but put together, both the pieces and workers create a lot more meaning and beauty, which was fascinating. It was a great takeaway for me,"" explains Sanvika.Rahul Tiwari from Banaras Hindu University (BHU), whose outdoor installation of a live barley - mustard field, complete with farmers and tools, also shows the existence of art in everyday life. As of now, the saplings have just sprouted. ""What I get to show through this is how something considered so normal also has an underlying artistic structure and deep meaning behind it. Nature can also be a spontaneous art performer,"" he says.With a big wooden canvas and a few tools, Harsha K R from Bangalore University beckons visitors to try drawing on his installation! ""People often say 'Oh I can't, I'm bad at art,' but when they see that the tiny scribbling they contribute are blending well in the overall frame, they become happy. It shows me how interacting with the audience makes the process of creating art a lot more delightful,"" he says.Even the frightful scenario of death serves as the fodder for a few artists, such as Sandeep Kumar and Hitesh Choudhary from BHU, whose installation is based on the life of cremation ground caretakers of North India, the Dom community. And what's more, they also turned cultural history ambassadors or storytellers from Kasi, for a while. ""When we explain about how we researched on the community and their connection with cremation grounds in Varanasi, visitors here were full of questions about the traditions and outlooks too. 'Oh! Did you go to their houses?' 'Did you eat with them or spend time with them?' 'What are they like,' they asked. It's been interesting to share a slice of our culture, interacting with the audience here.""The Students Biennale is spread across seven quaint venues at Fort Kochi's Mattancherry - Jew Street area has around 465 students and 15 young curators as part of it."

A look at this year earnings so far suggests she has earned around Rs 7000/qn from same area.While, about 3,000 women farmers of the district are now engaged in making organic pesticides and fertilizers on their own and using in their fields, there are several others who are learning to produce them to enrich the b soil health.While men would usually migrate to urban areas in search of work, women did a number of jobs from sowing seeds to spraying insecticides. But the status of farmers was usually reserved for the men. Since the inputs in farming were heavily dependent on the market, and women wouldnt be allowed to step out of their houses to buy seeds, pesticides, fertilizers etc., their role was limited to a greater extent, said Pradan coordinator Subodh Verma.Dwarka Bai of Sawarjhodi village, says, Years of chemical use had resulted in the loss of indigenous seeds and increased dependency on external forces. With this change, womens influence in agricultural activities had greatly diminished. Organic farming promoted through gender lenses could facilitate in rectifying this situation.On being asked about the process of making these pesticides, Dwarka Bai says, Local and naturally available materials are used for making these produces. These are ready to use materials. Jeewamrite(organic fertilizer), matka khad(organic fertilizer), neemastra (pesticide), aageneyastra (pesticide), bramhastra(pesticide), cow urine (concentrated fungicide) are some of them, she adds.As to the taste of the crops produced, Sitala Bai of Katoli village says, After we started organic farming, the taste has changed. Many women who are producing these crops have identified these changes. They sell them in local- and block-level markets and buyers like these produces because of the taste.Raju Chaudhary of Lotmara village told HT that the cost of cultivation has decreased. It is good to see women having ownership over the materials/organic products. Demand for our products is high in markets, he says.Now we manage to save enough money for our personal needs. We have all started sending our children to better schools and our family assets have increased also. At the same time, our health-related troubles have reduced a lot, says Chaiti from Sawarjodi."

The unit, located on the premises of Udyogiri at Gandamunda area, is equipped with eight motor-enabled oil extraction machines.Earlier, a Kachi ghani mustard oil unit existed at the same location which was destroyed in the super cyclone of 1999. With financial assistance from the State Government, the OKVIB took an initiative to revive the unit at a cost of `10 lakh. The cold pressed machines which can extract upto 60 litres of mustard oil per day, have been procured from Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh, OKVIB Chairman Tejeswar Parida said.Procurement of mustard seeds to run the plant will be done from remote districts of the State where farmers are victims of distress sale. Raw material will be purchased at market price from farmers through Odisha Consumer Cooperative Federation - Bhanjaprabha from all districts. This will eliminate the scope of farmers getting exploited by middlemen, Parida added.Inaugurating the processing unit, MSME Minister Jogendra Behera exhorted consumers to purchase mustard oil from OKVIB to support small farmers. The products are 100 per cent adulteration free and more such units are required to imbibe financial independence of people in remote areas, he added.The Board will soon install a honey processing plant with capacity of 100 kg of honey per day at the same facility. The honey processing plant will be procured from Pune. Once the facility is fully operational, the Board expects to supply more processed honey inside and outside State.On the occasion, sanction letters of village industries were distributed to 26 entrepreneurs from six districts. Projects like rice mill, paper cup and plate production, beauty parlour, automobile servicing, ready-made garment manufacturing, cement products and carpentry were approved for assistance by the MSME Department."

And what we discovered has already left us craving for Christmas, literally!In many Anglo Indian homes Christmas seems like a month-long affair, what with the rose cookies and kulkuls being made, the cake mix getting ready, and homemade wine being bottled. But the real deal, according to Chris Brown, a hospitality executive, is Christmas dinner. ""We go all out to make it a lavish affair and we look forward to it with much anticipation. Roast Turkey or Duck is one dish you will find in every Anglo Indian home for Christmas. The bird is marinated overnight, and the stuffing consists of boiled vegetables and mashed potatoes. The bird is then tied with twine and roasted along with herbs and spices like thyme, rosemary, black pepper, bay leaves and garlic. Some families even bake it,"" says Chris , a Sainikpuri resident. And what's a roast without a sauce! ""The cranberry or strawberry sauce is what brings the roast to life! We drizzle it over the meat. The usual side dishes include bread rolls, Pork chops or Grilled Spare Ribs and salad with vegetables like carrots, peas, Brussel sprouts and broccoli. This hearty meal is washed down with Ginger Pop or home-made wine. For dessert, there's the plum cake, crumble cake or fruit pudding with custard for dessert,"" says Chris.There's nothing like some good ol' spicy mutton curry and steaming hot rice. It's simple, but packs a punch, and the Telugu Christians swear by it. ""Once we're back from church, the women of the house get into the kitchen to prepare the spiciest and heartiest meal of the year. The non-vegetarian fare is in abundance and Christmas lunch is one meal where the number of helpings aren't counted. We make Bagara Rice and spicy mutton curry. The curry is made with a base of dry coconut and some chopped potatoes which adds that extra flavour. And on Christmas, Telugu Christians can't just restrict our meal to one type of meat; we need to have chicken as well. So there will be naatu kodi fry or curry as well"", says Annie Merlyn, a sales professional. The resident of Mahendra Hills adds, ""Some families do it the Deccani way by preparing a handi full of mutton biryani, and the aroma just wafts throughout the house. Of course you need lots and lots of raita to counter all that spice. The desserts usually Gulab Jamun, Semiya Kheer or fruit custard.""The Tamil Christian community in the twin cities has the unique distinction of merging so seamlessly with the communities around them, that their cuisine is an interesting amalgamation of many flavours. As Victor Amalraj, former Indian footballer puts it, ""A majority of us from the Tamil Christian community are based in and around Mettuguda, Lalaguda, Marredpally, Trimulgherry and Yapral. These are areas where many Anglo Indians live too. So our food is heavily influenced by them. Our Christmas dinner menu at home for instance has meat ball curry, yellow rice and duck roast. Some families also make a spicy naatu kodi curry or even a vanjram fish curry.""But the newer generation of Tamil Christians prefer their Christmas food a bit more Hyderabadi. ""We prefer the tried and tested mutton or chicken biryani with mutton curry. And while, the main meal is quite heavy, it's the desserts that steal the show. We make something called the sweet puff stuffed with coconut and sugar, rose cookies and dessert is usually fruit custard,"" says Emmanuel George, an HR professional from Safilguda.For Malayali Christians , who take pride in being one of the oldest Christian communities in the country, every Christmas meal is a feast to look forward to. Mini Joseph, a homemaker from Alwal says, ""The feasting begins at breakfast. Piping hot Kallappams or Palappams served along with mildly flavoured vegetable, beef or chicken stew is the highlight of the breakfast table. The appams also go well with Meen Moilee, a fish curry made with coconut milk."" The lunch is when the heavy weight dishes make an entry. ""Never mind what our staple food is the rest of the year, when it comes to special occasions we Malayalis have to have the boiled red rice. It just reminds us of what we'd eat in Kerala. The rice is served along with the tangy-spicy Kerala fish curry, Chicken Varatharachathu, egg roast and beef fry. Some families even make Meen Pollichathu (pearl spot fish fry). And after that heavy meal, we still save some space for the Semiya Payasam and Vattayappam (a sweet, rice cake with a topping of raisins and cashew nuts) to round off the hearty meal,"" adds Mini.When it comes to Goan Christians , Christmas lunch is a throwback to their Portuguese roots. And, it is one hearty party! Yvette Vaz Sharma, a homemaker from Trimulgherry says, ""We Goans make so many varieties of food for Christmas lunch, that there is not an inch of space left on the table. Beef is the most loved meat, so we make beef fry, beef cutlets and croquettes. And then you have those quintessentially Portugese-inspired dishes like the Chicken Xacuti, Pork Vindaloo and Pork Sorpotel that go well with vegetable or prawn pulao,"" says Yvette. And no Goan meal is complete without sea food. ""The very famous Goan fish curry and fish cutlets made using King Fish, Pomfret or Salmon are a rage on the dining table. The meal is a loud affair, like a party almost, with port wine flowing free. For desserts, it is caramel pudding or fruit custard,"" shares Yvette.For the very small community of Christians from the various North Eastern states, Christmas meal is a time for community bonding. The festival brings together folk from the same state to prepare a common meal. ""A Christmas meal is quite different for us. It's more about the act of sharing a meal together and bonding rather than the dishes themselves. So there aren't any special Christmas dishes as such,"" explains Sam Khumanthem, an entrepreneur living in Marredpally.""There are many tribes in the North Eastern states. Manipur, where I hail from, alone has about 18 different tribes and each one of them has its own unique cuisine and cooking styles. But almost every tribe swears by the duck curry and steamed rice combination. It's quite different from the curries you find in the rest of India because we don't use any masalas at all, except for roasted chilli powder. Manipuris also relish the Eromba chutney that we use as a side dish. It's a mix of different vegetables boiled and mashed into a semi solid form and flavoured with dry fish. Some people even make beef curry or smoked pork curry. When it comes to desserts, we go the traditional way. Our sweets are mostly jaggery base, like the Kabok, which also has peanuts in it,"" says Sam.When it is time for a feast, mutton has to be on the menu for UP folk. And Christmas time is no different. ""There's nothing like having Lucknowi chicken pulao and Lucknowi mutton curry. When we invite people over for a Christmas meal, they usually find our mutton curry very different. The secret is that our curry is made using mustard oil,"" says Ujjwala Samuel, a homemaker who lives in Karkhana. ""There's another special dish that not many make these days, but it was quite the Christmas special. Mutton is marinated for over a week with lemon, spices and garam masala and then deep fried. It's so tasty that you can snack on it all day. The desserts are heavy too. Khadu Ka Kheer is the favourite, but the kids also love the Gujiyas which are stuffed with khova and dry fruits,"" says Ujjwala.Bengalis have a great reputation for their skill with the ladle, and it is gloriously displayed on every bodo din (big day); Christmas is no different. ""The preparations begin a day in advance as we Bengalis prepare our sweet dish called the Khejur Gurer Payesh (date kheer) so that it's nice and cold for the next day. It's made from jaggery, dates, dry fruits and rice, and can get any Bengali excited,"" says Madhusudan Das, a lecturer who lives in Jeedimetla, adding, ""The next day we prepare matar pulao and mutton curry which is mildly flavoured and not very spicy like the Hyderabadi version. And then comes the iconic side dish  tomato sweet chutney made from dates, mango pulp and raisins. The sweets that follow are as important as the main mean itself. Sandesh and Coconut Barfi are the all-time favourites, and some even make flavoured sweet curd."""

KASAM is an apex society of around 12,000 farmers spread across five blocks in the tribal-dominated district. It procures spices produced by its members. They process the spices like turmeric, ginger, mustard among others and export it to different countries.Watch what else is making news:The government has sanctioned the funds to the KASAM under the Rashtriya Krushi Vikash Yojana (RKVY). We received a letter in this regard on Tuesday, said Sanjit Patniak, Secretary of KASAM.With the fund, well replace the 16-year old processing machines, he said. KASAM members are currently engaged in processing of turmeric, slices of gingers and mustard powder which are in great demand in Europe. The processing capacity of the existing machines is 1,000 tonnes per year. This will be increased to 5,000 tones per annum. This will also help the farmers procure more quantities of these products leading to greater profits, Patnaik said.Spices like turmeric and ginger are in great demand in foreign countries owing to their organic content and multiple uses, he said. The turmeric of the district has medicinal value and can also be used for facial, he claimed. The Control Union Certifications has certified the spice products of the KASAM as organic, he added.Last year, around 1,100 tonnes of processed turmeric and around 40 tonnes of ginger slices were exported to different countries leading to profits of Rs 50 lakh. The main buyers were the UK, the USA, Australia, Netherland, Germany and several other countries. In the first four months of the current year, around 500 tonnes of these products were exported to the European countries, said Patnaik.Raw spices are procured from 12,000 farmers of five blocks G Udayagiri, Raikia, Nuagaon, Daringibadi and Phiringia through 61 primary cooperative societies. The society gives 65 per cent of the profit to farmers, he added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Her government received attention for its extensive social-welfare agenda that it continued from its previous term, which included several subsidised Amma-branded goods such as canteens, bottled water and salt. Three years into her tenure, she was convicted in a disproportionate assets case, rendering her disqualified to hold office but she returned as chief minister after being acquitted in May 2015. In September 2016, she fell severely ill and, following 75 days of hospitalisation, died on December 5, 2016 from a cardiac arrest.Mamata BanerjeeClose on the heels of Jayalalithaas swearing-in, Mamata Banerjee too assumed charge as Chief Minister of West Bengal for a second term. The oath-taking ceremony, one of the biggest events in West Bengal, was called the coronation of the Queen of Bengal. Massive cutouts of Mamata Banerjee lined the roads leading to the venue. Besides Banerjee, 41 ministers were sworn in, many of whom touched her feet after taking an oath, reflecting a bit of the authoritarian aura of her counterpart in the southern state.Smriti IraniIranis tenure as Human Resources Development minister came to an abrupt end in 2016 after she allegedly courted more controversy than any other minister in the Narendra Modi cabinet. The former TV star bore the brunt of public outrage and the oppositions wrath over her handling of the episode that was blamed for the suicide of Rohith Vemula, a University of Hyderabad Dalit PhD scholar.She was accused of abetting the punishment of Dalit students by writing a series of letters to the University of Hyderabads vice-chancellor, which culminated in Rohith Vemula ending his life. After she was removed from the high-profile HRD ministry, Irani was given the textile portfolio.The infamous JNU row that made student union leader Kanhaiya Kumar a household name also backfired for the feisty leader. The opposition alleged that the HRD ministry had distorted facts in the case against the JNU student leaders who were representatives of Left parties.Kanhaiya KumarThe president of JNU students union was slapped with sedition charges, suspended from the university and arrested. Kumar, along with his fellow students Anirban Bhattacharya and Umar Khalid were charged with raising anti-national slogans at a students march protesting Parliament attack convict Afzal Gurus hanging on the third anniversary of the death. Kumar, who is a member of the All India Students Federation, the student wing of the CPI(M), was remanded to five-day police custody which led to an outcry among the student community, on social media and liberals across the country. Though Kanhaiya Kumar initially emerged a hero, he later drew flak for drawing political mileage from the issue.Rohith VemulaThe suicide of Rohit Vemula, a Dalit PhD scholar at the University of Hyderabad created a nationwide stir. Vemula wrote in his suicide note about his daily struggle against prejudice and discrimination, in the university and in society. Two weeks prior to his suicide Vemula and four of his Dalit friends, all members of the Ambedkar Students Association were suspended by the university following a complaint of assault by an ABVP leader. Vemula and his friends denied the charges. Vemula committed suicide soon after, an episode that drew attention to the plight of Dalit students in universities and also the alleged witch hunt that was pursued by then HRD Minister Smriti Irani in this particular case.Zakir NaikThe popular Islamic missionary and the controversial preacher came into the public eye after the Dhaka restaurant attack in July. He was accused of being the inspiration behind the attacks. Investigators claimed that Zakir Naik played a role in instigating youth to join the terror outfit Islamic State.Irom Chanu SharmilaA constant activist seeking the repeal of the controversial Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA) ended her 16-year-old fast. First introduced to fight the Naga rebellion in the 1950s, AFSPA has been a bone of contention in Jammu and Kashmir in the north and Manipur and other parts of northeast India as well, mainly due to its reported misuse by security forces. Sharmila now plans to take her battles to the political arena and contest in the Manipur elections.Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal YadavThere have been undercurrents between unclenephew Akhilesh Yadav and Shivpal Yadav ever since Akhilesh was named chief ministerial nominee of the Samajwadi party in the previous Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections, over Shivpal Yadav. However, things took a turn for the worse when SP Chief Mulayam Singh Yadav made Shivpal the partys state unit chief in place of Akhilesh, in an attempt to strike a balance between his son and his brother before the upcoming UP elections.Akhilesh Yadav stripped his uncle of three portfolios. Shivpal Yadav, thereafter, resigned from the state government as well as the post of the chief of Samajwadi party state line. The saga now continues as party chief Mulayam on December 28 released a list of over 300 candidates for the 2017 election, completely disregarding son Akhileshs picks; and Akhilesh restorted a day later by naming 167 candidates of his own to contest under different election symbols.Sri Sri RavishankarSpiritual leader and founder of the Art of Living (AOL) Sri Sri Ravishankar was mired in controversy after the World Cultural Festival hosted by him on the plains of the river Yamuna is alleged to have caused large-scale damage to the fragile eco-system around the water body. Environmentalists from across the country had protested the permission given to the festival to be held on the floodplains of the Yamuna, as they warned that massive temporary constructions for the event would cause an ecological disaster. Pressed for time and construction already having begun full swing when the case reached the National Green Tribunal (NGT), all that was done was to go ahead and give a green signal to the event, after the foundation agreed to pay Rs 5 crore in damages, which was never recovered.Vijay MallyaMallya, who has always been in the news for his flamboyant lifestyle, was in the limelight in 2016 for a wholly different reason  the poor state of his finances. The collapse of Kingfisher Airlines unravelled his business empire. And even as banks were trying to recover the thousands of crores of rupees given to his companies as loan, Mallya was allowed to fly out of the country despite a case being filed by the CBI filed against him for fraud, money laundering, and misappropriation among other charges. The liquor barons escape from the country led to the opposition putting political pressure, resulting in the revocation of Mallyas passport and a non-bailable warrant issued against him. Mallya, however, continues to live in the UK, evading the law in India.Baba RamdevSwadeshi business baron Baba Ramdevs Patanjali products is estimated to be worth over Rs 5,000 crore and the profits surged by almost 150 percent in 2016. The yogis products have been inching close to national brands like Dabur, Marico, Godrej, ITC, Nestle, HUL and P&G. A recent report, however, sparked doubts about the efficacy of his products that are claimed to be completely herbal and in some cases, organic. A court fined Patanjali Rs 11 lakh after it found the company guilty of ""releasing misleading advertisements by selling certain products with its labels although they were being manufactured by some other firm."" The case was filed in November 2012 after samples of products, including edibles like salt, honey, besan (gram flour), mustard oil and jam allegedly failed quality tests in August.Raghuram RajanRBIs 23rd governor, globally respected and credited with bringing down inflation in the country  and for taking several bold economic decisions  stepped down after completing his tenure in September. Rajans outspoken nature, particularly his comments on Prime Minister Narendra Modis pet project Make in India, which he said was better named Make for India, as reports suggest, did not go down well with the government. That, among other reasons, is suspected to have dented his chance at a second term in office, the possibility of which was widely discussed in the media. In a television interview, after announcing his decision not to seek a second term, he said, I was willing perhaps to stay, provided we could reach the right kind of agreement. We didnt. Thats where it ended."

But nearly 2,500 km away from home, he is guarding the perimeter of a luxury hotel in Kasargod.The 21-year-old Robin Singh is an 18-time state champion in sub-junior, junior and senior categories between 2012 and 2016. At the Subrata Classic International Powerlifting Championship at Jamshedpur, he finished second behind Irans Arash Rezaei in the 93kg category.I thought the government would support me. But all I got was `10,000 from the district administration on the Republic Day, he said, choking on his words. Poverty was gnawing at his dream and the self-trained powerlifter left his home at Ladpur village in Bulandshahr district. Robin came to Delhi and left his CV at several staffing agencies. One of them found him a job as a security executive at The Lalit Resort & Spa at Bekal. Powerlifting is not an Olympic sport but championships are conducted regularly by federations. It is a strength sport in which contestants attempt three types of lift - squat, bench press and dead lift - in a set sequence.Born to a farmer couple - Lalita and Subhas Singh Poonia - Robin was taken to bodybuilding when he was in Class VIII in 2008. There was no sportsperson or bodybuilders in the family and my parents were baffled at my choice, he said. He converted a shed in his house into a gym, made weights out of his mothers chakki (stone grinder) and upholstered a plank with rexine for his bench press. In 2012, he drifted to powerlifting through Youtube and signed up for a trial for North Zone championship at Mathura. I sat through the tournament watching others lifting weight, learning the techniques, he said.At the NZ championship at Patiala, Robin won the gold in the 93kg category. Since then there was no looking back. I go to tournaments to learn techniques. I speak to referees for guidance, then train at home, he said. But without a proper trainer, it was just a matter of time before he herniated his spinal discs. In 2015, I had bulge in L4, L5 and S1 discs, he said. Doctors asked him to quit the sport.But after six months of rest, he returned to the ring. But the first resistance came from his home. Every day Robin drank four to five litres of milk and ate 60 almonds. His parents cultivated wheat, mustard and rice in their 1.5 acres of farmland but the income was too meagre to sustain Robins schedule. He has two younger brothers too. Luckily, my mother reared two cows and three buffaloes, he said.The frequent crop failure due to drought and rain also made his going tough. But his exploits at the Subrata Classic changed his familys perception. The villagers gave me a rousing welcome upon my return. My parents said they would support me. But I know it was tough for them. Perhaps, my dream was too big, he said. On the brighter side, Ladpur started warming up to the sport. Youngsters started approaching Robin who threw open his gym for them. But after five months, Robin left home in search of a job."

The incident comes a month after a leopard was beaten to death by a mob in Mandawar village, Sohna, as the animals presence created panic among villagers and it allegedly injured 13 people.Villagers in Malaka spotted a four-year-old male leopard around 7am in a mustard field. On receiving information, wildlife officials and police reached the spot equipped with nets and a tranquilliser gun. Unlike the Mandawar incident, they managed to tranquillise the big cat amid resistance from villagers.In Mandawar, the villagers took law in their hands and killed the animal as the government machinery failed to capture the animal despite a hunt that lasted over three hours.A 15-member team of the wildlife department reached the village in Malakha on time, an official said. In Mandawar, however, the police and wildlife team reached the spot without any preparation. As no cage and tranquilliser gun was in sight for three hours villagers, panicked and beat the wild cat to death.In Malaka, however, the authorities were equipped and prepared. After tranquillising the animal, they moved it to Sohna for a medical examination. They said it would be released in the wild if its health condition is satisfactory.Another wildlife official said a Mandawar-like situation might have ensued had the animal not been tranquillised and rescued. The only loss incurred on Wednesday was the damage done to the ripe mustard crops in the village.Nearly 3,000 people, annoyed by the damage done to the crops, had gathered. Some even rubbed shoulders for a selfie with the animal inside the cage. But thankfully, we rescued him (leopard) without much loss, Shyam Sunder, district forest officer, Gurgaon, said.In the last two months, five leopards and a few hyenas were spotted by camera traps in Bandhwari, Damdama and Mewat.Wildlife researchers said capturing animals that stray into human habitations is not the long-term solution for man-animal conflict.When people see a leopard, the first instinct is to pick up a stick to attack it. This is not the right approach. Leopards are adaptable animals that live close to human settlements and feed on dogs, pigs etc. They will not attack humans directly, Bilal Habib, an expert associated with Wildlife Institute of India (WII), said.The forest department has sent a proposal to the WII to conduct a long-term study on leopards in the Aravallis. As per the proposal, which is first-of-its-kind, five leopards in south Haryana will be captured, fitted with a GPS-enabled radio collar and released back to the forest to study their movement patterns.Blast from the past-Nov 24, 2016  A leopard was beaten to death by a mob in Mandawar village in Sohna, 40 kms from Gurgaon, before injuring 13 residents.-May 2016 --- A male leopard was found dead at Gairatpur Bass forest area, the cause of death was known because the body was decomposed.-May 2015- A young female leopard was found dead after being hit by a vehicle on Gurgaon-Faridabad Road near Mangar Bani.-November 2014- A 12-year-old male leopard was killed in a road accident in Manesar.-April 2014- Four leopards were found dead within a week in and around a private golf resort in Gurgaon.-December 2011- A blue bull (nilgai) was killed while trying to cross the Gurgaon-Faridabad road.-January 2011- A male leopard was beaten to death in Kheri Gujaran village by a mob in the presence of government officials.-July 2010- A five-year-old female leopard was recovered from a farmhouse in the Aravalli area of Gurgaon by forest department officials.-February 2009- A leopard and her two cubs were injured by a speeding vehicle on NH-8-September 2008- A speeding vehicle killed a three-year-old male leopard when it was crossing the highway (NH-8) near Manesar village.-March 2008- A four-year-old leopard was caught from a Farmhouse in Sohna."

The participatory mass performance symbolizes 'death of profession' of farmers who lost their agricultural lands for the 'special economic zones'.The village, which is about 60 kilometres away from Nagpur, is hosting the country's first Land Art Festival. Started a week back, the festival 'Gram Dhara Chitra Utsav ' is witnessing the participation of artists from all over the country, who are adopting unique ways to highlight contemporary farming issues.""In adjoining village Sathanur, there were around 100 farmers till last year. But a majority of them lost their farms due to SEZ and now just seven practising farmers are left,"" said city artist Shweta Bhattad , who organized the festival.As part of the mass performance, Bhattad placed herself in a coffin buried in the ground for three hours. She kept writing the word 'Vishwas' inside the coffin. Bhattad had earlier done a similar performance in Pune and Paris last year.Inspired by her, 19-year-old Aadarsh Doke too buried himself for two-and-a-half hours. ""My father is a farmer and since a young age, I have been exposed to the problems faced by farmers. The performance was a small attempt to turn people's attention towards it,"" said Doke.The seven land arts, that have been designed by five social workers from Vidarbha, a psychologist from Netherlands, writer from Pune, choreographer from Nagpur, young singer and farmers, are based on different themes related to farming.""We stayed in the village for about 15 days and interacted with the farmers to understand their problems. Then we all collaborated, the artists would sketch and social workers would add meaningful messages to the art. After finalizing a blue print, we replicated the drawings on farms,"" said 24-year-old Gopa Roy, a mix-media artist from Delhi.The seven land arts based on different themes including farmers' suicide, green industry, women farm labourers and NT cotton have been grown in different farms of the village, covering a total area of 24,500 square feet.The festival witnessed participation of artists from various cities, who stayed with the villagers and sensitized them through art, music, dance and drama. Odisha-based artist Satyabhama Majhi is staying in Paradsinga since last two weeks, along with some kids and teachers from a tribal area of her state.""They practice organic farming in their school on a small scale. The land art festival gave them a larger exposure,"" she said.During their stay, Majhi and her students noticed large-scale open defecation near a small girls' school. ""We came up with our own small land art and sowed seeds of leafy vegetables in shape of a toilet. It has now grown and since last one week, people are hesitating in defecating near the school,"" the artist added.The festival has been extended till January 15 and the land arts are open for viewing. Visitors can also stay with farmer's families and explore village life."
