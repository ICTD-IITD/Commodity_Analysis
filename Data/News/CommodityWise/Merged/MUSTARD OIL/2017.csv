(ISIS flag. Source: Reuters) The ambition of IS or Daesh is definitely mass-casualty attacks, Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper. (ISIS flag. Source: Reuters)Islamic State militants have aspirations to launch mass-casualty chemical attacks on targets in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, the British security minister said in a newspaper interview published on Sunday. Ben Wallace also said British authorities feared that as the militant group was driven out of strongholds in the Middle East such as the Iraqi city of Mosul, Britons fighting for the group would return home and pose a growing domestic threat.Watch What Else Is Making News?The ambition of IS or Daesh is definitely mass-casualty attacks, Wallace told the Sunday Times newspaper.They have no moral objection to using chemical weapons against populations and if they could, they would in this country. The casualty figures that could be involved would be everybodys worst fear, he said.The report said no specific chemical plot had been identified but security services had been carrying out exercises to prepare for the possibility.IS used sulphur mustard gas in an attack on the Syrian town of Marea in August 2015, according to global watchdog the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.Wallace pointed to the dismantlement of an Islamic State cell in Morocco in February as evidence of the groups ambition to carry out chemical attacks elsewhere.Moroccan authorities dismantled a cell involving chemical weapons. They recovered toxic chemical and biological substances and a large stock of fertiliser. The substances found could have been used to produce home-made explosives and could have been transformed into a deadly toxin, he said.About 800 Britons are thought to have travelled to Syria, many to join Islamic State, since the outbreak of the civil war in that country. Around 100 have been killed.The big concern is if Mosul collapses and all the other bases of Isis (Islamic State) collapse. We know there are a significant number of fighting for IS in Syria. They will probably want to come home, said Wallace.In a separate report, the Sunday Telegraph newspaper quoted the head of Britains regulator of charities as saying that reports of links between charities and extremism had trebled over the past three years to reach a record high.The Charity Commission made 630 referrals to police in 2015/16 over allegations made  about abuse of charities for terrorist or extremist purposes, including concerns about charities operating in Syria and other higher risk areas, the report said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

Mr. Sivakumar, who had a brief association with Mr. Kalam after he met him for the first time, when the latter visited the Gandhi Gram Rural Institute in Dindigul in 2010, wrote the poem after watching his funeral procession on television. He was the Deputy Commissioner Modern Control Room in Chennai when he came out with the poem.The poem came to light when a monthly magazine published it, after which, music director Sankar (Ganesh) composed it as a song and brought out a CD, he said.

Wheat is the staple food in Rajasthan.We have been facing lack of water for our crops, but warm temperature made us worried. High temperature can ruin wheat, barley, and gram crops, said Sunil Singh, a farmer from Rupwas tehsil in Bharatpur district.My wheat and mustard crops are not growing because of clear skies and strong sunlight. We are worried over warm temperature in the winter season, said Lakhan Singh, a farmer of Hingoli village under Kumher sub-division in Bharatpur.A minimum temperature of 5 degree Celsius and a maximum of 15 are conducive for the growth of wheat crop; higher temperatures will harm the crop, said Yogesh Sharma, joint director of the agriculture department (Bharatpur range).Wheat, barley, gram, and mustard plants need temperature below 15 degree Celsius during daytime and around 5 degree Celsius at night; but maximum temperature crossed 20 degree Celsius in the last few days and this may be harmful for crops, agriculture department deputy director Deshraj Singh said on Friday.According to the meteorological department of the directorate of rapeseed mustard research at Sewar, the maximum and minimum temperatures were recorded at 18.7-8.60 degrees Celsius on January 2, at 22.4-8.6 on January 3, at 20-9.4 on January 4, and at 25-8 on January 5.Warmer winter interrupts life cycle of rabi crops, resulting in low production.

58d7a3c5a3d24b75f276db5b,New dawn for Yuvraj Singh,http://indianexpress.com/article/sports/cricket/indian-cricket-team-selection-committee-yuvra-singh-virat-kohli-odi-matches-new-dawn-for-old-don-4462824/,2017-01-06,"Yuvraj Singh is likely then to compete for a place in the XI with Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane. (Source: File) Yuvraj Singh is likely then to compete for a place in the XI with Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane. (Source: File)BY NOW, its already established that the MSK Prasad-led selection committee believes and swears by giving players second chances. Weve already seen lifelines being extended to Gautam Gambhir and Parthiv Patel. Patel was brought back from a eight-year hiatus while Gambhir was given an unexpected recall when the doors seemed to be tightly shut on his international career.So on the face of it, the return of Yuvraj Singh to the ODI team-he also reclaims his place in the T20 squad after having appeared last in the World T20 semifinal last March-could just be looked at as a continuation of their selection policy.The 35-year-old hasnt been in Indias ODI plans for more than three years now. And the three-match series against England is supposed to be when India usher in a new dawn under a new captain in Virat Kohli. But at least in Yuvraj, the selectors seemed to have thought it prudent to bring back an old don.The 2019 World Cup is just over two years away now. And India have only 55 matches before their opening game.Their preparation starts now. With Kohli now at the helm, this is when they build a team that would be ready to challenge for the trophy in England. So are the selectors actually looking at Yuvraj, who will officially be 37 by then, as a serious part of their World Cup plans? Or is it just a short-gap acknowledgment of his recent performances in domestic cricket which could lead to a fitting farewell at the Champions Trophy?Either way, there are questions that beg to be answered. Yuvraj comes back at a time the Indian middle-order is still not settled. Its a fickle batting line-up with no clear takers for positions from No.4-No.6.Lets say MS Dhoni sticks to the No.4 spot that he seemed keen on occupying during the series win over New Zealand in October. Kedar Jadhav was the biggest takeaway for India against the Kiwis, both with bat and ball, which should make him a certain starter at No.6 for now.That leaves only the No.5 spot up for grabs. So Yuvraj is likely then to compete for a place in the XI with Manish Pandey and Ajinkya Rahane. Yuvraj has the experience and he has the big shots. Though not as much of a high-flyer as in his early days, he still remains a safe fielder. And he can always chip in with his agonizingly slow left-arm spin.Its understandable then that the selectors are desperate for Yuvraj to click. Not to forget, that Indias bane over the last year or so in 50-over cricket has been the lack of a designated finisher. Its safe to say that in a scenario where the team needs 120 off the last 12 overs, youd any day pick Yuvraj over a Pandey or a Rahane. Hardik Pandya is billed to be the gung-ho, boundary-clearing finisher but hes still too raw and unproven at this level. Jadhav has played a few audacious cameos, but he still doesnt convince you to do so in a high-pressure situation. Then theres also the question of if not Yuvraj then who, in terms of the options available outside the squad. You look around the circuit and few names prop up instantaneously for you to be outraged by his inclusion. But does Yuvraj have the age and the fitness for the selectors to be making a two-year investment in him? For the record, the punt on Gambhir was a failed move. But you can always get away with a gamble of that sort in Test cricket, considering its a short-term one. You give someone a series or maybe two to see if they can cut the mustard and then just give up on it. It doesnt really unsettle a team in the long-run.But if Yuvraj wastes his three opportunities against England like Gambhir did, then it would mean three missed opportunities for Pandey, Rahane or both to cement their place in the team and as a result settle the middle-order. Keeping in mind the World Cup that is. Ironically, the axe dropped on Yuvrajs ODI career the last time around when India were just building their team for the 2015 World Cup Down Under. He had crossed fifty once in the previous 19 matches, averaging 18.53. Mitchell Johnson had exposed a weakness in the left-hander against the short-ball that pretty much laid Yuvraj to waste. One failure at Johannesburg on the truncated tour to South Africa in late 2013 was enough to convince Prasads predecessors that it was time to move on. Like with Patel and Gambhir, Yuvrajs recall was hailed by Prasad as just reward for a stellar domestic season. The numbers are impressive of course. He did after all score 672 runs at 84 in 5 Ranji Trophy matches for Punjab. And Prasad didnt stick to just throwing up the numbers in trying to justify his committees bold move.We should appreciate the way Yuvraj Singh has played in domestic cricket. All these days we thought he hasnt played long innings. But he has scored a double-hundred. He scored 180 on the Lahli wicket, he said.At the moment, it looks more like theyre content with giving the veteran a chance and seeing how it goes with the hope of course that it doesnt go the Gambhir way.ODI squad: KL Rahul, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli (capt), MS Dhoni, Manish Pandey, Kedar Jadhav, Yuvraj Singh, Ajinkya Rahane, Hardik Pandya, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Amit Mishra, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Umesh YadavT20I squad: KL Rahul, Mandeep Singh, Virat Kohli (capt), MS Dhoni (wk), Yuvraj Singh, Suresh Raina, Rishabh Pant (wk), Hardik Pandya, R Ashwin, Ravindra Jadeja, Yuzvendra Chahal, Manish Pandey, Jasprit Bumrah, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Ashish Nehra.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App now"

Political parties too have framed special strategies to woo this large chunk of voters. Villages are expected to witness crowded 'chaupals'.The multi-phase elections will begin with notification for the first phase on January 17 and end with voting in phase 7 on March 8, coinciding with a period when farmers have some time on their hands. ""This season wheat has been sown in around 1.24 hectares alone in Agra district and potato in 79 hectares. Harvesting of mustard crop will take place on 30 hectares. Farmers will start harvesting potatoes from around February 25, followed by wheat and mustard in March,"" said deputy director of agriculture, K N Rai.Shyam Singh Chahar, district head of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, ""Farms in Agra and nearby districts are covered with crops of wheat, potato and mustard. Framers will not be having much to do on the fields till first phase of voting on February 11. Farmers will be discussing their issues with the candidates and mark their presence in election rallies and political meetings.""Farmer Manvendra Singh of Kheragarh block said, ""It is after a long time that the election schedule is suitable for farmers. During election campaign days, we will have time to listen and interact with candidates and ask them what they are going to do for agricultural development and welfare of farmers.""This time party workers and candidates will not have to make the round of farms to meet cultivators and seek their vote. During the day, farmers will be either at home or in public places in villages.BJP district president Shyam Bhadoriya said, ""The party in Agra has been in continuous interaction with farmers. Our wing, the BJP Kisan Morcha, has been helping farmers in their time of need. Ahead of elections we are going to organize special chaupals and interact with farmers around bonfires. We will remind farmers of the pro-agriculture initiatives of the central government and note down their grievances."" BSP district head Pramod Raina said, ""We will make farmers aware of the Centre's neglect and farlse promises by the state government. In recent seasons farmers in the region have faced major losses due to harsh weather but the government has not provided any help. Through open meetings the party's plans for welfare of farmers will be conveyed throughout the district."" Congress district president Dushyant Sharma said, ""Party workers are in regular touch with farmers. The Centre's unplanned demonetisation has hit farmers the most. Once votes to power, the Congress will completely waive all pending debt, reduce electricity bills by half and enact other initiatives to relieve the burden on them. Special teams have been constituted at the district level to visit different villages and convey the party's vision for the welfare of farmers."""

58e4a0f9a3d24b136653b8f2,The sisterhood of wrestlers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-sisterhood-of-wrestlers/article17002100.ece,2017-01-07,"Its 3.30 p.m. on a clear day. Balali village, in the Bhiwani district of Haryana, is slowly whirring to life after the siesta. Theres a whiff of mustard in the air as the fields of yellow sway in the gentle breeze. The serenity, however, barely seeps in to a hall adjoining the rabi crop where 11-year-old Komal Sangwan is giving the mats a hurried sweep. In minutes, the hall would be packed with 20-odd children, Komal included, first warming up and then straining their sinews to instructions yelled out from the doorway.The tough taskmaster in question: Mahavir Singh Phogat, father and coach to golden grapplers Geeta and Babita. The father-daughters exploits, known in sporting circles for over half a decade, have entered the national conversation with the Aamir Khan-starrer Dangal , the Bollywood blockbuster thats scripting a new collections high at the box office each passing day.The high notes have been years in the making, literally. When he started training his two eldest daughters in 2000, Mahavir quickly became the black sheep of Balali. My relatives, even my parents, would ask me, Arent you ashamed that you are making pehelwans (wrestlers) out of girls? When I used to say that my daughters would make a name for themselves and make the country proud, people used to laugh, says Mahavir, as he sits outside the wrestling hall, Roxy, his pet pug, sleeping at his feet.They laughed then, but the laughter turned to applause as Geeta and Babita went on to win the gold and silver medals respectively at the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. Their sisters and cousins, Priyanka, Ritu, Vinesh and Sangita, also followed them into the sport, winning medals at international and national-level competitions.Winds of changeAlong with the Phogat sisters and Sakshi Malik, bronze medal winner at the Rio Olympics in 2016, young girls in the State are increasingly taking to the sport as evidenced by the throng at the small wrestling centre Mahavir built on his land, complete with a running track through the fields, and elsewhere in the State. When I started training my daughters there werent any akharas that allowed girls. Now, there must be at least 50 akharas that train girls, he says.Its not just that attitudes are changing, the State has also been investing in sports infrastructure, even allocating Rs.1.5 crore in the 2016-2017 budget for wrestling mats and weight-training equipment for akharas. Apart from the State governments wrestling centres, the Sports Authority of India also has three training facilities for the sport in Haryana in Hisar, Bhiwani and Sonepat. But there is a lot more to be done. With the right assistance, Mahavir says he can churn out many Geetas. The Haryana Sports Department itself estimates that Rs.2.5 crore is needed to strengthen akharas.At any rate, in a State with the lowest sex ratio in the country and where women have at different points been banned from using cell phones and wearing jeans, the sight of girls wrestling and excelling at the sport has started a conversation. Daya Kaur, Mahavirs wife, has seen it first-hand. From the time my daughters started wrestling to now, I can see some change. But its not the majority that has changed. Many still wish for a boy to be born, and take the birth of a girl in their family as a burden, she says, as she peeks into the wrestling hall while bracing up for the evening chores.Nine-year-old Neha Sangwan, the daughter of Balali sarpanch Amit Kumar Sangwan, has been training with Mahavir for two years. She can do 600 push-ups, says a village elder who is sitting outside and playing cards with friends. Its more like 100, clarifies Neha sheepishly.Sarpanch Sangwan says the fact that young parents like him are encouraging their daughters to train with Mahavir pehelwan  is an indication of change in the village. Its not just wrestling, but girls in the village are getting jobs in the paramilitary forces, in aviation and the government services. Wrestling will open up opportunities for my daughter, he says.For girls like Neha, the next step is to move to a town as training centres there offer better facilities.The Haryana Sports Department runs wrestling centres across the State, with the one at Rohtaks Chhotu Ram Stadium boasting of many famous students, including Sakshi Malik.About 100 students, including 30 girls, train twice a day for up to six hours at the centre. With photos of Sakshi Malik, double Olympic medallist Sushil Kumar and London 2012 medal-winner Yogeshwar Dutt hanging on the walls, the students arent short on inspiration.Most of the girls are aged 16-24 and have come from villages across the State, with their families funding their stay. They live by themselves in Rohtak, in single rooms on rent. A typical day starts at 5 a.m., with the morning training session spanning from 6.30 a.m. to around 9 a.m. Then its back to the room, where they cook, clean and rest before the afternoon session from 3.30 p.m. to around 7 p.m., and back home in time for dinner. Sunday is the only respite from this gruelling schedule, with the luxury of a few extra hours of sleep.For 18-year-old Reena, who has been wrestling for seven years, while attitudes of those around her may be changing, society still needs to. When I started winning medals, the people in my village started looking at me differently. The biggest change was after Sakshi didi s bronze medal in the Olympics. But I feel its superficial support, they dont really believe in us, she says.Back home, girls are married off as soon as they finish Class X, says Reena in the middle of a training break. Their mindset has not changed overall. My village is about 2 km away, but my parents insist that I rent a room in Rohtak just to keep out the taunts of others, she says.The coach at the centre, Mandeep Singh, who also trains Sakshi Malik, however, insists attitudes are changing. Just from talking to parents, we can see the change, he says, as girls as young as eight years old are being dropped off and picked up twice a day at the centre by eager parents.The wrestling boomIf the number of girls who are starting to take up the sport is any indication, then wrestling is booming in Haryana. Coaches and training centres are finding it difficult to accommodate the rush.At Rohtaks Maharshi Dayanand University, about 100 students train under former national-level coach Ishwar Chand Dahiya, who used to run the Chhotu Ram Stadium centre till his retirement a few years ago. It was there that he encountered Sakshi Malik and became her first coach.At a cold early morning session at the universitys wrestling hall, Kiran Ahlawat cant wait to get back on the mat. The 16-year-old injured her shoulder trying to impress the coach and now has to look on while the others practise. Wearing a pink hoodie and matching socks that peep out from a small hole in her shoes, Kiran is among 14 girls who train under Dahiya. When I started training girls in 2003, even my relatives used to say hes gone mad. But I did not treat girls and boys differently, says the genial coach as he watches over the students morning session.One of the beginners at the centre is 11-year-old Sakshi Malik. After her illustrious namesake became the first Indian woman to win an Olympic medal for wrestling, Sakshi decided that she wanted to follow in her footsteps. Every morning before school, and every afternoon after classes get over, she makes her way from her village, Kharawar, which is about half an hour away.For the twenty-somethings, the wrestlers are grappling with the pressure to get married, but not in the same way as their peers. Their families insist that they focus on their game, win accolades and then think of settling down. Medals will give them an upper hand when it comes to prospective suitors, says a coach. For now, the mat is where their focus is.Sudesh Malik, 22, who is from Bhainswal Kalan village in Sonepat district but lives and trains in Rohtak, knows exactly how things have changed for her ilk. Her parents had forced her to stop wrestling when she was younger. Only an intervention from her coach could get them to agree. When I started winning, they stopped objecting. Now they support me completely. In fact, when I meet my friends from the village, they tell me that I have it the best. Theyre all married. They tell me not to get married, she says.For Sudesh, who competes in the 74-kg weight class, the growing participation of girls has meant more competition. Earlier, there used to be only five to seven girls in my weight class. Now, at national-level events, there are up to 25, she says.Grappling with ground realitiesAnother wrestler at the session, 23-year-old Seema, says though wrestling gave her a new life, life back in her village has not changed much. They talk about us behind our backs. They say things like wonder what she is up to and what kind of clothes must she be wearing, she says.But the villages the girls come from are a world away from the mats. During an evening session, Dahiya shows the students some techniques. The entire hall gathers around as he tackles a student to the ground. As he stands on the sidelines giving instructions, he is interrupted by a girl asking permission to leave early. The hostel warden isnt allowing me to stay late, says the undergraduate student. The hostel she stays at has a fixed curfew for girls, 6 p.m., while boys are not required to adhere to any deadlines. The coach says he will figure it out, speak to the authorities and ask for permission.Meanwhile, Sudesh and Seema are grappling on one side of the mat when they bump into two young men who have also just gone to the ground. Move to your side, yells one of the boys, pointing to the edge of the mat where the girls are supposed to practise. Seema and Sudesh roll their eyes and carry on.Towards the end of the session, the young men and women practise with each other, as the coaches make sure that the doors and windows are closed. I dont let anyone, apart from parents, hang around the hall. If they see girls and boys wrestling with each other, theyll create a ruckus. If this (points towards a girl and boy grappling) was happening in a village, there would be murder, says one of the coaches.League of aspirationsIn some time, its Sudesh who asks to leave. The second edition of the Pro Wrestling League  a bid to professionalise the game on the lines of similar franchise models for cricket, hockey, badminton, kabaddi, etc.  is starting and she wants to catch the first match on TV. Coach Dahiya agrees, and tells all his students to watch kushti on TV as he wraps up the session.The girls cycle frantically to Sudeshs one-room house to make it in time for the opening. With three teddy bears hanging on the wall and two dumb-bells on the floor next to the bed, Sudeshs room is far removed from the staid wrestling hall where she spends hours each day.As Sudesh peels amlas (gooseberries) and a beetroot for juice (its good for you after practice, she says), the programme begins. Seema and Sudesh watch the bouts, talk about which of their favourites could win. As the day winds down, Sudesh gets a call from her father. She assures him that shes taking care of herself and not exerting too much  she hasnt competed in a big competition in about two years due to a knee injury. But Im getting better, getting the strength back, she says, as images from the K.D. Jadhav stadium in Delhi play on in the background.For many of the young girls in Haryanas wrestling centres and akharas, getting to compete alongside international stars in a televised league is a new opportunity, complete with money, fame and the opportunity to learn. But life is no breeze for the young women who appear to have made it.Kiran and Indu Chaudhary have just completed their bouts on day three of the league. With the deafening roar of cheering fans and drums still ringing in their ears, the Haryana Hammers teammates catch a breath. If we give our best, then young girls and their families can see the possibilities. It promotes the sport for the next generation, says Indu, who is from Meerut in Uttar Pradesh. Indu has had a tough bout and ended up injured.  Injury toh wrestler ka gehna hai , says Kiran, to which Indu nods.Whether it is in the wrestling centres or the akharas or under the floodlights of a Delhi stadium, the assembly line coming out of Haryana augurs well for Indias sporting ambitions in the global arena even as it equalises opportunities and alters societal attitudes along the way. Theres a new-found can-do spirit stemming from the successes of the Phogat sisters and Sakshi Malik. Even in faraway Balali, where Neha Sangwan has set her sights on winning an Olympic medal. Like Sakshi didi , she says. Only two notches better.Gold.From the time my daughters started wrestling to now, I can see some change. But its not the majority that has changed. Many still wish for a boy to be born, and take the birth of a girl in their family as a burden-Daya Kaur, wife of Mahavir Phogat"

The agency said additional data and improved analysis resulted in the higher final estimate.The EPA said its research supports earlier statements that water quality in the affected river system has returned to pre-spill levels.An EPA-led contractor inadvertently triggered the 3-million-gallon spill while doing preliminary cleanup work at the old Gold King Mine near Silverton, Colorado. The blowout affected rivers in Colorado, New Mexico and Utah.The EPA said in its report that only 1 percent of the metals came from inside the mine, while 99 percent were ""scoured"" from waste piles on nearby hills and stream beds. The iron and aluminum reacted with the river water to cause the eye-catching mustard color that was visible for days as the plume traveled down the river system into Lake Powell, the EPA said.Besides iron and aluminum, the spill released manganese, lead, copper, arsenic, zinc, cadmium and a small amount of mercury into the river, the EPA said.The EPA said last month it will pay $4.5 million to state, local and tribal governments for their emergency responses, but the agency rejected $20.4 million in other requests for past and future expenses.New Mexico Environment Secretary Butch Tongate accused the EPA of using the taxpayer-funded report to try to defend its actions. The state has sued the agency over the spill.Colorado officials said they had no comment on the report. Utah officials didn't immediately respond to a request for comment."

Dense fog prevailed many places in state. Sriganganagar in plains and Mount Abu in hills remained coldest with minimum temperatures of 3.8 degrees Celsius and 3.0 degrees Celsius respectively, met report said.Attributing the climatic change to active northerly winds Jaipur met office said that similar conditions will prevail in the state in next couple of days.Jaipurities woke up to the coldest day of the season so far, as a minimum temperature of 9.2 degrees Celsius was recorded. Roads wore a deserted look during early morning hours while vehicles were moving at snail's pace due to dense fog. Traffic on highways connecting Jaipur to Agra, Jaipur to Delhi and Jaipur to Ajmer was chaotic due to the abrupt jams. Likewise, half-a-dozen early morning flights were also affected by the situation. Trains coming from neighbouring states including Uttar Pradesh, Harayana and Delhi also arrived beyond scheduled at Jaipur railway station.Sriganganagar and Mount Abu were followed by Phalodi (Jodhpur) where a minimum temperature of 5.0 degrees Celsius was recorded along with Bikaner 6.5 degrees Celsius, Alwar 6.8 degrees Celsius, Vanasthali 7.1 degrees Celsius, Jaisalmer 7.4 degrees Celsius, Pilani 7.6 degrees Celsius, Sikar 8.0 degrees Celsius, Churu 8.4 degrees Celsius, Barmer 9.2 degrees Celsius, Jodhpur 10.4 degrees Celsius. Ajmer recorded 10.5 degrees Celsius followed by Chittorgarh 11.0 degrees Celsius, Udaipur 11.4 degrees Celsius Sawai Madhopur and Bundi 11.8 degrees Celsius each.Meanwhile, the continued dip in temperature is favourable for crops including wheat and mustard as temperature was warm throughout December.

The northeast monsoon  critical to the southern peninsula, particularly Tamil Nadu  has been a disaster, with overall rainfall for the season (October-December) turning out 45.2 per cent below normal. This is the worst since the 48.3 per cent deficit recorded in 2011.For Tamil Nadu, Kerala and southern Karnataka, the poor northeast monsoon rains come as a double whammy. Tamil Nadu, Kerala, south interior Karnataka and coastal Karnataka had already reported respective rainfall shortfalls of 19 per cent, 34 per cent, 21 per cent and 21 per cent even during the southwest monsoon (June-September). The corresponding deficits of 62 per cent, 61 per cent, 70 per cent and 63 per cent reported for the northeast season only make matters worse. Tamil Nadu, not surprisingly, has declared drought.Extended dry weather in Tamil Nadu and southern Karnataka could have a production impact, especially in milk and sugar where supply conditions are already tightening.There is no such problem of moisture deficiency in the main rabi belt of northern and central India. The current cold wave, triggered by widespread rain/snowfall activity over the western Himalayan region, should help the standing wheat, mustard and chana crops. While the northeast monsoon rains were bad in these regions as well  causing concerns till early this month  the fact is that the situation is far better than in 2015 and 2014. Those two years saw both the southwest and the northeast monsoon rains fail.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

In Punjab, the westerly winds, colloquially called pacchhon, gently sweep away the chill and fog, revealing stunningly sun-drenched lush-green swathes of wheat crop, the air redolent with mustard in bloom. This time, the breeze has a palpable flavour, that of political change.Punjab is on the cusp of a history-making assembly election. The first shape-shifter is evident in the contours of the contest itself. Since 1947, the two traditional parties, the Shiromani Akali Dal and Congress, have dominated the electoral landscape and taken turns to rule the border state  a neat seven times each.Only 2012 was an exception when the SAD-BJP combine romped home to an unprecedented successive win, thanks largely to the Congresss hubris and blunders in ticket distribution.This time, however, the Aam Aadmi Party has disturbed the bipolar mould. Never before has Punjab seen such a potent third force in the power sweepstakes. It has, to all intent and purposes, turned the long-entrenched revolving door politics into a TITA (there is third alternative) narrative.What the rookie party lacks in grassroots organisational muscle of its powerful rivals, it has more than made up for by tapping into a groundswell of voter angst with a Trump-style, take-no-prisoners campaign.Read: Punjab CM Parkash Singh Badal files nomination from Lambi for assembly electionsUndisputedly, it will be a momentous election for all three contestants. The outcome will have a bearing beyond the state and on the political fortunes of those in the fray. And, the Congress has the highest stakes. Of five poll-bound states, its only in Punjab that it has a realistic chance to win and refashion national narrative. Yet another debacle, the third on a trot, could well push it off the map of yet another state.Also, 75-year-old Captain Amarinder Singh has a lot to redeem in what he calls his last electoral outing. Blemished by two successive assembly defeats, the scion of the Patiala royal family recovered his political luck in his dramatic Amritsar victory in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls. On test is his reputation as the only leader capable of catapulting the party onto the victory podium.But, he has to contend with a determined AAP which is proving a more powerful foe than the Akalis whom Rahul Gandhi recently reckoned were a formidable machine.Read: Arvind Kejriwal in Patiala: Punjab CM will be from Punjab, I am Delhis CMFor the rookie party, its a make-or-break election after it pulled off a stunner in the 2014 polls, picking all of its four Lok Sabha seats from Punjab and garnering a 25% vote share. In Kejriwals scheme of things, Punjab is low-hanging fruit. Its a critical addition for his national ambitions for 2019 and to prove that he is not a one-trick pony.Despite being hit by a string of splits and scandals that have dissipated some of its energy, AAP is still cutting a swathe in the states complex religion-caste algebra. Its change the system caller tune has many takers among the youth, the most vocal protagonists of popular disenchantment with traditional parties.Cognisant of the third players disruptive politics, both the Congress and the Akalis are centering their anti-Kejriwal tirade on the outsider versus native narrative. Punjab Punjabian da ( Punjab belongs to Punjabis) goes the new Akali rallying cry. The reference to the Delhi chief ministers Haryanvi ancestry is in the context of Punjabs long-standing water and territorial disputes with Haryana. Such a parochial pitch overlooks the fact that Punjabis, by nature, are a great risk takers.Whats stoking the mood for change is a mixture of aspirations and anger. There is no denying the big-ticket development agenda  the prime calling card of SAD-BJP combines poll campaign -- has made a difference. In last ten years, Punjab has seen surplus power, mega infra projects, a huge heritage makeover and a social welfarism to the extent that 80% of one of richest states is the beneficiary of the subsided atta-dal scheme . But, then, the iconic Yeh dil maange more tagline holds more true for Punjabis than Pepsi.All this, coupled with pre-poll sops of 30,000 jobs and the jettisoning of unpopular MLAs, hasnt soothed the public ire. Truth be told, resonating in the grassroots discourse across poll-bound Punjab is the theme of arrogance of power that manifested itself in the patronage to myriads of mafias, the brazen promotion of the Badals business interests, misuse of police and even arm-twisting of the media.Read: Punjab leaders provoking violence ahead of polls?Worryingly for the Akalis, there is a disquiet even on the Panthic turf  their power bedrock - over incidents of sacrilege of the Guru Granth Sahib and the misuse of Sikh institutions for political ends. The ruling Badals are seen as the focal point of anti-incumbency. This last election of 89-year-old patriarch Parkash Singh Badal will test whether his son and heir apparent can keep up his winning streak . This is what holds the key to a smooth dynastic succession in the 96-year-old regional party.Akalis may be down but are certainly not out. Apart from the Modi magic to swing the urban voters, they are counting on Sukhbirs genius for a split-and-scrape-through strategy by propping up vote-splitters from the Congress and AAP dissidents. The Congress is scenting a victory, but its campaign is yet to gather momentum.In todays Punjab, there are no clear winners. Unless the breeze turns into a wind (hawa) in the next three weeks, the state which has always voted decisively could well be heading for another historic first  a split mandate."

Farmers told TOI that as they could not withdraw money from banks, they failed to get adequate amount of fertilizer, affecting quality of crop. Many said they were forced to take loans from moneylenders to buy agricultural inputs.BJP organized Mati-Tilak Pratigya to woo farmers ahead of the state assembly elections. Though hundreds of farmers across the district gathered at the event, they told TOI that they were hit hard by demonetisation.Shyamlal, a farmer from Meerganj, said, ""Though I stood in queues a few times outside bank, I failed to withdraw money on time and I could only get Rs 2,000 currency notes from the ATM, which was insufficient. As I did not have the cash, I could not purchase adequate quantity of fertiliser and pesticide for my wheat crop. My crop got damaged because proper care was not taken and I ended up incurring a loss of Rs 10,000.""Another farmer, Gaya Prasad from Fatehganj West said, ""Unable to withdraw money or exchange currency notes at the bank, I was forced to take a loan from a moneylender at an interest rate of 10%. This time, the delay in sowing of wheat and mustard will lead to less yield."" He added, ""I support demonetisation as it affected the rich and corrupt but it affected my crop this season. I will also have to pay interest later.""A resident of Bijamau village in Nawabganj, Tarlok Ram Gangwar, said, ""Bank officials gave money only to big traders and made us leave even after waiting in serpentine queues for days. We failed to get money to purchase fertiliser, seeds and bear the cost of diesel."" Another farmer, Ramveer, from Golenagra village in Fatehganj West said, ""We are habitual of standing in queues for purchasing every item of need but this time, we could not get cash when we needed it most. We had to borrow money and now, will have to pay interest rate which is an additional burden on us.""However, BJP MP from Aonla, Dharmendra Kashyap who was the chief guest here while addressing farmers claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been taking steps for the welfare of the community. He also mentioned about the schemes introduced by the Centre for farmers. Hitting out at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi who had organized ""khat sabhas' across UP, Kashyap said, ""A man who is unaware whether potatoes grow on trees or underground or how red chillies are made, has conducted khat sabhas for farmers. How can one help farmers when he is unaware about the problems faced by the community."""

""The discovery offers a peek into the past and the development of products which still sit within kitchencupboards around the world today,"" researchers said. The findings include glass bottles for Mushroom Catsup, ceramic bung jars for mustard and Piccalilli and delicately painted white jars for Preserved Ginger.Researchers from the Museum of London Archaeology in the UK also found white earthenware jars for Pure Orange Marmalade, Household Raspberry Jam and Plum Jam, some of which still bear their original labels. They illustrate the ambitions of one of Victorian Britain's most prolific and enduring enterprises and evidence the development of British tastes.""Excavations on Crosse & Blackwell's Soho factory produced a large and diverse collection of pottery and glass related to their products, with one cistern alone containing nearly three tonnes of Newcastle made marmalade jars with stoneware bottles and jars,"" said Nigel Jeffries, a Medieval and Later Pottery Specialist at MOLA.""We think this is the biggest collection of pottery ever discovered in a single feature from an archaeological site in London,"" said Jeffries.Crosse & Blackwell, a British food production company which has been in existence since 1706, manufactured, bottled and packaged their products on this site until 1921. The area was known for being a hive of industrial activity, and Crosse & Blackwell's facilities appealed to other companies, who outsourced aspects of their business to their factory, researchers said."

Instead, they will weigh the goat and pay `380 per kg for the whole animal.Earlier, when the adivasi women needed money they approach the middleman seeking a sum of `1,000 as loan. The cattle market at Attappadi is being held every Saturday.On Friday, the middleman comes and takes away the goat by paying the balance he deems fit to the adivasi women, says Lakshmi, the co-ordinator of the Kurumba panchayat samithi.Now, under the Mahila Kisan Sashaktikaran Pariyojana (MKSP) of the National Rural Livelihood Mission (NRLM), the adivasis of the 130 ooru samithis will sell their goats to the panchayat samithi. Goat sheds have been set up by the samithi where it will be kept and given feed till it is sold to interested parties which include non-adivasis, says secretary of the Pudur panchayat samithi Radhamani.We urge people to purchase Attappady black, Jamna Pyari, Malabari and the local breed directly from the goat rearer and contribute towards augmenting their income and livelihood. Nobody has to wait for the weekly Saturday trade fair but the goats will be available for sale all days throughout the year. The aim was to avoid the middlemen,says NRLM manager Seema Bhaskar.Adds Rajamma, a Kudumbashree member, We have already prepared a list of the adivasis rearing goats and at least 1,600 women are likely to benefit from the goat village facility through which they can sell. Buyers can approach the Kudumbashree office at the Ahads complex to purchase the goats. The minimum price fixed is `10,000 per goat.The adivasi Kudumbashree units have also ventured into making value-added products ofgroundnut, ragi, millet, thuvara parippu (yellow split dal), mustard, cluster beans and honey under the brand name Malleeswara products. There are 590 adivasi Kudumbashree units.We used to get only `20 for a kg of groundnut. Now we dry it and sell for `120 per kg. We also produce groundnut oil and the cake is sold as cattle feed. Same is the case with ragi which we used to get a very low price, but now after powdering it we get `30 per kg. All these activities contribute to our income and also provide the members with employment, Radhamani said."

Elsewhere, one could attempt a bungee jump, or zip around on a quad bike. You could also live out your soldierly fantasies by playing bang-bang in fatigues (paint balling - with paints pellets, of course). There was also hot-air ballooning, though only if the wind was fair enough for the balloons to take flight.The carnival's highlight was the obstacle course, as short as 3km, stretching to 5km. Here, participants had to answer questions posed by the topography (besides those set by man). Clamber up or scramble down? Wade through cold water or slither under barbed wire? Obstacles were placed at intervals, across farmland, standalone thickets of trees, marshes and craggy outcrops.Stamina, strength and speed are tested, as is the ability to make decisions under taxing conditions. The 'run' ended with a 'porcupine pit', a dug-up maze through which the contestant had to wriggle before climbing a ladder to ring a bell, which announces race's end.Away from the adventure pursuits was a space that throbbed with energy, part disco, part sound system. Stages at each end (and one on the side, too) battled for everyone's attention. And no carnival can be complete without a Bollywood celebrity, and Neha Dhupia played her role to the hilt, joshing and flirting with the crowd (not surprisingly, the 'Selfie with Neha' competition was well received)."

Now, they are learning that its no good unless the fish are allowed to flourish in their native waters for a while, before they are plopped in the mustard sauce.Last year, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh swore off celebrating the new year with Meghna hilsa. West Bengal, which is just as fascinated by the fish, launched an ad campaign discouraging people from having anything to do with juvenile specimens. One TV ad excitedly urged people not to keep any small hilsa with them. As though they habitually carry small hilsa about in their pockets.Inspired by their brethren across the border in Bangladesh, who went to war against overfishing when catches fell by orders of magnitude while prices soared, lawmakers in West Bengal are now ready to bring the majesty of the law to bear on illicit fishing in the spawning season, when hilsa swim upriver like salmon.Again, like salmon (the wild Alaskan variety is protected by law, by the way), hilsa could be legally shielded from fishermen and traders who catch and sell small specimens. Hilsa reappeared in Indian waters when Bangladesh declared fish swimming up from the Bay of Bengal off-limits.Now, it is Indias turn to prevent overfishing, so that hilsa venture further up the Ganga and Brahmaputra river systems, for everyones pleasure and profit. Size matters, and not only in fishing yarns. Apart from the ethical considerations, the smallest deserve protection because they have room to register the highest growth, and potentially offer the best returns.

Now, they are learning that its no good unless the fish are allowed to flourish in their native waters for a while, before they are plopped in the mustard sauce.Last year, Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh swore off celebrating the new year with Meghna hilsa. West Bengal, which is just as fascinated by the fish, launched an ad campaign discouraging people from having anything to do with juvenile specimens. One TV ad excitedly urged people not to keep any small hilsa with them. As though they habitually carry small hilsa about in their pockets.Inspired by their brethren across the border in Bangladesh, who went to war against overfishing when catches fell by orders of magnitude while prices soared, lawmakers in West Bengal are now ready to bring the majesty of the law to bear on illicit fishing in the spawning season, when hilsa swim upriver like salmon.Again, like salmon (the wild Alaskan variety is protected by law, by the way), hilsa could be legally shielded from fishermen and traders who catch and sell small specimens. Hilsa reappeared in Indian waters when Bangladesh declared fish swimming up from the Bay of Bengal off-limits.Now, it is Indias turn to prevent overfishing, so that hilsa venture further up the Ganga and Brahmaputra river systems, for everyones pleasure and profit. Size matters, and not only in fishing yarns. Apart from the ethical considerations, the smallest deserve protection because they have room to register the highest growth, and potentially offer the best returns. India under-appreciates this obvious principle.In politics, business and society, the future belongs to the small fry. But like the hilsa, they may need a little protection en route.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
58f5d1f5a3d24b0b70c25143,The ground beneath their feat,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-ground-beneath-their-feat/article17071026.ece,2017-01-21,"Siwans claim to fame so far has been three-dimensional: it is Indias first President Rajendra Prasads birthplace; it is the constituency of the jailed Rashtriya Janata Dal leader Mohd. Shahabuddin; and the district boasts of maximum remittances from abroad to Bihar  roughly 40 per cent of the Rs. 1,800 crore that flowed into the State in 2014-15. But slowly and steadily, Siwan is adding a fourth dimension  or a third claim to fame if you will. A group of young girls of Mairwa block is overturning the all-too-familiar story of being pushed into child labour and/or early marriage at the expense of education. The story is unfolding almost Dangal -like, as it plays out in the boondocks of Bihar. And like Aamir Khan in the Bollywood blockbuster, it has at its centre one man: Sanjay Pathak, 43, who doubles up as the young girls coach, guardian, teacher and lifeline; in short, he is their life around which their lives revolve, drawing sustenance and encouragement. This, then, is the story of 70 girls in sports jerseys who sprint, lob and block  striving for perfection under their mentors eagle eye.Every day, the girls set out on their bicycles furiously pedalling away the stretch of 15 km that takes them to Lakshmipur village for their daily practice on the one-acre farmland of Pathak. This is their sports complex, nestled between green paddy and yellow mustard plants, where they practise football, hockey, handball and athletics and have been winning medals at national- and international-level meets. At least 30 of my girls have played in national/international-level games and have brought medals and laurels for the country and the State but look at their shoes and the facilities here, Pathak points out. All that is here is courtesy the monthly salary of Rs. 43,000 that he receives as a government school teacher, but Pathak wouldnt talk about his sacrifices. When I see these girls kick the ball between goalposts and run like a hyena on this uneven mud ground, all my worries vanish what more could I ask from my life? he asks, his eyes glistening with just a hint of a tear drop.In Siwan, power flows from the barrel of the gun. And its always a man wielding it; women have little identity here. The child sex ratio of the district is skewed at 940 girls for every 1,000 boys. The prosperity that remittances have brought to the villages of Siwan has little bearing on the young girls from here.A man and his missionIt was sometime in 2009 that Pathak claims he received a divine message nudging him to do something for the poor schoolgirls of his native place. He identified a vacant stretch of land to kick-start his sporting mission. Beginning with just two, footballers Putul Kumari and Tara Khatun, the numbers steadily rose to 30 in just a few months. I was very happy that the girls had even started winning medals at the district-level games and were aiming high, says Pathak, who literally lives in his tracksuit. But alongside the achievements came taunts, ridicule, and threats at both the coach and his wards. The rowdies taunted us saying this land is not anyones baap ki zameen (fathers land) its government land. We ignored them but when things got out of control and they began harassing the girls by playing lewd songs on their mobile phones, plying their motorbikes on the field when the girls would practise and throwing shards of glass pieces in the arena, I complained to the local police station. It continued, he says, adding, but one day, I decided enough is enough. That was in March 2015.Pathak decided to drive his tractor all through his one-acre agricultural field and level it. Soon, it began to take shape of a training ground. This was literally his  baap ki zameen . It took another 10 days for the ground to be readied. He named the sports complex Himeshwar Khel Vikas Kendra and the girls group as Rani Lakshmibai Club. There is no signboard of the centre or the club, though  a few yards away from the Lakshmipur village, the playground suddenly appears amid the green paddy and yellow mustard fields, open from all sides.Over time, Pathak firmed up the layout. Three goalposts serve as a marker: one part where the girls play hockey; the other where they practise badminton and tennis. The athletes run on the fringes of the ground. At one end is a newly constructed, unpainted changing room, a 28x18 feet hall and a 22x18 feet room meant for administrative work. The hall and admin room are locked. They have not been inaugurated yet well do it soon, says Pathak. A hand pump is pitched near the changing room where the girls drenched in sweat come to quench their thirst after practice. Now, no one dares come here and tease or threaten us... my girls are safe here, says Pathak, breaking into a smile across his chubby face.A father of two growing daughters, Pathak lives in a joint family of nine members.He deserves the Presidents award for what he has been doing for the girls of the area but even the district administration is oblivious to this, rues younger brother Basant, a railway employee.Its 5.30 on a wintry January morning and Antima Kumari, a gold medal-winner in 100 metres in the under-14 State and national championships, is tying her shoelaces in her ramshackle rooftop room of her home in Bilaspur village. Stepping out on her bicycle, she soon merges into a file of pedallists on a narrow serpentine path. As they reach the outskirts of Lakshmipur village, another bunch of girls joins in, hockey sticks clutched tight in hand, footballs neatly strapped on the rear carrier of the cycle. Some of them like Anisha Kumari have come from as far as Gaderia village, some 16 km away. At the Himeshwar Khel Vikas Kendra, the cycles are hurriedly parked in a corner as the girls get ready to go through their paces.Practice makes perfectThe morning sun is not yet out and the wind is chilly. Its very cold sireven the morning dew has settled on the leaves, complains Priyanka Kumari, one of the girls. But Pathak is rubbing his palms in the field to keep warm and would hear none of it. After a short pep talk, its time for the warm-up session.Soon another batch of girls arrives, picks its hockey sticks and start playing on the adjacent ground. Three little girls in running shoes take to the track. In a few minutes, the playground is buzzing with frenetic physical activity and the cacophony of girls cheering and encouraging each other.On paper, coach Pathak has nothing to recommend him  neither a sportsman in his time nor someone who has trained for the job. But years of taking these village girls under his wing and mentoring them have honed his own skills besides that of his pupils: other than Putul, Tara and Antima, his stable has also produced national-level players such as Amrita Kumari, Nisha Kumari, Taras sister Salma Khatun (football), Sindhu Kumari and Khusboo Kumari (hockey) and Mamata Kumari and Neelu Kumari (handball). There are about 30 players of this ground who have played national and international matches [at various age divisions], boasts the coach, in between shouting out instructions as some dribble with their sticks, others feint and dodge past opponents with the ball, and still others zip past on the running track ringing the field.Its 8.30 a.m., pack-up time. The girls should be in their schools by 10 a.m., says Pathak. The playground gets deserted as bicycles once again zoom past narrow dirt paths taking the girls home.Daring to dream bigPathaks unswerving devotion to his cause has offered a lifeline to girls who couldnt have dreamt of a future beyond Lakshmipur village, let alone Mairwa block or Siwan. Tara and Salma Khatuns father Sudhan Ansari runs a roadside vehicle puncture shop to support their family of 15, which lives in a half-constructed roadside hall with partitions made of thin curtains in Mudyari village. Tara had gone to France to play in the school football world cup in 2014. Salma is a national-level footballer too, and sisters Sarla and Sabra have taken to the game as well. Initially it was tough for us to allow our girls to play football the relatives and the villagers taunted and ridiculed us. But now, after they have won laurels and their photos appeared in newspapers, were happy with whatever they are doing, says Rasulla Begum, their mother.Similar stories abound. Nisha, who has been to Kathmandu and Tajikstan in 2016 to participate in under-16 football competitions, is the daughter of electrician Ranjit Yadav. Amrita, who has played in Sri Lanka in 2013 and captained the Indian girls under-16 football team in Bangladesh in 2015, is the daughter of Shambhu Prasad, a vegetable vendor in Gurugram, Haryana. Putul, whose father Ravindra Prasad sells sweets at a roadside shop near the temple in Mairwa Dham village, couldnt make it to the Indian under-16 womens football contingent that went to Jordan for the Asian football championship because her passport was not ready in time. It was bad luck but one day she too will go to a foreign land to unfurl the Tricolour, says her proud father. Putul is fifth among seven sisters and a brother. Three sisters are already married and one is set to marry in April this year. But Ill let Putul continue with her game and let her marry whenever she wishes, says Ravindra, glancing at his 17-year-old daughter.This is just the beginning. The younger lot like Kajal Kumari and Shruti Kumar are the real players to watch out for, and they would certainly play for the senior Indian womens football team provided politics does not play a part in player selection, asserts Pathak. Ten-year-old Kajal, whose father Navrangi Bansfore rears pigs, comes from a Mahadalit family. She is an all-rounder... plays football and hockey with equal ease, but she excels as a sprinter, says Pathak. His pupil, sporting running shoes that are beginning to give away, smiles from a distance. I like running the most.Promises to keepBack home, space is always at a premium. Some of the girls have stacked their medals in large trunks, gunny bags and on the cemented racks below the roof in the room. The room of their coach too is crammed with medals, trophies and shields won the girls and awards for him. None of the girls have televisions in their households, except Antima who has a black and white Hybon brand TV set in her tiny room on the roof. But they all have their idols to swear by. [Lionel] Messi and Ronaldo are my favourite players for their dribbling, running and precision-passing skills, gushes Nisha. For Amrita and Putul, Messi is the best of them all. No player has control on the ball like him he is a true magician, says Amrita. For Tara and her sisters, its David Beckham and Zinedine Zidane. For their simple skills, they say.No television, but have they seen the much-talked-about Dangal ? No, not even the coach. Weve heard that the movie is inspirational for players like us its story is like ours but we cant afford to go to the theatre and watch it let its HD version come and well download it on someones mobile phone, giggles Amrita.The only regret these girls have is that theyre not getting any government support for their endeavour. Whatever we have is provided by our coach Sanjay sir the playing field, boots, jerseys, T-shirts, footballs, hockey sticks, he gives us money for our travel expenses to play matches outside the district he is our everything, they echo in unison. I spend Rs. 12,000 of my salary every month and get some donations from close friends and kind villagers for the girls to play the sport the changing room for the girls has been constructed with a donation of Rs. 3 lakh from some good Samaritans, says the coach, hoping that the State administration in Patna wakes up to their plight.Its 3.30 p.m. and the girls are back on their bicycles heading for the playground. The sun is slowly turning a shade crimson and the swirling fog gradually enveloping the village fields in a cold embrace as they furiously pedal to reach the Kendra by 4 p.m. The morning routine repeats itself until around 6 p.m., when its time to call it a day. The girls are homeward-bound, but the saga of hope, courage and promise will unfold again in the morrow.When I see these girls kick the ball between goalposts and run like a hyena on this uneven mud ground, all my worries vanish what more couldI ask from my life?Sanjay Pathak"
58f5d59da3d24b0b70c2538b,The good troublemakers,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/The-good-troublemakers/article17076411.ece,2017-01-22,"Some years ago, I was reading Art Spiegelmans Maus , a Pulitzer-winning graphic novel about the Holocaust, when my younger son, then five years old, wanted to know what the book was about.Why do the people have the faces of mice and cats? he asked.Why do you think they do? I asked him.He thought for a moment. Cats catch mice, he replied. Then he added: But they cant help it. (He knew this because we have a pet cat, though she has never met a mouse.) These drawings arent of cats. They just have the faces of cats. Theyre people. Are these people with cat faces being mean to the mice?I nodded. He had got it. Is this a real story? he asked.One of the hardest conversations with children  much harder than talking about birds and bees  is about injustice. We teach children to be fair and to expect fairness in return. This is the essence of parenting. Dont use your hands when youre angry; use words. Dont use mean words; use words to say what you mean. Be kind. Be fair.But how does one teach children to respond when the world isnt fair? How do we teach them to handle discrimination, to stand up for others, to make the world a better place? To go high, as Michelle Obama said, when others go low?The power of booksOne of the critical ways to teach children about tolerance and justice is through reading. Reading takes children outside the bubbles in which we try to protect them, and into the lives of others far removed from them. Reading teaches empathy. It gives universal power to individual stories. It talks about things that we arent sure how to talk about and says things that we often dont know how to say. It speaks to the imagination and to the heart.Last week, I ordered a set of American civil rights hero John Lewiss three-volume graphic memoir March . John Lewis is one of the iconic figures of the American civil rights movement. As a student, he applied to Troy State University even though he knew blacks werent allowed there. It was one of his first acts of protest against segregation. The boy from Troy, as Martin Luther King Jr. described Lewis, chaired the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and was one of the leaders in the student-led sit-in movement and the Freedom Rides in the early 1960s. At the legendary 1963 March on Washington, John Lewis was one of the youngest speakers. In 1965, he helped lead the historic Selma to Montgomery March as part of the voting rights movement.This National Book Award-winning collaboration between John Lewis, Andrew Aydin and artist Nate Powell presents an affecting first-hand account of the struggle for civil rights. At the National Book Award function, Lewis recalled how in 1956, as a little boy, he wasnt allowed a library card at his local rural library because of his race. Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it, said Santayana. March is an attempt to remind young readers about one of the most important civil rights struggles of the 20th century. It is a struggle that still continues. The memoir uses the 2009 inauguration of former U.S. President Barack Obama as a frame for its civil rights narrative. Because of you, John, wrote Obama on a card that he gave to Lewis on that historic day. Because of you, thereby tracing a line back from that cold January morning in 2009 to the story of the American struggle for civil rights and voting rights.There is another line in the narrative, another Because of you that goes further back from the struggles in Alabama and Mississippi in the 1960s to India and the freedom struggle led by Gandhi. Remember the teachings of Jesus Christ, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, writes Lewis in his list of dos and donts for the sit-in protests. Love and non-violence is the way.The cover of the first volume shows a group of protesters sitting at a lunch counter. Their faces are tense, nervous, but determined. On the counter before them are ketchup, mustard, salt, pepper, sugar, tissues and a sign that says Counter Closed. This is what the protesters are up against.The story begins on the morning of what would later be called Bloody Sunday. It begins on the Edmund Pettus bridge across the Alabama river. A line of marchers is on the bridge, and the state troopers are at the other end. Can you swim? Hosea Williams asks John Lewis, at the head of the march. No, says Lewis. Well, neither can I, replies Hosea. But we might have to.Moments in the memoirHistorical events are often brought to life in graphic novels in ways that are beyond the scope of textbooks. There are many unforgettable moments in this powerful work: the rich detail as the visuals zoom in to look at the anxiety in a persons eyes or zoom out to look at the vast fields over which the volunteers trudge day after day. The way the words and music of the movements songs curve around the panels, linking past to present, first softly and then soaring in epic, poetic fashion: They say that freedom is a constant struggle/ They say that freedom is a constant struggle/ Oh Lord, weve struggled so long, we must be free/ We must be freeOne of the most moving moments in the memoir is the search for the three missing volunteers in Mississippi. A line of dark trees, a few stars in the night-time sky, a small triangle of torchlight on the grass. A voice: You see anything? And then, on the next page, pitch black, a forlorn silhouette in grey, and the tiniest, saddest, most exhausted of responses: No.March is about how social heroes are made, through courage and non-violence, and about what Lewis describes as good trouble: to find a way to get in the way. It is also about the power of books themselves as manuals in the quest for social justice. One of the early sources of Lewiss own inspiration was a 1957 comic book titled Martin Luther King and the Montgomery Story , a 16-page, 10-cent narrative about non-violent resistance for desegregation.Sometimes going to school was a luxury my family couldnt afford, Lewis reflects about his childhood. He hid from his parents and ran to catch the school bus in the mornings instead of working on the farm. The school library was a place of discovery. After the first time he heard a speech by Martin Luther King, he says: I went to the school library on Monday to find out everything I could about this man.This week, as we read the part about the first march from Selma, on Bloody Sunday, my nine-year-old peered closely at the picture of John Lewis lying on the ground, a puddle of grey stones around his forehead. Thats blood! said my son, shocked. Hes bleeding. Thats blood dripping from his head.He was silent for a moment.Is this a real story? he asked me quietly.Yes, I replied.Uma Mahadevan Dasgupta is in the IAS and is currently based in Bengaluru.At the National Book Award function, Lewis recalled how in 1956, as a little boy, he wasnt allowed a library card because of his race."

Monocrotophos was meant for use on sugarcane crop.The Bihar Police was put under tremendous pressure to establish foul play in the deaths of 23 schoolchildren in the Gandaman primary school midday meal tragedy, but its investigations showed only criminal negligence on the part of the school principal, the officer in charge of the probe told The Indian Express.The Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of the state police exculpated the husband of the principal, who had bought the pesticide that made its way into the childrens meal.Read |Bihar midday meal tragedy: Everything you need to know about the incidentAccepting the CIDs supervision note, an additional district judge in Chhapra, Saran, in August 2016 convicted the principal, Meena Devi, and sentenced her to two jail terms of 10 years and seven years, to run consecutively rather than concurrently, adding up to a total sentence of 17 years.Watch What Else Is making NewsThe court acquitted Meenas husband, Arjun Rai alias Arjun Yadav, of all charges.This is how Vinay Kumar, additional director-general of police, CID, reconstructed the events of July 16, 2013  the day of the tragedy  in an exclusive interview to The Indian Express.Read | In Bihar primary school where mid-day meal killed 23, children go hungryThat day, Meena Devi, the principal of Gandaman primary school in Bihars Saran district, had planned to distribute free government textbooks to about 100 children studying in Classes 1 to 5. The school was running in a community hall measuring 30 ft by 20 ft. An open part of the verandah was being used as the midday meal kitchen.Meenas husband, Arjun Rai, had announced to the children and their parents that books would be distributed, and almost three times the usual number of 30-40 students had turned up. The midday meal menu, according to a chart prepared by the government, was rice and soybean curry.Rai, a farmer, had decided to grow sugarcane that year, and had purchased monocrotophos, a cheap but acutely toxic organophosphate agricultural insecticide. He had kept the container on the verandah of their house, some 600 metres from the school.Meena asked one of the two school cooks to bring the container of mustard oil from the verandah, which had no separately marked space for the midday meals groceries.The cook saw two similar containers. Arjun Rai had brought two litres of monocrotophos, an agricultural pesticide, from the neighbouring Sidhwalia Sugar Mill for his sugarcane crop. Monocrotophos resembles mustard oil. Instead of picking up the container of mustard oil, the cook picked up the one containing monocrotophos, ADGP Kumar said.Once on the fire, the pesticide turned black. The two cooks and some students brought this unusual behaviour of the mustard oil to the notice of the principal. Meena Devi, however, dismissed their concerns, saying old mustard oil can turn black with heat.Around 1.30 pm, the first batch of 60-odd students were ready to have lunch. Some, like Laxmi Sah, daughter of confectioner Raju Sah, went back home because they did not want to eat what was being served, but others like her brother Krishna stayed because they liked soybean. By 2.30 pm, there was complete chaos: parents were rushing their children to Masrakh hospital with complaints of giddiness, vomiting and breathlessness.In the end, 23 schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 12 years had died of poisoning.CID officers picked up the residue of the cooked soyabean from utensils and put it through Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), a chemistry technique to identify the amount and types of chemicals in a sample, and were able to establish the presence of the pesticide. It was known that Arjun Rai had procured monocrotophos for his sugarcane crop; what the CID now needed to find out was whether he had a motive for murder.We were under tremendous pressure to prove foul play. Rai could have added monocrotophos to the container of mustard oil. But his only mistake was to keep the pesticide container in the vicinity of the mustard oil container, ADGP Kumar said.It was criminal negligence on the part of the school principal, who should have responded to the complaints of the cooks and the students, said the officer. Naming Arjun Rai would have been poor padding for a conspiracy theory. Rai had no motive to conspire to kill students. The school principal was solely responsible for the tragedy, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The System of Rice Intensification (SRI) method was used.Ever since the land-return order, concerns had remained whether the concrete mesh setup in the now dismantled Tata Nano factory has permanently damaged the multicrop land character in these parts. Mamata Banerjee on October 30 last year kicked off the process of cultivation in a symbolic gesture by sowing mustard seed, which is faster and easier to grow in winter.On Wednesday, when Bijon Bihari Ghosh was the first to plant the Boro seedlings in his 12 decimal plot in Gopalnagar, he was elated. ""I was sent to prison for refusing to part with my land. I had insisted our land is very fertile and we often end up growing three crops round-the-year in the same plot. Today, I stand vindicated. The factory had turned this land into a concrete mass.Yet the land beneath remained fertile,"" Ghosh said.But the state agriculture department remains cautious. The SRI method which they are advocating here is different from the conventional rice cultivation methods. Experts say this involves planting single, young seedlings at optimal wide spaces, keeping the soil moist but well-drained and aerated and adding compost or other organic materials to the soil."

The answer is none.The latest data on nutritional composition of Indian foods published by the city-based National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) shows that the `humble' safflower oil has the highest percentage of good fat and the second lowest content of bad fat. This makes safflower oil the best bet in Indian kitchens.The `Indian Food Composition Tables', which was released in Hyderabad on Friday by NIN director T Longvah , lists as many as 13 edible oils with their fatty acid profiles. The NIN has profiled 526 Indian foods including oils with minute details like vitamin D content. The latest work is an update of a similar but limited exercise carried out in 1989. The oils analysed by the NIN are coconut oil, corn oil, cotton seed oil, gingelly oil, mustard oil, palm oil, rice bran oil, safflower oil, safflower oil (blended), soya bean oil, sunflower oil, ghee and Vanaspati.Though the NIN did not give ranking for oils, safflower oil emerges as the best cooking medium if the total polyunsaturated fatty acids (TPFA), total mono-saturated fatty acids (TMFA) and total saturated fatty acids (TSFA) are taken into account. Ex perts have classified TPFA and TMFA as good fats and TSFA as bad fat. Safflower oil contains the highest TMFA content (76.78%) among all oils analysed. It has a TMFA content of 14.04 per cent and a very low level (9.19 per cent) of TSFA. The higher the content of TPFA and TMFA, the better the quality of the oil from the health perspective. The lower the content of saturated fat, the healthier the oil. Safflower oil passes all these parameters. The second best oil is the sunflower oil, followed by mustard oil and soya bean oil. The popular rice bran oil stands at the eighth position while the all-time favourite ghee at the 11th position. Vanaspati and coconut oil occupy the lowest 12th and 13th slots based on their good and bad fat content.The World Health Organisation (WHO) warns that the ""risk of developing non-communicable diseases can be lowered by reducing saturated fats to less than 10 per cent of total energy intake."

When Iraqi forces retook Mosul University earlier this month, they found chemistry labs they believed had been converted into makeshift chemical weapons labs.Iraqi special forces Brig. Gen. Haider Fadhil said French officials tested the Mosul chemical this week and confirmed it was a mustard agent.The number of casualties due to IS chemical weapons is a small fraction compared to the hundreds of civilians killed in car and suicide bombings carried out by the group.Experts say that is largely due to the low grade of the weapons and the groups lack of access to efficient delivery systems.The types of rockets found at the site suggest the IS was attempting to weaponise the chemical agent, Brig.

Initially, the transplantation process had slowed down in the district due to severe cold, which affected the growth of the seedlings.As per reports, paddy seedlings have been transplanted in 4,687 hectares of land till January 27 against the target of 14,635 hectares for the current rabi season. Generally, paddy transplantation picks up from the first week of January during rabi season. But, stunted growth of the seedlings led farmers to put the transplantation on hold and wait for the sapling to attain the right size. However, the transplantation has gained momentum from the third week of January after the seedlings gained right growth.Umesh Mishra, a farmer of Satupali village under Dhankauda block, said, The severe cold badly affected the growth of paddy seedlings. But as temperature rose, the seedlings attained maturity for transplantation. Though every year he starts paddy transplantation in the first week of January, this season he did it from January 20, he added.District Agricultural Strategy Committee (DASC) has set a target to cultivate paddy in 14,635 hectares with a production target of 87,810 tonne during the rabi season.

In a free-wheeling chat with fashion designer Shilpa Reddy at an event here on Monday, Ms. Padma Lakshmi opened her heart to reveal a little of what inspired her latest book Love, Loss, and What We Ate: A Memoir .Though initially intended to be a guide to healthy eating, the book ended up being autobiographical due to continuous harking back to associated memories. For instance, she had modelled her kitchen after her grannys at Chennai, because the flavours of Mustard and Kadi Patta are hard to find where she stayed in the U.S.A. Though moving to the U.S. along with her mother, Padma Lakshmi has distinct memories of visiting her grandparents house at Chennai every year, after journeying solo for over 20 hours.I am a super taster since childhood, she says. She would climb up the shelves in search of pickles, forcing her grandmother finally to lock the kitchen.Modelling did help with her future career as food critic. Wherever she went on modelling assignments, she made sure that she tasted the street food there, while other colleagues went shopping. Her first advice to young persons would be to travel and explore the world as much as possible. You cannot control what happens to you, but you can control how you react to what happens to you, she says.The book also mentions the darker side of her life, the child sexual abuse she faced, and her Endometriosis which remained untreated till her 30s, as she had been made to believe that being woman was wrought with pain.Racism was felt at US, but it did not bother her as much as the colour prejudice back in India. I want Fair & Lovely to go out of business, she says to peals of laughter from the audience mostly comprising women from FICCI Ladies Organisation, one among the organisers of the event, apart from US Consulate, Harper Collins and Taj Krishna. Writing this book is the most gratifying thing in life for her, after her motherhood.So long, I had no control on what was being said about me in media, she says, indicating that it will not be so any more after the book."

If all goes well, commercial production of apples could begin in four to five years.We are making further studies on the varieties that are suitable for the region. The outcome of these studies is expected in a couple of years, Chief Scientist of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, Ramesh Aggarwal said during his recent visit to the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) at Chintapalli in the Agency area of the district.Low chilling varieties of apple saplings  Anna, Michael and Selection  were planted at RARS, Chintapalli, in 2014 and now (after two years), the results have shown that the average number of fruits per tree was 35 and average weight of each fruit was 53 gm, Associate Director of Research, RARS, G. Jogi Naidu, told The Hindu .We had again planted new varieties  Apple A mark creeper, Apple Bilaspur and Nonisalan  in August 2016 and we are expecting good results. The CCMB has distributed around 5,000 saplings to 100 tribal farmers in 2014 for cultivation on their farms in the Agency, and again around 15,000 saplings were distributed to the farmers in the district recently, he said.The results have shown that the fruit has a sweet/sour taste and the size small. The average yield per tree is between 30 and 40 fruits. We have procured low chilling varieties from CCMB recently, says Mr. Naidu.The overall average minimum temperatures in the Agency areas of Visakhapatnam district will be in the range of 4 to 17 degrees Celsius during the winter months every year. The RARS is also growing wheat from Indore and white rajma (Kanpur variety), chick pea, barley and oats on its premises on an experimental basis, and they have shown encouraging results, the RARS Associate Director said.We are also growing 11 different varieties of mustard and the experiments have shown very good results. The plant height, pods and branches are good, and we are expecting good yield. We are also growing linseed and niger, Scientist G.

Be it her struggle with the chronic pain of endometriosis, the controversial details of her relationships with Salman Rushdie, or theendearing moments with her daughter Krishna Thea, her earthy qualities make her one of the most relatable pop culture icons ever. She discussed in detail, the stories from her life  of love and loss and what she ate.Pickles for PadmaMy love for food was born in India, where I spent first four years of my life and many summers afterwards, Lakshmi once said in her memoir. During the talk with the host and homegrown designer Shilpa Reddy at Taj Krishna, she harked back to a similar sentiment as she said, There is nothing that reminds me of home faster than the smell of frying mustard seeds and curry patta. The mistress of spices reminisced with a broad grin,I would always climb my grandmothers pantry for the pickle jars that they kept on top of the shelves, away from my reach.Body beautifulThe Top Chef host and the co-founder of Endometriosis Foundation of America will surely go down in history as one of the champions of the causes of body positivity who never shied away from talking about chronic pain, dealing with it and coming to terms with ones body beautifully. During the conversation, she touched upon this subject to drive home the point that straightjacket beauty norms need to be quashed. The female body is one of the most beautiful creations of nature, she affirmed during her chat with Reddy and we agree. The diva has always flaunted her seven-inch long beautiful scar on her arm which is a result of a car crash that she suffered as an adolescent. Also, a vocal spokesperson against colour prejudice, she states, Whats wonderful about Indian race is the diversity  there are people with fair skin and straight hair and there are those with gorgeous dark skin and with Afro. When I took the plane from Mumbai to come to Hyderabad, I was happy to see voluptuous women on billboards wearing glittering sarees  they looked beautiful. She added firmly albeit humorously that I want the darn fairness creams to go out of business. Later, in a brief tte--tte with us, when we asked her what women should do to combat the changes in the body and embrace themselves, she said, Start looking after yourself, eating healthy, going to the gym, working out, improving the appearance of your skin andassured the rest will fall into place.Home and the worldAlthough the Indian-born American said she missed out on the shared history or understanding of Indian popular culture unlike those who have grown up in this country, she admits she feels at home here. I had no idea who the Bollywood stars are and am terrible at Antakshari. But now I realise that I am a combination of both the worlds, said Lakshmi. She seemed quite at home in Hyderabad even as she chatted about some of the most private bits of her life and in turn making those listening to her feel at home as well. She interacted with those who came up to her to talk about how much they loved and related to her writing.For sisterhoods sakeThe staunch feminist that Lakshmi is, this vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton, talked about the need to carrying on with dissent in the wake of her defeat. She said she wants her daughter, Krishna Thea Lakshmi-Dell to inculcate the values of feminism in the most natural way possible. For her the personal is political, thats why she mentioned taking her daughter to protest marches seem natural as well. Speaking about the episode of child sexual abuse she faced, Lakshmi mentioned that she felt the need to talk about it as A large number of young girls and boys suffer from it, and added that the process of writing her memoir wasnt always an easy one: There were days when I would sit in my office, write and feel the tears streaming down my face.The talk was hosted at Taj Krishna in association with US Consulate Hyderabad, FICCI FLO and HarperCollins India"
58f5f432a3d24b0b70c26744,BJP on charm offensive to win Jats over,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/BJP-on-charm-offensive-to-win-Jats-over/article17280539.ece,2017-02-10,"As the countdown to the first phase of the Uttar Pradesh elections on February 11 begins, the most striking development that has emerged through the campaign is the revolt of the Jats against the Bharatiya Janata Party. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2014, this dominant community  swept away by communal frenzy following the Muzaffarnagar riots of 2013  had played a critical role in the BJPs stunning electoral victory.Today, two-and-a-half years later, vestiges of hatred lurk beneath the picturesque sugarcane and mustard fields of western U.P. that turn the landscape green and gold in this season. But passions have cooled and the Jats have had time to think. Angered by the BJP-led governments failure to grant the community reservation and devastated by demonetisation, they are now repenting deserting the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) and the family of their hero, Chaudhury Charan Singh.Failed effortsJats are so incensed that last Tuesday, BJP president Amit Shah was compelled to call a meeting of community leaders at the residence of Union Minister Chaudhury Birender Singh, a Jat leader from neighbouring Haryana. But the dinner diplomacy failed to pacify the guests. A day later, another BJP Jat leader and Union Minister of State and MP from Muzaffarnagar, Sanjiv Balyan, was asked to engage the community in Meerut. Reports suggest this effort, too, was unsuccessful.Pushpinder Choudhury, who heads the politically unaffiliated Jat Aarakshan Sangharsh Samiti, says this development means that the RLD is back in business. Jats will vote tactically to defeat the BJP. They will vote not just for Jat candidates or RLD candidates but also for whoever can defeat the BJP, he told The Hindu.That may be an exaggerated claim as a small section of Jats, especially those affiliated to the BJP, younger men in particular, will remain with the party. Reports coming in from western U.P. say the BJP  and organisations affiliated to the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS)  have, in the closing days of the campaign, attempted to reintroduce emotive Hindutva issues relating to the theft of cattle and molestation of Hindu girls. The promise to form anti-Romeo squads (another name for the love jihad campaign) is officially in the manifesto. As one farmer leader put, Once the official campaigning closes, electioneering will continue on WhatsApp and Facebook.Onkar Singh, an RSS functionary from the Dharam Jagran Samanway in Muzaffarnagar, told The Hindu : Its a straight contest between the SP-Congress combine and the BJP. But once people start seeing the long lines of Muslims, the Hindus will all vote BJP.RLD factorConversations with members of all political parties in the fray suggest that the RLD could win anything between four and nine of the 73 seats, spread across 15 districts, going to the polls on February 11. But the fact that the party is now a player means that it will be a four-way contest  the Samajwadi Party (SP)-Congress combine, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), the BJP and the RLD  making the outcome that much harder to predict.Clear choiceAnother significant community in this part of the State, the Muslims, are squarely behind the SP-Congress combine, as the two parties are most likely to provide them security, something they currently prize above development. The alliance, too, has given the SP a boost, with joint rallies in the region receiving rapturous receptions.Muslims will, however, vote for the BSP wherever the alliance candidate is weak. This could place the latter party in a position of advantage in some seats, as the Dalit votes are sizeable here.The BJP will clearly do better than it did in 2012 when it won just 11 of these 73 seats, but it appears unlikely to be anywhere comparable to their performance in 2014, when they won two-thirds of the Assembly segments in the Lok Sabha seats here. The BJP, SP-Congress and BSP sources all claim they are leading in the first phase, but political observers agree that it will be a direct fight between the BJP and the SP-Congress combine, with the BSP at No. 3.The RLD has a fighting chance in four to nine seats in the first phase of the polls on February 11"

I had different kinds of Indian food but some of the foods I tasted in Odisha are very unique like the powder (badi chura), and shrimp (Chingudi checha) and fish with mustard gravy, I never had.

It would be a great opportunity if I could make a film on Odia food,"" said Grace Lee.Her film Off the Menu is a road trip into the kitchens, factories, temples and farms of Asia Pacific America that explored how our relationship to food reflects our evolving community.""You can't disconnect culture with food. Since my film takes place in United Sates and essentially about Asian immigrant community there is a longing for their favourite taste they might have lost being in a different country. Food helped connect us Asians in America,"" Lee said.Lee said she is 'nervous' and 'disturbed' over Trump's immigration policy. ""It's very disturbing to me. My parents are immigrants and I live in an immigrant community. To me it's not what the America I understand stands for. It's not I value and not lots of people I know value. America founded on freedom of religion and freedom of expression. It's completely upended all these things.

5904677d7be9e04154df66b7,Leafing through a salad book,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/leafing-through-a-salad-book/,2017-02-13,"On a cold blistery day in Delhi, my nieces 2-year-old son is entertaining himself by looking at pictures in my salad book and identifying the vegetables. About nine thousand miles away in USA, my 22-year-old son has come up trumps after poring over my salad book and zeroing in on the salad for his next meal.The two boys are a generation and many continents apart and yet, this innocuous salad book is their constant tasteful companion, albeit for different reasons. The toddlers mother has bought him a whole slew of baby books featuring fruits and veggies but the little guy invariably picks up my salad book from his moms kitchen and sits down for his daily erudition. My older son, The Health Nut, while living the dolce vida in The Big Apple, is very conscious of his calorie intake like a lot of his generation and hence the salad book is whipped out every now and then.Gone are the days when salads were looked upon as slightly better than a bitter pill to swallow. No one ever tossed a salad for a midday meal or sat in front of the TV with a big bowl of healthy luscious leaves and veggies. And no one thought of salads as comfort foods!The current generation is different. Weaned on a diet of political correctness and nutritional knowledge, they are not comfortable with the ghee-cures-all attitude of the older generations. Salads have made their way into their lexicon along with words like YOLO and hashtag.With the temperature dipping in many parts of the country, when someone mentions comfort food, a lot of young gourmands think beyond steaming hot bowls of soup or mac-&-cheese. While a salad a few years back was not considered comfort food material, times are changing. A big dinner-size salad packed with winter fruits and veggies and delicious toppings can help fuel you through chilly, foggy days. Better still, it can do so without making you feel sluggish and weighed down.With the festive season almost over and done with, February is a time to enjoy the bounty of winter foods and markets filled with colorful winter produce. I love browsing the aisles of the supermarket looking at all the vibrant racks of fresh produce. The brilliance of the malta orange, the plumpness of scarlet strawberries, dewy fresh local berries, and verdant dark greens jostle in a cacophony of color on the grocery shelves. Light summer herbs are replaced by collards, mustard greens, spinach, brussel sprouts and my personal favorite, kale.The chill in winter means that there is a craving for food that is filling. For salad eaters like me, this means changing the typical salad to include hearty grains, bright citrus fruits, nuts, root vegetables and hardy winter greens.So here I am on a Saturday morning at our local supermarket trying to pick out the freshest veggies and fruits for a salad for dinner. On the menu tonight are quiches: a sundried tomato black olive quiche and a bacon quiche. I think a fruity salad would go well with the quiches. The malta oranges call out to me with their flaming bright colors. I pick up some green olives and red onions, a block of spicy pepper gouda cheese and I am all set for my familys favorite Triple-O salad (recipe below).To me, the Triple-O salad is an ideal winter salad. It is light and yet has the depth of flavor with its seasonal notes to stand up to hearty winter dishes. Its simple to make with its three to four ingredients, and can be varied based on your preferences or what you have at home.Just before I wind up my shopping, I pick up a bunch of luscious strawberries and a packet of baby spinach. This along with some pasta and stone-ground bread will make for a lovely lunch tomorrow.Back home, as I am walking in, my son calls in from NYC. Hey mom, I have chicken leftovers. Can you suggest a quick salad? I look at the oranges peeking out of my grocery bag, think about the plummeting temperatures in US and decide its time to have a Triple-O date in two cities. Take down this salad, I say to him crisply, as I start unpacking my groceries.TRIPLE-O SALAD:Ingredients:Green or black Olives: 12  15 (pitted)Red onion: 1 small , sliced into thin ringsOranges: 2 large, cut into  inch slices or sectionsCheese : any pepper or spicy cheese (optional)Dressing:1 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1-2 lemonsSalt and pepper (to taste)Method: Start by peeling the oranges, removing the seeds and cutting into neat slices and set aside. Cut the onion into thin onion rings. A trick I learnt a few years ago was to dunk the onions into boiling water for about 10-15 seconds, removing them and rinsing under cold water. This removes the pungency of the onion. Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Place the oranges in a plate, add the olives and red onions, and dribble the dressing on the top. You can add the cheese to the salad from the top or arrange it like I do, around the salad edges."

Over 120 armed cops with the help of a drone are trying to trace the whereabouts of the animal.The armed cops positioned themselves on the roof tops of village houses and also cordoned off the village to ensure so that animal could not attack another person. ""Especially trained snipers of the quick reaction times (QRT) have been asked to immediately shoot down the animal,"" a senior official told TOI.Since late Sunday night, over 120 personnel, including forest guards, are carrying out intense search operations to hunt down the animal. The forest department on Monday also placed baits at three different places in the area in order to catch the animal that has put the lives of several animals in the area in danger.""A separate team was sent to the same area where the animal mauled down a woman to death. We suspect that animal is lurking around jungles near the STR,"" an official said. A separate division of Rajasthan Armed Constabulary (RAC) was also dispatched to the area.""The animal was last spotted near the same place where it killed Ram Kumar Meena . After that, we haven't spotted the animal again anywhere near the town,"" the official said.While the cops are keeping an eye on the jungle through the drone, the villagers are still in fear and have refused to step-out of the house fearing another leopard attack.

""Food is a direct way to show our care,"" said the Chennai-born model who spent the day at MOP Vaishnav College answering students' questions.She also emphasised that everybody should have the ability to feed themselves properly. ""It is a life skill. Just like how you learn to brush your teeth, make your bed, or do your laundry, you should be able to make yourself a handful of nutritious meals. I think that's a skill we as parents should introduce to our sons and daughters. It is a good skill to have. It doesn't matter who in the house does it,"" she said.She was also quick to point out an existing disconnect in the professional sphere. ""If people feel that cooking is a woman's job, then shouldn't women be executive chefs and owning those restaurants? There is a real disconnect there,"" she added.When students asked if there was anything more Padma wanted after all her accomplishments, quick came the response, ""I want a woman president in America."" Elaborating, Padma said that the fastest path to parity and equality in genders in any culture is to put more women in positions of power and legislative bodies.""Each of us has very special and interesting stories. Remembering these stories not only makes us happier but also brings us closer together as a society, something that is on top of my mind as an American voter right now,"" she added.Padma also had a message for students on Valentine's Day: ""Don't be happy just because someone loves you.

58ff2ded7be9e04136163447,Will note ban  decide UP polls?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/596742/will-note-ban-decide-up.html,2017-02-16,"Will note ban decide UP polls?By Geeta Pandey, Feb 17, 2017, 23:25 ISTIn November last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi stunned the country by announcing that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes were as good as garbage. Despite his insistence that the ban was meant to curb black money and put terrorists out of business, many analysts said it was motivated by politics rather than economics, and done with an eye on the Uttar Pradesh (UP) elections.Since the rise of the regional Samajwadi Party (SP) and Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the late 1990s, national parties  the Congress and the BJP  have been often relegated to third and fourth positions in the state. This time around, the Congress has joined the governing SP as a junior partner in an alliance, and the BJP is making an all out effort to win back the state.In the past few days, Ive travelled through several districts in the state to ask people if the currency ban or notebandi (Hindi for stopping of notes) here - is an election issue.The notebandi has without doubt touched every life, in the big cities, smaller towns and tiny villages, and everyone talks about the problems theyve faced. But will it impact the way people vote? In the main market in Barabanki town, not far from the state capital, Lucknow, the trading community is seething at the BJPs betrayal.Traders have traditionally supported the BJP, and in the past they have also contributed generously to party funds. But this time, they tell me they will not vote for the party. Notebandi is the biggest issue here, says Santosh Kumar Gupta, who along with his brothers, runs the family hardware store. The public has been really hassled. The government set limits on withdrawals and even those little amounts were unavailable because banks had no money.Gupta points out that in his address to the nation, the prime minister said the government had been planning for it for six months and that people would face minor problems.But there were lots of problems. Isnt he ashamed of lying? he asks angrily. Police used sticks to beat up people waiting in queues to withdraw their own hard-earned money. All small manufacturing units in Barabanki shut down for weeks. Thousands became unemployed.Theres a labour market a few metres from our shop and every morning, nearly 500 daily wage labourers from the nearby villages would gather to look for work, but for the first time, we saw there were no takers for them. His brother Manoj Kumar Jaiswal adds: Traders are very angry with Modi. He first said it was done to curb black money.Then he said it was done to promote digital economy. You can use credit cards and (popular mobile wallet) Paytm in cities like Delhi and Mumbai, not in Barabanki. People here are illiterate, many dont have bank accounts or credit cards. The Gupta family has 10 voters and not one will opt for the BJP.In Gosaiganj, on the outskirts of Lucknow, I stop to talk to people gathered at a tea stall. Raja Ram Rawat, a 60-year-old widower, lives with his two sons and four grandchildren. The small plot of land he owns is not sufficient to support the family and his sons work as daily wagers to supplement the family income. Since November 8, theyve not been able to find work even for one day, he says. I ask him how they are managing. Earlier if we bought two kilograms of vegetables, now we buy only one. Thats how we are managing.A farmer in the group, Kallu Prasad, compares the ban to poison for his community - it came just as the rice crop had been harvested and the sowing season had begun for wheat, mustard and potatoes. Normally we sell a kilo of rice for Rs 14, but this time we had to sell it for Rs 8 or Rs 9. We couldnt buy seeds and pesticides in time. Farmers who grew vegetables were the worst affected. Since people had no money to buy vegetables, they had to just throw them away.In the holy city of Varanasi, walking through the narrow lanes of Lallapura area, where homes sit cheek by jowl, one cannot escape the noise of the looms. Here, every home is a tiny factory where weavers work in semi-darkened rooms, using coloured silk threads to create beautiful patterns. Varanasi is famous for its hand woven silk and cotton saris and nearly a million people make their living from this cottage industry here.It was like we were hit by a bolt of lightning, says factory owner Sardar Mohd Hasim, describing the moment of Modis announcement. Hasim, who represents 30,000 weavers, says initially about 90% of the industry was affected since all their transactions happen in cash.Looms still shutWe had no cash to buy raw materials, we had no cash to pay wages to the workers. Nearly three months later, all my 24 looms are still shut. Most of my weavers are doing other jobs to earn a living.Varanasi has eight assembly constituencies, and Hasim insists that BJP will not win even one. Why would anyone now vote for Modi? he asks. One of his former workers, 40-year-old Mangru Prajapati, who is now back to work in Hasims brothers loom, agrees. Hes the sole breadwinner for his family of eight.Rajan Behal, trader and leader of the organisation that represents traders, weavers and sellers, calls it a major disaster. The ban, he says, couldnt have come at a worse time - November to February is the wedding season when sales peak, but this year its been a wipe-out. A long-time BJP supporter, Behal refuses to say who he will vote for but predicts that Modi will not win enough seats to be able to form a government in the state.Its an assessment challenged by senior BJP leader in the state Vijay Pathak, who pegs the partys chances of winning at 101%. He says that there were difficulties in the implementation of the currency ban, but insists that they have been able to convince the voters that it was done in the nations interest. We started our campaign with the aim to win more than 265 of the 403 seats. Now we believe we will cross 300.That, he says, is because people have faith in the man whos taking the decisions - the prime minister. On this count, hes right - Modis personal stock remains high, especially with the youth. In Kukha Rampur village in Tiloi constituency in Amethi district, 21-year-old Tanu Maurya says she will vote for Modi because he is doing good work and that the note ban was a good decision even if it caused some hardships in the short term.Since his sweep of the 2014 general election, Modi has not had much luck in state elections and hes desperate to reverse that losing trend. A victory in the politically key state of Uttar Pradesh would be a huge shot in the arm for Modi and his party.But will the rupee ban help him or hurt his chances? When the votes are counted on March 11, we will know whether it was a masterstroke or a miscalculation.International New York Times"

The forest department has issued shoot-at-sight orders and pressed over 150 personnel into action, apart from dog squads, a drone and 20 trap cameras. Rakesh Meena (left), a member of the youth committee in Silibavdi, where two of the four victims were killed, has been helping forest officials and reassuring residentsWhat is the situation in the villages near the Sariska forest area?About 20 villages in the area are affected and the residents are terrified. In the Silibavdi gram panchayat area (Thanagazi block), no one ventures outside after sunset. Shops shut early too. The daily power cut between 7 pm and 8.30 pm has made matters worse. Officials have told us that the panther is most active at night.Have such attacks happened in the past?Two people were killed last year, following which officials caught two panthers in November 2016. It was all fine the last two months but now We heard that the panthers caught last year were relocated in our region. (Officials say the panthers were relocated about 40 km away from the villages).What are the villagers doing to protect themselves?No one owns a gun here, all we have are sticks and we keep them with us all the time. When we go to work in our fields  I grow mustard and wheat  we step out in groups of 5-7 armed with lathis. Also, 30 per cent of the homes here are kuchcha and people living in them are the most scared. One of the victims was dragged out of her house by the panther. Unlike cities, there are no high walls in villages it is all open.The government says it has taken several steps to catch the panther.I dont think they are enough. Shanti Devi was attacked by the panther on the morning of February 12, but forest and police officials took several hours to reach the spot. The villagers were very angry, someone even hurled a stone at the head constable of the Quick Response Team. The same evening 55-year-old Ram Kanvar Meena was mauled to death. I hope the panther is caught soon. We have been having sleepless nights, and everyone is scared for their lives.What about the panchayat, has it done anything?Several youth committees, with five members each, have been formed, and I am a part of one of them. We have been asked to help forest officials and allay the fears of the villagers. We have been visiting homes, asking villagers to maintain calm, but most of them lose their cool and tell us to find the panther instead of conducting such drivesFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We have the starchier and blander versions but in other countries there are the more pungent recipes from vegetables, beans and greens. They are known to contribute to the gut-health and many people live by them. Hot and biting, these foods can serve well as substitutes for the highly-salted pickles. They can be served as sides or appetisers.Kimchi (Korea)This is mostly made of cabbage, which has to be left to ferment for a week. The chopped leaves are mixed with fish sauce, scallions and garlic and kept in a cool air-tight container. You may need to lose the cap once in a while to let the gases that form escape. Kimchi can be used as a sauce for other veg and seafood preparations. You can get it in Korean and Chinese restaurants such as Hae Kum Gang in Ashok Nagar, Arirang in Kamanahalli and Shiro in UB City.Gundruk (Nepal)Greens such as leaves of either mustard or raddish are shredded and left in earthenware containers. The blackish mushy gundruk is served as a side dish, an appetiser and even mixed with soups. To prepare as soup, the leaves are friend along with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and the usual Indian spices like turmeric. You could try it at Bameys Resto Cafe in Kormangala.Kombucha (Japan)It is a fermented tea drink and made using SCOBY, which is symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast. This is a mildly sweet drink with a bit of fizz. There is a miniscule percentage (single digit) of alcohol and unless you glug down many litres of it, you wont get a high. This drink is credited with curing everything from diabetes and depression to AIDs and cancer, but these claims are unproven. Get it at Adi Naturals in JP Nagar, Era Organics in Sanjaynagar or Green Channel in Ali Asker Road.Sauerkraut (China, Russia)This is a blander form of pickled cabbage made with carroway seeds and salt. Few people put onion too with this mixture, but this depends on how strong you would like the flavour to be. This is recommended for the lactose-intolerant to get their dose of good bacteria for gut health. Served at Soo Ra Sang, behind Leela Palace.Natto (Japan)It is made from soybeans. This is strong smelling and was earlier made by storing the beans in a haystack. The method of preparation has changed and these are now mass-produced, available in tin cans like baked beans. This is said to be high in fiber, Vitamin K and C and minerals. Nato is cooked with soya sauce and served with boiled rice. Available at Harima on Residency Road."

Lalu said people were confused because of Modi's statements. ""Prime Minister Modi should reveal who is his father is,"" Lalu said on the sidelines of a function at Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS) in Patna today. Addressing an election rally in Hardoi, Uttar Pradesh, on Thursday, Modi had that while Lord Krishna was born in Uttar Pradesh and had made Gujarat his "" karmabhoomi"", he himself was born in Gujarat and had been adopted by Uttar Pradesh. He went on to say that being an adopted son of Uttar Pradesh, he would not ditch his mai-baap (mother and father). Lalu had earlier attacked the Prime Minister saying he finds some or the other link with whichever state is going for polls. ""I really find it funny that whenever there are elections, the Prime Minister finds some relation with that state. Only recently he called himself the blood son of Punjab,"" Lalu had said. During the 2015 Assembly elections, too, Lalu had used derogatory language against Modi, calling him a "" brahma pishach (powerful demon spirit)"". He had said he would use the smoke of yellow mustard and chilly to throw such elements out of Bihar. Referring to BJP national president Amit Shah and Modi, Lalu said a black pigeon needs to be sacrificed and liquor poured to get rid of people like "" narbhakshi (man-eater) Amit Shah and brahma pishach Narendra Modi"". Lalu recently returned after addressing three public rallies in Uttar Pradesh. His second round of campaigning there is from February 26. He was campaigning in western Uttar Pradesh and would now visit a few constituencies in the eastern part of the state. Even his younger son and deputy chief minister Tejashwi Prasad ridiculed Modi on his adopted son comment, saying he had made elections a big joke. ""Modi ji said he is the adopted son of Uttar Pradesh. Earlier he used to say that Ganga maiya is calling him. It sounds like joke,"" Tejashwi said during a visit to Chhapra to file RJD candidates' nomination paper for the Council polls. ""I must tell you that Ganga maiya will now punish him for his false promises. He has been telling utter lies in his the election rallies."" No Grand Alliance (JDU, RJD or Congress) leader was ready to comment on Lalu's derogatory remarks against the Prime Minister. JDU MLC and spokesperson Neeraj Kumar avoided reacting to Lalu's comment but attacked the Prime Minister on the adoption issue. ""The Prime Minister's track record with the word 'adopted' has always evoked suspicion. His plan to adopt villages in parliamentary constituencies was a big failure. He may have made the village he adopted spic and span, but other villages adopted by MPs remain in bad shape."" Senior BJP leader and former deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi sharply reacted to Lalu's comment against the Prime Minister. ""Lalu's politics hinges on abusive language because his DNA is filled with abusive language,"" Sushil said. The word ""DNA"" has returned to Bihar politics after over a year. Modi had attacked chief minister Nitish Kumar's ""political DNA"" during an election rally in Muzaffarpur on July 25, 2015. Lalu grasped the opportunity, taking the pain to explain what Modi implied. ""Do you know what it means? He called him dogla,"" Lalu had said. Dogla, a cuss word, means ""illegitimate""."

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal. We will grow the boro paddy on 200 acres this season, besides sesame on 40 acres and split green gram, black lentil and maize on 20 acres each, said Jayanta Kumar Panrui, the nodal agriculture officer for the Singur project.Read | History books in Bengal to have chapter on Singur movement that led to Nano plants ousterIn order to build confidence among the landowners about the prospect of farming on the plot, nearly half of which had been damaged by industrial construction, the government has taken the entire charge of farming for the first year  from tilling land and supplying seeds and fertilisers to sowing and harvest.Farming resumed in October last year with CM Mamata Banerjee sowing mustard seeds herself. Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though. The land belonging to Suprakash Santra, who spent 21 days behind bars for trying to resist the police from taking possession of his land, is still filled with concrete. Tatas dug a huge pond here. The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."

The five-week long budget session commences on Tuesday and is scheduled to end on March 31. But Congress fears that when sensitive issues are raised against the ruling party, government might not permit House to run for the full session.""This has been strategy of the ruling BJP to run away from the state assembly, simply because Opposition raises issues on the floor of the House,"" said Bala Bachchan , Congress' acting LoP. ""But we will see to it that there is no hindrance in running of the House because we want discussions and debates.""BJP government will be under attack with issues like its claimed party worker Dhruv Saxena's alleged involvement in the ISI spy racket unearthed by the ATS recently.

""Farmers who take these loans from cooperative banks have to return the loan by February 28 instead of the previous March 31 deadline. This new date of February 28 means inconvenience and a lot of struggle for the agrarian community. Wheat, mustard and gram are the major crops of the rabi harvest and end of February is too early for payment. The crops are still standing on the field, not ready for harvest. So, where from will the farmer pay back the loan?""Congress said that distressed farmers will face hardships because a day after the February 28 deadline, the loans have to be repaid at 18% interest.Demonetisation and the mismanagement of implementation is another issue that the Congress will raise. ""There is also a severe fiscal crisis in the state which the government does not admit to. We know that funds from the Union government are constraint and the state despite its continuous efforts is not being able to release money from the Centre for various schemes,"" Bachchan said. ""Demonetisation has added to the financial predicament.""Congress MLAs claimed that their questions on illegal sand mining and Katni hawala scam will not be permitted for discussion.

Emblazoned on ""pure gold"" trophy worth Rs 30 lakh, it shows a racing bull with a tiny cart. Around the rustic stadium are enlarged photos of white bulls charging wildly, their turban-sporting jockeys hanging on. There's just one tiny problem at the ongoing Kila Raipur Sports Festival  there are no real bulls here.Every winter, Kila Raipur, a village around 20km from Ludhiana, hosts a sports festival that's come to be known as the 'Rural Olympics'. But ever since the Supreme Court banned bovines from any sort of sporting activity in May 2014, the dry-fruit-fed speedsters  once the centrepieces of this sporting gala  have been ploughing fields and chewing on the fact that horses now serve as their stunt doubles and take home their share of the prize money.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)On Friday, the first day of the 81st edition of the event at Kila Raipur  a Ludhiana village still warm from selfies with Aamir and Salman who shot films here  it was clear what happens when a star leaves the ecosystem.Instead of lakhs of villagers crammed into the 40,000-seater Grewal stadium, there were only a smattering of onlookers. This, despite the usual roster of colourful contests  a few men held up tractor tyres to win Rs 1,000, a beefy gym owner wearing a Bryan Adams vest lifted dumbells to warn against drug use, and in the dog race, 20-odd imported greyhounds chased a dead rabbit stuffed with cotton down a 400m course.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)In a corner, 60-year-old Charanjeet Singh and his bearded mates, all dressed in pathani suits and festive mojris, cheered like kids for these hounds. Till three years ago, these former bullock-cart jockeys were the ones racing down the same course in a cart drawn by two dust-raising Nagori bulls. ""At that time, you could never find a place to sit,"" said Charanjeet Singh of Bhaini Rora village, pointing to the empty seats.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)This year, in the wake of Tamil Nadu passing an ordinance to allow the bull-taming sport of jallikattu, and the Karnataka assembly passing an amendment bill to legalise kambala, the state's traditional annual buffalo race, the Grewal Sports Association (GSA)  which organises festival  hoped to revive its showpiece event.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)""It is not only our traditional sport but also a poor man's chief source of entertainment,"" said GSA's Jagbir Grewal, adding that the festival started in 1933 as a small annual recreational meet for farmers before it bloated into a tourist magnet. The sight of close to 150 jockeys driving pairs of white-humped bulls down a track brought farmers in droves. But the pleas of the committee members  most of whom are former hockey players  fell on deaf ears.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)""The governor has granted us a meeting but sadly, that's on the day after the event ends,"" said Jagga Singh Grewal, secretary of GSA.The SC order  a response to a petition filed by the government's Animal Welfare Board  said bulls were being ""forced to perform, inflicting pain and suffering"" in sporting events, violating laws relating to the prevention of cruelty to animals. But jockeys and organisers insist that the bulls were treated well.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)Even as the greyhounds were receiving a steady feed of honey, Glucon D and water at one end of the stadium, jockeys recalled that the pre-race diet for bullocks was rich. ""We fed them cashews, almonds, taramira mustard and fruit for energy,"" said Maggar Singh, adding that preparations would begin a month in advance.(Photo courtesy: Kulwant Singh Marrar)""After the race, four men would gently massage each bull,"" said Singh.If the ban isn't revoked, it might kill the breed, feared jockeys, pointing out that the Nagori tribe of Rajasthan that sells the bulls had lost its prime market: Punjab. The horse races, introduced to substitute bullock cart races, are not as popular. ""They bring 60% of the money that the bulls used to,"" said Jagbir Grewal.As she stretched her legs apart on a banner and kissed the ground, a slim, fully-clad athlete from Haryana named Ritu turned heads. One of the few women on the ground, Ritu said she was there for the prize money that would take care of her vegetarian diet that costs Rs 15,000 a month. She explained away the skewed gender ratio at the festival with: ""Local women don't need to pursue sports as many of them are born privileged.""But the more telling revelation came from bullock cart jockey Charanjeet Singh. He sold his bulls two years ago. ""Now, I'm planning to concentrate on greyhounds,"" he said."

Under the ground, the tubers are ready to be harvested as farmer Mahadeb Das uproots a couple to demonstrate.While the potato plants cover about 15 acre right beside where the paint shop stood, about 400 metres away, farmers have just sown seeds of boro paddy near the plot once occupied by the Trim Chassis Final (TCF) plant.Welcome to the former rusty Nano plant in West Bengals Singur that has become one of Indias most famous plots after the Supreme Court ordered the land to be returned to the original owners, setting aside the acquisition by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee government in 2006. Nowhere else in the country is the flip flop between farming, factory and back to farming so dramatically evident than in this land.The yield from the first crops sown in October 2016  mustard, lentil, khesari pulse and potato  makes us confident of good prospects in farming. The land has retained its fertility, said Ganesh Ghosh, 55, a resident of Gopalnagar Purbapara.Read | For Singur farmers, decade-old victory over Tata motors ends in gloomA walk inside the plot packs in a lot of surprises. Patches near the spots where factory sheds of the Nano plant stood till October last year are now lush green.Some plots liberated from the concrete structures  about a hundred acres  are yet to be turned cultivable. While most of the remains from the concrete structures have been removed, the plots are being filled with soil from a nearby riverbed.Nearly 800 acres of land are ready for cultivation and will be covered for irrigation by 56 mini-deep tubewells that are already installed and a check-dam that is being built on a canal. We will grow the boro paddy on 200 acres this season, besides sesame on 40 acres and split green gram, black lentil and maize on 20 acres each, said Jayanta Kumar Panrui, the nodal agriculture officer for the Singur project.Read | History books in Bengal to have chapter on Singur movement that led to Nano plants ousterIn order to build confidence among the landowners about the prospect of farming on the plot, nearly half of which had been damaged by industrial construction, the government has taken the entire charge of farming for the first year  from tilling land and supplying seeds and fertilisers to sowing and harvest.Farming resumed in October last year with CM Mamata Banerjee sowing mustard seeds herself. Over October and November, mustard was grown on 68 acres, potato on 15 acres and red lentil and khesari on 20 acres each. From the first week of February, mustard, lentil and khesari were harvested and the same land is now being used for paddy.Read | Never abandon the battlefield: Mamata Banerjees Singur takeawayNot everyone is equally pleased though. The land belonging to Suprakash Santra, who spent 21 days behind bars for trying to resist the police from taking possession of his land, is still filled with concrete. Tatas dug a huge pond here. The government-employed contractors, however, filled it with concrete slabs. Hundreds of quintals of concrete slabs need to be removed now. When will the land turn cultivable? asked Santra.There are the likes of Dwarik Ghosh, who will not resume farming. I never wanted to farm and had willingly parted with my land. I got both of my daughters enrolled in an engineering college, hoping the plant will create jobs. Now that I have got the land back, Im waiting for a good buyer to sell it off again, Ghosh said."

This facility would be used in developing plants from which higher yield could be secured with less use of water and fertilizers.Singh said ICAR-IARI, Pusa has developed an innovative, eco-friendly and cost-effective wastewater treatment technology through which waste water can be made pollution free and used for irrigation purpose with less than 1% energy and less than 50-60% investment and operational cost.The minister also said that this technology would be effective in checking the shortage of water and pollution of soil, ground water and food due to wastewater in future.Singh highlighted the various schemes launched by the government such as Prime Minister Crop Insurance Scheme, Prime Minister Agricultural Irrigation Scheme, Farm Mechanization Mission, National Agricultural Marketing, Rural Storage Scheme and Soil Health Card Scheme for the growth of farm sector.

A voice wafted across the dusty road and the bright yellow mustard fields on both sides - ""Aapke apne pratyashi, aapke pyare Raja Bhaiyya aap ke beech aa rahe hain (Your very own Raja Bhaiyya is coming to meet you)"" from a loudspeaker atop another SUV in the motorcade piloting the Independent candidate from Kunda assembly constituency of Pratapgarh district.On Monday, just one day before campaigning comes to an end for the fourth phase of the Uttar Pradesh elections, Raghuraj Pratap left the Bhadri Estate in Beti village early with his fleet of cars, snaking its way on the dusty road through the sun-soaked fields.He has won five consecutive Assembly elections from Kunda since he got into electoral politics in 1993 and his victory margin has only spiraled every time. And, the answer to why he could do so is there for all to see.As his fleet drove by, people along the road stopped their work and bent in reverence with folded hands. The cycle repair shop-owner stood up, leaving his work. An old man riding his bicycle, stops it and gets down to bow in reverence. He asked his car to be stopped on the road side where men and women stood in a huddle.As soon as the car pulled up to a halt, men pushed their hands in through the window, touching his feet. The crowd grew and he had to request them to step back so he could open the door.A loud roar of ""Raja bhaiyya ki jai ..."" rent the air as he stepped out. Men and women fell on his feet. There were young boys and girls, who sought his blessing, an old man had an application in hand, another wanted some work done while most cheered him, holding large cardboard cutouts of a saw - his election symbol -- wishing him success as he readied for the polls on Thursday. The ""Raja of Kunda"" folded his hands, raised his arms and accepted their greetings.He then drove off to the neighbouring constituency Babuganj, where another Independent candidate is fighting with his support.In the badlands of eastern Uttar Pradesh, Raja Bhaiyya is also considered a ""bahubali"" dominating the socio-political landscape, though he has not faced any charge in the recent past and has been acquitted in the earlier ones.Raghuraj Pratap's writ runs large in Pratapgarh, where people have been voting him for the last 25 years and revering him as their icon.Every morning, people would throng his palace to seek justice and he would ensure an informal spot justice, people seeking his blessings in even settling petty disputes around land or property. He would call the warring parties and deliver justice that can hardly be challenged.""If there is a case of teasing, people of his constituency prefer to complain to him and he who would call the wayward boy, reprimand him. Police is our second choice in such situations,"" said Radhe Mishra of Kunda Bazaar, adding that he organises marriages of poor girls and performs ""kanya daan"" himself.Is he the Robinhood of Kunda or a good Samaritan? ""They are like my father, mother, daughters and sons.""It is said in Kunda that you would punish an electricity department employee by hanging him upside down if there was power outage in your constituency,"" said TOI. The answer comes in an instant: ""It's of course a myth. And that is not needed. A phone call from me is enough to set things right.""He would ask his car to be stopped every other minute, whenever he found a gathering, waiting for a glimpse of the man whose victory margin has risen from 66,000 to 73,000, 72,000, 82,000 to 88,000 in the last election, turning the elections into a no contest irrespective of the opposition.Raghuraj's aura has remained undiminished despite then UP chief minister Kalyan Singh cracking down on him and describing him as ""Kunda ka goonda"" and then Mayawati slapping POTA on him.But, why has he never ventured out of the state to test political waters in the Delhi?He was offered a seat in the 2004 Lok Sabha elections by the then Samajwadi party chief Mulayam Singh Yadav but he declined and preferred to stay as an Independent MLA.Raghuraj Pratap is not only a heavyweight to the extent of being invincible in Kunda by now for the last 25 years, but in Lucknow too he plays an important role in the formation of the government. It was Raja Bhaiyya who played a key role in rescuing then Kalyan Singh government in 1997 after BSP had withdrawn support from him. He engineered defections in the BSP and Congress to marshal support of required MLAs.When Mayawati became chief minister in 2002, she slapped POTA on him and threw him behind bars for over one-and-a-half year but was later acquitted. It was during his jail term that he had twins but saw them only after 11 months after he was out of bail."

This apart, basic tactical information detailing the obstacles and explosives are explained.Also, there are separate rooms explaining CBRN warfare (Chemical, Biological, Radio-logical and Nuclear) to cadets. A senior OTA official said, Each terrain has its own characteristics and restrictions. The complex is a unique facility providing vital information about them. Very soon, we will be adding a chamber which will expose cadets (who will be wearing protective gear) to mustard and other harmful gases.A Weapon and Equipment Display Area (WEDA) is also being set up on the premises. Along with TATIC, these two new additions would serve to increase the awareness of the cadets. OTA officials said WEDA would also be part of the outsiders outreach programme, which means even the public could visit after getting prior permission from officials."

Patna has been witnessing above-normal temperature for the past four days with the maximum hovering above 30C. This is the highest maximum in the past 10 years in the state capital at this time of the month. Usually in February the daytime temperatures remain around 26C. There is unlikely to be any major relief in the coming days also. Tuesday's maximum temperature was 34.2C, around 7 degrees above normal, making it the highest in the capital since February 29, 2006 when the maximum touched 35.1C. The maximum recorded on Wednesday was 31.2C. Patna Met director Sumendu Sengupta said: ""The sudden rise in temperature is due to absence of any significant weather system and the warm westerlies currently blowing over the state. The increase in temperature is also due to no formation of clouds with the ground receiving maximum radiation."" Temperatures will be on the higher side for the next couple of days and then fall by 2-3 degrees. Even then it will continue to be above normal, Sengupta added. A weatherman said usually January and February are considered winter months and the city should register below 15C as the minimum temperature. But since Sunday, temperatures have risen. While the maximum has been above 30, even the minimum has been settling 4-5 notches above normal, he said, adding that weakening of the western disturbances along with no moisture incursion from the Bay of Bengal area are responsible for the rise in temperatures. The India Meteorological Department on Tuesday said maximum temperatures were markedly above normal (5.1C or more) at most places over Bihar while the minimum too remained above normal (3C to 5C) at many places. Maximum temperatures are expected to range between 31 and 33C till February 28 in Patna while the minimums are predicted to be between 15 and 17C. According to Skymet, in the past 24 hours, the maximum temperatures have increased in most parts of east India, including Bihar, Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha. It further stated that temperatures are expected to witness a further marginal rise as the weather is expected to remain dry and clear. Days are likely to remain warm with bright sunshine while the nights are expected to be comparatively cooler and comfortable, Skymet said in its weather bulletin. ""Fluctuating weather patterns are increasingly establishing themselves in stronger and more formidable ways. At present also, temperatures across most parts of the state are witnessing a rise and the unusual rise in temperatures seems harmful for the crops. Crops like wheat, jowar and mustard are hampered by above-normal temperatures resulting in early ripening of the mustard crop, while wheat and jowar are on the verge of losing their quality,"" said a scientist at Dr Rajendra Prasad Central Agricultural University, Samastipur. According to agriculture experts, if temperatures across these states continue to rise, wheat production may be hampered by 5-10 per cent."

However, Dheeraj Singh, former director of Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research (DRMR) says that using kachchi ghani mustard oil is healthier than other refined oils, as its nutrition value remains intact and is healthy for the body.Singh added that Rajasthan is the largest producer of mustard in India and contributes 50% of the production in the country. In Rajasthan, the maximum amount of mustard oil is extracted using the kachchi ghani process, which refers to cold press extraction of oil from seeds.He said that oil extracted through kachchi ghani process is unrefined oil. Earlier, bullocks used to move in a circular motion and crush oilseed with a the stone roller in a wooden drum to extract oil. Now with automation, steel drum and steel rollers are used, but oilseeds are crushed slowly in the same way as the animals used to do.He was at the five-day International Seminar on Oilseed Brassica (ISOB), which has been organised by the State Institute of Agriculture Management, (SIAM) Jaipur and Indian Council of Agriculture Research -Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research, Bharatpur.Dr Singh said that Dr SC Manchanda, senior consultant in the department of cardiology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, had written an article that was published in Indian Heart Journal in 2016 which mentioned that non-refined mustard oil is the healthiest for Indian cooking.He said mechanical and chemical processes are used to extract and refine oil using solvents and hexane and heated at very high temperature, which affects the quality of oil and it is not healthy for consumption.SIAM director Shital Prasad Sharma said mustard oil has antioxidants, vitamin E, Omega 3 and omega 6 and others. He mentioned that around 11 million tonnes of Palmolein oil is imported in India of which one million tonne is distributed through public distribution system in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and rest of the oil is used for adulteration with other oils.He added that in Rajasthan mustard is grown on30 lakh hectares and the yield is 13 quintals per hectare, whereas in India mustard is sown on 6.5 million hectares and production is 7.9 million tonnes. In Rajasthan, mustard is mostly grown in areas like Sriganganagar, Alwar, Bharatpur and Kota."

It has been producing chemical weapons since the 1980s and is now estimated to have as many as 5,000 tons, according to a biennial South Korean defense white paper. Its stockpile, one of the worlds largest, reportedly has 25 types of agents, including sarin, mustard, tabun and hydrogen cyanide. It also is thought to have nerve agents, such as the VX allegedly used by two women  one Vietnamese and the other Indonesian  to kill the North Korean leaders half brother, Kim Jong Nam. North Korea also has 12-13 types of biological weapons, said Lee Illwoo, a Seoul-based commentator on military issues.

They probably conducted a lot of tests to come up with a perfect amount that would kill Kim Jong Nam, but not harm the assailants or anyone else nearby in a crowded airport, Kim said. Its still unclear how the suspects allegedly handled the VX, but analysts say that North Korea is probably capable of producing VX as a binary agent, where two chemicals that are separately harmless become a nerve agent when mixed together.HEAVY PRODUCTIONNorth Korean leader Kim Jong Un smokes a cigarette as he gives guidance on the development of Ssuk Islet in this undated photo released by North Koreas Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang June 2, 2014.

The announcement raised serious questions about public safety in a building that authorities went 11 days without decontaminating.The substance, deadly even in minute amounts, was detected on Kim's eyes and face, Malaysia's inspector general of police said in a written statement, citing a preliminary analysis from the country's Chemistry Department.""Our preliminary finding of the chemical that caused the death of Kim Chol was VX nerve,"" said Inspector-General of Police Khalid Abu Bakar. Kim Chol is the name on the passport found on the victim, but a Malaysian official previously confirmed he is North Korea leader Kim Jong Un's older half brother.Khalid told reporters that one of the two women accused of wiping the toxin on Kim's face was later sickened and suffered from vomiting. He declined to say which of the women  one Indonesian and one Vietnamese  had gotten sick.Khalid said police were still investigating how the lethal agent entered Malaysia.Police previously said the airport had not been decontaminated. Asked Friday in a text message whether that was still the case, Khalid said, ""We are doing it now."" Details were not immediately clear.Malaysian police also previously no one besides Kim Jong Nam had been sickened.If VX was used, it could have contaminated not only the airport but anyplace else Kim had been, including medical facilities and the ambulance he was transported in. The nerve agent, which has the consistency of motor oil, can take days or even weeks to evaporate.The death of Kim Jong Nam, whose daylight assassination in a crowded airport terminal seems straight out of a spy novel, has unleashed a diplomatic crisis that escalates by the day. With each new twist in the case, international speculation has grown that Pyongyang dispatched a hit squad to Malaysia to kill the exiled older sibling of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un.North Korea has denounced Malaysia's investigation as full of ""holes and contradictions"" and accused the authorities here of being in cahoots with Pyongyang's enemies.According to Malaysian investigators, the two female suspects coated their hands with chemicals and wiped them on Kim's face on Feb. 13 as he waited for a flight home to Macau, where he lived with his family.He sought help from airport staff but he fell into convulsions and died on the way to the hospital within two hours of the attack, police said.The case has perplexed toxicologists, who question how the two women could have walked away unscathed after handling a powerful poison, even if  as Malaysian police say  the women were instructed to wash their hands right after the attack.Dr. Bruce Goldberger, a leading toxicologist who heads the forensic medicine division at the University of Florida, said even a tiny amount of VX nerve agent  equal to a few grains of salt  is capable of killing. It can be administered through the skin, and there is an antidote that can be administered by injection. U.S. medics and military personnel carried kits with them on the battlefield during the Iraq war in case they were exposed to the chemical weapon.""It's a very toxic nerve agent. Very, very toxic,"" he said. ""I'm intrigued that these two alleged assassins suffered no ill effect from exposure to VX. It is possible that both of these women were given the antidote.""He said symptoms from VX would generally occur within seconds or minutes and could last for hours starting with confusion, possible drowsiness, headache, nausea, vomiting, runny nose and watery eyes. Prior to death, there would likely be convulsions, seizures, loss of consciousness and paralysis.VX is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which North Korea never signed. The country is believed by outside experts to have the capacity to produce up to 4,500 metric tons of chemical weapons during a typical year, which it could increase to 12,000 tons per year during a period of crisis. Its current inventory has been estimated at 2,500 to 5,000 tons.It is suspected of being particularly focused on mustard, phosgene, sarin and V-type chemical agents  substances including VX that are designed to poison through contact and remain lethal for long periods of time. The North's development of such agents has been of special concern because of fears it might try to put them in artillery shells for an attack on South Korea's capital, potentially threatening the lives of millions.Joseph Bermudez, a well-known North Korea analyst, wrote an article for the respected 38 North website in 2013 that said the North is capable of not only employing ""significant quantities and varieties of chemical weapons"" across the Korean Peninsula but also using those weapons worldwide ""using unconventional methods of delivery.""He also said there is a ""growing body of evidence"" indicating the North has shared chemical weapons capabilities with Syria, Iran and others.Malaysia has three people in custody in connection with Kim Jong Nam's death, including the two suspected attackers. Authorities are also seeking several other people, including the second secretary of North Korea's embassy in Kuala Lumpur and an employee of North Korea's state-owned airline, Air Koryo.The case has marked a serious turnaround in relations between Malaysia and North Korea. While Malaysia isn't one of Pyongyang's key diplomatic partners, it is one of the few places in the world where North Koreans can travel without a visa. As a result, for years, it's been a quiet destination for Northerners looking for jobs, schools and business deals."

(File Photo)The credibility of the United Nations Security Council is at stake as it meets to discuss possible sanctions against Syria for the use of chemical weapons against civilians, the head of the French mission to the United Nations said on Friday. If the Security Council is not able to unite on such a vital, literally, vital question of proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction against civilian population, then what? said French UN Ambassador Francois Delattre.Watch what else is making news:What is at stake here frankly is the credibility of the Security Council, he told reporters. Delattre said that beyond existing clear evidence that chemical weapons have been used in Syria against civilians, there are converging indications that such weapons continue to be used. On the scale of the threats to peace and security, we are at 10 here, Delattre said. The doing nothing attitude or the talking only attitude are not an option confronted with such a threat.The draft resolution seeks to blacklist 11 Syrian military commanders and officials and 10 government and related entities involved in the development and production of chemical weapons. It calls for an asset freeze and travel ban for the individuals and entities across all UN member states.Two diplomats told Reuters on Thursday it was likely that Russia, the largest international backer of the Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad, would veto the text. US ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said: Weve worked with the UK and France to make sure this resolution comes on board and then well find out which countries have an excuse for chemical weapons and which ones are really going to say this is a problem.A joint inquiry by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) found that Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas, according to reports seen by Reuters last year. Assads government has denied its forces have used chemical weapons.The UN vote could coincide with talks between representatives of Assads government and his opponents with UN mediator Staffan de Mistura, which started on Thursday in Geneva. Delattre said he saw no contradiction in raising the subject of sanctions on Syria as the Geneva talks were being held. The nearly six-year-long conflict in Syria has killed at least 300,000 people and displaced millions, according to groups that monitor the war.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The people she met during her travels across India, her loved ones, and her own perception of the masks she dons as part of life come alive on her works.Perhaps her skills as a writer and poet have spilled on to canvases, where each person strikes the viewer as a character from a story that begs to be narrated.

Doan Thi Huong worked at an entertainment outlet and was arrested with an Indonesian woman, according to the police. (AFP) Kuala Lumpur, Feb. 24: The poison used to kill Kim Jong Nam, the half brother of the North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, was VX nerve agent, which is listed as a chemical weapon, the Malaysian police announced today. In a brief statement, Khalid Abu Bakar, the national police chief, said the substance was listed as a chemical weapon under the Chemical Weapons Conventions of 1997 and 2005, to which North Korea is not a party. South Korea has suggested that the killing was the work of the North Korean government. The revelation that a banned weapon was used in such a high-profile killing raises the stakes over how Malaysia and the international community will respond. VX nerve agent can be delivered in two compounds that are mixed at the last moment to create a lethal dose. The police say that two women approached Kim at the airport with the poison on their hands and rubbed it on his face one after the other. Samples were taken from Kim's skin and eyes. The poison was identified in a preliminary analysis by the Centre for Chemical Weapons Analysis of the chemistry department of Malaysia, Khalid said. The Chemical Weapons Convention bans the use and stockpiling of chemical weapons, and North Korea is among the world's largest possessors of such weapons. In 2014, the South Korean defence ministry said the North had stockpiled 2,500 to 5,000 tons of chemical weapons and had a capacity to produce a variety of biological weapons. (The North has conducted five nuclear tests since 2006.) VX is part of a family of nerve agents created decades ago during research into pesticides. It is tasteless and odourless and kills by causing uncontrollable muscle contractions, which eventually stop the victim from breathing. A dose of about 10mg is enough to kill by skin contact, according to the Federation of American Scientists. Several world powers, including the US and the former Soviet Union, once had large stockpiles of the nerve agent. American stores of VX were destroyed under the Chemical Weapons Convention of 1997, with incineration completed in 2012. In 1994 and 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo used homemade VX to attack three persons, one of whom died. North Korea is estimated to have a chemical weapons production capability of up to 4,500 metric tons during a typical year and 12,000 tons during a period of extended crisis. It is widely reported to possess a large arsenal of chemical weapons, including mustard, phosgene and sarin gas, a US Congressional Research Service report said last year. The announcement by Malaysia's police chief came just a day after North Korea denied any responsibility for Kim's death, accusing the Malaysian authorities of fabricating evidence of Pyongyang's involvement under the influence of South Korea. With the North's reclusive government on the defensive about the February 13 killing of Kim, the estranged half brother of Kim Jong Un, at the airport for the Malaysian capital, Kuala Lumpur, a statement attributed to the North Korean Jurists Committee said the greatest share of responsibility for the death ""rests with the government of Malaysia"" because Kim Jong Nam died there. And in what could be seen as a threat to Malaysia, the statement noted that North Korea is a ""nuclear weapons state"". But in a case that has been filled with mysteries, North Korea still would not acknowledge that the man killed was indeed Kim Jong Nam. And it gave no indication that it would agree to Malaysia's demands to question a senior staff member at the North Korean embassy in Kuala Lumpur in the investigation into Kim's death.

However, Dheeraj Singh, former director of Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research (DRMR) says that using kachchi ghani mustard oil is healthier than other refined oils, as its nutrition value remains intact and is healthy for the body.Singh added that Rajasthan is the largest producer of mustard in India and contributes 50% of the production in the country. In Rajasthan, the maximum amount of mustard oil is extracted using the kachchi ghani process, which refers to cold press extraction of oil from seeds.He said that oil extracted through kachchi ghani process is unrefined oil. Earlier, bullocks used to move in a circular motion and crush oilseed with a the stone roller in a wooden drum to extract oil. Now with automation, steel drum and steel rollers are used, but oilseeds are crushed slowly in the same way as the animals used to do.He was at the five-day International Seminar on Oilseed Brassica (ISOB), which has been organised by the State Institute of Agriculture Management, (SIAM) Jaipur and Indian Council of Agriculture Research -Directorate of Rapeseed-Mustard Research, Bharatpur.Dr Singh said that Dr SC Manchanda, senior consultant in the department of cardiology at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Delhi, had written an article that was published in Indian Heart Journal in 2016 which mentioned that non-refined mustard oil is the healthiest for Indian cooking.He said mechanical and chemical processes are used to extract and refine oil using solvents and hexane and heated at very high temperature, which affects the quality of oil and it is not healthy for consumption.SIAM director Shital Prasad Sharma said mustard oil has antioxidants, vitamin E, Omega 3 and omega 6 and others. He mentioned that around 11 million tonnes of Palmolein oil is imported in India of which one million tonne is distributed through public distribution system in Tamil Nadu and Kerala and rest of the oil is used for adulteration with other oils.He added that in Rajasthan mustard is grown on30 lakh hectares and the yield is 13 quintals per hectare, whereas in India mustard is sown on 6.5 million hectares and production is 7.9 million tonnes. In Rajasthan, mustard is mostly grown in areas like Sriganganagar, Alwar, Bharatpur and Kota."

But Russia is vowing a veto. A Security Council diplomat said Friday night that the vote was requested for next week. The diplomat spoke on condition of anonymity because discussions about the request were private. Britains deputy UN ambassador, Peter Wilson, had said earlier Friday that a vote would come as soon as possible.Britain, France and the United States have been seeking sanctions after an investigation by the United Nations and an international chemical weapons watchdog organization determined last year that the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas in the civil-war-ravaged country. The probe also found the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.President Bashar Assads regime denies using chemical weapons in the war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions since it began in March 2011. Russia, Syrias closest ally, has questioned the investigations conclusions linking chemical weapons use to Syrian government, and Russian deputy ambassador Vladimir Safronkov said Friday that his nation would veto the sanctions measure if it came up for a vote.Its a provocation, he said outside after leaving a closed-door Security Council session about Syria. In a sharp retort, US Ambassador Nikki Haley said the measure needs to happen.How much longer is Russia going to continue to babysit and make excuses for the Syrian regime? she said. People have died by being suffocated to death. Thats barbaric. The remarks were the latest signals that new President Donald Trumps administration aims to confront Russia on some issues, while also expressing interest in improving relations. Earlier this week, Haley reiterated that U.S. sanctions on Russia over its 2014 annexation of Ukraines Crimean Peninsula will continue until the region is returned to Ukraine.Despite the promised Russian veto, backers of the proposed U.N. sanctions see them as a moral and institutional imperative. Previous council resolutions called for measures, under a UN charter chapter that authorizes sanctions, if chemical weapons are used. On the scale of the threats to peace and security, we are at 10 here, French Ambassador Francois Delattre said before Fridays meeting.If the Security Council is not able to unite on such a literally vital question of proliferation and use of weapons of mass destruction against civilian populations, then what? So what is at stake here, frankly, is the credibility of the Security Council, he said. The movement toward a vote is coming at a delicate time. Peace talks began Thursday in Geneva, with the U.N. envoy for Syria casting them as a historic chance to end the conflict.Besides the prohibition on helicopter sales, a draft of the sanctions resolution seen by The Associated Press would impose an asset freeze and travel ban on 11 Syrian people. They include current and former military officers, the managing director of a Ministry of Defense subsidiary and the director-general of Syrias Scientific Studies Research Center, according to the draft. It says the research center was responsible for the development and production of chemical weapons.The asset freeze also would apply to the research center, to eight entities described as its front companies or proxies and to the Ministry of Defense subsidiary. There was no immediate response to an inquiry Friday to the Syrian mission. Syria isnt a Security Council member. The US imposed its own sanctions in January on Syrias military and some officials. A chemical weapons attack on a Damascus suburb killed hundreds of civilians on Aug. 21, 2013, leading to a U.S.-Russian agreement and a Security Council resolution the next month ordering the destruction of Syrias chemical weapons, precursors and the equipment to produce the deadly agents.The Syrian governments support for the resolution and decision to join the chemical weapons watchdog, known as the OPCW, warded off possible US military strikes in response to the attack, which the Syrian regime denied carrying out. Syrias declared stockpile of 1,300 metric tons of chemicals has been destroyed, but the OPCW has continued to investigate outstanding questions about possible undeclared chemical weapons.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The trio are pushing for a vote early next week on the measure that would slap sanctions on 11 Syrians and 10 entities linked to chemical attacks in the nearly six-year war.""I just explained our position very clearly to our partners. If it is tabled, we will veto it,"" Russian Deputy Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov told reporters following a closed-door meeting of the Security Council. Safronkov rejected the measure as ""one-sided"", saying it was based on ""insufficient proof"" and contradicted ""the fundamental principle of presumption of innocence until the investigation is over"".Russia has used its veto six times to shield its Damascus ally from any punitive action by the Security Council.The draft resolution follows a UN-led investigation which concluded in October that the Syrian military had carried out at least three chlorine attacks on opposition-held villages in 2014 and 2015.The joint panel of the United Nations and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) also found that Islamic State jihadists had used mustard gas in an attack in 2015. US Ambassador Nikki Haley said she was not swayed by the Russian arguments. ""How much longer is Russia going to continue to babysit and make excuses for the Syrian regime?"" she said.""People have died by being suffocated to death. That's barbaric."" ""You are either for chemical weapons or you are against it,"" she added.The fresh clash with Russia came as a new round of peace talks in Geneva struggled to get off the ground, with Syrian government and opposition delegations haggling over the format of meetings.The vote expected Monday or Tuesday would mark the first major council action by the new US administration of President Donald Trump, who took office on January 20 seeking warmer ties with Russia. Britain and France had circulated the draft text weeks ago, but held off on action to give the Trump administration time to study it.The vote would see the Trump administration joining old allies France and Britain to confront Russia over its support for Syria."

There's no reason for Pyongyang to risk taking another hit when it's already under heavy international sanctions over its nuclear program. It's also doubtful that the country would be suddenly willing to showcase its chemical weapons as a deterrent when it has never acknowledged their existence, the experts say.For Pyongyang,, who, would have been the clear priority that made any other consideration secondary, said Koh Yu-hwan, a North Korea expert at Seoul's Dongguk University ""They probably picked the deadliest chemical at their disposal because they absolutely didn't want to fail at killing Kim Jong Nam,"" Koh said. ""The fallout of using VX at an international airport could turn out to be significant for the country, but I doubt that the North Koreans thoroughly thought this through.""North Korea has denied involvement in the Feb. 13 attack on Kim Jong Nam at Kuala Lumpur's airport, and also refused to confirm that it was Kim who died. Saying that one of its nationals died from a ""heart stroke,"" North Korea has strongly criticized the investigation by Malaysia, which has been one of its few legitimate diplomatic partners, and made repeated demands for Kim's body.The overwhelming presumption that North Korea's government organized a hit job on Kim only strengthened after Malaysian police announced they found VX on his eyes and face. Analysts say it's almost certain that the highly powerful nerve agent, which scientists say is capable of killing 500 people through skin exposure with an amount weighing as much as just two pennies, would have been sourced from North Korea's state laboratories as its materials are tightly controlled internationally and hard to obtain.South Korea's military believeswith up to 5,000 tons that include sarin, mustard, tabun and hydrogen cyanide, in addition to V-type nerve agents.If North Korea really did use VX to assassinate Kim, it would indicate a new level of sophistication in its. The North Koreans probably needed to conduct many tests before figuring out the precise amount of VX that would kill Kim Jong Nam without harming the assailants or anyone else nearby in one of the world's busiest airports.While some Western analysts have argued through the media that North Korea might have used Kim's assassination to draw attention to its chemical weapons, most South Korean experts doubt it.North Korea, which has been pursuing nuclear weapons as an ultimate deterrent, has little to gain by highlighting its chemical weapons, which would only bring harsher punitive measures and put further pressure on the United States to relist the country as a state sponsor of terrorism, analysts say.""North Korea was already under immense pressure over its efforts to develop nuclear weapons and intercontinental ballistic missiles, and also its human rights issues. Things will get even more complicated for Pyongyang if its chemical weapons issues are thrown into the mix,"" said Chang Yong Seok, an analyst at Seoul National University's Institute for Peace and Unification Studies.Perhaps North Korea expected that its use of VX would go undetected because only a tiny amount would have been needed to kill Kim, experts say.Or maybe using VX might have been a logical choice for North Korea because it relied on two lightly trained foreign women to do the job. North Korea would have been reluctant to directly use its own operatives when it had no plans to acknowledge its involvement. A less powerful chemical, including those needing injection devices or other equipment, would have increased the possibility of the women failing to kill Kim or would require larger dosses that might have put more lives at risk.It's still unclear how the two women handled the VX without contaminating themselves and others, including travelers and medical workers who handled Kim's body.Some analysts say that North Korea probably produced VX in the form of a binary agent, where two chemicals that aren't separately deadly become a nerve agent when mixed together.But a South Korean military researcher, who didn't want to be named because he wasn't authorized to talk to reporters, has doubts. While it can be made as a binary agent, VX doesn't synthesize easily, so wiping a person's face separately with two of its component chemicals may not be a surefire way to kill him, said the researcher.What's more likely is that the North Koreans who allegedly organized the assassination coated the women's hands with protective chemicals before putting VX on them, he said. Aside from the two suspects, police have also arrested a North Korean who worked at a Malaysian company and are seeking seven more North Koreans who are, including an embassy official and an airline employee.""The security camera footage shows one of the women heading to the bathroom to wash her hands after attacking Kim. If she touched VX with her bare hands, she wouldn't have had the time to do even that,"" said the researcher."

He is a member of the Indian shooting team and is among the top 10 skeet shooters, winning acclaim in two subsequent World Cups  Germany and Finland. He secured his first national championship in 2011 in the shotgun category, and missed a berth in the Rio Olympics after an accident in 2014, which kept him out of practice for a year.

A priest introduced me to a devadasi who owned the remnants of the sari, she says. Jain, a textile revivalist and educator, has not just based her PhD thesis on this weave, she has managed to bring it back from the dead. By contemporising what was once a red, chequered cotton sari with a deep yellow border, she is seeking to generate interest and sustain production of this ancient weave.Temple runWhile records of the patteda anchu go as far back as the 10th century, Jain (36) came to learn of its existence from weavers in North Karnataka, while working with them. I kept hearing about handlooms that were woven earlier, but are not manufactured any more. This was one of them, says the Pune-based revivalist, who is pursuing her PhD with NIFT. So she began researching it, a challenging task as there were few available records, no samples, and no weavers who still knew how to make it.As she delved into the history of the weave, she discovered it was woven centuries ago in and around the villages of Gajendragarh, Belgum, Raichur, Kodal, Bedar, Bellary, Gulbargah and Dharwad. It was considered an auspicious garment, offered to the temple goddess when the daughter of a household got married, continues Jain, who interviewed nearly 700 people from 10 villages to unravel the details.Jaitly in the pictureArmed with the ragged bits of the sari shed procured from the devadasi, Jain began scouting for weavers who had technical knowledge to develop prototypes. She then took the samples to former Samata Party president and founder of the Dastkari Haat Samiti, Jaya Jaitly. She was so glad to see the patteda anchu that she placed an order for 100 saris, says Jain.Jaitly, who herself owns a patteda anchu, remembers seeing it in the markets in the mid-80s. During my political work, Id encounter a lot of traditional local handloom and Ive seen these saris in North Karnataka over 30 years ago, she says.100 and countingThe Dastakari Haat Samiti gave Jain an advance of Rs. 50,000 to start the project, and the 100 saris produced were then marketed and sold at a pop-up organised by Bengaluru-based Registry of Sarees, a community that promotes indigenous weaves. Co-founder Kausalya Satyakumar says the response was excellent. We are still selling, both in India and abroad, she says.While the basic pattern of the sari has been retained  it is a simple, coarse cotton weave with a broad border  its colour have gone beyond the original red and mustard. Jain has extended the palette to eight shades. And since it has pallus on both sides, it can be draped both ways, adds Jain.Today, 10 looms are running with the patteda anchu, says Jain, who hopes that this will lead to the formation of a self-sufficient and cohesive cluster. The joy of seeing ancient craft back in trend and people making their livelihoods keep me motivated, she concludes.The saris cost Rs. 1,800 each (courier charges are extra).

(Source: REUTERS/Mike Segar)Russia on Tuesday cast its seventh veto to protect the Syrian government from United Nations Security Council action, blocking a bid by Western powers to impose sanctions over accusations of chemical weapons attacks during the six-year Syrian conflict. China backed Russia and cast its sixth veto on Syria. Russia had said the vote on the resolution, drafted by France, Britain and the United States, would harm UN-led peace talks between the warring Syrian parties in Geneva, which began last week.WATCH VIDEO | US President Donald Trump Highlights Key Issues During His First US Congress AddressNine council members voted in favor, Bolivia voted against, while Egypt, Ethiopia and Kazakhstan abstained. A resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the United States, France, Russia, Britain or China to be adopted. Russian President Vladimir Putin described the draft resolution on Tuesday as totally inappropriate.For my friends in Russia, this resolution is very appropriate, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council after the vote. It is a sad day on the Security Council when members start making excuses for other member states killing their own people. The world is definitely a more dangerous place, she said.The vote was one of the first confrontations at the United Nations between Russia and the United States since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, pledging to build closer ties with Moscow. Russias Deputy U.N. Ambassador Vladimir Safronkov described the statements made against Moscow in the Security Council as outrageous and declared that God will judge you.Todays clash or confrontation is not a result of our negative vote. It is a result of the fact that you decided on provocation while you knew well ahead of time our position, said Safronkov. Western powers put forward the resolution in response to the results of an investigation by the U.N. and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).The international inquiry found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas. British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told the council before the vote: This is about taking a stand when children are poisoned. Its that simple. Its about taking a stand when civilians are maimed and murdered with toxic weapons.Chlorines use as a weapon is banned under the Chemical Weapons Convention, which Syria joined in 2013. If inhaled, chlorine gas turns to hydrochloric acid in the lungs and can kill by burning lungs and drowning victims in body fluids. Syrian President Bashar al-Assads government has denied its forces have used chemical weapons. Russia has questioned the results of the U.N./OPCW inquiry and long said there was not enough proof for the Security Council to take any action.French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre said the failure by the council to act would send a message of impunity. Chinas U.N. Ambassador Liu Jieyi said it was too early to act because the international investigation was still ongoing.We oppose the use of chemical weapons, he said. The draft resolution would have banned the sale or supply of helicopters to the Syrian government because the U.N./OPCW inquiry found Syrian government forces had used helicopters to drop barrel bombs containing chlorine gas.It also proposed targeted sanctions  a travel ban and asset freeze  on 11 Syrian military commanders and officials, as well as on 10 government and related entities.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said US support was a sign that the three countries are determined to oppose the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and ""make sure that chemical weapons cannot be used with impunity.""The resolution follows a joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog that determined the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas and the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.Russia, Syria's closest ally, joined the Western nations in establishing the joint investigation, known as the JIM, to determine responsibility for chemical attack.But Russia's deputy U.N. ambassador, Vladimir Safronkov, said Friday that Moscow would veto the resolution, which he described as ""one-sided,"" ''based on insufficient evidence"" and ""a provocation.""In a sharp retort, U.S. Ambassador Nikki Haley asked: ""How much longer is Russia going to continue to babysit and make excuses for the Syrian regime? ... People have died by being suffocated to death. That's barbaric.""The Syrian government denies using chemical weapons in the civil war, now in its sixth year, but the three Western countries contend there must be accountability following the results of the JIM investigations.""We call on all our colleagues in the council, all 15, to ... give a strong, clear, message tomorrow that the international community means business on preventing the use of these abhorrent weapons,"" Rycroft said.But the British ambassador said he didn't see any indication that Russia would change its mind and allow adoption of the resolution.The 11 Syrians who would be subject to an asset freeze and travel ban include Amr Armanzi, director-general of Syria's Scientific Studies Research Center, which is responsible for the development and production of chemical weapons and the missiles to deliver them. Nine current and former military officers and the managing director of a Ministry of Defense subsidiary that assists in the production of chemical weapons are also named.The 10 ""entities"" that would be put on the sanctions blacklist and subject to an asset freeze under the draft resolution include the Scientific Studies Research Center and several Syrian government subsidiaries, proxies, front companies and factories allegedly involved in producing chemical weapons.A chemical weapon attack on a Damascus suburb that killed hundreds of civilians on Aug. 21, 2013, led to a U.S.-Russian agreement and a Security Council resolution the following month that ordered the destruction of Syria's chemical weapons, precursors and the equipment to produce the deadly agents.While insisting it did not stage the attack, the Syrian government supported the resolution and joined the chemical weapons watchdog known as the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, warding off possible U.S. military strikes.Syria's declared stockpile of 1,300 metric tons of chemicals has been destroyed, but the OPCW is still investigating outstanding questions about possible undeclared chemical weapons.The draft resolution expresses ""grave concern"" that the OPCW ""is not able to resolve all identified gaps, inconsistencies and discrepancies in Syria's declaration"" and calls on Syria to undertake an ""expeditious resolution of all outstanding issues.""

""Chachi, Jai Bhim,"" exclaims Abbas Ansari , as he adjusts his dark brown sun glasses and twirls up his moustache before greeting the woman with folded hands.It is afternoon and Ansari (25), the BSP candidate from Ghosi assembly constituency in Mau is at the peak of his campaign. But more than a candidate-inarguably youngest to be fielded by any political party in this UP assembly election-Abbas is the son of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari , who, while still lodged in jail, is contesting from the neighboring constituency of Mau Sadar.Even as the shadow of a gangster father looms over him, Abbas, a management graduate and a national level shooting champion, is in a hurry to get into the shoes of a 'neta'. ""Ek baar aapan ladka ko vote diyo...(vote this time for your son),"" Abbas exhorts in a typical local dialect, even as one of his accomplices pulls out a calendar bearing a photograph of BSP chief Mayawati and hands it over to Naina.Bemused, the woman responds: ""Humka kachhu na chahi bhaiyya... hum logan ka koi kuch nahi kari raha ab tak...(I don't need anything...nobody has done anything for us),"" she pleads. Abbas listens patiently and then bows to her. ""Vote na diyo...aashirwad to diyo Chachi.. (Don't vote but at least bless me),"" he says, before walking away to a waiting cavalcade of SUVs parked in the sunbaked stretches that snake through swathes of mustard fields.The cars, bearing BSP flags and blaring out a party song moves from one village to another. And each time, Abbas darts out of his SUV to meet people, poses for a selfie with youngsters and even hugs children.The Ghosi assembly constituency, comprising as many as 181 small and big villages, has seen a public representative of either BJP or BSP since 1993. Fagu Chauhan, who won the seat as BJP candidate in 1993 and 1996, switched to Mayawati's camp and won the seat in 2002 and then in 2007 on BSP ticket. He lost the seat in 2012 to SP's Sudhakar Singh. Mukhtar had then, as a candidate of Quami Ekta Dal-now merged with BSP-had contested from both Mau and Ghosi. He won Mau but was relegated to third position in Ghosi.This time, Sudhakar is in the fray to get re-elected as SP candidate, while Chauhan is contesting on a BJP ticket. Not surprisingly, Abbas keeps hitting at both Sudhakar and Chauhan. ""Bhaiyya aap Sudhakar Chacha aur Fagu Chacha to dekh liye ho...hum unka jaise nahi hain...koi commission na laihein...jo paisa aayi u yahin laga dehiyein... (You have seen Sudhakar uncle and Fagu uncle...I am not like them...I will not take any commission.. whatever funds arrive would be put into development of the area),'' he tells a group of men in village Fatehpur Dulhara. ""My father has been four times MLA from Mau. He must have done something to win the seat so many times. Time has now come for Ghosi to see development,'' Abbas tells TOI.The Ghosi assembly constituency is actually a complex mix of Dalits, Muslims and Most Backward Caste (MBC). While Dalits account for nearly 18% of the total population, Muslims are around 20%. The constituency, otherwise, is dominated by non-Yadav OBC, essentially Rajbhars. While BSP is banking on a general projection of Dalits-Muslims consolidation, the SP and BJP is relying completely on local factors."
58f501db7be9e018510a16ec,GM crop 'consensus' queried,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170228/jsp/nation/story_138202.jsp,2017-02-28,"New Delhi, Feb. 27: A government agency in Brazil, the world's second-largest cultivator of genetically modified crops, has flagged about 750 research studies, including some from India, that it says highlight hazards or uncertainties related to GM crops. The agency, which functions under Brazil's ministry for agrarian development, said such studies that underscored ""deep"" divisions about GM crops within the scientific community seemed to have been ""disregarded"" by regulators who evaluate these crops for safety and efficacy before approval for cultivation. The report comes at a time a regulatory panel under India's environment ministry is evaluating a GM mustard crop that a subcommittee had in a preliminary assessment declared safe for human and animal consumption. America, Brazil, Argentina, India and Canada account for over 95 per cent of the world's 180 million hectares under GM crop cultivation. Brazil grows genetically modified soy, maize and cotton while India has so far cultivated only GM cotton that regulators approved in 2002. Indian scientists and biotechnology executives have repeatedly asserted that GM cotton's performance in India has largely been successful. Although some scientists have over the past decade highlighted technical problems about the GM cotton varieties grown in India, GM cotton accounts for over 90 per cent of land under cotton. ""Despite all the anti-GM campaigns, even this year it is estimated that we'll have about 87 per cent GM cotton,"" said Charu Dutt Mayee, a senior cotton scientist and president of the New Delhi-based South Asia Biotechnology Centre. ""The average farmer is happy with GM cotton. Some problems emerged because of poor management of varieties."" The Brazilian report said the 750 studies provided ""irrefutable evidence"" for the lack of consensus about GM crops among scientists, challenging assertions by some crop biotechnology specialists that there was no debate over the public health or environmental risks of GM crops. The Brazilian agency released the English version of the report, authored earlier this month by ecologists Gilles Ferment and Leonardo Melgarejo and agricultural engineers Jose Maria Gusman Ferraz and Gabvriel Bianconi Fernandes. ""At this point, it stands out that the literature used by regulatory agencies in the risk assessment of GM plants (is) predominantly produced, financed, or supported by interested companies or researchers who are or have been linked to the biotech industry,"" the authors wrote. Mayee said he was unaware of the Brazilian government's report. ""Brazil, Argentina, and the US have adopted genetically modified crops on a larger scale than India and longer - they have food crops, which we do not yet,"" Mayee said. The report has cited studies that it says question the long-term efficacy of GM plants, including a 2010 study by scientists at the University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad (Karnataka), that found target insects successfully breeding on GM cotton. Biotechnology proponents said they were surprised that the Brazilian government had associated itself with the report. ""Brazil has been an early and large adopter of GM crops. I would be really surprised if this is from the government,"" said Bhagirath Chowdhury, representative of a global non-government agro-biotechnology agency. The report also refers to a 2011 study by Indian crop scientist M.S. Swaminathan that noted that GM cotton was a ""clear leader"" as a standalone crop. It added that the income advantage of GM cotton declined for small and marginal farmers who intercrop cotton with cereals or pulses."

58f5077b7be9e018510a1d21,Axe on shady mukhiyas,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170301/jsp/jharkhand/story_138255.jsp,2017-03-01,"Chief minister Raghubar Das during Seedhi Baat at Suchana Bhavan in Ranchi on Tuesday. Picture by Hardeep Singh Ranchi, Feb. 28: Chief minister Raghubar Das today asked rural development department secretary N.N. Sinha to send a formal notice to all DCs asking them to disqualify mukhiyas ""within a week"" if they were found guilty of corrupt practices. Das gave this directive during Seedhi Baat, his monthly people's interface at Suchana Bhavan, while handling a case pertaining to an allegedly corrupt mukhiya of Tetron panchayat in Jainagar, Koderma, before a battery of bureaucrats present personally and many others, including DCs and policemen, connected through videoconferencing. One Anand Ravidas alleged financial irregularities by Tetron mukhiya Babita Devi and her husband Mahesh Das in development work, saying the couple withdrew funds for a 200-feet boring in their area when in reality only 60 feet was dug. The mukhiya and her husband also inflated cost of solar plates to Rs 30,500 against the market rate of Rs 20,000, and claimed Rs 1.8 lakh for water tankers priced at Rs 1 lakh. An earlier probe by Koderma administration confirmed irregularities in solar panel and water tank purchases. Today, when Koderma DC Sanjiv Besra claimed the mukhiya had shown three quotations, the chief minister said those ""could always be fabricated"". ""Suspend her immediately and don't resort to babudom by writing letters,"" Das said, directing rural development department secretary Sinha to issue orders to all DCs to take legal and punitive action at their end against mukhiyas without waiting for anyone's permission, if claims of their shady deals were found true. ""Almost all mukhiyas across the state are resorting to fraudulent means,"" Das said. One Jagdish Mahto from Jamtara's Nala block said that he had applied for a Rs 3 lakh loan from Bank of India to set up a mustard oil mill in 2014 under a central scheme, but bank officials asked for Rs 30,000 as bribe. ""When I refused, they rejected my application,"" he alleged. A representative from BOI told Das that the bank's viability study had rejected Jagdish's proposal. But, Das wasn't happy with the explanation. ""Had he given the bribe, the loan would have easily got approved. Isn't it? I know how bankers fleece people in remote areas,"" he said, directing his secretary Sunil Kumar Barnwal to ensure the bank manager was suspended. In a case related to the murder of an 18-year-old Dhanbad boy whose culprits were at large, Das ordered SSP Manoj Ratan Chothe to ensure results in one week or suspend the local OC. When the SSP said their probe revealed that the boy's mother had an illicit relationship with a railway employee, and that she did not let the police question her or her alleged beau, Das got visibility irritated by these personal allegations and ticked off the SSP: ""I am not interested in her relationships. Murder has been committed, why are killers not caught?"" he said. In all, 20 cases, including pending dues after retirement, poorly made government buildings, cropped up today."
58f95f59a3d24b0b70c3f3ac,Yellow is the new saffron here,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/yellow-is-the-new-saffron/article17385175.ece,2017-03-01,"Sipahs bright mustard fields appear completely in sync with the political mood of the village. Cutting past its dusty roads, the colour yellow becomes even more apparent  vivid yellow scarves, banners, flags and posters indicate the presence of the Suheldev Bharatiya Samaj Party (SBSP).The village, nestled in the Zahoorabad constituency in Ghazipur, less than 20 km from the banks of the Ganga, is in the heart of the Yadav-Muslim-Bhumihar belt of eastern Uttar Pradesh. However, the talking point here is not any social alliance but the political significance of the Rajbhars. The community is one of the 17 most backward castes that have been for long been demanding inclusion in the Scheduled Caste category.At a crossing in Sipah, around a dozen Rajbhars have gathered, some of them tired after the days campaigning. There is no doubt about their political and electoral inclination  they are strongly behind Om Prakash Rajbhar, president of the SBSP, which draws its strength from the Rajbhars.Its about prideOm Prakash Rajbhar is making our presence felt. We are also getting the honour due to him. Before his movement, no party wasted a second on us, says young Rajesh Rajbhar, a small-time farmer, like many other people of his caste in Sipah. If Rajbhars lavish praise on Om Prakash Rajbhar for elevating the asmita (pride) of the community and popularising their icon Suheldev, they are also thankful to the Narendra Modi government for its outreach.After coming to power, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has taken concerted steps to popularise Suheldev. If BJP chief Amit Shah unveiled a statue of Suheldev in Bahraich, the party installed his frame in its gallery at its headquarters in Lucknow. Last year, the BJP went against convention and started a new superfast train  the Suhaildev Express  named after the medieval warrior-king, a legend among Rajbhars.The triweekly service covers the breadth of Indias most populous State  from Ghazipur in Purvanchal to Anand Vihar in Delhi. The BJP-Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) have, over the years, aggressively tried to portray Suheldev as a Hindutva warrior who stopped the march of the Muslim invader Ghazi Mian, a nephew of Mahmud Ghaznavi, in Bahraich, and halted Islamisation of the region. In this village, too, Suheldev is hailed as a national hero who kept out invaders. Several respondents spoke with a communal undertone.Affinity for BJPThe affinity of the Rajbhars towards the BJP also stems from that fact that the party is fighting the elections in an alliance with the SBSP. It is expected to further push the BJPs outreach among non-Yadav backward communities.As part of its deal with the BJP, the SBSP is fighting eight seats spread across eastern U.P.  Mau, Bansdih, Chaudauli, Zakania, Shahganj, Mehnagar, Ramkola and Zahoorabad in Ghazipur, where Om Prakash Rajbhar is himself contesting. However, the BJP hopes to gain across the belt as an understanding with the SBSP has earned it a commanding presence among the Rajbhars.Campaign journeysOm Prakash Rajbhar is himself travelling across the belt with Amit Shah to draw in his communitys people. Though estimated to be around 2% of the States population, the Rajbhars are concentrated is some districts of east U.P., having the potential to impact results. While Om Prakash has in the past claimed that his community is effective in no less than 70 seats, his aide Pattiram Rajbhar, says the Rajbhar vote is spread across 147 constituencies. In every constituency, there are 10,000 to 80,000 Rajbhars, says Pattiram, adding that the vote was being transferred to the BJP in full strength.In Zahoorabad, Om Prakash is battling against the Bahujan Samaj Partys (BSP) Kalicharan Rajbhar, former MLA and runner-up last time, and the Samajwadi Partys (SP) Mahendra Chauhan, a candidate from the Noniya backward caste. In Sipah, Om Prakash is the clear favourite among members of his community.Whereas Sipah strongly backs its community leader, while travelling across Ballia, Azamgarh, Mau and Ghazipur districts, substantial conversion of the Rajbhar vote towards the BJP could be found. In some areas, however, they appeared split between the SP and the BSP as well, especially if they fielded candidates from the community.Moti Chand Rajbhar, an ally-turned-foe of Om Prakash, however, says the latter has lost credibility in his community due to his flip-flops and would not be able to ensure the full Rajbhar vote to the BJP.No intelligent Rajbhar likes him, says Moti Chand, who now works for the SP in Ballias Rasra seat. Om Prakash Rajbhar struck a deal with the BJP for his own greed. He has sold the communitys future for a few bucks.  He had merged his outfit, the Jai Suheldev Party, with Om Prakashs BSP to form the SBSP, but the two soon parted ways over differences.In 2002, after leaving the Bahujan Samaj Party, Om Prakash Rajbhar, who has in the past claimed to be a descendant of Suheldev, formed the SBSP. In 2012, it contested 52 seats and secured over 4.7 lakh total votes [5.06% votes in the seats it fought] but failed to open its score. Mr. Rajbhar himself stood third from Zahoorabad, despite winning a decent 48,865 votes.Another issue that stirs the Rajbhar is the talk of Dalit status. The community is financially, socially and educationally among the most backward."

Express File Photo Indian Agricultural Research Institutes library building in New Delhi. Express File PhotoIn about a months time, Indian farmers are going to harvest their wheat crop that will mark the 50th year of the Green Revolution. The 1966-67 rabi season was when they first undertook large-scale planting of the new miracle high-yielding varieties on some 2,40,000 hectares. Key to the revolution was the Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), whose scientists developed the package of practices for cultivation of the semi-dwarf wheat lines, initially imported from Mexico before breeding their own improved varieties, starting with Sonalika and Kalyan Sona in 1967. That very IARI today is without a regular director. It has, in fact, been without one for a good part of over two-and-a-half years. The last director to have served a full term,H S Gupta, retired on August 7, 2014. It took more than a year to appoint a successor. But even the new director Trilochan Mohapatra, who joined on August 28, 2015  he previously headed the Central Rice Research Institute at Cuttack, Odisha  was around for barely six months. On February 22, 2016, Mohapatra became director-general of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR). IARI has been headless since then.It reflects the neglect by the authorities of an institution that has contributed so much to our farmers. That this is happening when we are celebrating the golden jubilee of the Green Revolution makes it even more unfortunate, says Vijay Pal Singh, former programme leader (rice) at IARI and breeder of Pusa-1121, the blockbuster basmati variety that generates around $3 billion in annual export revenues for the country.From Kalyan Sona and Sonalika in the mid-sixties, IARI scientists went on to develop similarly successful wheat varieties such as HD-2285 (released for commercial cultivation in 1982), HD-2329 (1985), HD-2967 (2011) and HD-3086 (2014). While Kalyan Sona and Sonalika raised the wheat yield potential that many farmers harvested from 10-15 quintals to 45-50 quintals per hectare, these rose further to over 70 quintals with HD-2967 and HD-3086. The last two varieties would cover an estimated 14 million hectares or nearly half of the total area planted to wheat in India this year!But wheat apart, IARIs research fields have produced a host of widely-cultivated varieties also in rice (Pusa Basmati-1, Pusa-44, Pusa-1121 and Pusa-1509), mustard (Pusa Bold, Pusa Jaikisan, Pusa Mustard-25, 26, 27, 28, 29 and 30), chana (BG-256 and BG-362), vegetables (Pusa Ruby tomato, Pusa Purple Long brinjal and Pusa Sawani okra), and mango (Mallika and Amrapali). More recent breakthroughs include Pusa Double Zero Mustard-31 (the first ever canola-grade mustard containing low levels of erucic acid and glucosinolates) and Pusa Arhar-16 (a promising early-maturing pigeon-pea that can yield 20 quintals per hectare in just 120 days and is, moreover, amenable to mechanical combine harvesting).Significantly, all this is from an institution with an annual budget of just over Rs 400 crore, which also covers salaries and other establishment expenses. There arent many research organisations in India that have had such a tangible impact on the ground with so little investment, claims Singh, whose breeding accomplishments in basmati rice won him the Padma Shri award in 2012. IARIs bane has been the overbearing control  on everything from administration and appointments to funding, travel and research collaboration approvals  imposed by ministers, bureaucrats and scientist-administrators sitting in Krishi Bhawan. Such direct involvement from the Agriculture Ministry may not have mattered during the Green Revolution period, when the person at the helm, Chidambaram Subramaniam, was somebody who knew the subject well and, equally important, had a direct line with the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi.We were living ship-to-mouth those days and everybody recognised the importance of investing in agricultural research. A lot of attention was, therefore, paid to institutions such as IARI and it continued even in the decades that followed. No wonder, we had such illustrious directors, be it B P Pal, M S Swaminathan, A B Joshi, H K Jain and S K Sinha or R B Singh and S Nagarajan, notes Singh.According to him, things have changed in the last few years, when agriculture itself has ceased to be a priority amongst policymakers and we think we have become self-sufficient. That has bred not just complacency, but even negligence, manifested in Indias premier national institute for agricultural research and education not having a full-time director. The Indian Agricultural Research Institute currently has Jeet Singh Sandhu, deputy director-general (crop science) of ICAR, holding additional charge as its director. Prior to him, the officiating director was Ravinder Kaur, an agricultural physicist who heads IARIs water technology centre.The director of IARI should be someone with a good understanding of soil and water, besides biochemistry, genetics and breeding, plant pathology and entomology. I hope the government make the right choice and it is done soon. The present situation is sending a negative message to the younger generation of scientists, adds Singh.Many eminent farm scientists, both past and serving, The Indian Express spoke to felt that the time had come to insulate both IARI and its parent organisation ICAR from political/bureaucratic interference by bringing them under the direct charge of the Prime Minister. This is the case with the Indian Space Research Organisation, Department of Atomic Energy, and the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. Transferring administrative authority from Krishi Bhawan to the Prime Ministers office will make ICAR/IARI less vulnerable to ministerial whims and day-to-day interference. Moreover, it will help raise the profile of agricultural research to the level of space and atomic energy, while protecting the autonomy of institutions like IARI, they point out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The Upanishad then goes on to talk of meditation of Brahman as gastric fire. The Upanishad says that the light of this fire is the same as the light that shines above the highest worlds, explained M.K. Srinivasan in a discourse.The gastric fire is said to be antarjyotih. That means that this gastric fire is the body of the Supreme Brahman.The word antarjyotih is also used by Vedanta Desika in his Bhagavad Dhyana Sopana, where he describes Lord Ranganatha of Srirangam. Desika says the Lord is daivatam daivatAnAm  the God of all gods, the only One who can grant moksha.In the Bhagavad Gita, the Supreme One is said to be of the form of VaisvAnara agni.Chandogya Upanishad also talks of how this gastric fire can be perceived. It can be felt by experiencing the heat of the body, which is felt by touch. It can also be perceived as the internal sound one hears when the ears are closed, the rumbling in the ears. This rumbling is the sound of that Agni. So this Jyoti is drishtatva and srutatva  that is, it should be meditated upon as seen and heard.The Supreme One is known through meditation. This Paramatman, who has all auspicious qualities, resides in the heart.He is smaller than the smallest grain of rice; smaller than a mustard seed. Yet He is greater than all the worlds. He assumes a small proportion in order to reside in our hearts, and this is to facilitate our meditation on Him. He who believes firmly that he will reach Sri Vaikuntha when he departs from this world shall definitely reach the abode of the Supreme One."

But political differences over how to divvy up GST revenues or compensate states for lost income because of the new tax held up progress.Once the tax reform comes into effect, consumers will pay a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services. At present, they pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed  one over the other  at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.The proposed GST will have four tax slabs. Farmers and small traders are exempt.The applied rates will be 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. The cap will be on the higher side, finance minister Arun Jaitley said without elaborating on the higher limit. States want the higher limit set at 40% to obviate the need to go to Parliament every time taxes have to be raised on certain goods and services."

The council now has to approve the State GST Bill. The CGST and IGST Bills will have to be approved by the Parliament now and ratified by states.Here are the 10 things that you need to know about the GST regime:1) Constitution amended for GSTThe government amended the Constitution, which requires approval from two-third of members in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, to switch over to GST from the present tax regime at the Centre and states.The Lok Sabha passed the Constitution (One Hundred Twenty Second Amendment) Bill on May 6, 2015.The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government took months to bring all opposition parties on board so and move the Bill in Rajya Sabha where the ruling party does not enjoy a majority.On August 3, 2016, the Rajya Sabha approved the Bill after a marathon debate and with some changes. On August 8, the Lok Sabha approved the amended bill.2) India as a common market with one taxThe GST will unify India into a common market with one tax across all states, which will eliminate the present cascading impact of a plethora of central taxes.Central taxes such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Additional Customs Duty and Service Tax will all be merged into one CGST.State levies such as VAT, sales tax, entertainment tax, purchase tax, mandi tax, luxury tax, octroi and entry tax, will be subsumed into SGST.The Centre will levy the Central GST and Integrated GST, while states will impose the SGST.3) Four-slab GST structureThe new regime will have a four-slab structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.There will be no tax on several items including rice, wheat and other essential items, which constitutes 50% of CPI inflation basket.The lowest tax rate of 5% is proposed for items of mass consumption used by common people such as spices, tea and mustard oil.There will be two standard rates of 12% and 18% covering most manufactured items and services.The highest tax rate of 28% will be imposed on items like luxury cars, pan masala, tobacco and aerated drinks. These items are currently attracting a tax of 27-31%.4) States to get compensation if there is revenue lossThe Compensation Bill will ensure states will get fully compensated for the first five years if there is a revenue loss after GST is rolled out.There could an enabling provision in the GST Bills that highest slab could be raised up to 40% to make up for the loss in revenues coming from other items.5) Dual control on assessing taxpayersThe Centre and states will both assess taxpayers having a turnover of over Rs 1.5 crore in turnover annually.States will the power to assess taxpayers below Rs 1.5 crore in turnover.At present, 90% of taxpayers have turnover below Rs 1.5 crore annually and they will be assessed by states.6) How GST will lower tax burdenGST will be a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition.The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages.7) How will consumers benefitConsumers now pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed --- one over the other --- at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.GST will be a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services.GST will eliminate the cascading impact of multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and states, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.8) Will industry benefit from GSTFor India Inc, GST will ensure easier compliance through the GST Network (GSTN) platform. A seamless tax-credit system throughout the value chain and across states will ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business.All services such as registrations, returns and payments will be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent.GST will help India improve its ranking in the ease of doing business.9) GST impact on inflationInitially, GST may lead to a higher inflation as many services and manufactured products get costlier and as compliance improves.However, GST will help moderate inflation in the medium to long term as the cascading impact of taxes goes.10) Will GST help the economyThe GST is widely perceived to help in accelerating economic growth by 1-2 percentage points as it shores up revenues of Centre and states, which can be invested in infrastructure and social schemes.Industry will be able to invest more money in ramping up capacity as the tax burden is reduced, which will propel growth and employment."

58f55739a3d24b0b70c20249,Ear to the ground,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ear-to-the-ground/article17404927.ece,2017-03-04,"Appraising the vote:In Kalan, numerically there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. Susheela Devi (far right) stands with her neighbours in the village. (Below) An old Thakur house.R.V. MoorthyThe sprawling village of Kalan is set in 1,200 bighas of fertile land in the southeastern corner of Uttar Pradeshs Sultanpur district. An early spring sun filters through the trees onto the ruins of Somit Pratap Singhs hereditary home. He is supervising the building of his new home, as the mountain of bricks before which he sits suggests. Somit has just completed his MSc from the Shri Vishwanath Degree College nearby and hopes to become a primary school teacher, once the Assembly elections conclude and recruitment is resumed.Three days before polling in the Kadipur Assembly constituency (February 27), in which this village falls, we talk about the electoral prospects of the parties in the fray. Its BJP versus BSP here, he says confidently. His vote, like that of his fellow Thakurs, will go to the kamal ka phool (lotus, the BJP symbol). He suddenly rushes off and returns with a large notebook, flips it open and shows me a family tree he has drawn up painstakingly. It goes back two centuries. Its important that future generations know who their ancestors were, he stresses.The Thakurs, BJP loyalistsIndeed, pride in their heritage is a recurring theme with the Thakurs who dominate the village politically, own the largest tracts of land, and are patrons of education. Kalan has many shortcomings, but it has an array of educational options in its immediate vicinity from the government school and degree college to the swish Shivbrat Childrens Academy and an engineering college: it ensures that virtually every child here is getting an education. The last named is administered by Uma Shankar Singh, the former pradhan of Kalan, who studied at Mumbais K.C. College and the Mafatlal Institute before embarking on a 25-year-long career in textile quality control that included a stint at Subbu Textiles in Tamil Nadus Erode district.Rajendra Bahadur Singh, a primary school teacher in a neighbouring village, claims his familys arrival in these parts predates Rana Pratap  a Thakur icon  who ruled in the sixteenth century. His ancestors, he says, came as horse traders from Amer in Rajasthan, overthrew the Rajbhars who were the local rulers at the time and settled down in the village of Khanpur Pilai, less than five km from Kalan. Today, he proclaims proudly, Our clan of Kachwaha Thakurs is spread over 52 villages and the Rajbhars work on our land. But we dont have any social relations with them.Its a given that Rajendra and his family, including his elder brother who holds a PhD in sociology from Lucknow University and has done research work at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University, will vote BJP. It is the only nationalist party  all educated people will vote for Narendra Modi, he says.And then he adds, This time, the Rajbhars, who are traditional BSP supporters and even voted for the party in 2014, have shifted to the BJP. The reason? A brand-new Rajbhar party, the Bharatiya Samaj Party, that takes its inspiration from Raja Suhel Dev, ironically enough the Rajbhar king who was defeated by the Thakurs, has allied itself with the BJP this time.Rajbhars shifting right?In Kalan, the Rajbhars, an OBC community, are numerically larger than the Thakurs but, barring the Musahars (earlier rat catchers but now landless labourers), are the poorest in the village. Its members largely live below the poverty line. A handful are marginal cultivators not even growing enough to feed their families, while the vast majority are landless labourers here.The Rajbhar quarter in the village is a tongue of land surrounded on three sides by lush green fields of paddy and mustard. But most of it belongs to another OBC community, the Badhais, traditionally makers of agricultural tools, but whose secondary occupation is cultivation.The crowded mud hovels in which the Rajbhars live are a far cry from the well-lit havelis and whitewashed bungalows of the Thakurs, equipped with modern conveniences. Some have laid out their string beds outside their homes. To protect themselves from the elements and the mosquitoes, they have opened out used fertiliser bags and stitched them into mosquito net-like canopies for their beds.Our ancestors left us no land, says Sanichara sadly, so we work on the lands of the Thakurs and the Badhais. Rajpati and Mala join in the conversation to complain they have the  lal rang ka card  (BPL card) but dont get any of the welfare benefits that others seem to enjoy. No one cares whether we are alive or dead, says Mala. We have no proper drains or toilets, and a kucha (unpaved) road leads to our dwellings. Her nephew, Munna, is a mason who has seen a bit of life outside the village. Look at Bihar: have you seen the pitch (tarred) roads there? he says enviously. Here we were told that everyone with a red BPL card would get a free bulb, and pay Rs. 25 on electricity. But we are being made to pay Rs. 270. In the hand-to-mouth existence that they live, that makes a big hole in their meagre earnings.So has anyone come to seek your votes, I ask. Yes, says Rajpati, someone from the BSP. But when I ask who they are voting for, the women say,  Kono palan nahin (We havent decided yet). Mala adds,  Jahan public jutegi wahan jayenge (Wherever the majority is going, we will follow).Sanicharas father-in-law, Motinath, with matted long hair and a straggly unkempt beard, is more forthcoming: The cycle [the SP symbol] is looking at its community, the elephant [the BSP symbol] at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal .As I turn to leave, there is a surprise. Sanichara, Rajpati and Mala follow me. As soon as they are out of earshot distance from their menfolk, they grab my arm and whisper in my ear: We like Mayawati: we have attended her rallies in the past. We are going to vote for her. Dont you think thats a good idea?Camp BSP: the DalitsIf the Thakurs of Kalan have memories of military triumphs stretching over several centuries that gives them the self-confidence to take on the challenges of life, the BSP phenomenon has empowered the Dalits over the last 25 years. Indeed, though Akbarpur, the birthplace of the socialist leader, Ram Manohar Lohia, is less than 40 km away, only old-timers in the village have fleeting memories of him, with a statue and a few educational institutions named after him there. Instead, with BSP founder Kanshi Ram making this region  of which Kalan is a part  one of his social laboratories, it is the BSP that continues to have influence here.In Kalan, numerically too there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. As I walk to the Dalit quarter, right at the heart of the village, this is immediately visible, especially among the women and the younger generation.Uneducated Dalits like Ramachal and his wife Usha are marginal farmers, who supplement their income by carrying bricks at building sites. But they have nothing left at the end of the month. Ramachals ailing father gets a pension, but thats about it. They complain about notebandi (the demonetisation exercise) and are a bit subdued, but their eldest child, Sonu, who is in Class XI at the local government school, is not. He says he wants to be an engine driver and see the world. His mother butts in to say sourly, Where will we get the money for the bribe? But Sonu remains cool and instead explains the Pythagorean theorem with aplomb  a tribute both to him and the school where he studies.At 17, he doesnt have a vote but clearly takes an interest in politics, for it is he who says that his parents will vote for the elephant.  Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants, Sonu stresses.Like Sonu, one of their neighbours, Sunita Devi, who works at an Anganwadi, has her own world view. An attractive young married woman, she is the mother of three little girls, and has studied till Class X. Modi had said ghar ghar sauchalaya [a toilet in every house], but we have no toilets yet, she says. We will vote for Behenji because she gives the most benefits. When my eldest child was born, she was in power and the government gave Rs. 1 lakh insurance for the baby. When my daughter turns 18, I can use the accrued money for her marriage.I tell Sunita I had heard that a BJP representative visited the Dalit quarter, and ask her what she thinks of the Prime Minister. Yes, Rajesh Kumar [a BJP activist] came here and said, vote for kamal ka phool. I told him we are haathi [elephant] people, so forget about it. And then she takes off on the Central government: I was expecting my third child last November and had gone to my parents home in Azamgarh district. Thanks to notebandi , my parents had such a tough time raising the Rs. 5,000 for me to have the child at a private hospital.So what does she expect of the Prime Minister? When we choose a Prime Minister, we do it in the hope that he creates a harmonious atmosphere, and works for the welfare of all the people. Then everyone will be happy. We dont expect notebandi  everyone sitting at home and crying, she says.If the Dalit women are committed Mayawati supporters, some of the men are considering other options. Ramprakash, a bus conductor who earns Rs. 4,000 a month, says, We are haathiwalen but its not necessary that we will all vote BSP. Modi has done some good work: lets try him once. His fiery young wife, Shashikala, and their neighbour, Meera, turn on him: Rubbish! He has done nothing. We women at any rate will vote BSP.And then comes another surprise. Meera says, Our grown-up sons are considering another option  Akhilesh Yadav [of the SP], because he has given cycles and laptops.The split backward voteBut Mayawati has other admirers among the backward castes. In Kalan, there are half-a-dozen homes of the Lohars, traditional blacksmiths, but who have now turned to carpentry, with many moving to Mumbai. The Lohars have some land, but it is not enough to feed them. Saroja Surajlal Vishwakarma, the young daughter-in-law of one Lohar household, is an ardent Modi admirer. But her aunt-in-law, Parvati, who lives in Mumbai and is here on vacation, hates the Prime Minister. She had to pawn her jewellery to get her husband treated after demonetisation devastated their carpentry business. Someone who begs for your votes should not oppress you. Life was best for women under Mayawati. I have been to her rallies, she says firmly.But not all communities who vote BSP have been empowered. Take Kalans only Musahar family. Ram Chander, his two brothers, and his wife Lakshmina, who suffers from a nervous disorder, live on the edge of the village. Three decades back, they lived in a small room in the nearby kasba , and would travel to Kalan for work. One day, a Thakur said that he would give them a piece of land in exchange for which they would have to make sal leaf pattals (plates) and clear away the soiled plates. Now no one eats from those plates and they do odd jobs to eke out an existence. They also have a little stall on the main road where they sell chewable tobacco, potato crisps and toffees.If the Lohars are divided, another backward caste, the Chaurasias, traditional betel growers and a community that has social relations with the Thakurs, are firmly with the BJP. Kalans current pradhan Bimla Devi was away in Mumbai to attend to her husband Chottey Lal, who is admitted in a hospital there after he sustained a heart attack. They have a thriving betel leaf and motor parts business in that city. That is evident from the imposing three-storey house they are building in the village, with tiered, carved balconies that curve around the structure.Their younger son, Krishna, who has a BSc degree, is standing in for his mother. He reels off all the improvements he has made to the village  drains, roads, electricity  and says he hopes to contest the seat when it is de-reserved. His elder brother Mukesh, who is going to sit for the entrance exams for a government job, and he are both BJP supporters. Mukesh says he likes the BJP but wishes the party would not try and divide society  also he makes it clear that reservation for OBCs must continue. But Krishna likes the party for its anti-Muslim stance: They tease our girls in Muslim-dominated areas and the SP gives them protection, he says, adding, I want Yogi Adityanath to be Chief Minister.In Kalan, however, the Muslims are a miniscule minority, no more than six families, two of whom live on one edge of the village. But the two  related to each other  have quarrelled over land, and a wall separates their homes. Tabassum is a young widow. She and her daughter live with her mother and sister-in-law. They have no land, so her brother who works in Mumbai sends home money to support them. My daughter, Saina Bano, has friends at the private school she attends, but none in the village. For much of the year, they live in splendid isolation: Most people dont know we are Muslims, so we go and play Holi, she says and then adds, We invite people for Bakrid. Yes, she will vote, she says. I hear people are voting for Mayawati. Ill do the same.Akhileshs Yadavs?The Yadavs in Kalan are predictably supporters of the SP: they are largely educated and financially on a stable footing. Sangeeta, a young housewife who also works at an Anganwadi, lives in a joint family. Her brother-in-law Rajesh has an MA degree and is looking for a job. But the family has enough land to not only to feed itself but also sell in the open market. Everyone here says they are voting SP, but it is the younger members who answer the difficult questions. The cherubic-looking Saurabh is only 16, but clearly sharper than his elders: when I ask the family what they have to say about the Yadavs cornering all the benefits, it is he who responds, measuring his words carefully: Do only OBCs walk on the roads or benefit from the ambulances and police vans? Are they the only ones who get pensions? Yes, there may be many Yadavs in the police and forces because we are a martial people. But the bureaucracy is dominated by Kayasthas and Brahmins. Why not talk about that?And then Saurabh springs a surprise. He will be of voting age by 2019 and he says: I am very impressed by Modis personality. I think many in my family will vote BJP in 2019. His uncles demur but he has let the cat out of the bag. After SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav came to power, through the 1990s and the 2000s, political power helped the Yadavs prosper materially and enter the middle class. Their aspirations have changed and many no longer wish to be associated with a party associated with lathi-wielding musclemen. If the advent of the polished Akhilesh Yadav has held them back, the results of the current elections could well determine the future voting patterns of the community.The cycle is looking at its community, the elephant at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal (lotus).Motinath Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants.sonuOur grown-up sons are considering Akhilesh Yadav because he has given cycles and laptops.Meera"

We are deeply alarmed by what our colleagues have seen, and we strongly condemn any use of chemical weapons, by any party, anywhere, Mardini said.Lawan Miwan, head of Emergency Hospital in Irbil, told CNN that he was treating two cases with symptoms consistent with exposure to a toxic chemical agent.Two residents of east Mosul reported smelling something strange, like a chemical agent or mustard gas following mortar attacks on Wednesday and Thursday.They said the attacks came across the Tigris River from western Mosul.The World Health Organisation (WHO) has responded to the reported use of chemical weapons agents in eastern Mosul, activating an emergency response plan to treat those who may be exposed to the highly toxic chemicals, the WHO said on Friday.The Islamic State (IS) has used chemical weapons on numerous occasions in Iraq and Syria, including in the battlefield in northern Iraq, according to Iraqi and US officials.This is believed to be the first such attack in Mosul since the October start of the offensive to retake Iraqs second most populous city from IS control."
5b2e13299855b7245313d86e,Easing Tax Burden to Industry Benefits: Ten Things You Need to Know about GST,https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/easing-tax-burden-to-industry-benefits-ten-things-you-need-to-know-about-gst/story-v8nyt8dnSlvtOLk18Dd4mO.html,2017-03-05,"The Centre and states agreed on Saturday on two bills crucial to triggering a Goods and Services Tax, virtually clearing the path for a July 1 rollout of the countrys biggest tax reforms since independence.After the 11th GST Council meeting, finance minister Arun Jaitley said the GST council has approved the two legislation -- the Central GST and Integrated GST bills - to replace excise duty and service tax with the GST. The council now has to approve the State GST Bill. The CGST and IGST Bills will have to be approved by the Parliament now and ratified by states.Here are the 10 things that you need to know about the GST regime:1) Constitution amended for GSTThe government amended the Constitution, which requires approval from two-third of members in both the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha, to switch over to GST from the present tax regime at the Centre and states.The Lok Sabha passed the Constitution (One Hundred Twenty Second Amendment) Bill on May 6, 2015.The Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance government took months to bring all opposition parties on board so and move the Bill in Rajya Sabha where the ruling party does not enjoy a majority.On August 3, 2016, the Rajya Sabha approved the Bill after a marathon debate and with some changes. On August 8, the Lok Sabha approved the amended bill.2) India as a common market with one taxThe GST will unify India into a common market with one tax across all states, which will eliminate the present cascading impact of a plethora of central taxes.Central taxes such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Additional Customs Duty and Service Tax will all be merged into one CGST.State levies such as VAT, sales tax, entertainment tax, purchase tax, mandi tax, luxury tax, octroi and entry tax, will be subsumed into SGST.The Centre will levy the Central GST and Integrated GST, while states will impose the SGST.3) Four-slab GST structureThe new regime will have a four-slab structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.There will be no tax on several items including rice, wheat and other essential items, which constitutes 50% of CPI inflation basket.The lowest tax rate of 5% is proposed for items of mass consumption used by common people such as spices, tea and mustard oil.There will be two standard rates of 12% and 18% covering most manufactured items and services.The highest tax rate of 28% will be imposed on items like luxury cars, pan masala, tobacco and aerated drinks. These items are currently attracting a tax of 27-31%.4) States to get compensation if there is revenue lossThe Compensation Bill will ensure states will get fully compensated for the first five years if there is a revenue loss after GST is rolled out.There could an enabling provision in the GST Bills that highest slab could be raised up to 40% to make up for the loss in revenues coming from other items.5) Dual control on assessing taxpayersThe Centre and states will both assess taxpayers having a turnover of over Rs 1.5 crore in turnover annually.States will the power to assess taxpayers below Rs 1.5 crore in turnover.At present, 90% of taxpayers have turnover below Rs 1.5 crore annually and they will be assessed by states.6) How GST will lower tax burdenGST will be a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition.The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages.7) How will consumers benefitConsumers now pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed --- one over the other --- at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.GST will be a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services.GST will eliminate the cascading impact of multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and states, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition. Under GST, there would be only one tax from the manufacturer to the consumer, leading to transparency of taxes paid to the final consumer.8) Will industry benefit from GSTFor India Inc, GST will ensure easier compliance through the GST Network (GSTN) platform. A seamless tax-credit system throughout the value chain and across states will ensure that there is minimal cascading of taxes. This would reduce hidden costs of doing business.All services such as registrations, returns and payments will be available to the taxpayers online, which would make compliance easy and transparent.GST will help India improve its ranking in the ease of doing business.9) GST impact on inflationInitially, GST may lead to a higher inflation as many services and manufactured products get costlier and as compliance improves.However, GST will help moderate inflation in the medium to long term as the cascading impact of taxes goes.10) Will GST help the economyThe GST is widely perceived to help in accelerating economic growth by 1-2 percentage points as it shores up revenues of Centre and states, which can be invested in infrastructure and social schemes.Industry will be able to invest more money in ramping up capacity as the tax burden is reduced, which will propel growth and employment."

While the situation in the Maoist-hit district is slowly improving, its district headquarters mirroring a well-kept small town and Maoist influence being largely pushed into the jungles of Bijapur, Sukma and Narayanpur, senior police officers still identify Katekalyan as a problem area.Yet, Katekalyan has quietly been building another identity  as the nursery of organic farming mushrooming across the district, where farmers have come together to set up a company to market their produce across the country.Gonelu Ram is one such farmer. It isnt paddy season yet, so the crop is assorted  tomatoes, peas, chana and mustard. Standing in front of his lush green fields, he beams as he reels off their names, and then adds an important note. All this is completely organic. The fertlisers I use are what nature gives Cow urine, neem leaves, bitter gourd leaves and besharam patta. My produce has never been better before 90 per cent of Katekalyan has now returned to completely organic farming, he says.Watch What Else is Making NewsTill about five years ago, Ram, like most other farmers across Dantewada district, was caught in a dilemma. Organic fertilisers and indigenous seeds were part of the knowledge passed down to farmers for generations, but the administration, looking at agriculture as a way of reaching out to people in a conflict zone, was sending a different message. The crops that were pushed were homogenous high-yielding varieties that worked best with chemical fertilisers.These high-yielding seeds and the fertilisers were not suited for the microclimate. There was good yield for a while, but the soil soon became unresponsive and it killed the ecosystem around it. There were no fish in the ponds or earthworms in the ground. Now, the district administration is returning to organic methods, and wants to make Dantewada a completely organic farming district, says Akash Badave, who was a PMRDF fellow in Dantewada and has since been working on agricultural improvement in the district.The Indira Gandhi National Agricultural University records 22,000 different varieties of rice found in the state, most unique to it. And Dantewada is no different. Badave says that while no exhaustive study has been done so far, a 10-village sample survey revealed 35 different varieties of rice, with differences in gestation of crop ranging from 60 days to six months.The most important thing is that these communities have known these varieties for a generation, and each has different properties. There are many types of rice that have medicinal qualities, some that are given to lactating mothers, others for joint pain. Then there are millets such as Kosa, which are in high demand elsewhere but are unique to Bastar, he says.The return to traditional farming, with a few tweaks, began during the kharif crop of 2013. The district administration began the process of teaching farmers systems of rice intensification, which included tips like ensuring space between two stalks.The method was used to show that despite no use of fertilisers or high-yielding seeds, productivity could still be high. In 2013, 300 farmers adopted it, and their produce increased three to four times. Now, there are over 2,000 farmers, and 170 small groups of farmers have been formed to go around the district and tell others about the benefits of organic indigenous farming. Its a peer review system, with these groups looking at fields and certifying whether the produce is organic or not, says a senior government official.Those involved in the process realised that the system wouldnt work if there was no market to sell to. So, on August 26, 2016, the Bhumgadhi Organic Farmers Company Limited was set up to package and sell the unique Bastar produce across the country. It has since expanded to include 370 farmers. Each farmer pays Rs 1,000 to buy a share in the company, which in turn buys organic produce and uses state-aided technology to improve the seeds. In the next month or so, district officials plan to procure a processing unit with storage godowns.The administration is incurring some expenditure, but there will be no interest, and the money only has to be paid back in 10 years, by which time the company will have grown. The term Bhumgadhi, fittingly, means the post-harvest festival of prosperity, says Badave, who is the CEO of the company.Dantewada District Collector Saurabh Kumar says they are in touch with buyers from across the country. We are in talks to sell our produce in stores all over the country, such as Udaipur, Chandigarh, and especially in South India where the demand for our produce is very high. We are attempting to fill the vacuum of an available market, he says.A few kilometres short of Katekalyan, on the road from the district headquarters of Dantewada, some residents of Gatam village sit and listen intently to a small team that talks about the producers company. Eighty-six of them belong to an extended family, and they laugh when they are asked to confirm that number. All of us are related, one way or another, and live in one part of Madkampara village, says one of them.But the large family isnt the only thing that is striking. Amid a large swathe of brown, their fields are glistening green. Three big containers are filled with organic fertilisers, made from the waste after the droppings from the mahua tree are converted into local alcohol.Asked if they will be a part of the farmers company, one of them answers: Kucch accha ho raha hai Karenge, hum karenge (Something good is happening we will take part).For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

But political differences over how to divvy up GST revenues or compensate states for lost income because of the new tax held up progress.Once the tax reform comes into effect, consumers will pay a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services. At present, they pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed  one over the other  at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.The proposed GST will have four tax slabs. Farmers and small traders are exempt.The applied rates will be 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%. The cap will be on the higher side, finance minister Arun Jaitley said without elaborating on the higher limit. States want the higher limit set at 40% to obviate the need to go to Parliament every time taxes have to be raised on certain goods and services."

The district officers were unaware when the minister could do the inauguration with the model code of conduct in place.I will have to check on this were all they were willing to say. However, the minister got special permission from the Election Commission, but that did not help. The officials were not sure if they could attend the function or not. When the minister did the inauguration on Sunday, the district officials were not present.Akalis on cloud nine after DSGMC polls winOverjoyed with the partys victory in Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee (DSGMC) elections on March 1, Akali supporters, who are awaiting the poll results in Punjab, have coined a new slogan, Ek nu Dehli, 11 nu Punjab, meaning that they have been victorious in Delhi gurdwara polls and would also win the Punjab assembly polls where the results are due on March 11. The SAD (Badal) staged an impressive victory in Delhi where Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) backed out of the contest. The AAP gave a tough fight to AAP and Congress in Punjab, though.Retd Punjab babu on green missionRetired IAS officer Suresh Kumar is leading another campaign post-retirement, focusing on water-energy-agriculture nexus and crop residue in Punjab. While in service, he led the agriculture department. At a discussion held last week, the thinking heads from the state departments of agriculture, environment, irrigation and power, besides experts from the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), came together to discuss these issues. Kumar managed to involve the United States Agency of International Development (USAID) and Centre for International Projects Trust (CIPT). They have divergent views on some issues, but there was consensus that solutions need to be found before it is too late.Netas of varied huesThe proceedings in the Haryana assembly remained dreary during the first week of the budget session. There were not any great speeches. Clever wordplay was also missing, barring occasional digs by leaders of the ruling and opposition parties at each other. And the most noticeable thing in the 90-member House was the sartorial sense of the legislators  their kurta-pyjamas and sleeveless jackets in pink, purple, red, mustard, green and blue hues. Leading the pack of MLAs sporting colourful clothes was none other than chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar. Like his mentor Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the RSS pracharak-turned-politician has a penchant for wearing colourful jackets and kurtas with white churidaars. Their multi-coloured clothes of the MLAs have not remained unnoticed. They are a talking point among the mandarins and mediapersons.Sulking Haryana BJP legislatorsUpset over neglect, several BJP legislators in Haryana are publicly griping against the functioning of their own government. Though chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had tried to placate them on Thursday, his assurances do not seem to have worked. The 16 miffed MLAs, who have complaining against sautela vyavahar (step-motherly treatment), not only asked the ministers in the House on Friday about the fate of projects announced by the chief minister in their areas. They had another meeting to formulate a joint strategy. Kuch log goad mein baitha rakhe hain. Baki vidayakon ki koi sunwayi nahin hai (Some people are sitting in the lap. Other MLAs are not lent an ear). Officers keep objecting to everything. With what face we will go to the people, one of them grumbled after the meeting. They are now waiting to meet the central leaders after March 11, the day of the assembly results.Envying the neighbourThe grass, they say, is always greener on the other side. Ask the MLAs in Haryana about their status. A number of them feel there is no place like neighbouring Uttar Pradesh where the assembly polls are currently underway. Vidhayak ka bahut roab aur rutba hota hai UP mein (MLA has major influence and status in UP), one of the miffed BJP legislator said. But its not the MLAs. A senior minister also feels this way. Main jab bhi UP jaata hoon toh feel hota hai main mantri hoon (When I go to UP, I get the feeling that I am a minister), an outspoken minister said while chatting with reporters on the sidelines of the ongoing budget session. He attributed the difference to size of the two states. Being a small state, the officers are in direct contact with the CM or his staff, and do not pay attention to legislators, he said.Dhankars killer dialogueSmiles were rife at a press conference held by agriculture minister OP Dhankar the other day on the forthcoming agri-leadership summit in Surajkund. Asked about absence of adequate marketing for farm produce from the state, he amused the newspersons and officials alike by quoting a dialogue of Bollywood film Raees. Us film mein Shah Rukh Khan kahta hai, Gujarat ki hawa mein vyapaar hai, mein chahata hoon Haryana ki hawa mein bhi vyapaar ho, he said while exhorting the state farmers to look at market demand prior to sowing. The smiles turned into laughter when the minister was elaborating upon inviting progressive farmers and a journalist suggested that officials supposed to invite them could have easily met them together at dharna spots where the Jats are holding protests. However, the joke did not amuse the minister.Dharamshala as 2nd HP capital: BJP takes divergent standChief minister Virbhadra Singhs move to give second capital status to Dharamshala has been hailed by his party colleagues from Kangra district, but the opposition has been giving confusing signals. Congress MLA from Jawalamukhi Sanjay Rattan recently not only heaped praise on the CM for the decision, but also urged Virbhadra to construct his private residence there. Before the CM even responded, Dehra legislator Ravinder Singh Ravi, who belongs to the BJP, warned urban development minister Sudhir Sharma that Rattans suggestion was aimed at displacing him from Dharamshala. However, Shimla MLA Suresh Bhardwaj, who is also from BJP, has openly criticised the decision. He is blaming the minister, seen as the CMs blue-eyed boy, for the move. Its not Virbhadras decision. Sharma has mesmerised him, Bhardwaj says.Himachal CPS told to play it coolKnown as Congress loose cannon, chief parliamentary secretary Neeraj Bharti hurls accusations at not only members of the opposition BJP, but at his own party colleagues on social media. Those at the receiving end include transport minister GS Bali and his son Raghuvir Singh Bali. Raghuvir, who is secretary, Himachal Congress, had a word of advice for Bharti when the latter was abroad. People elected by popular vote should show restraint while speaking on public platforms, he said during a short visit to Bharti assembly constituency, Jawali.(Contributed by Aseem Bassi, Gurpreet Singh Nibber, Navneet Sharma, Rajesh Moudgil, Gaurav Bisht, Naresh K Thakur)"

Northern India and Chile are globally the only two regions with high incidence of gall bladder cancer, which has prompted researchers to look for answers.This was the first time a largescale study involving 1,400 patients was undertaken by the Parel-based hospital along with the United States National Cancer Institute.The research team studied over 7 lakh single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in patients. SNPs make up the genes in a body. The research found that all patients had mutations of the ABCB4 and ABCB1 genes, which may be responsible for increased risk of gall bladder cancer.Watch What Else is Making NewsThe Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is going to conduct research in north India following the Lancet report to understand the causes for and treatment of the disease.Gall bladder cancer has high variability in India. It is common in some regions and absent in others. ICMR will do further research, said ICMR director Dr Saumya Swaminathan.Gall bladder cancers incidence is 14 per lakh population in women and 7.4 per lakh population in men in regions where the Ganga and Brahmaputra rivers flow. In other parts of India, the incidence is close to zero, with South India having incidence of 0.7 per lakh population.ABCB4 and ABCB1 genes are responsible for transport mechanisms from the liver to gall bladder. Mutation in ABCB4 and ABCB1 gene can affect bile formation and increase salt in body. This can cause cancer, said the author of the study, Professor Rajesh Dikshit.According to another author of the study, Dr Preetha Rajaraman of the National Cancer Institute, the mutation can increase gall bladder cancer risk by 50 per cent. This research opens up scope for more study. This is the first time such a large research on the gall bladder has been conducted to point at gene mutation, she said.The Tata Memorial Hospital, along with Banaras Hindu University and the Dr B Borooah Cancer Institute in Guwahati, will work on research papers to measure if gall bladder cancer is caused by heavy metals found in the Ganga and the Brahmaputra, if local tobacco and mustard oil consumption may be responsible, and whether specific bacteria found in the two rivers could lead to increased cancer risk.Our future research will throw more light on whether a cluster of factors, including genetic mutation, are responsible for gall bladder cancer. This cancer is being passed on for generations in that belt, said principal author Dr Sharayu Mhatre.Gall bladder cancer is usually detected in advanced stages because of lack of symptoms to help early detection. At least 70 per cent patients are diagnosed in the advanced stages which leaves them with three to five years to live. The initial symptoms are mild stomach pain and gas formation, which develops into jaundice in advanced stage.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The research, published in The Lancet Oncology on Monday, is being seen as a path-breaking genome study that will help scientists understand gall bladder cancer better and lead to better diagnosis and treatment.The study, conducted in collaboration with the US National Cancer Institute, Johns Hopkins University and TMH has tracked down the presence of two genes, ABCB4 and ABCB1, associated with gall bladder cancer risk. It was carried out by comparing 1,000 gall bladder cancer patients and 1,700 people with no history of cancer.According to Dr. Rajesh Dikshit of TMH, one of the researchers involved in the study, people with these gene variations are at a 1.5-time higher risk of being afflicted with gall bladder cancer. This is the first large scale study to identify common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). These are individual base pair changes in DNA that may increase the risk in an individual. More such investigations will be carried out in the country to explore complexities, he said.The prevalence of gall bladder cancer varies from region to region, but more cases have been found in the countrys north and northeast and along the Gangetic belt, which makes these regions prime locations for further studies. In the past, studies have mostly focussed on the history of gall stones in gall bladder cancer. While gall stones are commonly linked with increased risk of gall bladder cancer, doctors say the percentage is miniscule.Further study plannedTo take the study forward, TMH researchers have already tied up with the Banaras Hindu University in Varanasi and the Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute in Guwahati to look at other factors contributing to increased risk. Aspects like the high metal exposure in the Gangetic belt, increased tobacco consumption and usage of mustard oil, which is common in this region, are some factors that can be studied further, Dr. Dikshit said.Dr. Abhijit Talukdar, an oncologist with the Dr. B. Borooah Cancer Institute, said the plans are in a preliminary stage. We are in talks with TMH doctors and will start the study to track down lifestyle factors once we have a plan in place.Cancer of the gall bladder, which stores bile (digestive fluid produced by the liver), is said to be uncommon. These cancers are detected in late stages due to which the prognosis is poor.The highest number of cases comes from Chile and other Central or South American countries, East and South Asia including India. Gall bladder cancer occurs more commonly in women. There is a need for much larger population-based studies. However, this is the first time anyone has looked at genetic markers for increased risk of gall bladder cancer. Researchers can now take it up from here and carry out further studies, Dr. Preetha Rajaraman with the NCI said.People with these gene variations are at a 1.5-time higher risk of getting gall bladder cancerDr. Rajesh DikshitTata Memorial Hospital"

The residents of Odia basti, located near Dussehra Maidan, not only provided a timely succour, but also caught the attention of Bhopal residents with their benevolent nature.""The people of the Odia basti did their best to help the victims. Their aid in the rescue operation was commendable,"" said Dr DK Satpathy. Over time, the community has made the city its home, and have become part and parcel of Bhopal's rich composite culture.Former director of medico-legal institute Dr DK Satpathy was one of the first Odia community members to come to the city. Turning nostalgic, he said, ""I came here way back in 1968. There were just 20 to 22 of us here then.""Now, the city of lakes has become the second home to 1000-odd Odia families. The unmatched weather and beauty of the city was one of the main reasons for the community to come calling to Bhopal. Many of them say that the local climate here keeps them reminding of the pleasant weather in their original homeland -- land of Lord Jagannath.Another major attraction for the community was BHEL which provided a great job opportunity to the educated community that was in search of greener pastures. ""Between 2006 and 2008, there was a buzz about recruitment in BHEL. Hence, many people from Sambalpur and Kalahandi and other parts of Odisha came to Bhopal. Today, we are in thousands,"" said Sanjeeb Nanda.The community also brought with it the rich traditions of their state and integrated them seamlessly with the local culture. Being a vibrant and dynamic community, it has helped in enriching the society immensely. ""In order to help our community members integrated, we organise frequent meetings which traditional Odia sweets and home-made rice vadas,"" said Arun Kumar Hota, one of the active members of the society. ""I have been here for 14 years. Bhopal is now my home. I love the climate of Bhopal. It reminds me of my childhood days in Odisha,"" he added.The Odia community has a rich range of cuisines which have also become popular among the local populace. Delicacies like 'chhenapod', 'ambil', 'monda', 'pitha' and 'kheer' continue to titillate the taste buds of Bhopal residents with their unique aroma and flavour. ""Odias and Rathyatra are inseparable. I came to Bhopal 15 years back. Every year during sukla paksha, we hold Rathyatra. We prepare anna, dalma, laal bhaji and kheer for Lord Jagannath's bhog,"" said Arun Ponda, priest of the Jagannath temple near Jawahar Chowk.""Last year in Nuakhai festival, we made the statue of Samaleswari Devi with thermocol. Sambalpuri saris and pattachitra were also put on display. We also invite some celebrity to grace the occasion. Last year, Padma Shri Halder Nag, an eminent poet, attended the event,"" said Prashant Kumar Oram.Nuakhai: Falls between September and October.

(Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Beekeeper Dinkar Patil (centre) with pomegranate farmers of Agoti village in Maharashtras Pune district. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)As Dhananjay Takle moves around the fruit-laden trees in his three-acre pomegranate farm, he cant but recall the scene just over five months back. This farmer from Agoti village in Indapur taluka of Pune district had a real scare when the same 1,000-odd trees werent setting fruit, despite good flowering.Watch What Else Is Making NewsI had planted pomegranate for the first time and invested around Rs 6 lakh in inputs, including labour. The trees started flowering towards September-end. But the flowers, instead of developing into fruits, were simply dropping, he notes. Consultation with other farmers in his village revealed that the flower drop had to do with the lack of pollination. There werent enough honey bees and other pollinating insects in and around his fields to transfer pollen from the stamen (male organ) of one flower to the stigma (female part) of the other. The result: No fertilisation and fruit formation.Takle, then, followed the advice of his fellow-farmers: Take beehive boxes, each containing a colony of 20,000-30,000 insects, on hire and install them in the field, as some of them had done earlier. I contacted Dinkar Patil, a bee keeper from Latur, who rented out three boxes for my orchard. By early November, 90 per cent of the trees started bearing fruits and I hope to harvest around 20 tonnes of pomegranate in the next 15 days. Without those bees, all my hard work would have gone waste, he says.The importance of honeybees to agriculture  more specifically, the role that the tiny-winged insects play in pollination  is too well-known to require elaboration. Not as well recognised a reality, however, is the destruction of beehives that the indiscriminate usage of pesticides have wrought and, in turn, contributed to a not-insignificant agricultural crisis. Theres no better proof of that than farmers like Takle today having to hire beehive boxes to aid in pollination.Highly cross-pollinated crops like onion, cotton, oilseeds and most fruits and vegetables depend entirely on winged insects that, during their flights to collect nectar, also transport pollen from one flower to another. Honeybees are best suited to perform this function. Our experiments have shown an average 30 per cent increase in crop yields  from 17-19 per cent for cotton to 48 per cent in sunflower and 150-170 per cent in lychees  if honeybees are artificially introduced in the fields during the flowering stage even in normal conditions, informs Laxmi Rao, assistant director of the Pune based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).Not for nothing, then, that as pollinator insect populations have seen reduction  linked to factors from widespread pesticide application and mono-cropping to climate change  it has spawned a business of artificial introduction of beehive boxes. In Maharashtra, there are professional beekeepers now charging farmers anywhere from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 for renting out boxes for a month.Dinkar Patil has doing this for the last 15 years. Proprietor of the Latur-based Patil Bee Keepers, he was initially supplying beehive boxes to companies producing onion and vegetable seeds. But in recent years, he has noticed an increasing demand from even farmers for his pollination services. Much of it is from pomegranate, oilseeds and mustard growers, who have reported sharp dip in the natural bee numbers in their areas. The demand-supply gap is huge, because I myself get queries for 5,000 beehive boxes a year, but am in a position to fulfill barely a fifth of these. There were orders for around 500 boxes from pomegranate farmers in Indapur alone last year, but I could provide only 50, claims Patil, who owns and rents out 700 boxes round the year.A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Beekeeping, promoted as a cottage industry by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, has so far focused mainly on honey. But now, a new demand avenue has opened up for beekeepers  in the form of pollinators-on-hire services. The beehive boxes are kept for a month or so during the flowering season. Once fruit-setting happens, the boxes are removed and taken to the field of the next crop whose flowering is due. Since flowering happens for different crops all through the year, barring the peak summer and monsoon months, there is a steady demand for the services offered by the likes of Patil.Patil maintains colonies of Apis mellifera or European honeybees that normally travel within an area of four square-km area to collect nectar and pollinate flowers. On the other hand, Vipin Mahajan, another beekeeper from Talegaon Dabhade, a town in Punes Mawal taluka, employs Apis trigona bees. The former species require regular supplementary feeding of concentrated sugar solution to ensure no starvation, but the bees dont migrate and farmers only need to install one box per acre.The trigona bees require less maintenance, but the requirement is three boxes per acre. Also, mellifera beehives can survive for three years, whereas trigona hives need to be re-populated every year.According to CBRTIs Rao, the lack of trained bee breeders is a major concern. This is even more so in a scenario where the destruction of the natural habitat for bee populations is already impacting pollination in major crops. There can be no second Green Revolution without conservation of honey bees. Farmers need to be sensitised about the importance of the winged visitors to their fields, she points out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

When it is their cue to enter and perform, they squeeze each others hands in encouragement.Sunish Surendran /Stella Subbiahand Justin McCarthyJustin is tall, slender and has a beatific smile that never leaves his face. Stella is petite, and in a resplendent red sari, sports a vivacious look of joy throughout the performance.The long-time collaborators devised a show, titled Vastramaranam (weaving memories) as a Bharathanatyam dancers response to the sari, an homage to Kalakshetra founder Rukmini Devis love for Kanjeevaram saris.Stella, who is based in London, hails from Patna and trained at Kalakshetra as a recipient of a merit scholarship from the Government of India. She went on to perform for 13 years as the lead dancer in the Kalakshetra dance company, touring the world under the direction of Rukmini Devi.This show highlights memories with textile, Stella tells me when I ask her for the motivation behind the piece. The motifs on a South Indian sari  the flora and the fauna  are all present in music and dance too. The interconnectedness is obvious. The inside of the mind and the outside of the body are intertwined.Born and raised in Michigan, Justin moved to India 37 years ago. A disciple of renowned Bharathanatyam dancer, Leela Samson, he relinquished his American citizenship to become an Indian. Based in Delhi, Justin performs across the world and also teaches dance and music.This show reminds me of what initially attracted me to India  the fascination that I had for this single piece of cloth that doesnt have to be stitched, that can serve so many purposes.I love the sari and the dhoti. I remember first looking at Rukmini Devis Vasantha Valli sari, a beautiful mustard sari with parrots on it. That was more than 30 years ago, and I still remember its beauty.This is the fourth time that Justin and Stella are working together. We really enjoy collaborating, says Justin. Both Stella and I dont stick to what is happening in the world of mainstream Bharathanatyam  we are always striving to go beyond it. We are fellow anarchists and she is a kindred spirit, he laughs.We dont believe in hierarchy in dance, Stella affirms. We are bound together by our desire to critically engage in our work. We carry colonial history in our mind, body and everything. We need to engage in critical analysis through art. This doesnt mean taking a side, but it means finding connections.Justins and Stellas trajectories, while very similar in terms of their shared love for dance and the importance of critical dialogue within the art form, have taken them to different parts of the world. But collaborations such as these bring them together, and both of them speak at least three to four languages each, creating connections wherever they are.Any move challenges you, Stella tells me. When I moved to the UK, I didnt want to work in a cultural context. For me, dance should be dance and not a source of cultural identity. It should be something I can take anywhere and share with anybody.Yes, we use the text, the tunes and the philosophy that are rooted in cultural history, but that should not overshadow the dance itself.Home for Justin is India, but he does miss his family back in the US. But I see them often, he says, smiling. I know Im Indian because comfort food for me is hot rice and ghee. Though I have to say, he pauses, someone introduced me to hot rice and coconut oil today; it was just delicious."

Those fighters have used crude chemical weapons, including chlorine and low-grade sulphur mustard.But while the weapons have hurt civilians, U.S. officials do not believe that they have been militarily effective.NYT"

Picture by Gautam Dey Ranchi, March 11: Unseasonal rains and western disturbances coupled with local phenomenon resulting in thunderstorms and squalls in some isolated places in Jharkhand are being seen as a boon by agricultural experts in the state. According to Birsa Agriculture University's (BAU) agro-meteorological division scientist A. Wadud, the current phenomenon will help the soil retain its moisture and assist crops in the upcoming rabi season. ""This same condition with a few spells of drizzle and light rain is expected to continue for the next couple of days. This will be highly beneficial for crops, but if it turns into heavy rains, accompanied with hail and thunderstorm, it can have an adverse impact,"" he said. ""Heavy rains will wash away the seeds of wheat, fruits and other allied crops sown in this season. However, moderate rains will be beneficial for a state such as Jharkhand where irrigation facilities are still not up to the mark. There are few standing crops such as wheat and mustard at the moment and harvesting of green peas is yet to happen,"" he added. A BAU advisory for March 8-12 has asked farmers to postpone the harvesting of any rabi crops and store the harvested crops in a safe place. ""Farmers may utilise this rain to sow green gram (moong) and vegetables and spray urea over crops. Inter-culture operations should be done to preserve the moisture for a longer duration,"" it stated. Wadud said those looking to cultivate green gram, may use the rain to prepare their fields for sowing. R.P. Singh 'Ratan', director extension education of BAU, said they had not received any report of excessive rains in Jharkhand from any district. ""The most important thing is that the developments have created a favourable condition for vegetable crops. Rainfall that has happened is isolated pockets will be good for the soil,"" he said. According to the Ranchi Met office, a cyclonic circulation in the upper air over north Chhattisgarh and its neighbouring areas have weakened. ""While there is a possibility of rain with thunderstorms in isolated pockets of the state, especially in the northern region after late Saturday afternoon, there is no such possibility on Sunday,"" a Met official said.

Later, the World Health Organisation raised the number of the affected to 12. According to WHO, and authorities at the West Erbil Emergency Hospital, the symptoms, such as blisters, redness in the eyes, irritation, vomiting and coughing, are that of chemical attacks.Who is behind the assaultThe needle of suspicion points to the IS. The attack happened in the eastern part of Mosul, which has for weeks been under the Iraqi troops control. The city has been divided into east and west by the Tigris river. When the Iraqi troops began the battle for Mosul in October 2016, they started by attacking the eastern suburbs of the city, slowing making moves into the ISs power centres. The citys administrative buildings and airport are in the western part. Though eastern Mosul is liberated, in early March, it was within reach of IS fighters rockets and mortar shells from the west. One theory is that the IS is targeting more civilians at a time when it is facing a huge military setback.Chemical warfare capabilityThis is not the first time the IS has been accused of using chemical weapons. In September and October last year, IS fighters launched at least three chemical attacks in Qayyarah, 60 km south of Mosul. The attacks came after the town was recaptured by Iraqi troops. They caused painful burns to at least seven people consistent with exposure to low levels of a chemical warfare agent known as vesicants, or blister agents, the Human Rights Watch reported in November. According to the IHS Conflict Monitor, a London-based intelligence collection and analysis service, the IS has used chemical weapons, including chlorine and sulfur mustard agents, at least 52 times on battlefields in Syria and Iraq since 2014.U.S. military officials have repeatedly warned of the ISs chemical warfare capabilities. Chlorine is commercially available as an industrial chemical, and terrorist groups often use it to make bombs. But its not clear from where IS got sulfur mustard, a chemical warfare agent.The regime of Saddam Hussein and that of Bashar al-Assad in Syria had possessed the weapons earlier. The Saddam regime is gone, and Syria gave up its chemical weapons as part of an international agreement to avoid American invasion. It is believed that the IS is involved in its production. In January, when the Iraqi troops recaptured Mosul University from IS, they found chemistry labs had been converted into makeshift weapons labs. Later, troops discovered mustard chemical warfare agent in the eastern part of the city.The use of chemical and biological weapons is a war crime. Efforts to eradicate their use date back to the 19th century and the first universal ban came into effect after First World War.In 1997, the Chemical Weapons Convention treaty prohibited the use and production of chemical weapons. At least 190 states have so far accepted the treaty, while 93% of the worlds declared stockpile of chemical weapons have been destroyed. But these regulations are meant for nation-states, whereas the attack in Mosul suggests that non-state terrorist actors also possess chemical weapons capabilities. As of now, the threats they pose could be minimal as their capacity to make high-grade weapons and delivery systems may be limited. Still, terror groups possessing chemical weapons poses a challenge to the international security architecture.Stanly Johny"

It rained heavily at many places in Bhind, Morena and Sheopur districts during the last three days. Farmers of the area expecting bumper yield are now a concerned lot. Bheron Singh, a farmer in Morena's Jaura village, said, ""I had harvested the crop and the produce was lying in the fields. After rainfall and hail, the dry mustard beans were damaged extensively. At some places the mustard seeds have come out before time, affecting its quality.""Similarly, in Mandsaur, Neemuch and Ratlam region, the opium crop has been affected at many places. At some places the process of extracting latex from the opium fruit is over, but at other places the process is on and the farmers have borne the brunt of the weather conditions, said Ram Singh Chouhan, a farmer.""The latex gets diluted, affecting the quality of opium,"" he said, adding there is no mechanism to calculate the damage caused to the crop. A cooperative and BJP leader, Chouhan said the crop should be included in the category of masala (spices) and covered under the PM crop insurance scheme.Agriculture minister Gaurishankar Bisen said, ""Though it has not rained much, we are waiting for the field reports to understand the impact of the rainfall."" Crop has also been affected in the districts of Bundelkhand following a spell of rainfall. Changing weather pattern has become a regular feature now, said Fazal Mehmood, a farmer in Chhatarpur. ""Every time our crops are damaged we have no other option but to look at the government for help,"" he added."

The government purchases mustard through its agency -- National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation (NAFED).

Being in this industry, you really need to stay fit. Our job involves long hours, lot of food, interacting with people and the need to look fresh through it all. Looking back at a near three-decade career, the only thing I would have done differently would probably be taking up international opportunities earlier on in my career for better exposure.I think what the city needs to change about its culinary scene is keeping the food warm from the first bite to the last. Take a naan for instance. Some hotels serve huge pieces that become rubber by the time you get to the middle. So portions are something Chennai needs to really consider. Also, there are curry leaves in almost everything. Why?As a chef, You need to know the source. If youre near the sea, why should you accept frozen fish? Its crucial to eat your local produce!What is special about each cuisine is the technique. Down south, we find such refined spices and processes of cooking while Bengal has a milder palette with a lot of mustard. Same way, you see variations in Italian and Mediterranean cuisines. Cooking processes are a lot more complex in south than north  lot of minute nuances to keep in mind. Coming here, I learnt that curd rice is best served when it never touches the fridge. The beauty of food is that irrespective of cuisine, the basics are the same; its all a matter of improvisation.I am fond of Italian and eastern Mediterranean food. The grills of Syria  their kebabs and Lebanese maizes are my favourite. I prefer a lighter palette rather than something too spice heavy. I want the essence of the base  be it vegetables or meat  to come through first. Our spices should enhance and not mask the base.I have made a few mistakes as a chef; there was a guest who ordered paneer tikka butter masala. I sent him a chicken tikka butter masala instead. He was quite exasperated and never came back to our hotel for a year. When he returned, I made the same mistake. What are the odds, of the same mistake happening to the same person!My advice to aspiring chefs out there would just be  do not follow TV shows blindly. While popular culture does do justice in its representation, the culinary world goes much beyond that and is as exciting as its challenging. The youth have an aggression about them thats commendable. It just needs good channeling."

Members of Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) met Udaipur collector Thursday demanding set up of Rabi crop procuring centers at various places.""State government failed in facilitating purchase of groundnut crop earlier. Now, after Rabi crops have been harvested, the government has taken no steps to procure them at minimum support price,"" said Partha Dangi , district president of BKS. As government agencies have not started buying the crops, farmers especially in remote tribal areas are forced to sell their crops to private agencies for petty amount, he added. There had been reasonably well production of wheat, chana dal, mustard rapeseed during Rabi season.""It is a double whammy for us, the farmers. First, we didn't have money for sowing and payments of agriculture inputs like seeds and fertilizers. Marginalised farmers took loans and managed to complete sowing.

A strong smell of mustard oil and incense, overlaid with sweat, pervades the room on Slaughterhouse Road in Shivaji Nagar, an old part of Bengaluru where tradition still holds sway despite a rapidly changing neighbourhood.Inside the room, a group of young men clad only in langotis, their bodies glistening with mustard oil, are chatting with each other.  Dand maro (do push-ups), shouts a middle-aged, bearded man, sitting on a wooden stool. No one dares to ignore coach Ansar Pehalwan. This traditional gymnasium  akhada or garadi mane or taleem for the locals  is a far cry from the sleek, modern gyms, lined with a machine for every muscle. Instead of elliptical trainers and treadmills, weights of stones and huge spades line one end of the wall.As part of the warm-up routine, the students have to dig up the red mud on the floor of the workout area and level it again.However, going by the number of school and college students as well as professionals practising, these old school garadi manes are holding their own against the new gyms on the block. It does help that the training sessions here are free of cost.According to the people running these traditional gyms, their clientele has increased after the success of Bollywood films like Sultan and Dangal .Many have now started opting for the garadi manes as the training techniques we teach them have been passed down from one generation to another, said Ansar Pehalwan.No room for womenBut a Geeta Phogat would not get a look in here  the garadi manes have always been and remain a male bastion. The youngest of the boys in Ansars group is Arfat, a Class 7 student of the Jamia Ulm School in the City Market.At 13, he performs the rigorous exercise with grace and ease. I do a 1,000 push-ups and squats everyday. After school, I come here and work out, he said.Sufian, a shy 17-year-old smiles, and starts oiling his body. These traditional methods have increased my focus in academics, he said, swinging a sturdy, wooden club over his head.Its not just students who patronise the garadi manes. Young professionals, including engineers, film directors and the odd doctor, train here.An older conventionA few kilometres away, at the Ustad Pehlwan Kale Bhai Garadi, also in Shivaji Nagar, practice sessions have begun. Twenty-eight-year-old S. Karthik, an engineer who works with a mobile phone company, is busy digging the red sand on which the wrestlers practise kusthi (wrestling).Every wrestler has to level the mud as a warm-up exercise. I used to visit a modern gym earlier. But here the exercises are more functional and build immense stamina, which is useful in gripping the opponent during wrestling, he said.Apart from Shivaji Nagar, Ulsoor also boasts these traditional gymnasiums. One of them is the Muthialamma Garadi Mane, founded by Pehalwan Srinappa, Though hidden by the Someshwara Temple, the garadi is frequented by many youngsters in the mornings and evenings.Its where Kushal Raj, a final-year aeronautical engineering student trains. I joined this place more than a year ago. My body got toned in a few months. Though I took a break for three months, I did not put on weight unlike what happens when you discontinue the [mechanised] gym workout, he said.Software engineer Ahmed Kashif (28), who works out in the Ustad Pehlwan Kale Bhai Garadi, says most white-collared professionals have inhibitions about taking part in kusthi . Many feel awkward when they smear their bodies with mud. But these workouts have a long lasting effect, he concurs.For coaches like Ansar and Arif, who oversee the Ustad Pehlwan Kale Bhai, garadi manes are more than just a place to exercise in. Here, Hindus and Muslims practise together. There is no religion when it comes to wrestling on the mud, said Arif Pehalwan.Despite dire predictions of their demise, garadi manes continue to attract enthusiasts. Ansar Pehalwan, who has wrestled for over 40 years, says he wants to keep the spirit of these physical workouts alive, and hopes that it will become mainstream once again.

Families of farmers were seen harvesting their crops.Lale khan, a farmer, said, ""It rained for almost half an hour and there was hailstorm. They have damaged our crops.""Similar swing in the weather was witnessed in Jodhpur and nearby areas on Saturday evening following hailstorm and rains, which dealt a blow to standing crops. The shift in weather brought down the temperature.The Met department has predicted more hailstorm and drizzle to moderate rain in the next 24 hours in the district.Since morning on Saturday, it was cloudy in Jodhpur which brought the temperature down from the previous day. But the weather in the district changed suddenly in the afternoon with clouds turning darker. By evening, a sand storm had hit the city, which was immediately followed by hailstorm in many places in rural areas and rain, which continued intermittently.According to a farmer, Tulsaram Sivar, the hailstorm flattened the crops in many areas of the district like Phalodi, Osian, Mathania, etc.He claimed that crops of gram, cumin, mustard, etc., suffered due to hailstorm and rain. The cold wave and rain have spelled doom for crop that's ready for harvest."
58ff0ddf7be9e0429666d000,Mindless Development Is Threatening Our Commons,http://www.hindustantimes.com/columns/mindless-development-is-threatening-our-commons/story-JoMsB14PMUyIbM1cmdUTnO.html,2017-03-20,"Yamuna Khadar is downstream from Wazirabad, not far from where the river enters Delhi. Its a very different river from the one you see from the ITO Bridge or Nizamuddin Bridge. To see the river, you go down Outer Ring Road, past the University and Timarpur, and turn off towards the Yamuna Biodiversity Park.Then you weave your way through the dusty by-lanes of Jagatpur, just another one of those urban villages that dot Delhi, till you reach the fields bordering the river. Concrete roads cut across the fields of vegetables and mustard to the river, jutting like grey-brown fingers on green baize.If you are lucky, and it is the right time of the year, you may see Red Crested Pochards, not inside the biodiversity park, but in one of the agricultural ponds surrounding the fields. The large diving duck that comes to India from Europe and central Asia is unmistakable. The males have a bright orange head and a striking red bill.The fields themselves are home to the Red Avadavat, a pretty red bird that belongs to the munia family, Scaly-Breasted Munia, weavers of various kinds, chiff-chaffs, warblers, and other common birds. Eurasian Marsh Harriers are common, Eurasian Hobbies not so (although you may see them). And in the winter months, the air is filled with Black- and Brown-Headed Gulls, and the occasional Pallass Gull.Then the road (no matter which one you are on) ends abruptly, and you are at the river. On a typical day, you may find some people bathing here, others immersing the ashes of the dead, and still others just hanging around. The bank is usually littered with garbage, plastic bottles, marigold garlands, shiny packs that one served as homes for chips or biscuits. Lapwings (you may spot two varieties usually, three if it is your day) and larks dot the banks. The water is unexpectedly clean (or at least looks clean).In the winter months it is filled with gulls and the kind of ducks you see in Delhi in those months  Northern Shovellers, Northern Pintails, Eurasian Wigeons, two or three kinds of pochards.One afternoon, I sat by the bank and watched the dying sunlight leap off the russet brown bodies of a huge flock of Ruddy Shelducks. We (my son and wife were with me) ticked off around 60 species that day (many others have seen more)  not exactly a high number in Delhi where you can see 30 species in your garden.Indeed, Delhi and its environs are a birders delight and dismay. One year, a bunch of us, in a convoy of seven cars, drove 90-100 km away to Dighal to see a rare Marbled Teal that had somehow strayed into India. The bird was in an agricultural pond, in the middle of a village. It wasnt a particularly clean village; we had to watch our step. A Peregrine Falcon makes its home in a tall TV tower in West Delhi. It is seen there every year.Most people associate birds with forests. At the least, they expect a green area earmarked as a sanctuary, or a water body surrounded by greenery, like Haryanas Sultanpur National Park. Yet, there is better birding to be had in the fallow and cultivated fields and scrubland behind the park that birders call Sultanpur Flats.And in a place not too far away from Sultanpur, Basai, near what is touted as the regions next hot real estate zone, developments adjoining the Dwarka Expressway. There is even better birding to be had along a drainage canal in Najafgarh. The Aravalli Biodiversity Park, Basai, Sultanpur, Bhindawas, Dighal  all are probably hotspots in the Central Asian Flyway, a migratory path from Europe and Central Asia to the Indian peninsula that birds have been using for hundreds, maybe thousands of years. A few of the hotspots have become national parks. Many are privately owned agricultural land or commons.Across India, the commons are under threat and the owners of agricultural land are selling their holdings thanks to the relentless development of our cities. In Basai, real estate developments have sprung up in fields once homes to thousands of waders and Bar-Headed and Greylag Geese. The birds still come, flying over the Himalayas en route, although their numbers are dwindling.On the other side, in Uttar Pradesh, the huge lake near Beel Akbarpur in Dadri (Greater Noida), and the surrounding marshes that were once home to thousands of waders and ducks is gone, consumed by developments including a large Ansal project and a university funded by Shiv Nadar, an IT-billionaire-turned-philanthropist.In 2014, a birder photographed a Lesser Florican in the stub of grassland that remains behind the university. The bird, a bustard, is named in Schedule I of the Indian Wildlife Act  promising it absolute protection. To be sure, it could have been a vagrant. And to be sure, birds have shown far more resilience to the inexorable march of progress than many other species.Not far from Dadri is Dhanauri Kalan, made famous by happenings in an adjacent hamlet Bhatta where farmers protested that they werent getting fair value for land being acquired by real estate developers. The commons here are home to the largest roost of Sarus Cranes near Delhi. Ive seen up to 120-125 of them playing, dancing, and calling in unison. But Dhanauri was lucky. Thanks to the efforts of an environmentalist, Anand Arya, it was classified a wetland.Many other commons are not as fortunate.In India, no one really associates the commons with the environment, which is not surprising in a country where most people think removing weeds and scrubs from a plot and replacing them with Australian grass is actually good for the environment.R Sukumar is editor, Mintletters@hindustantimes.com"

The first-of-its-kind study has recommended 5% annual increase in funds for agricultural research to achieve additional 1% growth in Total Factor Productivity (TFP) in agriculture sector.Department of Agricultural Economics at JAU, Junagadh, conducted the study 'Total Factor Productivity (TFP) of major crops and contribution of research investment to agricultural growth in Gujarat'. Scientists involved in the study say that this was the first ever comprehensive study undertaken in Gujarat.Based on the study, scientists recommended that to attain targeted agricultural growth, investment in agricultural research and extension education needs to be increased at the rate of 5% per annum.The study conducted by R L Shiyani, M G Dhandhliya and V D Tarpara, while Haresh Chavda analyzed the TFP growth of major crops of Gujarat between 1990-91 and 2011-12, and the factors affecting it.""In the past, major sources of growth in agricultural production were area and yield. However, the future growth has to be essentially driven by increase in yields. There is a compelling need for sustained efforts to increase production of essential items like cereals, pulses and edible oils among others. Faced with limits to further expansion of cultivated land and slowing returns to further input intensification, productivity growth assumes a central role in meeting the challenges of the future,"" scientists said.""Major crops of Gujarat have experienced a strong technological growth in the last two decades, except bajra and sesame. The internal rate of return to public investment in agricultural research ranged from 27% in case of mustard to about 75% for cumin with the overall average of 42% for major crops of Gujarat. Proper management of agronomical practices to keep production cost low and proper price incentive to keep pace with other crops in the state, are equally important,"" the study stated.In fact, the study revealed that cumin has given highest internal rate of returns (in last two decades) with 74.9% annually. In value of marginal product term, the farmer has received Rs 22.37 against expenditure of extra Re 1 in input cost in castor.The study has analyzed the role of public sector investment in agricultural research to increase output growth and estimates the contribution of agricultural research to Gujarat's economy and attainment of food self-sufficiency. Researchers selected groundnut, cotton, castor, sesame, mustard, bajra, paddy, wheat, gram, tur (pigeon pea) and cumin for the study."

In the interim, the space has been closed for business or used for sundry events.I was 26 then, and I am 42 now. The people that converged every Thursday to experience metal and rock are older now, and that is what makes the nostalgia precious. It is a pure delight to know the iconic space is reopening, he tells us over the phone. For as little as Rs. 100, the rocker boys in their black tees and long manes would make their way to Razzberry for the love of live music. They didnt pay that well, but bands still wanted to play there to gather street cred, says Poddar.We now fast forward to the present; one side of the wall leading to Juhu Hotel has got a fresh layer of graffiti. We enter the garden, and plop onto sofas on the deck with the view of the sea before us. The 20,000-sq.ft. space also offers an indoor razz bar, a bistro and patio seating. The thatched roof from the 90s remains intact. The attic will be converted into a whiskey lounge soon. The dark teakwood and tufted leather seating gives the renovated space a fresh sophisticated look.Mixologist Nitin Tiwari, the man behind some of Indias most popular bar menus, from Toast and Tonic in Bengaluru, It Happened in New York and Masque in Mumbai, is on board as director with Razzberry Rhinoceros and has created an interesting root-to-fruit menu. Tiwari gets us started with sweet lime and sage (Rs. 600), a smooth drink with the mild bitterness from sweet lime blending well with the herby sage and strong gin.The all-new Razzberry has five different menus at its five different areas. Chef Ranveer Brar is in charge of the kitchen, so we know we will be fed in style. We begin with truffle milky mushroom galouti (Rs. 375), which has a velvety keema texture, spiced with cardamom, cinnamon, and truffle oil. We love the mini coin pudina pyaaz lachha parathas that come with it. It is served with bocconcini, strawberries and a delicious truffle cream. A wasabi beetroot hummus, served with house-made ricotta cheese and bajra crisps, lacks the spicy zing of wasabi (Rs. 545). The grilled kasundi prawns are juicy, citrusy with orange zest, finished with the pungent mustard (Rs. 375). A simple dish, smartly executed with some cheese and lemon leaf. By now, we are on our next drink, a twist on the whiskey sour, razz sour (Rs. 600). Who thought whiskey and raspberries will fall in love? We love that the drink hasnt lost its stiffness to the fruity compote. The steamed coconut sea bass has a tender coconut rub and tastes flaky fresh. The gosht mulayam seekh kebab (Rs. 625) comes on skewers in a flat iron, which we dunk in a walnut yogurt dip.We end the meal with two biryanis, the yakhni ghost biryani Hyderabadi (Rs. 645) and vegetarian biryani. In the first serving, the mutton pieces could have been juicier, and we craved for more of the earthy masala. The latter is a nutty and fragrant qubooli, Hyderabadi flavourful channa dal biryani with vegetables. But the real winner is the safed mirch ka salan dip  a desi, spicy, and irresistible mix of sesame, poppy, peanut and coconut paste, with its tadka of curry leaves in the yoghurt mix that bowls us over.Before we move on to dessert, we try two more drinks: cold brew old-fashioned (Rs. 600) comes with a coffee twist. The Mumbai cosmo (Rs. 600) is a nostalgia-stirring vodka drink, infused with tea in a bottle. The cosmopolitan glass has Parle-G crumble, to be munched between sips. Appropriately for the season, we have a creamy green mango kulfi garnished with cooling gulkand and strips of aam papad, which cut the sweetness (Rs. 225). We loved the decadent chocolate mousse, which is served with a passion fruit compote.The all-new Razzberry Rhinoceros intends to be friendly towards the college crowd. We are informed that the lawn will soon be peppered with bean bags and a pocket-friendly canteen menu available from noon to 3 p.m. While a dedicated team will curate music events, the new avatar aims to be a cultural hub. So take a yoga session in the morning and attend a book launch in the afternoon. We hear there might be Kindles available to access a reading list too. Its a good way to keep the party going for yesteryear frequents as well as millennials.Razzberry Rhinoceros, Juhu Hotel, Juhu Tara Road, Juhu; noon to 1 a.m.; 7400402604/05"

It has also damaged a few huts and some mustard crops ready for harvesting, said officials.We have already deployed a team of experts from Bankura district in neighbouring West Bengal. They have used tranquilisers, but with little success so far in bringing the wild tusker to control, said regional chief conservator of forests (RCCF) Prashant Kumar Gupta. This is why we have requisitioned the services of Shahnawaz Safat Ali, a certified shooter from Hyderabad. His arrival is expected soon, he added.The pachyderm, which is spotted in one block of the district one day and in another the next day for the past four days, trampled an elderly man, Lakhan Das, to death in Alampur district. It also left two men  Uday Kant Mahto and Narayan Sahni of Sadanand Baisa village  badly injured on Wednesday, said forest officials.Forest department officials said rising instances of human interference in forests and dwindling sources of water could be a reason behind elephants entering human habitations. Although Bhagalpur district does not fall in the migratory area of wild elephants, there are rare cases, such as the present one, of wild elephants from parts of Jharkhand straying here, said Gupta."

(Source: Express Photo by Rohit Jain Paras) Yusufs wife Bassi and their children at their one-room home. (Source: Express Photo by Rohit Jain Paras)JASWANT Yadav, Inaam, Khillu and Yusuf have spent all their lives in the shadow of the bank. The branch of Punjab National Bank in Alwar isnt much to look at, with its suffocating rooms, its stack of dusty files and its barely visible vault adorned with two, tiny stickers of gods. But as they looked around for options post-demonetisation, say police, the four saw this as their only one. On March 16, the four were formally arrested for three failed attempts to rob the branch.On three nights spread out over a little more than a month, as Alwar slept and a police outpost across the road didnt notice anything untoward, Jaswant, Inaam, Khillu and Yusuf made gradual progress from the outer wall of the bank to the handle of the vault where their luck ended. Rajendra Yadav says when police came looking for his son Jaswant, 22, at their home in Alwars Tajilka village, on March 7, he confronted his son. Jaswant said he was returning after closing his mobile recharge shop when he heard noises behind the bank and saw Inaam trying to break the wall. When Inaam asked for help, he agreed, Yadav says.When his mother asked him why he helped Inaam, Jaswant said his work had dropped to a fourth since September-October, Yadav says. But we grow some wheat, bajra, mustard and vegetables, we had food to eat. I cannot understand why Jaswant took this risk. Before handing over Jaswant to police, Yadav adds, he gave him a good beating.Alwar Superintendent of Police Rahul Prakash calls Jaswant the mastermind. All the four arrested have confessed. They said they were facing acute financial crunch because of demonetisation, the SP says. If Jaswant ran a mobile shop adjacent to the bank, Inaam, 50, helped out at his brother Fazluddins tyre repair shop in front of the branch, apart from working as a labourer on a patch of farm adjacent to the bank, from where the break-ins were attempted. Yusuf, 23, was a daily wage labourer, while Khillu, 20, had told his family he worked at a furniture shop though police say he also did odd jobs. All four live within a kilometre of the bank.On December 19, the four allegedly made their first robbery attempt, digging a hole in the rear wall of the bank next to Inaams farm. Not sure what to do next, they covered the damaged area with straw to avoid raising an alarm, and went about looking for help. Since the four hadnt managed to dig all the way in, no one at the bank noticed the damaged wall. The bank has no guards, with the process to appoint one only on now. Says the SP, When they couldnt find anyone to help them break in, the four returned on their own on February 25 and 26.Senior Branch Manager at PNB Rang Lal Meena says the fact that the bank was closed on the two days  February 25 was the second Saturday of the month, and 26th a Sunday  gave them some time. According to police, on the night of February 25, they dug a small tunnel into the banks strong room from Inaams farm, but ran into a heavy steel cupboard. So they worked on the hole in the wall again, pushed the cupboard aside and entered the bank through the underground tunnel sometime between the nights of February 25 and 26.Being locals, they knew there is a power cut between 1-2 am and then 3-4 am. Thats when they apparently broke in, since the alarms did not go off. They next cut the wire which could have sounded the alarm when the power came on, Meena says. But they could not break the time lock embedded in the vault  it allows the vault to be opened only at a designated time, even if the correct combination is entered  and only ended up damaging its handle a bit.Anil Yadav, a constable at the Shekhpura police outpost that faces the bank branch, says the inexperience of the four was evident. Laughing, he adds, Jaswant was the only one with some experience  his friend Arif had tried to break into an ATM two years ago, while he sat outside on the getaway bike. Gopi Chand, in charge of the police outpost, remembers Imaan rushing in around dawn on February 27. He told us he had spotted six persons behind the bank. Police claim Inaam was trying to mislead them.Inaams father Yaseen Mev, 83, hasnt been told he is in jail. Mev also continues to believe Inaam helped police in cracking the robbery. I am proud of him, he says. The family lives in Shekhpura. While admitting that demonetisation had hit their tyre business, Inaams brother Fazluddin says that couldnt have pushed Inaam to burglary: My brother is a Haji, he can never do such a thing. Inaam has five girls and a boy with wife Magar Bi, the eldest two are teenagers and the youngest just 15 months old.In Jojaka village, Khillus mother Sahmuri too challenges police: Khoob taftish, khoob talashi karwa lo, aatho gaaon mein (investigate as much as you want, in all eight villages around). Everyone will testify to the honour of my son and our family. Khillu and wife Aneesa have two daughters and a son. Police call him a daily wage labourer, but Aneesa believes what he told her about working in a furniture shop. However, she admits none of them knows much about notebandi. I dont know what it is all about, butts in Sahmuri. How could it have made my son try such a thing? I am told police just spotted him drinking soft drinks with one of the accused.In Yusufs Tajilka village too, people allege police high-handedness. Police saw this as a lottery. They told some 40 persons that they were being investigated and took money to keep them out. Yusuf could not pay, so they put him in jail, more than one villager says. At their one-room home, as her two young children huddle around her, wife Bassi says, Yusuf was in the fields when police came. He went on their bike to the police station. Wouldnt he have run away if he was guilty?Yusufs brother Iqbal, who lives with their father nearby, adds, Yusuf would get barely 10 days work in a month after demonetisation, from about 20 days earlier. How could he have paid the thousands demanded by police? Bank manager Meena wonders if the four knew how much money the bank branch held for all the trouble they went through: it was just over Rs 11 lakh in new notes. We had been getting several empty trunks delivered to the bank at the time, which we filled with crores of demonetised currency. Perhaps they thought that crores of money was instead arriving at the bank in those trunks.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 2:35 am"

The Indian Express rides alongsideFitted with cushioned luggage racks, vestibuled ends for passengers to move through compartments, drinking water dispensers, mobile-charging points, fire extinguishers and modular toilets, the Antyodaya services the Eastern-Southern railway corridor, which sees the heaviest movement of migrant workers in the country. A 2013 report by the Gulati Institute of Finance and Taxation that was placed in the Kerala Assembly said that four states  Assam, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha  alone accounted for 62% of the migrant workers in Kerala.The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta) The train finally pulls into Ernakulam (above) on Monday morning (Express Photo by Shubham Dutta)At its launch, Railways Minister Suresh Prabhu said, Antyodaya Express is a long-distance, fully unreserved, superfast train service for the common man to be operated on dense routes The facilities provided in Antyodaya coaches are similar (to those) in first class. Our governments focus is on aam aadmi so we launched the product with many facilities for them.Except, most people dont know about the train. When it sets out from Howrah at 5 pm on March 18, a Saturday, its third trip from Howrah to Ernakulam, only 200 of the 1,600 seats had been filled. Almost everyone on the train had found their way here accidentally, after missing the other train, Suvidha Special, which, curiously, runs on the same date and on the same route.The problem is that there has been very little publicity about the Antyodaya whereas the Suvidha Special continues to be completely crammed  if you get an empty patch to sit on the train, you dont move for the next 36 hours, says a senior officer of the South Eastern Railways.So this Saturday evening, as passengers gingerly get on to the new train, complete with the sheen rarely associated with the Railways, many wonder if they have got onto the wrong train.Like Mohammad Rafiqul. A few minutes after he steps in, the 33-year-old, a veteran of unreserved trains and a labourer in Kochi, realises that all 20 coaches of Antyodaya are unreserved. He sits on a berth and tentatively stretches out his legs. Then, with more abandon, he flings his small bag onto the parallel seat and says with a smile, It doesnt smell of sweat. It smells different.By 8 pm, the train is rumbling through Odisha and all mobile charging points have been taken. Music from mobile phones, ranging from folk songs of Bengal to Bhojpuri film music, compete with the steady chugging of the train. One passenger points to his GPS, the blue dot rushing parallel to the ocean and asks another, You think we can see the sea from here? The sun has set though and the observatory windows  a novelty on unreserved trains  have little to offer.Home-cooked meals are prised open, filling the train with the heady aroma of mustard and spicy fish curries. The lights stay on, all night. But that doesnt seem to bother many  as one passenger puts it, a good meal and a place to stretch your legs is all you need to get some sleep.Much of the journey continues the same way. It isnt until 12.30 on Sunday afternoon that the train reaches Vijayawada, the junction where the most number of passengers get on. Most of them are migrant workers from Chhattisgarh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. But the amazement of the passengers as they get to the train and the shared burden of their stories remain the same, helping workers who dont speak the same language to somehow find common ground.Take, for instance, Shaiful Sheikh. The 24-year-old from Mayapur in West Bengal works near Aluva in Kerala. He is engaged in a deep conversation with Hari Shankar Kumar from Jharkhand  about the train, the Narendra Modi governments plans for the poor and how it all connects with demonetisation. When neither Hindi nor Bengali proves to be a language they can converse in, they throw in a few Telugu and Malayalam words.Our stories are all the same. We are all here because of our stomachs, says Kumar.Over the next few hours, there are more stories  of drought, rains coming too late or too early, crops lost to blight, parents dying and leaving behind only debt, of industries moving away or eating up their land, of crooked politicians.It isnt until 1 am on Monday that the train finally fills up. As it pulls into Coimbatore Junction, hundreds fill the compartments. Some lie underneath the seats to catch some sleep, others balance themselves against the new scratch-proof walls of the new train and somehow, manage to fall asleep.At the start of the journey, many had looked around in wonder at the near empty train. Now, they sit stoic, squeezing in to accommodate more people. Isnt this how trains for the poor always are, after all?Pramod Kumar, 21No job yetFrom: Raigarh, ChhattisgarhDestination: Salem, Tamil NaduAfter a bit of coaxing, Kumar reveals the truth: he is fleeing Goa. He simply hated the place. A year ago, says the 21-year-old, he went to Goa on a whim after seeing a photograph in a magazine. I thought itd be nice to get work near the sea, he says . But that place was horrible. I used to work on a fishing boat and it was scary. I didnt know how to swim. I learnt that but what good is a little boat if the weather is bad?, he says, adding that he is now on his way to Salem, Tamil Nadu, where a cousin works.After some negotiation, Ram managed to find a train to Vijayawada from where he will travel to Salem. My cousin said the contractor would give me food and pay me Rs 8,000 or 9,000 a month. Thats better than what I was getting in Goa. Besides, thankfully, theres no sea in Salem, he says with a shudder.In his bag: A GOA T-shirt and some clothesBirender Kumar Ram, 33Juice shop ownerFrom: Karihari, JharkhandDestination: VijaywadaRam moved out of his village when he was in his twenties. My family didnt have any money. I had studied till Class 12, but there was no job in the village. So I started working in a restaurant in Tirupathi and later Hyderabad.He worked his way through different jobs  mostly restaurants, sometimes at shops. I did well because I was educated. The language was a problem, but when your survival depends on it, you can learn almost anything.A couple of years ago, Ram and his friend from his village started a juice shop in Tirupathi. We named it Balaji Juice Shop. It is a good shop on the way to the temple. I save Rs 10,000 a month, he says.Ram says he misses his family  his wife and two children are in Jharkhand  but cant say that about his village. Every time I go back to the village, it seems strange, a little alien.In his bag: A note his son wrote to him, neatly folded in his walletNaresh Sarana, 23Works at ice-making plantFrom: Gossaigaon, AssamDestination: ErnakulamThe 23-year-old has a hard time explaining where his home is. Buxa, in Assam, he says repeatedly. When told Buxa is in West Bengal, he explains patiently, Buxa, the forest. Our home is in the forest that starts from Buxa in West Bengal and comes all the way to lower Assam. My family is from Gossaigaon.The 23-year-old has studied till his Class 10 and now works in Ernakulam at an ice-making plant. He explains that whenever he travels out of home, he stops at Siliguri, a city known for its wholesale Chinese goods market. I picked up a new leather wallet there, he says with a grin.I have been working in Kerala for two years. A friend of mine told me about this job and I get paid Rs 7,500 a fortnight. My family grows a little rice on our field but that is not enough. So my parents depend on my income.In his bag: His new walletNoorwar Mondal, 32Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: AluvaMondal has been a construction worker in Kerala for three years. Like his ancestors before him, he had worked as a sharecropper, but soon, found that work was hard to come by as were the wages. By 2014, he decided to join the many people from his village and make his way to Kerala.It was easier than I thought because there are so many people from Bengal in Kerala. For instance, my family told me to carry mustard oil with me so that I could make fish curry  mustard oil is hard to find in Kerala.His work is tough but pays well, between Rs 450 and Rs 500 a day, along with overtime. In Bengal, there are too many people and not enough jobs; in Kerala, people are all well educated and dont want to do the work we do, says Mondal, who spends six months with his family  wife and two children  and six months working and saving.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMd. Rafiqul, 33No job yetFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamRafiqul used to work as a compounder in a local hospital in Islampur, a town in West Bengals Murshidabad district. But last year, after his son was born, he decided he needed to get work that paid more. His friends told him about Kerala and how he could find work laying floor tiles. So he packed his bags and took the train, his first trip to Kerala.I am a little worried. Everyone has said that Kerala has good fish. But the fish in Murshidabad is the best in the world. Our Hilsa is the best and there is no one who can cook it the way we do. I cant survive on dosas, he says laughing.And then, on a serious note, he says, My friends told me I can earn almostRs 1,000 a day in Kerala. From Ernakulam, I will meet a friend and we will go together to Thiruvananthapuram. If what they have promised comes true, it will change our lives  at least my sons if not mine, he says.In his bag: A bottle of mustard oilMohammad Isharul Islam, 26Construction workerFrom Islampur, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamIslam has been in Kerala for six years, working as a construction worker. That makes him somewhat of an old hand. So when he talks about his work in Kerala and why he doesnt think the good run will last, people around him pull in closer to hear him speak. Demonetisation was a turning point. Construction work stopped altogether and all of us were stranded, he says, adding that his employers still owe him about Rs 50,000.Still unmarried, he laughs and says that his mother is constantly horrified at the thought of him marrying someone from outside Bengal. The 26-year-old works as a construction worker, laying floor tiles in homes. Its strange working in these big homes and then going back to a cramped room. But at least I can send about Rs 3,000 to my family. But what they really look forward to is the banana chips I take for them, he says.In his bag: A family photographDeepak Dhaori, 29CarpenterFrom Jhargram, West BengalDestination: VijaywadaA carpenter, Dhaori is on his first trip outside Bengal. The 29-year-old is from Chandri, a village in Jhargram, 37 km from Lalgarh, which was the site of the November 2008 clashes between villagers and cadres of the erstwhile Left Front government.Dhaori plans to alight at Vijayawada and take the bus to Secunderabad in Hyderabad. Someone from my village is in Secunderabad and they said they need carpenters. In my village, there is no work and it has been that way for years, he says.Married, with a boy and a girl whom he has left behind, the 29-year-old says that until a decade ago, people in his village used to die due to lack of medical attention and clean drinking water. To be honest, I am scared to go to a new place. There are things, habits you never thought you would give up  like the evening tea with friends. But I had to leave home.In his bag: A new shirtSonu Ram, 40LabourerFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreOn his way to Shoranur, a town in Keralas Palakkad district, this is the 40-year-olds first trip outside home. There is no work in Madhya Pradesh. The drought last year wiped out the farms. We lost all our crops. My elder son studied till his Class 8 and then went to Kerala for work, the other is in Class 5. My son said only if both of us work can we support the family.While his son paints houses, he says he is unsure about what he will do  I may have to start by laying bricks.He had taken a train from Jabalpur to Vijayawada, from where they boarded the Antyodaya Express. Asked about the work and his expectations, he says, From what my son has told me, I can make about Rs 15,000 a month and not spend too much because the employers give us food and a place to sleep.In his bag: A list of phone numbers and directions written on a piece of paperRabindra Mali, 27Mill workerFrom Cuttack, OdishaDestination: CoimbatoreThe 27-year-old has been working for over a decade at a spinning mill in Kozhikode. From a traditional fishing family near Cuttack, Rabindra says he has never been to school. When I was 10, I went to Tirupati because I heard you can get work near the temple. I started working in a tea shop and then at a restaurant as a waiter. Later, I got this job in a spinning mill, he says.Rabindra will get off at Coimbatore and take a bus to his factory. I work about 12 hours a day and make Rs 390 a day  thats about Rs 12,000 a month, he says. The company he works for, says Mali, pays him overtime but no food and accommodation. My sister and brother-in-law also live in Kozhikode. He works in a company and she works as a domestic help, he says, adding that he hopes to someday bring his wife and 3-year-old son to the city.In his bag: A sari for his sister and a new shirt for his brother-in-lawMahesh Bharti, 24MasonFrom Jabalpur, MPDestination: CoimbatoreWhen he is not poring over Hindi film magazines, Bharti has people around him hooked with his knowledge of all things Bollywood, passionately discussing everything from Katrina Kaifs love life to Salman Khans troubles with the law.Bharti works as a contract labourer in Shoranur, a town in Palakkad district, and earns about Rs 650 a day. I am going to Coimbatore and from there I will go to Shoranur. Thats where I have been working the past year. Tiles, plaster, wall putty  I do it all, he says with a grin. His parents continue to live in Jabalpur, Madhya Pradesh, where they have own some land.In his bag: A few Hindi film magazinesTapash Pappu Maity, 26WaiterFrom KolkataDestination: ErnakulamTapash Maity, or Pappu as he calls himself, worked as a waiter at various outlets of Kwality Walls in Kolkata until three years ago. The 26-year-old married two years ago and now has a year-old son.He says, The job in Kolkata was okay  the money wasnt too good, but it was good, steady work. But the problem was my salary was stuck at Rs 8,000 a month for far too long. In Kerala, I work for Lazza Ice Creams  I serve at their parlours and earn about Rs 24,000 a month.It helps to be from a big city, he says  nothing surprises me. Others, you know, they see women roaming around late at night in malls and get a shock. Not me.In his bag: Photographs of his wife and year-old sonMilan Mondal, 23Construction workerFrom Murshidabad, West BengalDestination: Ernakulam, KeralaWhen he was 12, Mondal borrowed Rs 400 from his parents, saying he was going to Kolkata to see the city, and ran away with an elder cousin.My first job was at a construction site in Kolkata  a club house run by the Left that was being renovated. In the mornings, I would fetch water and in the evenings, when the party people sat down to play cards, Id serve tea and get some bakshish. I had left home with Rs 400; when I went back eight years later, I had Rs 4,000.Mondal has been in Kerala for three years, working at a construction site in Idduki. I earn Rs 6,000 a week, much more than what I earned in Kolkata, he says, distracted as he fiddles with his smartphone. Gadgets are my real love. Tonight, I am going to watch movies on YouTube  old Bengali films. Those stories are from a simpler time.In his bag: SD card with moviesSheikh Hasibul Arinde, 40ElectricianFrom HowrahDestination: CoimbatoreThe 40-year-old is a trained electrician, having earlier worked for a government-run electrical agency in Bengal. He now works as an electrical contractor for Larsen and Toubro, on a project near Coimbatore.I have been working as an electrician for decades now. My father was an electrician at the Kolaghat Power Plant near Kolkata and I learnt from him. But to be able to work in Bengal, you need a licence and for that, you have to pay bribes to the party, he says, adding that he is glad he moved to Coimbatore.My daughter and son are in school in Howrah. I dont want them to become electricians, but I always tell them to see and experience new things. For instance, when I first went to Tamil Nadu, I had a hard time with the language. Not anymore, he says.In his bag: A new shirt that his in-laws gave himAbhishek Sarkar, 29ElectricianFrom Nabadwip, West BengalDestination: CoimbatoreSarkar met Arinde while in Kerala and the two now work together for the same company in Coimbatore. Their friendship, they admit, is rare for these times. He is Muslim, I am Hindu. We live together and eat together. I celebrate his festivals and he does mine. But when we go back home, people give us strange looks. What they dont understand is this: Hindu or Muslim, our problems are the same. God doesnt come into the picture when youre not getting paid, says Sarkar, talking about how demonetisation hit people like him.For almost two months, we didnt get paid. Employers still owe us about Rs 75,000. One of the contractors from Odisha said he would pay us soon; now he doesnt even pick his phone, he says.In his bag: His mother has packed a packet of sandesh from his favorite shopArshad Rahman, 37Labour contractorFrom Kamrup, AssamDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduWhen asked what he does, he says, Businessman. I am a labour contractor.I am a migrant, but not a labourer. I arrange for labourers, he says repeatedly. He says he first went to the south around 15 years ago when he got an order to get labourers to work at a Sewage Treatment Plant (STP) in Chennai. My men have made almost all the STPs in Chennai. My labourers are the best, he brags. Talking of how he began his business, he says, There were so many people in the Northeast and East looking for work that I realised it was a great opportunity.Rahman, who says he has worked in several states, including Gujarat, Telangana and Kerala, saves about Rs 30,000 a month. Work has slowed down in Gujarat because all the big projects have already come up. In Kerala, too, it will slow down. Right now, I am going to Katpadi near Vellore (Tamil Nadu) and after that, I may have to go to Telangana.In his bag: A new pair of jeansSheikh Shamim, 29Construction workerFrom Pandua, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThis is Shamins second trip to Kerala, where he works at a construction site. After spending almost an hour worrying if he was on the right train, he finally settles down.A year ago, a contractor from our village asked me if I wanted work. I said yes, and here I am. It is hard work, but the money is better than anything you get in Bengal, he says.The 29-year-old from Pandua in Hooghly district, who dropped out after Class 3, used to work as a rickshaw driver. With his wife expecting their second child, he says he had to find a way to earn more money. I came at a bad time, though. Within a few months of my coming to Kerala, work dried up because of demonetisation. Contractors said they couldnt pay us anymore, so I went back. This time, I am planning to stay for as long as I can, he says.In his bag: Puffed rice and naaru (sweet made of coconut and jaggery)Sheikh Mantu, 54LabourerFrom Malda, West BengalDestination: ErnakulamThe 54-year-old worked as a bus conductor for close to four decades, but three years ago, after a near-fatal accident, his family said they wouldnt let him to do that work any longer. I was a conductor on the Malda-Kolkata route. I did that for 36 years. But once, our bus met with an accident  the driver was killed and my rib cage was shattered. My family was scared after that. They still call buses vehicles of death.But with his family  wife, three children and an ailing father  to take care of, Mantu had to find some work. There were others from my village working as labourers in Kerala so a year ago, I decided to come with them, he says.The work in Kerala, he says, is strenuous, but the money is good. I do plastering and painting. I used to make about Rs 400 a day, now I make twice that. But to be honest, I didnt think I would have to work at this age.In his bag: A pack of cardsShamwar Hossain, 20Construction workerFrom Mayapur, West BengalDestination: Aluva, KeralaHossain has been to Kerala only once before. He works as a construction worker there, earning Rs 450 a day. I work for a contractor who tells me where to work. The hours are regular in Kerala and pay comes on time. The government is also more sensitive to the needs of the poor. For instance, I am told that they will give me a identity card, he says.Hossains family are sharecroppers, but with agriculture in Nadia, his home district, failing, labour is no longer in demand and his father has been unemployed for five years.I dont plan to go back to Nadia. There are others who miss home. I dont. When I think about home, I think of people suffering because they cant find work and my mother skipping meals to let us to eat. In Kerala, lifes good. I earn well, I work hard and I sleep peacefully at night.In his bag: Four packets of chanachur (a snack of chickpeas, lentils and nuts)Mritunjay, 24CarpenterFrom Kharagpur, West BengalDestination: Katpadi, Tamil NaduMritunjay says never wanted to leave his home in Kharagpur. But with no formal education, the 24-year-old says he couldnt have found a job in his village. There are schools for us Adivasis in Kharagpur, but I never studied. That was a mistake.He learnt carpentry from his uncle in Kharagpur, helping him make tables and chairs for government offices. He had earlier worked in Thane as a labourer but returned to his uncles shop. Not only did they not pay well, he says, but they were cheats and the city is too crowded and people unkind.Mrirtunjay says his uncles friend is a construction worker in Vellore. My uncle said his friend would help me. He even bought me the train ticket. I have been told that I can earn Rs 500 a day and if I do a lot of overtime, over Rs 15,000 a month. Thats almost double of what I was making in Kharagpur.In his bag: Two new gamchasMohammad Firoz, 26MasonFrom: HooghlyDestination: ErnakulamThe 26-year-old first came to Ernakulam in 2008. He knew an uncle in the area, who quickly set him up to work as a bricklayer.Since then, he has progressed to being a wall putty specialist. Initially, I had some trouble with the food in Kerala. Everything is cooked in coconut oil. I dont like that. There are others who will eat just about anything. But that isnt me. I enjoy my food. Luckily, there was good beef in Kerala  that was a life saver.Firoz now earns about Rs 500 a day, plastering walls at a Kendriya Vidyalaya in Ernakulam. Its a government school so we get paid on time. I make aboutRs 3,400 a week, including overtime. That is enough for me to live comfortably  eat beef and fish once in a while whenever I dont feel like eating the food the contractors give me.In his bag: a photograph of his parentsFor all the latest India News, download Indian Express App nowFirst Published on: March 26, 2017 3:26 am"

While Saini stands for GM free mustard, experts argue that GM mustard is the way forward to increase productivity and income of the farmers.The differences cropped up at SEA Rapeseed-mustard conclave held at a city hotel Saturday. While inaugurating the conclave Saturday Prabhulal Saini called for GM free mustard crop.The minister said oil content of traditional mustard variety seed is 40-42 % and exhorted scientists to develop variety of mustard which has more oil content but Saini said he is not in favour of genetically modified ones.However, agriculture experts and industry differed with the minister. Dr Deepak Pental of Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants, University of Delhi, in his discussion on 'GM Mustard Seed-Pros and Cons', said "" It is unfortunate that while Europe produce about 80 % of their mustard oil from GM mustard followed by China and Canada about 70 %, we are still debating about it.""He said these technologies have been adapted by other countries almost 20 years ago and we are debating it now. He called for high breed variety resistant to disease built in to the seed.Bhagirath Chaudhary, founder director of M/s South Asia Bio Technology Centre (NGO) New Delhi, said India is largest importer of edible oil including mustard. ""The irony is while it imports 15 million tones mustard oil from countries which produces its oil from genetically modified varieties, still we are not allowing this variety to farmers in the country which would have reduced our dependence on imports of edible oil."" He said it is impossible to increase production without genetic improvement.Denying breakthrough technology to famers is an injustice to them as wells the countr, said Chaudhary.Vijay Sardana, head of M/s Global Food Security and Agri Business Policy, UPL group called for focusing on intercropping and byproducts mustard cake, honey and straw for industrial use. For instance, he talked of using straw to brick kiln industry would reduce the problem of pollution caused by burning of stumps and at the same time will save lot of woods cut to be used in brick kilns."

The film is said to be based on jail inmates who form a band.Talking to HT City director Ranjit Tiwari says, On a personal note I dont have any connection with the city but films central theme has brought us to the city. The story, which I cant talk about at this moment, is based in Lucknow which is its soul. I have stayed and researched here for the film and it was very important to shoot here to capture the soul of the city in real locations. He has been associate director for several films including Hero, D-Day and Katti Batti.On the sets that they have built in Mumbai he says, There is rule, which does not allow us to shoot inside a jail so the production team decided to erect one. We chose to do it in Mumbai as its easy to shoot there and saves extra budget of shooting in an outside location (Lucknow). The film falls in the drama genre.Farhan with actor Deepak Dobriyal, director (left) Ranjit Tiwari & executive producer Hemraj Dogra (standing) at the jail set in Mumbai (Lucknow Central team)The team has shot on the roof of Chota Imambara, Centenniel College, Jahangirabad Palace, Malihabad, Roomi Gate, Kaiserbagh, Residency and Lalbagh besides other localities informed line-producer Aroon Singh Dicky.Films executive producer Hemraj Dogra tells that the team initially had some apprehension with the change of state government but it turned out to be a smooth ride. We faced no problem at all and everyone co-operated a lot. The public has been very supportive. They do flock to watch the shoot but are very nice and obedient. We are very happy on this front, he says.Fan momentFarhan obliged his fans and crew members for a photo-op on the last day of shoot.

There would be three vans initially, spread out across Kolkata.AT A time when meat sellers have come under watch in Uttar Pradesh, and now Jharkhand, the West Bengal government is set to get non-vegetarian delicacies to Kolkatas doorsteps through Meat on Wheelz.The initiative has been started by West Bengal Livestock Development Corporation Limited (WBLDCL)s popular brand Haringhata Meat, which also deals in non-conventional meat such as that of quail, duck, turkey and emu. Officials said that apart from taking cooked non-veg delicacies to Kolkata and its suburbs, Meat on Wheelz would also sell frozen packaged items of Haringhata.The scheme was launched by Animal Resources Development Department Minister Swapan Debnath on Monday at the departments headquarters at Salt Lake. There would be three vans initially, spread out across Kolkata. Depending on the success of the pilot project, a fewmore vehicles would be added, including in other district headquarters of the state, an official said.On Tuesday, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee commented about the recent happenings in Uttar Pradesh, where meat sellers went on strike in protest against the crackdown on slaughterhouses. People are afraid & many are scared about differences over caste, creed & religion, she said in a statement.Among the dishes planned on Meat on Wheelz are quail briyani, gandharaj turkey and duck roast.An official said that Haringhata Meats sales had trebled over the past few years, with that of quail, duck and turkey meat doubling in the last one year.

On August 8, the Lok Sabha approved the amended bill.2) India as a common market with one taxThe GST will unify India into a common market with one tax across all states, which will eliminate the present cascading impact of a plethora of central taxes.Central taxes such as Central Excise Duty, Additional Excise Duty, Additional Customs Duty and Service Tax will all be merged into one CGST.State levies such as VAT, sales tax, entertainment tax, purchase tax, mandi tax, luxury tax, octroi and entry tax, will be subsumed into SGST.The Centre will levy the Central GST and Integrated GST, while states will impose the SGST.3) Four-slab GST structureThe new regime will have a four-slab structure of 5%, 12%, 18% and 28%.There will be no tax on several items including rice, wheat and other essential items, which constitutes 50% of CPI inflation basket.The lowest tax rate of 5% is proposed for items of mass consumption used by common people such as spices, tea and mustard oil.There will be two standard rates of 12% and 18% covering most manufactured items and services.The highest tax rate of 28% will be imposed on items like luxury cars, pan masala, tobacco and aerated drinks. These items are currently attracting a tax of 27-31%.4) States to get compensation if there is revenue lossThe Compensation Bill will ensure states will get fully compensated for the first five years if there is a revenue loss after GST is rolled out.The money for this compensation will come from compensation fund created from cess that the Centre will charge on certain goods.5) Dual control on assessing taxpayersThe Centre and states will both assess taxpayers having with an annual turnover of Rs 1.5 crore.States will the power to assess taxpayers below Rs 1.5 crore in turnover.For North Eastern states those with an annual turnover of Rs 10 lakh or below will be exempt from the ambit of GST, for the rest of India this limit is Rs 20 lakh.6) Will GST lower tax burdenGST will be a single tax on the supply of goods and services, right from the manufacturer to the consumer. Credits of input taxes paid at each stage will be available in the subsequent stage of value addition.The final consumer will thus bear only the GST charged by the last dealer in the supply chain, with set-off benefits at all the previous stages. Revenue secretary, Hasmukh Adhia has said that GST will reduce tax burden on the common man, but all will depend on where goods and services are fitted in the GST slabs.7) How will consumers benefitConsumers now pay higher taxes as multiple levies are imposed --- one over the other --- at various stages starting from production to the retail sales.GST will be a single and transparent tax proportionate to the value of goods and services.GST will eliminate the cascading impact of multiple indirect taxes being levied by the Centre and states, with incomplete or no input tax credits available at progressive stages of value addition.8) Will industry benefit from GSTFor India Inc, GST will ensure easier compliance through the GST Network (GSTN) platform.

59038e557be9e0264d1d1497,Mumbai: The water bearers of narrow lanes,http://indianexpress.com/article/cities/mumbai/mumbai-the-water-bearers-of-narrow-lanes-4593212/,2017-03-30,"Manzoor Alam stands next to his mashaq in Pydhonie. Express Manzoor Alam stands next to his mashaq in Pydhonie. ExpressMANZOOR ALAM and Mohammed Nasir wake up at 6 am every day and push an empty 500-litre tank for over a kilometre to fill it with water. At a water source in Bhuleshwar, the men take about half an hour to fill the tank and then push it back to Doodh Bazaar area near Pydhonie, to start their rounds. The men are known as mashaq wallahs in the area, for the pouch, or mashaq, they carry to transfer water. In areas of South Mumbai, such as Pydhonie, Bhendi Bazaar and Dongri, men like Alam and Nasir are a regular sight. The mashaqs  hand-stitched bags made of animal skin  are filled with water and delivered to shops, homes and other establishments in the area. They fill the 20 to 25 litres of mashaqs with water through these tanks and deliver it in the area.There are many small shops, tea vendors, construction sites where there is no water connection. These men are their only source of water. They call these men as per requirement, says a shopkeeper at Pydhonie. He adds that while earlier, the mashaq wallahs were much more in demand since the water supply was abrupt, even now, many depend on them for their daily water supply. In the narrow crowded lanes, with not enough space for buses or cars, a distinct call for a mashaq can be heard from the buildings every once in a while.Alam says this year, while the temperatures have been rising, the demand for water has not increased yet. There are many who prefer water delivered through tempos and water tankers as it proves cheaper, ordered in bulk. We are called if there is a small demand for a small quantity of water, such as of someone does not manage to fill their water tankers during the morning water supply hours or if there is a family function, Alam says. He lugs a 25-litre pouch in a 2-km area multiple times in a day at a price between Rs 15-25 per trip.The cost depends on the distance and the floors we have to climb to deliver the water, he explains. Alam was a teenager when he first came to the city, fleeing home in Bihar to look for a job. The 46-year old says that at the time, over three decades ago, a majority of men from Rajasthan worked as mashaq wallahs. I was employed by one of them and learnt the work from him. The mashaqs have handles to help carry them on the shoulder, but they are very heavy. It is tiring, he says. Now, Alam and Nasir, who came to the city together, work on their own, having bought mashaqs. Each mashaq costs Rs 2,500 and lasts for over six months. To prevent them from tearing apart due to the weight, the mashaqs have to be maintained by applying mustard oil every few weeks.While earlier, the men who made the mashaqs had their shops in the same area, they have shifted out to the suburbs. Earlier, the men were traditional mashaq wallahs, working for generations together. Now, it is usually youngsters who do this work till they find another job, says Mohammed Ashraf, another mashaq wallah. The job does not pay much for the effort it requires. Each person who is employed here tries to find work as a loader or a labourer to get out of this profession, he says.Alam says he tried to get another job but failed, and has hence continued for so many years as a mashaq wallah. He sleeps on empty carts in the market area after finishing work at 8pm, waking up at 5am the next day. Apart from resting for about half an hour in the afternoon, his day consists of many trips carrying the heavy water-bag. After having worked so many years, I know each and every building and lane. Each day, the hope is to at least get enough demand to cover the cost of the water we buy, he says.None of them think the business would end anytime soon, since congested, old areas like these would require water delivered to them due to lack of supply. Many prefer to call us instead of big water tankers since their requirement is less. We will not go out of business, but some days are particularly bad, when we only make a few trips, Alam says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

At least 30 different innovations in the sector are stuck, pending approvals from the government.While the retail value of the Indian bio-economy is estimated at $35 billion, projects in the agri-biotech industry have failed to receive an impetus.According to data available with the Association of Biotech Led Industries (ABLE), the retail value of bio agri sector sums up to $9.015 billion, out of which $9 billion is accounted for by commercialisation of Bt cotton alone, with no representation of innovation in any other crops, as licences have not been granted for their field testing.The ABLE Agriculture (Able-Ag) has urged the government to relax policy norms, as companies are finding it hard to get approvals for field testing of their innovations.The Centre had mandated organisations to secure no-objection certificates (NOCs) from the respective state governments and in majority of the cases, approvals were being denied, mostly because of a threat perception about Bt crops, according to members of the association.The government needs to open it up for testing, at the very least. Unless these innovations can be tested for their safety, how can the safety concerns around Bt crops be addressed? asked Shivendra Bajaj, executive director, Able-Ag.The projects awaiting approvals include innovations developed by Indian Institute ofHorticulture Research, Sugarcane Breeding Research Institute, Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture, apart from several private companies with regard to crops such as cotton, maize, mustard, corn, sugarcane, papaya and tomato among others.Giving a glimpse into the situation, he said things were getting worse for the technology year-on-year, for the past five-six years.The irony is that much of the data generated in India is being made of use of by other countries. Countries such as Bangladesh, which entered the field much later, are now making use of Bt innovations in agriculture. Every year, they are slowly increasing the cultivation of Bt brinjal. Pakistan has commercialised Bt maize after testing it for several years. In India, it is still pending even though we started testing it way earlier, Bajaj said.As for the safety concerns, Bajaj said India imported edible oils generated from Bt crops in other countries, while back home there was apprehension about allowing the development of these crops."

After working in a royal kitchen for nine years, he moved to the hospitality sector. This is the second time Singhs Rajasthani food festival is being hosted at Bengaluru Marriott Whitefield.From the land of the Maharajas comes 15 dishes that have a range of flavours  sweet, spicy and the many stops in between. The rich cuisine is generous with ghee, yogurt and spices.For the starters, I had Murg Ka Parche and Rai Ki Machli, both are tender and have a distinct flavour. The fish is seasoned with mustard and the Tandoori chicken breasts have a crusty garlicky flavour. Paneer Ke Suley, Dal Pakodi and Mangodi Ki Tikki are hot, soft and filling. The Dahi Vada is fresh and minty.The main course has 11 dishes. Laal Maas, which translates to red meat, is one of the most popular dishes. It is mutton curry cooked in a sauce of curd and spicy red chillies. There is little or no use of tomatoes, just a bit of onions and coriander powder.The traditional Laal Maas shows how Rajasthani cuisine is shaped by spices more than anything else. The red chillies are supplied from a village called Mathonia, about 20 km from Jodhpur. Another dish that stood out was Ker Sangri, made from shoots of a desert plant Khejari. It grows only once a year, during spring time. This is more a pickle with its tangy natural flavour.In Ghatte Ki Subji and Ghatte Ki Pulao, dumplings are made from besan and cooked in a curd gravy. Subz Panchmela is a mix of five sauted vegetables - carrots, cabbage, beans, green peas and spinach.At the end of the line stands a dessert bar. Crunchy, juicy jalebis are also served. The disc-shaped Ghewar oozing ghee is heavenly.The festival is on till April 6. Cost for two: Rs 3,000 plus taxes"
5904726c7be9e04154df6ee5,Why smart cities? I’d rather have smarter villages,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/musings-from-the-mountains/84922/,2017-04-02,"Its good to know that my old friend the jackfruit is finally coming into its own. Apparently it is now much in demand in western countries, a fashionable substitute for meat fillings for burgers, sandwiches, pies etc, with one enthusiast even calling it mutton hanging from a tree.Here in India we have always appreciated a good jackfruit curry, or even better, a jackfruit pickle. Im a pickle fiend myself, and among the 20 different pickles on my sideboard there is always a jar of jackfruit pickle; thats why I call it an old friend. But I had no idea it tasted like mutton. The seed and the pulp have their own individual flavour. As it grows on a tree we call it fruit, but we cook it as though it were a vegetable. And if, to some, it tastes like mutton, then perhaps some meat-eaters will become vegetarians. On the other hand, some vegetarians might not care for its meaty flavour!When I was a boy, we had an old jackfruit tree growing beside the side veranda. I spent a lot of time in the trees surrounding my grandmothers bungalow, and this one was easy to climb. The others included several guava and litchi trees, lemons and grape-fruits, and of course a couple of mango trees  but these last were difficult to climb.Why do you spend so much time in the trees? complained my grandmother. Why not do something useful for a change?The trees are my brothers, I would say, I like to play with them.And I still think of them as my brothers, although I can no longer climb trees or play in them.And indeed I think of them as human beings possessed of individuality and charm. Just as no two humans are exactly alike (unless they happen to be twins), so no two trees are the same. Like humans they grow from seed. They develop branches as arms and leaves like flowing hair. We give birth to children; they give birth to fruits and flowers. We shelter our young, they shelter small creatures of the forest.But unlike us, they spring from the soil, from the land  that very land that gives us food and pasture and protection; the land that we so casually take for granted, preferring to build upon it rather than grow upon it. Where will our cattle graze when the last green spaces have gone?No problem, says a young friend. We can always import our milk.The other day I came across an old book that had been on my shelves for many years: Farmers Glory by A G Street, written over 60 years ago. In his epilogue he writes: It is perhaps nothing to boast about, but there is little doubt that the present prosperity of British farming is mainly due to one man, who is now dead. His name was Adolf Hitler. There is no disputing that it was the fear of famine during the early 1940s that taught the British nation that despite all mans cleverness and inventions, when real danger comes an island people must turn for succour to the only permanent asset they possess, the land of their own country. It has never, and will never, let them down; always provided they realise and obey this eternal truth  that to make the land serve man, man must first be content to serve the land.And surely it is this love of the land and willingness to serve it that is at the heart of patriotism. The patriotic songs and speeches that we hear from time to time are fine for stirring up the emotions, but it is really the connect between ourselves and the do bigha zameen on which we grow our fruit and grain that emboldens us to protect it.I think I am correct in saying that most of our jawans, the young men who join the solid ranks of the Indian Army, come from rural backgrounds; some from the hills, some from the vast plains and hinterland of our country. They know the value of the land. They have grown up in the villages and have worked with their families in the rice fields, or sugarcane plantations, or mango groves, or wheat or corn or mustard or fields of an infinite variety of crops. More than the city folk, they know the value of the land, its true worth in terms of either prosperity or poverty. And so they are ready to defend it, to fight for it against all corners. The best soldiers come from the soil that they and their forefathers have tilled. So let us protect the land  not only from the intruder or the enemy, but from those who would turn the field or the forest into one more concrete jungle.But of course there are those who prefer concrete jungles. Like my young friend who wants to live in a Smart City and never mind the cities that are no longer smart. My advice to him (unheeded of course) is to go back to his roots, create a smart little village, and plant jackfruit trees!"

(Edlib Media Center, via AP)Frances foreign minister called on Tuesday for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council after what he said was a disgusting gas attack on Syrias rebel-held Idlib province. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based war monitor, said a suspected chemical attack by Syrian government or Russian jets killed at least 58 people, including 11 children, in the rebel-held northwestern province of Idlib.A new and particularly serious chemical attack took place this morning in Idlib province. The first information suggests a large number of victims, including children. I condemn this disgusting act, Jean-Marc Ayrault said in a statement.In the face of such serious actions that threaten international security, I ask for everyone not to shirk their responsibilities. With this in mind, I ask for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council, he added.It was not immediately clear what action France, a permanent member of the Security Council, wanted to be taken.France, Britain and the United States in February put forward a resolution to impose sanctions targeting Syrian government officials over accusations of chemical weapon attacks during the six-year conflict.Russia, backed by China, cast its seventh veto to protect the Syrian authorities and Russian President Vladimir Putin described the draft resolution as totally inappropriate.Western powers put forward the resolution in response to the results of an investigation by the U.N. and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW).The international inquiry found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.The use of chemical weapons constitutes an unacceptable violation of the convention against chemical weapons and is another example of the barbarity that the Syrian people have been under for so many years, Ayrault said.Before a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss aid for Syria, Ayrault said Europe could not play a role in the countrys reconstruction without a credible transition.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(Source: REUTERS) A man breathes through an oxygen mask as another one receives treatments, after what rescue workers described as a suspected gas attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun in rebel-held Idlib, Syria April 4, 2017. (Source: REUTERS)Victims of a suspected chemical attack in Syria appeared to show symptoms consistent with reaction to a nerve agent, the World Health Organization said on Wednesday. Some cases appear to show additional signs consistent with exposure to organophosphorus chemicals, a category of chemicals that includes nerve agents, WHO said in a statement, putting the death toll at at least 70. The United States has said the deaths were caused by sarin nerve gas dropped by Syrian aircraft. Russia has said it believes poison gas had leaked from a rebel chemical weapons depot struck by Syrian bombs.Sarin is an organophosporus compound and a nerve agent. Chlorine and mustard gas, which are also believed to have been used in the past in Syria, are not. A Russian Defence Ministry spokesman did not say what agent was used in the attack but said the rebels had used the same chemical weapons in Aleppo last year.The WHO said it was likely that some kind of chemical was used in the attack because sufferers had no apparent external injuries and died from a rapid onset of similar symptoms, including acute respiratory distress. It said its experts in Turkey were giving guidance to overwhelmed health workers in Idlib on the diagnosis and treatment of patients, and medicines such as Atropine, an antidote for some types of chemical exposure, and steroids for symptomatic treatment had been sent.A UN Commission of Inquiry into human rights in Syria has previously said forces loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad have used lethal chlorine gas on multiple occasions. Hundreds of civilians died in a sarin gas attack in Ghouta on the outskirts of Damascus in August 2013. Assads government has always denied responsibility for that attack.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington. But Russia, a Syrian ally, and China have repeatedly vetoed any United Nations move to sanction Assad or refer the situation in Syria to the International Criminal Court.These types of weapons are banned by international law because they represent an intolerable barbarism, Peter Salama, Executive Director of the WHO Health Emergencies Programme, said in the WHO statement.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The Syrian military denied responsibility and said it would never use chemical weapons.UN Syria mediator Staffan de Mistura said the horrific chemical attack had come from the air.The draft text, seen by Reuters, says Syrias government must provide an international investigation with flight plans and logs for Tuesday, the names of all helicopter squadron commanders and provide access to air bases where investigators believe attacks using chemicals may have been launched.It asks UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to report monthly on whether the Syrian government is cooperating with an international investigation and a fact-finding mission into chemical weapons use in Syria.The draft resolution expresses its outrage that individuals continue to be killed and injured by chemical weapons in the Syrian Arab Republic, and expresses its determination that those responsible must be held accountable.It was not immediately clear how Russia, an ally of Assad, and China would view the move.In February, Russia, backed by China, cast its seventh veto to protect Assads government from council action, blocking a bid by Western powers to impose sanctions.The Security Council is due to be briefed on the suspected toxic gas attack on Wednesday.An investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, or OPCW, found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants had used mustard gas.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Moscow and Washington.The Security Council backed that deal with a resolution that said in the event of non-compliance, including unauthorized transfer of chemical weapons, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, it would impose measures such as sanctions.The draft resolution proposed on Tuesday recalls that decision.The Hague-based OPCW set up fact-finding mission in 2014 to determine cases where chemical weapons had been used in Syria.The UN Security Council then established a joint team of UN and OPCW investigators in 2015 to assign blame in cases where the fact-finding mission had determined chemical weapons had been used."

They say a chemical weapons attack on a town in northern Syria on Tuesday killed dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied ever using such weapons.Here is a timeline of events related to chemical weapons use in Syria.August 20, 2012: Former US president Barack Obama says the use of chemical weapons would be a red line that would change his calculus on intervening in the civil war and have enormous consequences.March 19, 2013: The Syrian government and opposition trade accusations over a gas attack that killed some 26 people, including more than a dozen government soldiers, in the town of Khan al-Assal in northern Syria. A UN investigation later finds that sarin nerve gas was used, but does not identify a culprit.August 21, 2013: Hundreds of people suffocate to death in rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital, with many suffering from convulsions, pinpoint pupils, and foaming at the mouth. UN investigators visit the sites and determine that ground-to-ground missiles loaded with sarin were fired on civilian areas while residents slept. The US and others blame the Syrian government, the only party to the conflict known to have sarin gas.August 31, 2013: Obama says he will go to Congress for authorisation to carry out punitive strikes against the Syrian government, but appears to lack the necessary support in the legislature.September 27, 2013: The UN Security Council orders Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons stockpile, following a surprise agreement between Washington and Moscow, averting US strikes. The Security Council threatens to authorise the use of force in the event of non-compliance.October 14, 2013: Syria becomes a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibiting it from producing, stockpiling, or using chemical weapons.June 23, 2014: The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says it has removed the last of the Syrian governments chemical weapons. Syrian opposition officials maintain that the governments stocks were not fully accounted for, and that it retained supplies.August 7, 2015: The UN Security Council authorizes the OPCW and UN investigators to probe reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, as reports circulate of repeated chlorine gas attacks by government forces against civilians in opposition-held areas. Chlorine gas, though not as toxic as nerve agents, can be classified as a chemical weapon depending on its use.August 24, 2016: The joint OPCW-UN panel determines the Syrian government twice used helicopters to deploy chlorine gas against its opponents, in civilian areas in the northern Idlib province. A later report holds the government responsible for a third attack. The attacks occurred in 2014 and 2015. The panel also finds that the Islamic State group used mustard gas.February 28, 2017: Russia, a stalwart ally of the Syrian government, and China veto a UN Security Council resolution authorising sanctions against the Syrian government for chemical weapons use.April 4, 2017: At least 58 people are killed in what doctors say could be a nerve gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held Idlib province. Victims show signs of suffocation, convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and pupil constriction. Witnesses say the attack was carried out by either Russian or Syrian Sukhoi jets. Moscow and Damascus deny responsibility."

The Trump administration blamed the Syrian government for the attack, one of the deadliest in years, and said Syria's patrons, Russia and Iran, bore ""great moral responsibility"" for the deaths.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said at least 58 people died, including 11 children, in the early morning attack in the town of Khan Sheikhoun, which witnesses said was carried out by Sukhoi jets operated by the Russian and Syrian governments.Videos from the scene showed volunteer medics using fire hoses to wash the chemicals from victims' bodies. Haunting images of lifeless children piled in heaps reflected the magnitude of the attack, which was reminiscent of a 2013 chemical assault that left hundreds dead and was the worst in the country's ruinous six-year civil war.Tuesday's attack drew swift condemnation from world leaders, including President Donald Trump , who denounced it as a ""heinous"" act that ""cannot be ignored by the civilized world."" The UN Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting for Wednesday in response to the strike, which came on the eve of a major international donors' conference in Brussels on the future of Syria and the region.In a statement, Trump also blamed former US President Barack Obama for ""weakness"" in failing to respond aggressively after the 2013 attack.""These heinous actions by the Bashar al-Assad regime are a consequence of the past administration's weakness and irresolution,"" Trump said. ""President Obama said in 2012 that he would establish a `red line' against the use of chemical weapons and then did nothing. The United States stands with our allies across the globe to condemn this intolerable attack.""Trump left it to his top diplomat, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, to assign at least some blame to Russia and Iran, Assad's most powerful allies. Tillerson called on both countries to use their influence over Assad to prevent future chemical weapons attacks, and noted Russia's and Iran's roles in helping broker a cease-fire through diplomatic talks in the Kazakh capital, Astana.""As the self-proclaimed guarantors to the cease-fire negotiated in Astana, Russia and Iran also bear great moral responsibility for these deaths,"" Tillerson said.In a statement, the Syrian government ""categorically rejected"" claims that it was responsible, asserting that it does not possess chemical weapons, hasn't used them in the past and will not use them in the future. It laid the blame squarely on the rebels, accusing them of fabricating the attack and trying to frame the Syrian government.The Russian defense ministry said the Khan Sheikhoun residents were exposed to toxic agents from a rebel arsenal hit by a Syrian air strike.The ministry spokesman, Major General Igor Konashenkov, said in a statement early Wednesday that Russian military assets registered the strike on a weapons depots and ammunition factory on the town's eastern outskirts. Konashenkov said the factory produced chemical weapons that were used in Iraq.Photos and video emerging from Khan Sheikhoun, located south of the provincial capital of Idlib, showed the limp bodies of children and adults. Some were struggling to breathe; others appeared to be foaming at the mouth.The activist-run Assi Press published video of paramedics carrying victims, stripped down to their underwear and many appearing unresponsive, from the scene in pickup trucks.It was not immediately clear if all those killed died from suffocation or were struck by other airstrikes that occurred in the area around the same time.It was the third claim of a chemical attack in just over a week in Syria. The previous two were reported in Hama province, in an area not far from Khan Sheikhoun.Opposition activists and a doctor in Idlib said it was the worst incident since the 2013 gas attack on the Damascus suburb of Ghouta that killed hundreds of civilians and which a UN investigation said used sarin gas.Faced with international outrage over that attack, Assad agreed to a Russia-sponsored deal to destroy his chemical arsenal. His government declared a 1,300-ton stockpile of chemical weapons and so-called precursor chemicals that can be used to make weapons, all of which were destroyed.But member states of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons have repeatedly questioned whether Assad declared everything. The widely available chemical chlorine was not covered in the 2013 declaration and activists say they have documented dozens of cases of chlorine gas attacks since then.The Syrian government has consistently denied using chemical weapons and chlorine gas, accusing the rebels of deploying it in the war instead.Dr. AbdulHai Tennari, a pulmonologist who treated dozens of victims of Tuesday's attack, said it appeared to be more serious than a chlorine attack.In a Skype interview, he said doctors were struggling amid extreme shortages, including of the antidote used to save patients, Pralidoxem.Most of the fatalities died before they reached hospitals, Tennari said. ""If they got to the hospital we can treat them. Two children who took a while before they were lifted out of the rubble died,"" he said.Dr. Mohammed Tennari, a radiologist and AbdulHaj Tennari's brother, said Tuesday's attack was more severe than previous ones in the province, most of which used chlorine cylinders.""Honestly, we have not seen this before. The previous times the wounds were less severe,"" he said. The doctor, who testified before the United Nations in 2015 about renewed Syrian government use of chemical attacks despite claims it has destroyed its stockpiles, said there was a chlorine smell after Tuesday's attack, but it was mixed with another unknown ""toxic gas which causes poison and death.""Mohammed Hassoun, a media activist in the nearby town of Sarmin, where some of the critical cases were transferred, said doctors there also believed it was likely more than one gas. ""Chlorine gas doesn't cause such convulsions,"" he said, adding that doctors suspect sarin was used.""There are 18 critical cases here. They were unconscious, they had seizures and when oxygen was administered, they bled from the nose and mouth,"" he told The Associated Press.Tarik Jasarevic, spokesman for the World Health Organization in Geneva, said by email that the agency was gathering more information about Tuesday's incident. The Syrian American Medical Society, which supports hospitals in opposition-held territory, also said it had sent inspectors to Khan Sheikhoun and an investigation was underway.Hussein Kayal, a photographer for the Idlib Media Center, said he was awakened by the sound of a bomb blast around 6:30 a.m., and when he arrived at the scene he found entire families inside their homes unable to move, with their eyes wide open and their pupils constricted. He put on a mask, and he and others took victims to an emergency room. He said he later felt a burning sensation in his fingers and was treated for that.The province of Idlib, which is almost entirely controlled by the opposition, is home to some 900,000 displaced Syrians, according to the United Nations. Rebels and opposition officials have expressed concerns that the government is planning to mount a concentrated attack on the crowded province.New York-based Human Rights Watch has accused the Syrian government of conducting at least eight chlorine gas attacks on opposition-controlled residential areas during the final months of the battle for Aleppo last year that killed at least nine civilians and injured 200. A joint investigation by the United Nations and the international chemical weapons watchdog determined the Syrian government was behind at least three additional attacks in 2014 and 2015 involving chlorine gas, and that the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one, involving mustard gas.Late Tuesday, Abu Hamdu, a rescue worker in Khan Sheikhoun, said people were still searching for their family members, nearly 12 hours after the attack.""People are still very lost,"" he said."

They say a chemical weapons attack on a town in northern Syria on Tuesday killed dozens of people. The Syrian government has denied ever using such weapons.Here is a timeline of events related to chemical weapons use in Syria.August 20, 2012: Former US president Barack Obama says the use of chemical weapons would be a red line that would change his calculus on intervening in the civil war and have enormous consequences.March 19, 2013: The Syrian government and opposition trade accusations over a gas attack that killed some 26 people, including more than a dozen government soldiers, in the town of Khan al-Assal in northern Syria. A UN investigation later finds that sarin nerve gas was used, but does not identify a culprit.August 21, 2013: Hundreds of people suffocate to death in rebel-held suburbs of the Syrian capital, with many suffering from convulsions, pinpoint pupils, and foaming at the mouth. UN investigators visit the sites and determine that ground-to-ground missiles loaded with sarin were fired on civilian areas while residents slept. The US and others blame the Syrian government, the only party to the conflict known to have sarin gas.August 31, 2013: Obama says he will go to Congress for authorisation to carry out punitive strikes against the Syrian government, but appears to lack the necessary support in the legislature.September 27, 2013: The UN Security Council orders Syria to account for and destroy its chemical weapons stockpile, following a surprise agreement between Washington and Moscow, averting US strikes. The Security Council threatens to authorise the use of force in the event of non-compliance.October 14, 2013: Syria becomes a signatory to the Chemical Weapons Convention, prohibiting it from producing, stockpiling, or using chemical weapons.June 23, 2014: The Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons says it has removed the last of the Syrian governments chemical weapons. Syrian opposition officials maintain that the governments stocks were not fully accounted for, and that it retained supplies.August 7, 2015: The UN Security Council authorizes the OPCW and UN investigators to probe reports of chemical weapons use in Syria, as reports circulate of repeated chlorine gas attacks by government forces against civilians in opposition-held areas. Chlorine gas, though not as toxic as nerve agents, can be classified as a chemical weapon depending on its use.August 24, 2016: The joint OPCW-UN panel determines the Syrian government twice used helicopters to deploy chlorine gas against its opponents, in civilian areas in the northern Idlib province. A later report holds the government responsible for a third attack. The attacks occurred in 2014 and 2015. The panel also finds that the Islamic State group used mustard gas.February 28, 2017: Russia, a stalwart ally of the Syrian government, and China veto a UN Security Council resolution authorising sanctions against the Syrian government for chemical weapons use.April 4, 2017: At least 58 people are killed in what doctors say could be a nerve gas attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held Idlib province. Victims show signs of suffocation, convulsions, foaming at the mouth, and pupil constriction. Witnesses say the attack was carried out by either Russian or Syrian Sukhoi jets. Moscow and Damascus deny responsibility."

Once they are allowed for confined field trials, they will have to take no-objection certificates from states,"" said an official.On commercial release of GM mustard, he said the government would go by the Supreme Court 's decision on the pending petition. ""Though a sub-committee of the GEAC hasy given its safety clearance for GM mustard, we need to submit our report to the environment minister (Anil Madhav Dave) for final call.""The biotech regulator last year made the report of the sub-committee public and sought comments from stakeholders. ""Its outcome will also be placed before the ministry which may submit it to the court,"" said the official.The regulator had last year decided to relax the requirement of NOC from states for ""Event Selection Trials"" (ESTs), which are small scale experiments conducted within the premises of institutes. ""It had decided that a decision regarding NOC is to be communicated to applicant within 90 days from the date of receipt and if, in the mean time, the state does not take any appropriate action, the decision is to be considered positive by the applicant,"" he said. The GEAC had not given any relaxation in requirement of obtaining NOC from states for ""Confined Field Trial"" (CFT).The central regulator had recommended field trials for as many as 13 transgenic varieties of rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, cotton, brinjal, mustard, potato, sugarcane and chickpea in 2014.

The entry to these events is free and the play at both venues will begin at 7pm sharp.Many youngsters who hear and read about suicide are often heard saying that it takes courage to end one's life, but Vas says that ""it also takes courage to hold on to hope, to keep searching for that silver lining and gather strength to never give up, and instead intelligently cope with the problem"".Kiran Bhandari of the Mustard Seeds cast told TOI, ""Those suffering from depression have their entire routines messed up, and to make things worse, they stop doing what they like.

Sunflower. Mustard. Crops deemed rather unsuitable for the Kerala clime, they have all been dealt with successfully. Now, the juicy watermelon too has succumbed to the perseverance of farmers in Kanjikuzhi.Achieving a rare success in the state, a farmers collective named Ambalakkara Agricultural Group harvested 2,000 kg of watermelons after having cultivated the trailing vine in two acres of leased land.The watermelon harvested fromthe leased land at Puthanambalam,Kanjikuzhi | ExpressIf anything, the panchayat in Alappuzha is fast turning out to be a research laboratory for farming. Having experimented with various crops alien to the state, the farmers tamed the large fruit that generally flourishes in warm weather.The cultivation was carried out in two acres in Puthanambalam, ward 6 of the panchayat. Terming the endeavour a huge success, the 11-member farmers group is pleased as punch.We received around Rs 60,000 from watermelon farming against an expenditure of around Rs 15,000 to 20,000, said P S Sujith, a young farmer.The seeds were sourced from Bengaluru, with 200 gram costing Rs 4,000. We followed eco-friendly methods for the entire cultivation process, using cow dung, ash and chicken manure. Pure water too is a requisite.Endorsing the feat, Agricultural Department Deputy Director J Premkumar said: It is very rare watermelon is cultivated successfully in such a quantity in Kerala. We have decided to support watermelon farming in more areas from the next season. The produce was sold through bio-vegetable outlets opened along the national highway by the Kanjikuzhi panchayat and the Co-operative Bank.Controlled watering, after a growth of 40 to 50 days, is needed to increase quality and taste, Sujith said. Acknowledging the support of the Agricultural Department in attaining the success, he said: Seventy days are needed for growing watermelon. The cultivation began on Dec 25 and harvesting started in March first week. We are now planning to farm more areas from next season.Kanjikuzhi Co-operative Bank president M Santhosh Kumar backed the effort. The sheer hard work of the young farmers has brought about the success in various farming experiments, he said."

His ancestors, he says, served in the royal Mughal households and were privy to palace intrigues and gossip. While the tradition has been reduced to a roadside service, it still has some takers.Perched on a stair leading to Jama Masjid, Mushahid sports a red skullcap, a cloth satchel slung over his right shoulder and a green towel over his left. He happens to catch a glimpse of Kamal, a 24-year-old who lives on the mosque premises, cleaning and doing menial jobs there.I have always got my ears cleaned by kan melias. I dont use earbuds, says Kamal as Mushahid sits down to work, pulling out a slender ear pick and wrapping a wad of cotton around the spatula before peering down Kamals right ear.The elaborate service, which costs Rs 20, involves several rounds of cleaning  once with plain cotton, the next with cotton dipped in hydrogen peroxide and, if needed, mustard oil. Cotton earbuds in the market irritate the ear and can rupture the ear drum. What I do is clean and heal the ear if it is inflamed or infected. That is why I still have enough customers to make around Rs 250 a day, Mushahid says.But the ear cleaners resent the suspicion they are met with. We have been providing an indispensable service for three centuries. But nowadays, people suspect we use unhygienic instruments which can pass on infections. Thats not true. We sanitise the picks with Dettol before each use, Jamal says.Mushahid says. There are roughly 1,000 more like me, scattered across Old Delhi, Connaught Place, India Gate and the New and Old Delhi railway stations.Things, though, are changing. I am in the trade but my children are studying, so they dont have to join me, says Mushahid.The red pagdi his ancestors proudly donned has been replaced by a thin cotton skullcap. The turban used up a lot of cloth and took a long time to tie. This cap takes a minute to stitch and wear, Mushahid says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Unfortunately not so this year. Since no mutton is available anywhere in the city, I have drawn up an alternate menu comprising paka rui macher kalia (rohu fish curry), pabda macher jhaal (Indian Catfish curry made with copious spreads of mustard sauce) mango chutney, doi (sweet curd) and mishti,"" said Shipra Sahay, secretary of Nari Samity, Ranchi.Ruby Choudhury, a homamaker and a resident of P N Bose Compound, said while substitutes for mutton and kasha mangsho are hard to find, she has decided to use her culinary skills to prepare two to three varieties of fish, with accompaniments of mango chutney, moong daal, doi and mishti this year.Another homemaker, Namita Chatterjee, a resident of Shivangi Apartment at Hazaribag Road, said her Poila Baisakh lunch menu would comprise fish and payesh (kheer or rice pudding) along with other vegetarian and sweet dish accompaniments.Alpana Mukherjee, a homemaker at Purulia Road , said mutton would be replaced with chicken butter masala and two preparations of fish, sweet pulao and the usual doi and mishti for lunch on Poila Baisakh. Anima Ghosh of Tharpakhna said that golda chingri would occupy a place of importance on the platter while Mita Ghosh , a resident of Kantatoli, said: ""With no mutton, fish is our only option.""At Union Club and Library, where a gala dinner is being arranged for members on April 15, Shyama Prasad Mukherjee, secretary, revealed chicken butter masala and fish cutlet would replace mutton this year because of ""extra-ordinary circumstances"".

Step aside, headliners, couture is here to take centre-stage. One of the most followed platforms for spring and summer fashion, the festival heralds the dominance of crop tops, boho tassles and flares in our wardrobes this season. This time, however, experimentation seems to be the flavour of the fortnight with celebrities going beyond the usual boho staples and taking to interesting fusion pieces and silhouettes. From Nicole Scherzinger to Kendall Jenner, heres how you can add these festival hits to your summer rack.Down to the basicsFreida Pintos breezy ensemble is easily one of our favourites from the festivals first weekend. Her torso-baring off-shoulder top teamed with high-waist wide-legged khakhi pants is great for the summer heat and quite different from her otherwise colourful outfit choices. We like the tied sleeves and the Amrapali-style choker and wrist accessory.Shine brightRemember the sequinned cropped disco blouses that were a Bollywood dance number staple back in the early 2000s (think Kareena Kapoor in K3G)? If Kendall Jenners ensemble is something to go by, looks like theyre back in style. The sparkly bralette paired with a pailette-embellished Esteban Cortazar shirt and high-waist stripe trousers is a great way to contemporise a retro favourite.Jamming it upTrust British supermodel Jourdan Dunn to teach you how to rock a party in your jammies. Making her Coachella debut, the 26-year-olds mustard satin pyjama suit paired with a simple black bustier brings the best of the seasons trends together for a chic and comfortable ensemble.Cut above the restModel Lottie Moss sure knows how to add class to a festive ensemble. The off-shoulder billowy crop top complete with a keyhole neckline teamed with a high-waited black wrap skirt with a split down the middle is great for all body types with a touch of sophistication. You may choose to throw in some staple pumps to make this party perfect but we like Moss decision to go for casual pure white sneakers better.The right knitCrochet jackets and throws are done and dusted but Nicole Scherzinger just took the fabric a notch higher with this figure-hugging dress.The denim jacket addition paired with chunky black boots and a simple sling bag is a winner.

Please take whatever you need and drop the money in the honesty box. We trust you, reads the board on Thumbis public refrigerator installed at a flat in the city. Inside are packs of neatly cut vegetables, salads for the health conscious and dozens of nadan eggs. There is finely chopped carrot along with onion, curry leaves and all others that go into the dish. An initiative of Thumbi, the complete online agriculture store, the idea is to provide pesticide-free products and promote farming. Its not a profit-oriented concept. For us its part of our social responsibility and yes, we trust our customers, says Noufal, one of the directors.Thumbi was started six months ago by four techies, all of them interested in botany and farming. The idea was to come up with a comprehensive site that provides almost everything associated with agriculture. From grow bags and vermicompost to ready-to-cook organic products and desktop plants, Thumbi offers a number of services. Under seven different categories come vegetables, organic products, plants, seeds, accessories, agri services and books. Instead of going for unhealthy vegetables from other states, we source products from local farmers and deliver it at your doorstep, says Anoop Francis who founded the e-store with Nishad, Mithun and Noufal.Noufal says the customer feedback has been great and as of now they have a strong and growing clientele. Tumbis cutting unit near Vellayani College offers finely cut vegetables and there is an option for bulk orders as well. Waste management is one of the gravest issues we are facing today. Various eateries and restaurants in the city are making tons of vegetable waste each day. What we do is collect their menu and offer vegetables cut according to their requirement. You can save the time needed for cutting and there will be no waste.The portal also offers a range of herbal plants and saplings, most of which are available across Kerala. Lakshmi taru, red guava, mustard, hog plum, stevia and vetiver will be shipped to your home in special grow bags. Then we also have seeds of many flowers, fruits and vegetables. We have vendors at various places and we handle the procurement and delivery in a professional manner, he adds.Thumbi has also established a direct link with farmers, getting rid of middlemen and offering them maximum profit. The farmers usually get only 30 to 50 percentage of the selling price. If you are a farmer with quality produce you can always approach us for a much better deal. Naufel says he wouldnt call all the products organic, but each vegetable is cleaned in veg wash, a special solution developed at College of Agriculture. All our products are safe to eat. And we also have pure organic menu and all such products are listed on our site. If you order cut vegetables before 8 pm, they will be delivered the next day fresh from the farm, he adds."

Where, by whom and how were the samples taken?""""If there truly had been sarin in Khan Sheikhun, then how can the OPCW explain the charlatans from the White Helmets hopping about in sarin fumes without protective equipment?""The Russian-Iranian move for a new inquiry raised hackles at the OPCW executive council meeting this week.The fact-finding team ""deserves our full confidence,"" the Belgian representative to the OPCW told the meeting on Wednesday.""We don't see the need to put in place a new structure.""The draft decision had also sought to urge member states to ""provide national experts for participation in the investigation.""That would have enabled Moscow to deploy its own experts alongside the OPCW's independent teams in a bid ""to discredit the results"" so far, one source close to the discussions told AFP.In an unprecedented step, the OPCW's executive council in November condemned Syria's use of toxic weapons -- the council's first public condemnation of a member of the Chemical Weapons Convention.It came after a joint UN-OPCW investigation concluded in October that the Syrian air force had dropped chlorine barrel-bombs from helicopters on three opposition-held villages in 2014 and 2015.Islamic State jihadists were also found to have used mustard gas in August 2015 in Syria.Russia last week vetoed a UN draft resolution condemning the April 4 attack and demanding the Syrian government cooperate with an investigation, blocking Security Council action against its ally for the eighth time.After Moscow initially said a Syrian air strike had struck a ""terrorist warehouse"" containing ""toxic substances,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin last week accused Assad's opponents of planning to stage chemical attacks to lure Washington deeper into the conflict."

With blacks, whites and greys as his palette  and the occasional splash of mustard or seaweed green  he creates spaces that are serene and often dramatic. And anyone who rents Studio BnB for a night can see this firsthand, without knocking on the doors of any of his clients, which includes director-producer-TV host Karan Johar and owner of Bharat Floorings and Tiles, Firdaus Variava.Vazirani believes in reinventing himself with each project. I tend to keep revisiting ideas. I dont enjoy being someone who designs a space in two months, cuts copies pastes it, and is done, explains the self-taught designer, who honed his skills first as an associate style editor with UK-based interiors magazine, Living Etc .Grey sets the moodCurrently designing the new Bharat Tiles store in Mumbai, Vazirani says the idea of the luxury home is changing. People are starting to enjoy spaces that are minimalistic and pay attention to detail. Luxury is in how you interact with things and the materials you choose. And this approach is spreading now, says the 34-year-old. An example in point: a white-tiled bathroom with copper accents he created, which is classic, understated and uber luxe. I imported the tiles from Spain and spent the equivalent of fancy Italian marble for that space, he laughs.Though he feels the industrial look may be on its way out, the minimalist in him is drawn to concrete, a still on-trend raw material. He recalls a transit stop four years ago at the Bangkok airport, which is beautifully finished in concrete, and getting obsessed with it. I prefer spaces that appear larger even if they are small, and one of the easiest ways to do this is to not have any joinery in the floor. And concrete is a material that allows me to go seamless, he shares, explaining that he is experimenting with it at his studio, too, where he makes dcor pieces (like concrete diamonds that grace his coffee table at home), lamps, table tops and door knobs. We also do concrete marbling  where you mix different colours to create a marbled effect. We did fun ice popsicles with this for a recent Nicobar travel pop-up, he says.A night at the studioLaunched a month ago, Studio BnB is in the heart of Bandra. I travel quite frequently and use a lot of Airbnb. On a recent trip to Paris, I lived in a house and went to the coffee shop every morning for a croissant. It makes you feel like a local. And I can imagine people wanting to do the same in Bombay, says Vazirani. The design of the 500 sq ft bed-and-breakfast is an extension of his home, with random things (like a retro blue typewriter and large pickling jars) coming together in rooms painted white, with diaphanous curtains and art on the walls. But what catches our interest is that you can buy much of what you see there. Often, when people come home, they ask where they can buy certain things. So I thought it would be an interesting experiment, says the 34-year-old, who currently has framed photographs by Neville Sukhia and Shahid Datawala, besides art pieces from Project88 and Sulaiman Merchants series on dogs. All the furniture (made at the studio) can be recreated or customised on request, too. We suggest you give the cement marbled side tables in the living room a second look.Book the bed-and-breakfast atRs. 5,427, on airbnb.co.in."

I studied International Relations and French in the UK and Paris and had planned a career in an international organisation or the media.When I studied in Paris, I lived with a family who spent a great deal of time, effort and money on good food and good ingredients.This is probably where my interest in food really took off. I also learned that it wasnt just about the food and the taste but it was about what the French like to call art de vivre or the art of livingin other words lifestyle .I returned to India soon after and found I missed European food... fresh salads, healthy and tasty light food. From then on, there was no looking back. I became friends with frying pan. Wherever I travelled, whether it was southern Spain or Russia, Shanghai or Bali, food became my ambassador.I find mustard to be a unique ingredient. I love mustard in all forms  as a wholegrain mustard or Dijon mustard condiment, ground into a paste in Bengali cooking, mixed with other spices for the Bengali panch phoren and in South Indian and Gujarati dishes in a tadka. Of course it is also used to perk up a hot dog and hamburger.I use it extensively in salad dressings, the wholegrain with honey for a honey mustard dressing and the Dijon or wholegrain for a foil wrapped chicken or fish parcels where you need to use no oil. Devilishly easy, the essence of the fish parcel is simplicity and great mustard. It is inspired by the Bengali dish Paturi where Hilsa or betki is smothered in a paste of mustard ground with mustard oil and green chilli and steamed in a banana leaf. The honey mustard chicken is a perennial favourite in our house. Be creative with rice by using leftover rice for a rice salad which has dry fruit, nuts and a rich mustardy dressing.I am sharing a recipe of a salad - beetroot made zingy with a lovely mustard dre ssing.Karen Anand was recently in the city for VR Foodies Fest."

He said that he administered mustard oil to his animals to help them combat the heat.Manjeet Dhankhar from a village in Rohtak district said that he owns four buffaloes and due to the heat waves the delivery of milk has gown down by 30%.

The recent attack in Syria was a horrific reminder of this threat. There can be no impunity for these crimes,"" he said in a video message to the ceremony.""For 20 years we have been allies in this cause. Now let us resolve to consign these diabolic weapons to the pages of history.""The ceremony was also attended by Dutch King Willem-Alexander and Sweden's Princess Victoria, as well as ambassadors from OPCW-member nations.Despite the celebrations, ""we cannot ignore the black cloud hanging over us"", said Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders, referring especially to the April 4 suspected sarin gas attack in the Syrian rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun, the latest in several attacks.The continued use of such weapons underscored that the OPCW as an independent, neutral body was needed ""more than ever before,"" Koenders added.In an unprecedented step in November, the OPCW's executive council condemned Syria's use of toxic weapons -- its first public condemnation of any of the 192 members of the convention.- Syria the 'greatest test' -Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 after denying for years that it had toxic arms. And while 100 percent of its declared stockpile has been destroyed in an operation involving some 30 countries, there are growing fears that the Syrian regime did not reveal the true extent of its armoury.OPCW director general Ahmet Uzumcu acknowledged Wednesday that ""our collective journey to banish forever the evil of chemical weapons has reached momentous landmarks.""But he warned that ""in Syria the OPCW has faced its greatest test of commitment as well as resilience.""""Our work in Syria is not yet finished. It is of grave concern that we continue to see reports of the use of chemical weapons.""He urged Egypt, Israel, North Korea and South Sudan -- the last four countries which have not yet signed the convention -- to join up ""without delay"".And with some victims in the audience, he paid tribute to those who have suffered most from such deadly weapons, first used on the battlefields of Belgium's Ypres in World War I.The victims ""remind us of the human toll when morality is recklessly abandoned and universal norms callously breached,"" Uzumcu said.""The work of the OPCW represents the most effective response to such cruelty; a ray of hope illuminating a dark shadow on our history."""

Summer vacations are around the corner, and the rigidity of routine is waiting to be broken. Nestled amidst the Sahyadri hills, by the banks of the Vadivale Lake, in Kamshet is a workspace that encourages kids to get away from the routine and claustrophobia of daily life in a city. Director Atul Kumars theatre residency in Kamshet, will host the Young People's Programme, a weeklong summer theatre camp for children aged between eight-12 years.Beyond the stageKumar who runs one of the most prolific and visible theatre production houses in the country, The Company Theatre kick-started his dream project the TCT Workspace in Kamshet in 2011. Thats when he set-up a space for artists from different genres to come together and create new work. Their first production to emerge from the residency programme, Piya Behrupriya a retelling of Shakespeares Twelfth Night  has gone onto receiving numerous national and international accolades. Since then, Kumar has staged Khwab Sa , an adaptation of William Shakespeares A Midsummer Nights Dream which come back to the Mumbai stage later in the year.When Kumar isnt showing-off his histrionics either on stage, or off it, hes using his time to plan workshops that are more for all-round development rather than just focused on theatre. Since the drama aficionados own journey began at the young age of 14, Kumars commitment to the medium of theatre has been a long one. Kumar was instantly hooked to the spotlight when he filled in for an injured actor at a school production of Afraid of the Dark . After a stint with the Delhi theatre group, Chingari, Kumar set-up The Company Theatre in 1993. When asked what about the art form keeps him going, Kumar states simply, Thats all I know.Summer camp funThe programme at Kamshet also aims to familiarise children to life in the village. Bring forth a connection with the land, explains Kumar excitedly. The seven-day summer camp of sorts, will introduce kids to farming techniques, recycling methods, nature walks, storytelling sessions, milking buffalos and cows, baking and cooking. Apart from walking amidst the 500 trees planted through the village and bird watching, the participating children will also encouraged to dive into the lake nearby. We also have home cooked khaana provided by a lovely Assamese couple, and two dogs to play with, laughs Kumar.The actor/director will head the theatre programme, which will highlight various aspects of acting through group play, voice modulation, body and space in movement, improvisation, personal stories, and text work. Our workshops are not done to make great actors at the end of them, but allow self expression, which is the most important thing, elaborates Kumar. With only 18 kids being admitted into the residency, he believes that the small group will help provide a sense of focus.Food for thoughtFor the younglings who are as curious in the kitchen, as they are on stage; baker and theatre maker, Shivani Tanksale is planning on whipping up a cooking course that also touches upon the fundamentals of baking. The course was a suggestion made by Kumars 11-year-old daughter who was disappointed by the gender barriers in her classroom, and decided to speak-up. She came-up and said to me you know dad? Sometimes people think that only girls are interested in cooking, but so many boys in my class are interested in it too, recounts a proud Kumar.To ensure safety, only Tanksale will be given open permission to handle a flame, while the kids will indulge in no-flame recipes. We also want the children to experience cooking with food grown from our fields. Know how it tastes, how it feels, how its grown using natural pesticides. Theyll hopefully feel a sense of pride in that, elaborates the director. At the end of the seventh day of the camp, parents will be invited for a food presentation and play performance, by the kids.For somebody who has been a part of the theatre industry since 30 years, and directed numerous actors, Kumar explains that theres a different kind of joy that comes with working with kids. He says, They dont have baggage, they speak their heart, theyre not groomed, they justare. In a world thats so full of facades, a mask used for self-expression, can only be refreshing.The Young Peoples Programme will take place from May 14-20.

Take a trip down Gandhi Road and you can never miss out on the number of silk sari showrooms that display their best variety. Our reporter goes on a day long trip to the sari town and captures the story of weaves.Every wedding in a typical South Indian family includes an elaborate trip to Kancheepuram, to buy the best muhurtha podavai for the blushing bride-to-be. As a young kid, this meant a day in another town, running across the narrow aisles as the women gushed over row upon row of colourful saris. Now as I step through the various distinct phases on a silk trail, organised by Jhoola Activity Centre, in collaboration with Co-optex, for children and parents, I finally understand what the fuss was about.These kids are lucky to learn the Kancheepuram silk story at such a young age. Kancheepuram silk saris have a history and profundity as rich as their appearance.Often considered heirlooms, these saris range from Rs 8,000 to over Rs 1 Lakh, depending on the weight, design and quantity of zari.A silk sari passes through several hands before you buy it at the retail store. The silk and zari threads are processed separately, and reach the co-operative society from where, based on designers expertise, the silk yarn and zari are distributed to respective weavers. Once the saris are woven, they are taken back to the co-op society which then sends them to retail stores. Kancheepuram has both co-operative (government-owned) and private silk sari dealers. The silk handloom industry forms a major part of the towns economy.Raw Silk ProcessingExtraction of silk Silkworms are reared on mulberry leaves and when they start pupating in their cocoons, they are put into boiling water. The cocoons produce individual long fibres that are extracted and fed into a spinning reel. Based on thickness of silk thread, 18-20 cocoons produce one silk thread. Presently, the silk weavers co-operative societies receive ready silk from TANSILK (Tamil Nadu Co-operative Silk Producers Federation)AHIMSA SILKA more humane way of silk production: cocoons are allowed to hatch naturally, or manually, and the vacant cocoons are boiled instead. This is called Ahimsa silk, as its a non-violent way of procuring the material. Making Ahimsa silk takes 10 days, while normal silk takes only 15 minutes and the process yields six times less silk filaments. Thus it costs Rs 6,000 a kg, twice the cost of normal silk.WHATS IN A KANCHEEPURAM SARI?A sari is made by hand-weaving silk and zari threads in an elaborate process. They are known for their strength and durability, made possible by the twisted yarn  double warp and double weft, which gives it the weight. In a typical Kancheepuram sari, the main body, pallu and border are woven separately resulting in a korvai or visible zig-zag stitch that runs parallel to edge of the border and pallu. This joint is woven strongly; this differentiates the Kancheepuram silk saris from the others. Nowadays, however, the body, border and pallu are woven together, and we get different colours in the border and pallu, thanks to tie-and-dye method, wherein a single silk warp is dyed in different coloursDYING UNITRaw silk is rough and sticky in texture, and needs to undergo a series of processes before it becomes fine and shiny. Raw silk yarn is received from the co-operative society. Based on the designs, yarn loops are de-gummed, dyed and dried before sending them back to the co-operative societies to be distributed to the weavers.1. The raw silk is rinsed thoroughly in normal water to remove dirt and soften the silk before de-gumming.2. Water is heated to 90C in a boiler and the steam thus produced is sent through pipes to eachtrough of water. In a day, about 6,000 litres of water is used. Its recycled using a reverse osmosisplant, thus saving water to a large degree.3. The wet silk is immersed in boiling hot water mixed with soap and soda to remove the roughness and dirt. This process takes up to 30 minutes, during which Sekar and Mani constantly stand by, in the searing hot and humid set-up and periodically twist and rotate the silk yarn with the rods to ensure even de-gumming. Finally, the silk yarns are taken out, twisted dry and kept aside. In one turn, about 6 kg of silk is degummed. In a day, they do over 70 kg.4. The process of dying usually takes about 15 minutes, based on the colour. Originally, natural dyes were used, but now chemical acid or metal complex dyes are used. Similar to de-gumming, the yarn is immersed in a trough filled with boiling dye-infused water and periodically rotated to ensure even colouring.5. The rich dyed silk yarn loops are removed, and washed in a normal water bath. They are then soakedin a fixing agent (for lighter colours, lime juice is used) and finally the silk yarn is spun in a machine to remove all moisture and laid out to dry in the sun for about 2-3 hours, after which it is bundled and sent back to the co-op society office. This whole process imparts a soft sheen texture to the silk threads.ZARI PROCESSINGZari is essentially a silk thread coated with silver (50-55%) and gold (0.5%), and is the most expensive element of the Kancheepuram sari. Previously zari was imported from Gujarat, but now zari processing units have opened in the region to meet the increasing demand. Weavers measure and collect required amount of zari according to their saris design, in the form of warps or wefts, from the co-operative society. Saris vary in zari from 10% to about 60% . The cost of the sari is directly proportional to the zari quantity.CENTRALISED DISTRIBUTION OF DYED SILK YARN AND ZARICo-operative societies hold all the dyed silk yarn and zari in organised, numbered storage. An in-house designer allots designs to weavers who then collect their pre-assigned silk warps and zari. These are measured and weighed before distribution. One gram of zari (called koolighai) costs about Rs 45, while 1 g of silk costs Rs 5.Making of a SariSIZING AND WARPINGThe silk warps are stretched across two bamboo stands. Each thread of silk is separated slowly to remove dust, the warp is looped and then immersed in rice kanji (diluted rice gruel)  this process is called sizing. After sizing, the warp is stretched once again for dressing and dried by exposure. This is an extremely laborious and specific process. It is usually done early mornings or evenings as the heat from the sun will cause distraction and sweat may harm the silk. In the olden days, there used to be a puli thoppu in between the weavers houses where this will be done. Presently, warping is done in house backyards. A bridal sari that was being designed with zari will cost up to 1 lakh!WEAVINGWeaving a Kancheepuram sari is a complex process and takes anywhere between five to 30 days. Every sari is woven by double warp (threads along length of the sari) and double weft (shorter threads along the shorter length of the sari), the combination of which provides the weight and strength to the sari. The warps are stretched across the handloom, while the weft is inserted by hand using shuttles. The threads used in weaving are in fact three threads twisted together, which adds to the strength. In the case of small butta, motifs in the body, pallu and border, the weft consist of zari threads, instead of silk. For preparing a traditional double side contrast border sari, three shuttles are used which requires an extra semi-skilled labourer.PATTERNS & MOTIFSBorder designs are drawn to scale on drawing paper and then traced on a graph sheet. Inked-in squares are marked on paper for portions where figures come. Adai cards are punched to the requirement of the design and are read by a Jacquard machine, which accordingly lifts the thread associated with the design thus creating patterns on the sari. Motifs in border and rich designs in the pallu are produced by pulling the lever connected to the Jacquard boxes of different hook capacityDESIGNSPopular border designs found are brick, birds, animals, leaf, mango, nayapaisa, sovereign etc. Local names for designs are: MORNING EVENING : A sari with different sized borders GANGA JAMUNA : A sari with different coloured borders THANDAVALAM: Stripes run parallel along the length of the sari KOTTADI: Checked squares or rectangle pattern The most popular colours used are blue, black, green and mustard. A popular bright blue colour, which was favoured by singer MS Subbulakshmi, has been named after her as MS blue!TEST FOR PURE SILKCut out a small corner, or few fibres, from the sari and burn it. If the smell is similar to burning hair, and produces a black ash-like substance, then it is pure silk. The logic is, silk being a natural product, will burn and smell like hair, another natural product. Artificial silk will smell like burnt plastic and produce black dripping soot.A MOVIEThe early struggles and difficulties faced by silk weavers of Kancheepuram before the co-operative movement was showcased in a movie, Kanchivaram (2008), starring Prakash Raj and Shriya Reddy. The film went on to win the National Award. Though the status of these silk weavers has improved significantly now, the film portrays a very poignant past."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, April 26: The Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) today said the Narendra Modi government was creating issues like beef ban and Aadhar cards for cows to divert the people's attention from its failures. KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi told reporters here that after three years in power, the Modi government had not only failed to curb price rise but had also opened 40 public sector undertakings for foreign direct investment. Akhil said the government had hit the farmers and the underprivileged hard by withdrawing the subsidy on fertilisers and allowing the State Bank of India to charge customers who are unable to maintain a minimum balance in their bank accounts. ""Whenever someone raises his voice against these regressive policies, the Modi government hits back using the media and social media and brands the person anti-national. Under Modi as Prime Minister, the largest number of public sector undertakings have been opened for FDI without paying heed to anyone's opposition,"" he said. ""The average retail price of arhar dal has increased to Rs 11,000 per quintal in January this year from Rs 6,700 in May 2014. Similarly, during the same period, the price of masoor dal increased to Rs 9,100 from Rs 6,500 per quintal, mustard oil to Rs 102 from Rs 86 per litre and rohu fish to Rs 160 from Rs 115 per kilogram. These are only a few examples,"" he added. Akhil criticised the BJP for allowing the SBI to charge on the accounts which do not have minimum balance. #""After coming to power, the Centre forced poor people to open bank accounts saying those will need zero balance. The government has connected these accounts with various government schemes so that they cannot be closed. The tea garden workers have even been forced to take their salaries through bank accounts. Now, the SBI has decided to charge the accounts which do not have a minimum balance. The bank even decided to charge if someone withdraws his money more than three times a month. But the Modi government is silent."" ""The government has failed to issue Aadhar cards to the people of Assam. Now it is going to give Aadhar cards to cows. This is nothing but an attempt to keep people busy with such issues to cover the failure of the government,"" Akhil added. He alleged that the BJP in Assam had also failed to fulfil the promises it had made to the people of Assam. ""Before completion of a year of the BJP-led government in Assam, we will remind the people about the promises."""

The big cats that strayed into civilian areas were rescued and released into the wild.These operations are important as in November 24, last year, a two-and half-year-old leopard was beaten to death at Mandawar in Sohna area in the presence of staff from wildlife department officials and the police.After the first incident, four more cases  December 28 in Malaka, February 16 in Palwal, March 17 in Sohna at a village near Mandawar and the latest in Durga Colony of Sohna  have been reported.In all these cases, the leopards were released into the Aravali forest after they were examined by the vets and were cleared to be returned to their natural habitat, officials of the wildlife department said.After the November 24 incident, we have been taking active steps to avoid any untoward incidents, said Shyam Sunder Kaushik, divisional forest officer, wildlife, Gurgaon.The wildlife officials were given training to handle the tranquilizer and deal with the mob when confronted with the kind of situation as was seen on November 24.Read I Gurgaon: Leopard attacks two in 5-hour drama, watch videoThe Mandawar incident stands out as one where everything that could go wrong did. The tranquilizer arrived late and it was alleged that the forest officials and policemen at the spot made no effort to control and disperse the mob that went after the big cat.However, the officials took lessons from that incident and exercised due caution while conducting all subsequent operations. The same was key to the leopards being rescued.A three-and-a-half-year-old male leopard that strayed into mustard fields near Malaka village of Tauru, 40 km from Gurgaon, on December 28, was rescued by a team of forest and police officers and released into the wild the day after.After being rescued, the leopard was sent to a veterinary hospital in Rohtak district where the doctors took care of it.Similarly, on February 16, a male leopard was rescued by the wildlife department from Krishna Colony in Palwal after a five-hour operation. Again, on March 17, a leopard was rescued from a village near Mandar in Sohna.Even after these successful stories, the wildlife department still believes that it needs more tranquilizer guns, darts and staff to deal with these cases. A proposal to augment the number of tranquilizer guns and vehicles has been sent to the state government. We are also waiting for a nod regarding another proposal to collar leopards with a view to monitoring their movement and tracing their habitat, Kaushik said."

You should check them out; theyre doing some fantastic stuff.Its not often that you hear restaurateurs praising another restaurant, and Im intrigued.Opened by two ex-chefs who handled the Japanese and Thai food at San Qi at the Four Seasons, The Blue is extremely tiny. It seats just 14 inside and 8 outside. Its so small that every time the woman behind me adjusts her seat, her elbow digs into my back. This size of restaurant is a popular format in the stretch between Bandra and Khar. One table is occupied by a group of vaguely familiar television actors who bitch about script rehearsals between discussing the culinary delights of Singapore.The mushroom gyoza at The Blue are crisp on the outside and hold an almost mousse-like filling. They go well with the soy-chilli dip. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)With just two cuisines to choose from, ordering is easy. We start with a plate of nigiri sushi. Thin, bright pink slices of tuna akami that look like slivers of raw steak are draped over sushi rice. The rice is slightly warm, a touch over body temperature. Its unusual, but doesnt detract from the taste or texture of the sushi. Our mushroom gyoza are crisp and brown on the outside with a mousse-like texture to the filling. It tastes even better with the sweet-salty-spicy soy-chilli dip.The soft-shell crab tempura is coated in Japanese mustard. Its one of the popular starters at the Khar restaurant. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)Im equally impressed by the texture of the Karashi mustard soft shell crab, batter-fried and coated in mildly piquant Japanese mustard. The crab is simultaneously, soft, crisp and crunchy. The salad though seems superfluous. We are quite pleased with all the Japanese starters.For the main course we shift to Thai: a chicken green curry and a serving of crispy pork. Its not easy to get a good green curry at a standalone place in Mumbai. Most use ready-made curry pastes, which flattens the flavours somewhat. What distinguishes The Blues curry is that you can not only taste the spices, but also the flavour of the vegetables. It also has faint citrus aroma which brings a zesty freshness to every morsel.The Blues green Thai curry doesnt taste like the usual pre-made pastes. You can taste the spices and the veggies, and theres a refreshing hint of citrus. (Aalok Soni / HT Photo)Tossed with baby corn and zucchini in a spicy-sweet sauce, each cube of pork has a perfectly crackled skin. Its more crunchy pork than crispy.The only disappointment was the tub tim grob. Served in a glass bowl rather than a coconut shell, it looked rather unloved and the achingly underwhelming coconut milk left you a little heartbroken.The Blue is doing some fantastic stuff indeed; its five-star hotel quality food at about one-fourth the price.HT reviews anonymously and pays for all meals"

We are even requesting people to create water holes outside village areas so that these animals do not enter the villages for water, said Shyam Sunder Kaushik, divisional forest officer, wildlife, Gurgaon.Similarly, a three-and-a-half year-old male leopard was also released into Aravallis on December 29 by the wildlife department after it entered into mustard fields near Malaka village of Tauru, 40 kms from Gurgaon.However, the rescue operation in Sohna was important for the wildlife wing as on November 24, a leopard was beaten to death by the villagers when it strayed into Mandawar village in Gurgaon.

Meanwhile private vehicles will be handed a memorandum in this regard besides a rose, and will be allowed to proceed further to Delhi. Ambulance or emergency services will not be disrupted.Our motive behind stopping vehicles going to Delhi from Punjab is not to harass people, but to lodge our symbolic protest against the Punjab governments attitude. The State government vehicles, whether that of a bureaucrat or others including chief minister or ministers, will not be allowed to move, said Leader of Opposition Abhay Singh Chautala.The INLD leader also accused chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar of letting down the people of Haryana by not including opposition leaders at a meeting he held with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.INLD State president, Ashok Arora, said that the partys State executive has passed a resolution demanding compensation of Rs 25,000 per acre for farmers whose crop was been burnt in fire, and immediate arrangement of electricity, drinking and irrigation water in places where there is acute shortage besides compensation to farmers who have been forced to sell their mustard produce below maximum selling price (MSP).Meanwhile, Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) took strong notice of the threat issued by INLD to stop Punjabi vehicles from entering Haryana on July 10 and termed this act as unfortunate, illegal, unconstitutional and highly dangerous.SAD Secretary and Spokesman Dr. Daljit Singh Cheema said that it was surprising that a responsible political party is giving a call for such a program which can directly result in bloody clashes between the people of Punjab and Haryana. He said that this decision of NLD has reminded the people of the 1982 ASIAN games during which people from Punjab, particularly Sikhs, who were going to watch the games were dragged out of their vehicles and humiliated.Daljit Singh Cheema further said that political parties from Haryana should desist from indulging in such inciting activities and should not forget their responsibilities while trying to score points in the political battle on the SYL issue. He said that neither could such a bogus threat scare Punjabis nor can it stop them from entering Haryana.SAD has urged Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to take serious notice of the threats issued by INLD and ensure safety of Punjabis and smooth flow of traffic from Punjab to Delhi via Haryana and vice-versa."

The finance ministry (FM) had mooted a change in the FY in July last year, arguing that the April-March cycle does not allow budget-makers to have a proper assessment of the monsoon. It had described the calendar year as more in sync with the rhythms of rural development and infrastructure-related activities in the country. The proposal had evoked mixed responses with the Niti Aayog supporting it and the industry body, ASSOCHAM, issuing a trenchant critique. In his Niti Aayog speech on April 24, the PM had called for taking the debate to Parliament and the state assemblies. It is disquieting, then, that the MP government has decided to carry out the change even before such a debate has begun.In July last year, the FM constituted a committee led by the former chief economic adviser, Shankar Acharya, to examine the desirability and feasibility of changing the FY. In December, after the committee submitted its report, the ministry denied an imminent change in the FY. It talked of reviewing the Acharya committee report and stated that changing the FY would require a lot of preparations. While the report is not in the public domain and neither the Union government nor the MP government have gone public about their preparations, it seems that criticism of the move has gone unheeded. The ASSOCHAM, for instance, had argued, changing the financial year will not only mean a change in book-keeping, but also in the entire infrastructure of accounting software, taxation systems, human resource practices involving huge costs for both big and small industries. The shift would cost hundreds of crores of rupees, the industry body had said.MPs plan to present its budget for 2018 in December this year, is presumably aninitial-year exercise. Aligning the FY with the calendar year would require the budget to be presented in October or November, about the time when sowing for rabi crops  most importantly, wheat and mustard  begins. It defies logic as to how the finance minister will conduct this exercise with, at best, a sketchy idea of the harvest next year. What is even worse is that the minister will have virtually zero information of the monsoon next year.

5b5064a39855b70b4a41ab45,Calendar Tinkering,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/calendar-tinkering-4639550/,2017-05-04,"Barely a week after Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke about aligning the fiscal year (FY) with the calendar year in a speech at the Niti Aayog, the Madhya Pradesh government has announced that it will implement the change by presenting its budget for 2018 in December this year. The finance ministry (FM) had mooted a change in the FY in July last year, arguing that the April-March cycle does not allow budget-makers to have a proper assessment of the monsoon. It had described the calendar year as more in sync with the rhythms of rural development and infrastructure-related activities in the country. The proposal had evoked mixed responses with the Niti Aayog supporting it and the industry body, ASSOCHAM, issuing a trenchant critique. In his Niti Aayog speech on April 24, the PM had called for taking the debate to Parliament and the state assemblies. It is disquieting, then, that the MP government has decided to carry out the change even before such a debate has begun.In July last year, the FM constituted a committee led by the former chief economic adviser, Shankar Acharya, to examine the desirability and feasibility of changing the FY. In December, after the committee submitted its report, the ministry denied an imminent change in the FY. It talked of reviewing the Acharya committee report and stated that changing the FY would require a lot of preparations. While the report is not in the public domain and neither the Union government nor the MP government have gone public about their preparations, it seems that criticism of the move has gone unheeded. The ASSOCHAM, for instance, had argued, changing the financial year will not only mean a change in book-keeping, but also in the entire infrastructure of accounting software, taxation systems, human resource practices involving huge costs for both big and small industries. The shift would cost hundreds of crores of rupees, the industry body had said.MPs plan to present its budget for 2018 in December this year, is presumably aninitial-year exercise. Aligning the FY with the calendar year would require the budget to be presented in October or November, about the time when sowing for rabi crops  most importantly, wheat and mustard  begins. It defies logic as to how the finance minister will conduct this exercise with, at best, a sketchy idea of the harvest next year. What is even worse is that the minister will have virtually zero information of the monsoon next year. The MP governments move is ill-thought out, and other states would be well-advised not to follow suit without a thorough debate.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Assad denies responsibility. An initial report by an OPCW fact-finding mission is expected next week. It will not apportion blame, but aims to establish whether chemical weapons were used.Uzumcu, a Turkish diplomat, has said the mission has analyzed samples, including blood, urine and tissue, taken from Khan Sheikhoun victims and found incontrovertible evidence that they were exposed to the nerve agent sarin or a similar toxin. But Uzumcu said they are still working to figure out exactly what happened. Russia has suggested victims could have been killed by toxic agents released from a rebel chemical arsenal struck by Syrian warplanes.The issue will of course be to develop a narrative on the incident  how it happened  so we can be sure that those victims in fact were really affected by the release of sarin in Khan Sheikhoun, Uzumcu said. So we are not yet there, but the analysis or results of analysis are indeed incontrovertible.France last week published a detailed report into the Khan Sheikhoun attack, saying French tests showed that the sarin used bore hallmarks of the Syrian regimes chemical weapons program.

From the farmer in UPs Hathras who sells his spent animals, to the small-time vyapari through whom it reaches the supplier of a state-of the-art processing-cum-exporting unit in Aligarh, the buffalos journey.FOR Puran Chand Sharma, dealing with Mohammad Sabir Qureshi is a twice or maybe thrice-a-year affair. But this transactional relationship is essential to sustaining his dairy farm operation involving 10 female buffaloes  three now in-milk, two pregnant animals, two young yet-to-calve heifers, and three one-year-old calves.The ones that are pregnant will start giving milk when those currently producing go dry. In the meantime, the jhoti (heifers) will also be ready to conceive. So, at any time, Ill have three buffaloes together yielding 25-30 litres daily for me to sell at Rs 30-35 per litre, explains the 60-something Sharma. So, where does Qureshi come in? Prompt comes the reply: He takes care of the animals that have become a bojh (burden) on me.Sharma classifies the buffaloes that are a bojh into four categories. The first includes those that after about five lactations  by then, theyre 9-10 years old  have stopped producing enough milk to justify their continued maintenance. The second are infertile animals (we wont sell if they do not get pregnant the first time, but will if they dont the second time too). The third are the ones with damaged udders (jiske thun bekaar ho gaye). The last are male calves, sold even before they are a year old.These animals are of no use to me. If they are useful to him (Qureshi) and he is willing to pay me Rs 25,000 or more, why should I have a problem selling? That money I can use to buy a four-year-old, first-time lactating buffalo, capable of giving 2,000 litres annually, for Rs 60,000. This cycle of replacing old animals with new is what keeps my business going, Sharma says in a matter-of-fact tone.Farmer: Puran Chand Sharma. At Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur, it costs him Rs 100 a day to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for a buffalo with a yield of 10 litres. So he sells his unproductive cattle for Rs 25,000 or more (Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Puran Chand Sharma. At Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur, it costs him Rs 100 a day to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for a buffalo with a yield of 10 litres. So he sells his unproductive cattle for Rs 25,000 or more (Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Agrees Chaudhary Maharaj Singh, a 2.5-acre, five-animal farmer from Madhaka, the village in Sadabad tehsil of Uttar Pradeshs Hathras district to which Sharma belongs. A buffalo has to be fed 10 kg bhusa (wheat straw), 1 kg khali (mustard oilcake) and 1 kg daliya (ground wheat) every day, whether or not it produces milk. For 10 litres yield, I have to increase the khali to 4 kg and daliya to 2 kg, and also give 1 kg of gur (jiggery). At todays rates (Rs 6/kg for bhusa, Rs 20/kg each for khali and daliya, and Rs 40/kg for gur), it costs Rs 100 daily to feed an unproductive animal and Rs 200-plus for 10 litres, he says.Singhs relationship with Qureshi is, again, purely transactional. It doesnt concern me what he does with our buffaloes. All I know is we farmers cannot afford to feed them, he says.***Mohammad Sabir Qureshi, 25, is one among the many livestock vyaparis who procure and aggregate buffaloes that farmers such as Sharma and Singh see as having served their utility, even if they can continue to live for 15 years and beyond. The vyapari is the vital cog in the buffalo meat value chain, connecting the small dairy farmer in UPs rural hinterlands to the processor-exporter supplying to consumers in Vietnam, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Egypt or Algeria.When business was good, Qureshi  his farmer clientele extends to 40-50 villages in Sadabad tehsil  could assemble up to eight animals within one-two days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But there was a one-month period  from around March 11 to April 10, after the Bharatiya Janata Party stormed into power in the UP Assembly elections  that saw no transactions at all. The new Yogi Adityanath administrations crackdown on illegal/unlicenced slaughterhouses and meat shops, coupled with heightened cow vigilante violence and police harassment on the ground, led to a virtual collapse of the livestock trade.Livestock trader: Mohammad Sabir Qureshi. He procures and aggregate buffaloes from farmers such as Sharma. When business was good, he could assemble up to eight animals within 1-2 days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But between March 11 to April 10, traders such as Qureshi bought no buffaloes. Now he just about manages a truckload once in 3-4 days as against 1-2 days earlier Mohammad Sabir Qureshi. He procures and aggregate buffaloes from farmers such as Sharma. When business was good, he could assemble up to eight animals within 1-2 days for transporting on a 14-foot Canter truck. But between March 11 to April 10, traders such as Qureshi bought no buffaloes. Now he just about manages a truckload once in 3-4 days as against 1-2 days earlierNo vyapari in our area purchased a single buffalo during that time. I used to get calls from many farmers to take their animals, but we were all too afraid to buy. Had we sat in our homes for a month or two more, the farmers themselves wouldve been on the streets, says Qureshi. Though the situation has improved a tad in recent weeks, I can just about manage to do a truckload once in three-four days now, as against one-two days earlier.Qureshi takes his animal truckloads mainly to Mohammad Kafil, who is a registered supplier for integrated abattoirs-cum-meat processing plants  such as the one at Talaspur Khurd, near Aligarh, owned by the Mumbai-based Allanasons Limited. Kafil is somebody on Allanasons records, technically authorised to supply to its plant on a commission basis and to whom payment is made through RTGS bank fund transfer. He, in turn, pays Qureshi independently in cash. Before this government came, I was supplying 100-150 buffaloes daily, which fell to zero through much of March and the first week of April. It has since recovered slightly to 60-70, but we still face lot of trouble from the police, Bajrang Dal and other gau rakshak (cattle protection) groups, says Kafil, who has 10-15 primary aggregators such as Qureshi working for him.***The meat exporters announce their purchase price for buffaloes, delivered at the plant, every 10-15 days. The rates are based not on the animals live weight, but carcass yield, usually about 45 per cent of the former. Thus, a buffalo whose live body weight is 400 kg would be assessed at a carcass yield of 180 kg. The carcass is basically the meat and bones left after the animal has been dressed (slaughtered) and stripped of its hide, head, horns, ears, feet, udders, fat, tissues and internal organs (heart, liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, stomach and intestines).The price the plants quote to their registered suppliers  who further communicate it to the vyaparis  is on a Rs per kg basis. If this is, say, Rs 150/kg, the delivered rate for a 400-kg buffalo with a carcass weight of 180 kg works out to Rs 27,000. The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the registered supplier (normally Rs 0.50/kg of carcass; Rs 90 in this case) and the vyapari (Rs 500), besides expenses incurred towards transport, local levies and kharcha paani (incidental payments, including to the police).Broker: Registered suppliers such as Mohammad Kafil bring the animals to the plant where they are taken to a lairage (in picture) and rested for 24 hours before being moved to the dressing line. Kafil gets a commission from the plant and pays the trader in cash.

Kafil gets a commission from the plant and pays the trader in cash. (Express photo/Oinam Anand)According to Qureshi, the haulage cost for eight buffaloes, inclusive of loading and unloading charges, over a 60-km distance from Sadabad to Aligarh is roughly Rs 4,500. In addition, one has to shell out Rs 400-500 per truck at every police station/outpost  there are four of them (Kachhpura, Chandpa, Sasni and Hanuman Chowki) between Sadabad and Aligarh. Adding other costs (toll tax, levies, local transport of animal from farm, maintenance at aggregation point, etc) takes the total deductions to Rs 1,700-1,800 per buffalo. The farmer, at the end of it, gets Rs 25,200-25,300 for his spent buffalo.Sourcing from farmers is the easiest part. For us, the real problem is in taking the buffaloes to the processing plant. Theres always the risk of police impounding our trucks or the animals being freed by gau rakshaks. All this ultimately increases our costs, points out Kafil.The most convenient tool to extract kharcha paani is via invoking provisions of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act or asking the vyapari to produce a fitness to travel certificate issued by a government veterinary doctor for the animals. Procuring such certificates isnt easy when there arent too many veterinarians around, and even more difficult for the small-time vyapari aggregating buffaloes from farmers in remote villages.***Allanasons Aligarh plant has a registered capacity for dressing and processing meat from 2,000 buffaloes a day. Like most others abattoirs in UP, it had to close down for a week after the Yogi government was sworn in on March 19, as buffalo arrivals ground to a halt. The plant is currently getting 1,000-odd buffaloes  below its past daily average of 1,500  even as the threat of disruptions to livestock movement remains. All five units in Unnao, for instance, have shut this week, following a district administration order under which no animal would be allowed entry into a plant without a valid fitness-to-travel certificate.Abattoirs-cum-meat processing plant: Buffalo meat being processed into various cuts at the Allanasons plant in Aligarh. Plants such as this one quote a price to suppliers, who further communicate it to the vyapari. If the price is, say, Rs 150/kg, the rate for a 400-kg buffalo with a carcass weight of 180 kg works out to Rs 27,000. The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the supplier and the trader.

The price that the farmer receives is determined after deducting commission fees to the supplier and the trader. (Express photo/Oinam Anand)UP has 41 of Indias 73 buffalo abattoirs/meat processing plants approved by the Agricultural & Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) under the Union Commerce Ministry. While some of them  Allanasons units at Aligarh and Unnao or the Abu Dhabi-based LuLu Groups at Barabanki and Rampur  have the capacity to handle over 1,000 animals per day, the majority do about 750. Getting enough animals to ensure minimum capacity utilisation, which wasnt an insurmountable problem during the previous regimes, is the single biggest challenge facing these units today.The Aligarh plant, which is spread over 40 acres and originally came up in 2010, has entailed an investment upwards of Rs 250 crore. It has all facilities, starting with a reception where the buffaloes brought in trucks are unloaded, tagged and subjected to an ante-mortem inspection by the units veterinary team to check for disease-free, non-milking and non-pregnant status. Once cleared, they are taken to a lairage and rested for 24 hours before being moved to the dressing line.Since slaughtering happens through halal  the Shariah-compliant method of slitting just the carotid artery, jugular vein, food pipe and windpipe in a single swipe  it ensures all the blood is drained out from the animal. This is collected and sent to a separate rendering facility for drying and conversion into a high-protein blood meal used as fish feed. Slaughter is followed by removal of hide, feet, fat, tissues and various organs and offals. Most of these are again sold independently  the hide to leather tanneries; fat (tallow) to soap and lubricant makers; and ear, hooves, liver, heart, lungs, food pipe, intestines, bladder, udders, and abomasum (the fourth stomach compartment) to the pet-food industry. There is a separate edible food market also for the other three bovine stomach chambers: omasum, reticulum and rumen. If this werent enough, the ingesta or undigested food in the stomach, too, is recovered and dried for use as plant boiler fuel.The dressed carcass that remains is weighed, washed and then chilled for 24 hours  primarily to arrest microorganism development  prior to deboning. The bones go to the rendering facility for processing into gel chips, sold to manufacturers of gelatine used in drug capsules and various food products. The deboned meat constitutes some 68 per cent of the carcass weight. Ergo, from a 400-kg buffalo with 180-kg carcass yield, 122.4 kg of boneless meat can be produced for export. The boneless buffalo meat is processed into various cuts  tenderloin, shin/shank, rump steak, blade, silverside, etc  and weighed, packed and frozen to minus 18 degrees Celsius, before being despatched by refrigerated trucks for final shipping in containers.***At an average Rs 200/kg export price, the 122.4 kg of boneless meat would fetch close to Rs 24,500. Another Rs 5,500-6,000  it could be more  can be realised through sale of hide, gel bones, offals and other by-products. That would make for gross revenues of around Rs 30,000, of which Rs 25,000-plus or 83 per cent goes to farmers. The farmers share would, of course, drop as the animals are brought in from longer distances, pushing up both transport costs and various incidental expenses.Our estimate is that the farmers payout would be at least 60 per cent of the industrys turnover. We probably give more than what even dairy plants give for milk, claims Fauzan Alavi, director at Allanasons Limited.Indias buffalo meat exports rose spectacularly, almost five-folds in quantity terms and over 22 times in value terms from 2002-03 to 2014-15, before tailing off somewhat in the last two years. The boom in exports (Rs 26,303 crore during the last fiscal) came even as the countrys buffalo population increased from 97.92 million in 2003 to 108.70 million in 2012, while also going up from 22.91 million to 30.63 million for UP during this period.We have not grown at dairys expense. On the contrary, our industry is complementary to the White Revolution. If the government is serious about doubling farmers income, they cannot afford to ignore livestock that includes both milk and meat, says Alavi.It remains to be seen whether that argument will wash with the Yogi government.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Collect two north facing branches of a Banyan tree (east facing will also suffice) that has grown in a stable, take precisely two grains of urad dal mustard seeds, grind all the ingredients with curd, and consume the mixture.This recipe is not some self-styled godman's prescription to fool gullible couples. It's part of the third-year Bachelor of Ayurveda , Medicine, and Surgery (BAMS) textbook that informs students on techniques to conceive a boy The text has been copied from Charaka Samhita, the pre-2nd Century CE compilation on Ayurveda, which is included in the current BAMS syllabus. According to the textbook, the process of creating a male foetus is called `pusanvan', and any woman who desires a boy should be ""blessed with the pusanvan ritual"" as soon as she gets pregnant.The textbook lists various techniques to ensure the birth of a boy. One such technique is rather expensive. It says: ""Create two miniature statues of a man out of gold, silver, or iron after throwing the statues in a furnace. Pour that molten element in milk, curd or water, and on an auspicious hour of Pushp Nakshatra, consume it.""The BAMS syllabus in the state is supervised by the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) in Nashik, and Dr Dilip Mhaisekar, former dean of the Dr Shankarrao Chavan Government Medical College in Nanded, is the vice-chancellor.Objection to the textbook's contents were recently raised by Ganesh Borhade, a member of the district supervisory board of the PreConception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques (PCPNDT) Act, who is also associated with the Lek Ladki Abhiyan supervised by advocate Varsha Deshpande.""Doctors with BAMS degrees have a thriving practice not just in rural areas, but also in cities such as Mumbai, Pune, and Nashik. Many people shun allopathy in favour of Ayurveda, and if this is what medical students are being taught, God help this society,"" Borhade said.He brought the textbook content to the notice of the PCPNDT Act authorities in the state, but it is unlikely that such content will be removed from the textbooks in the coming academic year.Dr Asaram Khade, the Maharashtra PCPNDT Act consultant, told Mumbai Mirror that a letter has already been issued to the joint secretary, public health, Government of India regarding the syllabus in violation of the PCPNDT Act, even as Borhade warned that the Centre had less than a month to act. ""The academic year starts in July, and such content supports,"" he said.Borhade pointed out a part of the content in the textbook, which he said had no scientific backing whatsoever. The portion of the content said, ""Cook rice flour with water, and while cooking, the woman should inhale the steam. Then add water to the cooked flour, and soak a ball of cotton in it. The woman should lie on the threshold so that her head touches the ground. Then, with that cotton ball, the liquid should be poured in her nostrils. It should not be spit out, instead it should be swallowed.""MUHS Vice-Chancellor Dr Mhaisekar said the BAMS curriculum was decided by the Ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH), and that he had written to the ministry regarding the objectionable content.""We are awaiting a reply from the ministry,"" Mhaisekar told Mumbai Mirror yesterday. ""The MUHS doesn't have the right to add or delete from the syllabus. There are seven members from Maharashtra in the Central Council of Ayurveda and all of them are aware of this content,"" he said."

You may not spot them in the market but these exotic veggies are available at agricultural scientist D Prabhakar Rao's sprawling farm . Even wasabi mustard and the nearly-extinct Bangladeshi long brinjal can be found here.Rao, a trustee of Sri Sri Institute of Agricultural Sciences and Technology, has a passion for collecting exotic desi seeds of vegetables from across the globe. He has preserved over 142 seeds from more than 25 countries.""These exotic species are not new. They are old varieties, which are native to India. We may have lost them over the years, but they are found in various other parts of the world. For example, I got the seeds of lemon-flavoured cucumber and cinnamon basil from east European countries like Bulgaria. A rare variety of tomatoes, which are big in size, is from Romania,"" he said. Blue tomatoes, Hanuman Ghada lauki (a desi variety of bottle guard that weighs 1.5kg per piece) and purple lady's finger are among the exotic varieties grown at Rao's farm near Kanakapura, over 35kms from BengaluruFarmers from many parts of the country have benefited from Rao's 20-year-long quest, as he has shared rare seeds with them. ""A farmer in Nelamangala sells red romaine tomatoes for Rs 300 per kg, and they're in demand,"" he said, adding that none of the varities is hybrid.Rao, who practises natural farming , believes a farmer should visit the market only to sell and not to buy. An advocate of natural farming, he has trained more than 5,000 ryots  adivasis in Chattisgarh, and farmers in Shiggavi and Belagavi  through his audits on drought-hit areas.According to him, organic farming is not the same as natural farming. ""I practice and train farmers on natural farming. ""In organic farming, cow dung from 20 cows is used annually for one acre of land. But in natural farming, the same amount is enough for 20 acres of land. In organic farming, farm yard manure is not very helpful for plants. But in natural farming, the Jeevamrutha mixture  consisting of fresh cow urine, cow dung, jaggery and gram flour  is more effective as the living microorganisms help improve soil quality,"" Rao explained, adding that organic farming is a European concept.Rao, who has a specialization in climate-resilient agriculture, will address the crowd at a two-day national summit on 'Innovative Approach to World Nutrition and Food Security ' at the Art of Living Intenational Center in Kanakapura on May 9 and 10.In Karnataka, sowing is done in June since rain is expected in July and August. ""But owing to climate change, we have been receiving copious rain only by September. So in North Karnataka, we have trained farmers to sow both tur dal and chickpea at the same time in the same farm so that they don't suffer crop loss even if one fails,"" Rao added."

Watermelons should inspire us. Have you ever wondered at the power of a watermelon seed? It has the potential of drawing from the earth and through itself 2 lakh times its own weight! Amazing are the colourful designs formed on the outside surface, something beyond the imitation of art. The white rind within and the red thick inlay studded with black seeds are admirable.Each melon seed must lose itself into the ground if it has to bear much fruit. The Faith process is similar. Faith is to lose or immerse ourselves completely in the hands of God allowing Him to shape us into something beautiful.The breaking process is painful but momentary as God opens up situations we thought impossible. It is from broken clouds we have rain, from broken wheat we get our bread. Unless we surrender ourselves like clay in a potter's hands or a piece of rock in a sculptor's hands we can never experience new shape to our lives. The best way to handle life is to put our life in the hands of God.Jesus exhorts us to have Faith to see the impossible ""I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, ""Move from here to there, and it would move. Nothing would be impossible."" (Mathew 17:20) ""Faith is to be sure of the things we hope for and to be certain of the things we cannot see"" (Hebrews 11:1).Life's journey is wrought with many challenging and painful situations. But God calls us to surrender ourselves in Him. Saint Augustine says ""If sorrow makes you shed tears, then faith in the promises of God makes us dry them.""When you find it hard to have Faith in God especially when there is darkness in our life, look at the chicks under the wings of the hen. There is darkness around them, but they know that they are safe under the shelter of their mother's wings. It was by Faith that Noah, Abraham, Sarah, saw inexhaustible possibilities in God (Hebrews 11). The scriptures emphasise ""For with God all things are possible."" (Mathew 19:26).Faith in God sees the invisible, believes the incredible and receives the impossible."

Several of these have also been released by the state government.For his research, Singh has been felicitated by two former Presidents of the country apart from V-Cs of a number of universities and government agencies.Singh's expertise in protecting and developing indigenous high-yielding varieties of seeds has benefited not only millions of farmers and agricultural experts in the country, but also those across the world. His high yield seeds require the least of pesticides and insecticides.Now, Singh has embarked on a new mission of conserving his 'sons' (the term he uses for seeds he has developed) through a gene bank.""Traditionally, farmers in the country do not have hybrid seeds so they keep a portion of their produce in earthern pots as seeds for the next season. These seeds are usually used for two-three years,"" he said, adding that ""I have been developing wheat, paddy and pulses' varieties for two decades without approaching any high-tech lab. As I treat these seeds as my 'sons', I have now started developing a gene bank.""For the purpose, he stores the best of these seeds in small earthen pots, painted pink (""to keep away moisture,"" said Singh), carefully cataloging their names and numbers. ""I don't want my effort to go in vain. I have waited for the government to provide me land for setting up of the 'bank' or give me funds for storing seeds,"" he said. With no help forthcoming, Singh has used part of his meagre income to construct a hall in his residence and plastered its floor so that the 'bank' remains protected, with limited sunlight and air.""The government extends invitation to international experts, spends lakhs on grants and here I am, ready to provide everything for free. But nothing has been done to conserve seeds that I have developed. It will be a personal loss and also to the nation if these seeds are not conserved and given to farmers to boost their produce,"" he added."

Back in May 1856, Wajid Ali Shah, the 10th Nawab of Oudh, came to what was then Calcutta with much disquiet in his heart. The British had confiscated his lands, his treasury , his comfort -indeed, they had even banished him from his beloved Luc know. So what was he left with? On the outskirts of Kolkata, in Metiabruz , the Nawab rebuilt a repli ca of his beloved capital, complete with grand Islamic structures, his beloved parikhana of damsels, a zoo of exotic animals, kite-flying, kabootarbaazi and yes, food from the royal kitchen.But the purse strings had been tightened. The table was set, but the grandiose banquets were un der quite a bit of financial strain.So the Nawab's enterprising chefs thought of an ingenious way to deal with the shortage of meat. They added potatoes and eggs to the royal repast -and thus was born the Kolkata biryani.We were hearing the history of this dish from Manzilat Fatima , the great-greatgranddaughter of the Nawab. ""The only difference between Awadhi biryani and the Kolkata biryani is that the latter has aloo. When Wajid Ali came to Kolkata, he did not have enough funds to feed his entourage in an elaborate way . But his culinary heritage was his biggest treasure and he was both khaane ke aur khilaane ke shaukeen. So, after a few years in Kolkata, the potato was introduced in the biryani. The tuber had been brought to India by the Portuguese and was considered a novelty, since it was imported. It was also quite expensive, though not as much as meat.Apart from bringing down costs, the potato also helped to maximise the volume of the dish,"" Manzilat told us.We met Manzilat on a warm summer afternoon at the Sibtainabad Imambara, in the heart of Metiabruz. The building houses the tomb of the Nawab and in that sense, is a great place to hear the story of the biryani's evolution. ""The taste of the biryani available in restaurants differs from what I cook at home. They use artificial colour, meetha attar and definitely there's no saffron. It is also a bit spicy. But the one that we make at home has to be mild and we use saffron to get that perfect colour. The biggest difference is that we use mustard oil, which was always very popular in Bengal , to cook the korma,"" said Manzie, as she is fondly called by her friends and family members. Manzilat should know what she's talking about. After all, the tradition of cooking the dish has been handed down to her by her mother, who, in turn, learnt it from her grandmother, Farrukh Ara Mehdi Begum, who was the wife of Meher Qudr. Meher was the only son of Birjis Qudr, Wajid Ali Shah's eldest son.Apart from sharing family history, Manzilat also con sented to cook the special Nawabi biryani that she makes at home for CT.""Every time I place a layer of biryani in the handi, I have a habit of saying Bismillah, which means in the name of Allah. As Muslims, we start any aus picious work by taking his name and I feel that's the secret behind my biryani coming out so well,"" said Manzilat, as she put the meat in mustard oil on low flame at her Mirza Ghalib Street residence.""To get rid of the pungency of mustard oil, I smoke or burn the oil completely till it turns a dusty-grey in colour,"" she added. The rice has to be soaked in water for some time, before it is cooked threefourths. Then, when the meat is medium soft, the potatoes fried golden brown and the rice half-cooked, it's time to put the biryani on dum. From homemade biryani garam masala to a mixture of saffron strands and milk to kewra water and ghee, everything is poured into the handi with utmost finesse.And then comes the crucial part -the dum. ""Biryani ko dum dena is the most difficult part. It requires the most con centration and during this time I don't let anyone talk to me since the slightest of mis takes can spoil the zaika of the dish,"" said Manzilat. She apparently calls this the jhat pat biryani as it doesn't take more than two hours to make. Also, having mas tered the art of making biryani over 35 years, Manzilat has everything on her fingertips.Once the lid is removed, her entire apartment filled with a heavenly aroma as Manzilat turned to us with a smile and said, ""It's ready."" She makes it a point to serve her biryani with a generous helping of boorani, a type of raita or ghol, that's made from mint leaves, green chillies, rock salt, roasted cumin and curd and also acts as a palate cleanser.Over the years, this member of the royal family has turned her love and passion for cooking into a part-time profession. She takes house party , birthday and small corporate event orders, for a headcount that doesn't exceed 25.Apart from the biryani, she also makes chicken or mutton rezala, dum ki machhli and different kebabs. ""I prefer doing everything on my own, since I don't want to compromise on quality . If the order is for more than 25 people, it's difficult to cook the food at home. At times, there's a mixed order for chicken and mutton biryanis. I then have to make both simultaneously so that they remain equally fresh,"" Manzilat said.She also does pop-up cookery shows in Kolkata and has even travelled to Lucknow for some.Though she wants to start a catering business, she's in two minds since this requires hiring and training people and sharing her secret recipe. ""Perfecting the art of making biryani didn't happen in a day , but took several years of trying and testing. Also, my children, Aman and Asna, have been my biggest critic. When they started having the biryani, they would find one fault or the other and that helped me improve my skills. Now that they've grown up, they tell me, Mamma you make the best biryani ever,"" smiled Manzilat. The Nawab's heritage is in safe hands."

The commercial release of GM Mustard has been objected by several civil society groups, farmers organization, including Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM), an arm of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS). Bt cotton, a non food crop, is the only transgenic crop cultivated in the country.The mustard hybrid, DMH-11 was developed by Delhi University former Vice Chancellor Deepak Pental led Centre for Genetic Manipulation and Crop Plants (CGMCP). The application was submitted to GEAC in 2015 and a sub-committee was constituted in February 2016 to look into safety issues concerning transgenic mustard. The committees report was put in public domain for suggestions.In 2010, a moratorium was put on commercial release of Bt Brinjal by the then environment minister Jairam Ramesh following several concerns raised by farmers, scientists and civil society groups.The committee met today and deliberated upon the report of the sub-subcommittee submitted again after incorporating suggestions. It was decided to recommend GM Mustard for commercial release, said Additional Secretary in the ministry Amita Prasad.Prasad said that some conditions have been put on the developer and now the final decision will come from environment minister.The sub-committee in its initial report had said that GM mustard is safe for consumption and environment and does not raise any public health concerns for human beings and animals.Interestingly, BJP in run upto the 2014 elections, had clarified that they would not allow GM crops without proper scientific investigation.Civil society groups have been opposing clearance to the GM Mustard on several grounds including serious concerns with male sterility and herbicide tolerance and inadequate testing.Sarson Satyagraha, a broad platform of hundreds of organisations representing farmers, consumers, scientists has condemned the green signal provided by GEAC to herbicide tolerant GM mustard today.""GEAC has proven yet again that it is unscientific and uncaring with regard to citizens' health and environment. They have failed in their very mandate and purpose for which they have been created, to protect citizens from risks of GMOs, said the coalition in a statement.Kavitha Kuruganti of the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA), a nationwide informal network of more than 400 organizations said that we have shown how this GM mustard dossier was rigged for favourable results, how it is an unneeded GMO, how it will increase chemicals in our food and farms because it is a herbicide tolerant GMO."

In doing so, he would follow a precedence set up by his predecessor, Jairam Ramesh.When Bt cotton, Indias first GM crop was approved in 2002, the decision taken by GEAC was the final. But when Bt brinjal came up for commercial release clearance in 2009, Ramesh stopped it, negating the GEAC clearance.The GM mustard has been developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants in Delhi University South Campus under the leadership of Deepak Pental, a former vice chancellor of theuniversity.If they clear it, it is good.

The environment ministry has to now take the call whether to accept the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) recommendation. GM mustard is a technology hailed by sections of crop scientists but criticised by anti-GM activists, farmers' groups, beekeepers and the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch, a Sangh affiliate. In 2010, then environment minister Jairam Ramesh had after multiple consultations with scientists, biotechnology specialists and activists blocked the commercial release of a version of GM brinjal that had been approved by the GEAC. Scientists at the University of Delhi South Campus, who had developed the GM mustard, had earlier said the plants promised 25 to 30 per cent higher yields than standard varieties and would help India reduce its edible oil import bill. ""The agenda of GM mustard came up in a meeting of the GEAC today. It has given a positive recommendation,"" an environment ministry official told PTI. The GEAC has put a number of conditions to the ministry while recommending its commercial use. A subcommittee of the GEAC had last year examined dossiers of data submitted by scientists and observed that the GM mustard was safe for human and animal consumption and did not raise any public health or safety concerns. The Swadeshi Jagaran Manch has said the government should not allow the cultivation of GM mustard as it would impact allied agricultural activities. A PTI report today quoted the Manch's co-convener, Ashwani Mahajan, as saying the organisation would ""request the government not to allow its commercial cultivation"". Several other organisations too said they were hoping the government would reject the GEAC recommendation. ""The GEAC has proven yet again that it is unscientific and uncaring with regard to citizens' health and environment,"" Sarson Satyagraha, a forum of farmers, consumers and anti-GM activists, said in a media statement. The Sarson Satyagraha has claimed that the GM mustard dossier submitted to the GEAC was ""rigged for favourable results"", and that the GM mustard will increase chemicals in farms and in food because it is a herbicide-tolerant variety. ""We hope and urge minister Anil Dave to be responsible in his decision-making - this GM mustard should be rejected just as GM brinjal was seven years ago. He should uphold the BJP's election manifesto promise that GM food will not be allowed into India without full scientific evaluation of their long-term effects on soil, production and biological impact on consumers."" However, a senior plant molecular biologist and former member of the GEAC said India needed to quickly adopt GM crops. ""Crop biotechnology is a powerful option to improve our food yields. Yields can also be improved through better crop management, but those are already in use and our food demand is growing,"" said Rakesh Tuli, a senior research adviser at the Panjab University, Chandigarh. Last year, sections of India's beekeepers had joined the campaign against the release of GM mustard, expressing concerns that the GM plant might adversely impact honey production. Charu Dutt Mayee, an agricultural scientist and president of the South Asia Biotechnology Council, had in September last year pointed out that GM mustard studies had not found any significant differences between bees for aging on GM and non-GM mustard crops. Farmers' representatives have in the past said India's edible oil import bill could be reduced by encouraging farmers to invest in mustard through appropriate procurement policies."

Those against planting of GM mustard (and Bt brinjal earlier) have sought to invoke the precautionary principle, by claiming these to be food crops.The countrys biotechnology regulator has approved the environmental release and cultivation by farmers of DMH-11, a genetically modified (GM) hybrid mustard developed by scientists at Delhi University. The green signal from the genetic engineering appraisal committee (GEAC) may not, however, amount to much. We know how the same GEACs go-ahead for the commercial release of Bt brinjal was overturned in February 2010 by the then Environment Minister  who assumed the role of regulator and ordered a moratorium on the transgenic vegetables cultivation. One can only hope that the current minister, Anil Madhav Dave, will not do a Jairam Ramesh, though the pressure may not be any less, with the opposition this time coming primarily from organisations affiliated to the Sangh Parivar.Those against planting of GM mustard (and Bt brinjal earlier) have sought to invoke the precautionary principle, by claiming these to be food crops. This is as opposed to Bt cotton, now being grown by Indian farmers on some 11 million hectares. But the food versus non-food argument does not wash, simply because lint fibre is only one-third of the kapaas or raw un-ginned cotton harvested by farmers. The balance two-thirds comprises the seed that is crushed to extract oil. Cotton-seed oil is, indeed, Indias second largest indigenously produced oil today after mustard. The de-oiled cake or meal remaining after oil extraction is, likewise, fed to milch animals. Both the oil and meal are, thus, being consumed as food either directly or through milk and meat since 2002, when our farmers started cultivating GM cotton. Just as nothing calamitous has happened to us from ingesting Bt proteins all these years, theres no evidence of the Barnase, Barstar and Bar proteins used in GM mustard being toxic to human or animal health.The so-called swadeshi opposition to GM mustard is all the more intriguing considering this is a product, unlike Monsantos Bt cotton, which has been indigenously developed and in the public sector. Moreover, India imports 15 million tonnes (mt) of edible oils worth almost $11 billion annually. The 15 mt includes 4 mt of soyabean (entirely GM) and 0.4 mt of rape/canola oil (mostly GM).If so much of GM oil can be imported, why should similar technology not be permitted for oil made in India? Surely, there cannot be one standard for videshi and another for swadeshi farmers.

Beans, broccoli, blueberries, salmon, spinach, tomatoes, kale, walnuts and yogurt are some of the chief ingredients that make up most of the dishes.The diner has definietly stepped up the game in terms of healthy food and has gone beyond the regular salad to please the fitness concious and the foodies alike. The menu features appetizers, entrees, sides and desserts. We started off with the Fruits and Nuts Super Salad. The salad offers the crispness of te romaine lettuce, spinach, red cabbage and broccoli along with the crunch and sweetness of the walnuts, apples, dried apricots, cranberries and blueberries. While, I have always been skeptical of salads, this one definitely made me rethink.I would any day prefer binging on this good looking salad that tastes beautiful with the crisp and crunch of green and nuts, seasoned with a pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette.Try the Pomegranate Honey Mustard Salmon. The lemon and olive oil basted grilled salmon filet is grilled just right with a crisp top and a very well cooked meat inside. The fish is topped with pomegranate honey mustard vinaigrette. The dish is mildly sweet, served with couscous and ginner kale along with with toasted almond, cranberry and blueberry.This one will win your heart with the saltiness of the fish and the sweetness of the dressing. The Cherry Chipotle BBQ Chicken too is cooked very well. The grilled chicked breast is flavoured with lemon and olive oil and is topped with tangy cherry chipotle BBQ sauce. It is served with an apple five-grain pilaf and fresh broccoli slaw.If you are a vegetarian, dealing with an itchy throat or just having a bad day in general, ask for the Vegetarian Tex Mex Chili, like I did. The dish just fills you up with warmness and the tanginess of the sun-ripened tomatoes along with the substance of the beans.Like the name suggests, this is truly a Tex Mex wholesome meal made with chipotle peppers, red onions topped with yogurt, fresh pico de galloand jalapeno. The dish is served hot and spicy on a brown rice pilaf. We ended our meal with the Fruit Crumble dessert. Do I love sweet and sour blended in with loads of crunchy crumble? Hell yeah! The dessert is heavy on the sour side, but I have always enjoyed citrus flavours, so I had a gala time devouring this delicious baby.While scaling high on the flavours, the dessert will also appeal to those watching their calories. The crumble is packed with strawberries, blackberries, blueberries and juicy peaches and served hot with a topping of vanilla frozen yogurt scoop.I would highly recommend foodies and the health concious to go check out this new menu.Cost for two: `2,500 (approx)"

Those against planting of GM mustard (and Bt brinjal earlier) have sought to invoke the precautionary principle, by claiming these to be food crops.The countrys biotechnology regulator has approved the environmental release and cultivation by farmers of DMH-11, a genetically modified (GM) hybrid mustard developed by scientists at Delhi University. The green signal from the genetic engineering appraisal committee (GEAC) may not, however, amount to much. We know how the same GEACs go-ahead for the commercial release of Bt brinjal was overturned in February 2010 by the then Environment Minister  who assumed the role of regulator and ordered a moratorium on the transgenic vegetables cultivation. One can only hope that the current minister, Anil Madhav Dave, will not do a Jairam Ramesh, though the pressure may not be any less, with the opposition this time coming primarily from organisations affiliated to the Sangh Parivar.Those against planting of GM mustard (and Bt brinjal earlier) have sought to invoke the precautionary principle, by claiming these to be food crops. This is as opposed to Bt cotton, now being grown by Indian farmers on some 11 million hectares. But the food versus non-food argument does not wash, simply because lint fibre is only one-third of the kapaas or raw un-ginned cotton harvested by farmers. The balance two-thirds comprises the seed that is crushed to extract oil. Cotton-seed oil is, indeed, Indias second largest indigenously produced oil today after mustard. The de-oiled cake or meal remaining after oil extraction is, likewise, fed to milch animals. Both the oil and meal are, thus, being consumed as food either directly or through milk and meat since 2002, when our farmers started cultivating GM cotton. Just as nothing calamitous has happened to us from ingesting Bt proteins all these years, theres no evidence of the Barnase, Barstar and Bar proteins used in GM mustard being toxic to human or animal health.The so-called swadeshi opposition to GM mustard is all the more intriguing considering this is a product, unlike Monsantos Bt cotton, which has been indigenously developed and in the public sector. Moreover, India imports 15 million tonnes (mt) of edible oils worth almost $11 billion annually. The 15 mt includes 4 mt of soyabean (entirely GM) and 0.4 mt of rape/canola oil (mostly GM).If so much of GM oil can be imported, why should similar technology not be permitted for oil made in India? Surely, there cannot be one standard for videshi and another for swadeshi farmers. The scientists behind DMH-11 and the underlying Barnase-Barstar system technology claim it has the potential to increase mustard yields by roughly 30 per cent, besides helping introduce other traits such as resistance to alternaria blight and stem rot that is now limited through conventional breeding.

5922e5277be9e01fc7f5b4d3,GM mustard sowing may kickstart this Rabi season,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gm-mustard-sowing-may-kickstart-this-rabi-season/articleshow/58652837.cms,2017-05-13,"NEW DELHI: With the central biotech regulator green flagging commercial cultivation of GM mustard, the government is likely to take a call on the transgenic food crop ahead of the Rabi sowing season, beginning October.Though the ministry's approval is also contingent on current proceedings in the Supreme Court, the Centre could be looking at limited introduction of GM mustard in the 2017-18 Rabi season.The environment ministry on Friday came out with a detailed explanatory note allaying safety concerns on consumption of the transgenic variety of oil-seed in the form of 'Frequently Asked Questions' (FAQs) seeking to assure public opinion that the food crop is as safe for consumption as conventionally grown mustard varieties in India.The note also point-by-point answered a number of questions which are being raised by civil society members and anti-GM groups on its impact on quality of nectar, honey bees, animal feed, use of additional irrigation and fertilisers or whether it will cause any diseases. The ministry has said it will not cause ailments like dropsy.The ministry, however, remains careful while responding whether all GM foods are safe. It avoids making general statements and says different GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways.""This means that individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case-by-case basis and that it is not possible to make general statements on the safety of all GM foods"", said the eight-page note.Though the ministry later removed the link of the note from its official website in the light of some spelling mistakes, officials said the idea of making it public was to make people aware of science behind transgenic crops and moreover the safety issue of the GM mustard which would be the first genetically engineered food crop in India.""We have already made public the safety assessment report of the sub-committee of the central regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), which had last year concluded that the consumption and cultivation of the GM mustard was completely safe for human consumption and environment.We want to inform people about it in a simple way so that the anti-GM propaganda, based on unscientific reports, should not mislead them"", said an official.Responding to these questions, the note says, ""This genetically engineered (GE) mustard is as safe as non-GE mustard. It won't cause Dropsy or any other diseases.The introduced proteins are independent of the nectar production traits and therefore are not expected to influence nectar quality and quantity.""""The honey bee studies have revealed that this GE mustard does not affect the number of honey bees visiting GE mustard plants as compared to non-GE mustard plants"".It also noted that the transgenic variety of mustard has ""no additional requirement of irrigation and fertiliser for growth and cultivation as compared to any other conventional mustard""."
593ae9f87be9e00e1ecd454e,Memory against forgetting,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170513/jsp/opinion/story_151239.jsp,2017-05-13,"Few could have said it with the dark wit of Milan Kundera in The Book of Laughter and Forgetting. When Czech Communist Party leader Vladimir Clementis was disgraced and executed, he was ""airbrushed"" out of an earlier photograph that showed him standing next to Klement Gottwald, the future President. What stood in his place ever afterwards was a blank wall: erased past vacuuming the future. After all, a tabula rasa in the future is more easily appropriated by rulers to engrave their agendas upon. Because, ""the struggle of man against power is the struggle of memory against forgetting."" This reference came to mind at Ganges Gallery's recent show, Things Lost, Remembering the Future. In presenting 14 participants from eight South Asian countries - where the manipulation of minds through rearranged histories seems rampant - it treads that besieged area where artists wish to hold on to, what curators Kurchi Dasgupta and Amritah Sen describe as, ""the small, the forgotten... as opposed to the official and the monumental."" Frighteningly enough, though, such loss may not always be intentional. In the Record Room series of David Alesworth (Pakistan/ UK) the past becomes a precarious, chancy reconstruct, depending on what may be excavated from the mountainous chaos of yellowing, brittle files in careless official archives (picture, bottom). Leaving out of reckoning the vast field of unrecorded voices, of course. But loss, the erosion of the past, is the steady refrain in the subcontinent where society was once thought to be changeless. Huma Mulji (Pakistan) perceptively sums up the onslaught of change in a simple picture: of baker Karamatulla, who sold the bread he baked daily in his run-down little home in an area which has suddenly turned into prime land. His small family enterprise now stares at extinction in a competitive market as inevitably as does his little home before the juggernaut of property development. Bangladesh's Tayeba Begum Lipi retreats to a memory that's too private to be decoded. But Mustafa Zaman (also Bangladesh) teases intriguing murmurs out of negatives of passport photographs laid over hazy images beneath in his series, Witnessing the Witnesses: the viewer witnessing the stunned, spooky witnesses to unspoken events. The layering conjures a fragile twilight zone of garbled memory evaporating before it can be quite defined. Aye Ko (Myanmar) brings to his digital photograph a concentrated, theatrical gesture of individual resistance. But the fissures within Myanmar aren't political alone. As Thyitar, a Muslim artist made conscious of her difference from the others by those others, reminds you. But a single frame can hardly compensate for the performance you don't get to see. What Pala Pothupitiye (Sri Lanka) reminds you of is how identity is yoked to the accustomed earth: homeland and its maps. In this case, of two districts of the island state. Green and mustard patches, embellished with stylized waves, the tiger (of the Tamils?) and the decorative lion of their national flag, make for an engaging work but it mutes the conflicts his note mentions. His compatriot, Thisath Thoradeniya, displays an aerial map of Bangalore, with iron tools arranged on it. A striking juxtaposition that stokes multiple suggestions. Maimoona Hussain (Maldives) speaks at a more intimate level, evoking the poignant vulnerability of The Female Child, while Sen (India) brings a universal resonance to the experience of disintegration, of ""living in bits and pieces"", as the integrated ideal symbolized by the Vitruvian Man falls apart. That sense of disintegration persists in Dasgupta, who lives in Nepal. She cunningly wrests from adversity a metaphor for the crisis that followed India's blockade of the land-locked country in 2015 by stitching together bits of canvas when she ran out of art material. And Sunil Sigdel (Nepal) translates a performance into a single, arresting visual which comments on the irony of subcontinental labourers dying - one every two days, says his statement - while building, in blue overalls, the infrastructure in Qatar where the world will compete for the gold in football in 2022. Hence the title, Blue Slavery in Golden Construction (picture, top). The video of Nepal's Ashmina Ranjit, who walks backwards to retrace her life's journey from Kathmandu valley to the capital city, seems rather futile. But Rahaw Omarzad's (Afghanistan) footage, beginning with a ground-level view of walking feet, suddenly throws a knockout revelation: the ragtag recruits have prosthetic legs, living signposts of the serial devastation that began in 1979. Another sequence in which books tumble, pages flying, inscribes a Fahrenheit 451 concern into this Afghanistan epic of things lost. Only, it's a veritable loot; of history and heritage, leaving the future bereft, rootless, without memory."

The final nod will come from environment minister. Bt cotton is the only crop allowed in the country.The mustard hybrid, DMH-11 was developed by Delhi University former Vice Chancellor Deepak Pental led Centre for Genetic Manipulation and Crop Plants (CGMCP).I would like to emphasise that GMO contamination is neither remediable nor reversible and is the outstanding concern. The genes in HT hybrid DMH 11 are toxic genes: being an herbicide tolerant crop also means that DMH 11 is a pesticidal crop. Its nationality doesnt change the science, said Bhushan.Explaining the harm GM crop will do, Bhushan said the issue also is that with GMO contamination, our mustard will be changed at the molecular level.Any toxicity that there is will remain in perpetuity. Are we prepared to be the agents for such monumental risk and put India and its people in jeopardy without any recourse and remedy? he questioned, urging the minister to reject it in the public interest.The Supreme Court lawyer also cited an apex court order whereby Chief Justice, based on the assurance given by the Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi that the Union of India will not release DMH 11 without the prior approval of the Supreme Court, accordingly, gave a verbal order of an interim injunction till the case is heard comprehensively and the issue of HT mustard in substance."

The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the environment ministrys top technical body to examine safety of GM crops, recommended this week commercialisation of mustard. The final call is with the government. Given NDAs promise of doubling farmers income as well as Indias dependence on import of edible oil, it must go with the recommendation.GM mustard, developed by a Delhi University team, has been through extensive safety trials. Last year, the entire dossier of safety studies submitted by the Delhi University team was placed in public domain for review. Given the sensitivity of the issue, the 26-member GEAC has gone the extra mile. It made sense as Bt Brinjal which was cleared by GEAC in 2010 was held back by the previous government, following a sustained campaign against it by groups opposed to the introduction of GM food.The governments immediate challenge will be to deal with an ongoing Supreme Court hearing on the veracity of safety tests for mustard. Last year, government had told the apex court it would wait for courts approval. Mustard is a winter crop which gives the government a window to prepare the ground for its introduction. The key to the introduction of GM mustard is NDAs willingness to withstand pressure from multiple lobby groups, including Sangh Parivar elements. Beyond following safety protocols and being transparent there is nothing more that can be done on the regulatory side. It is important to keep in mind that Indian agriculture is in dire need of an increase in yields and should therefore be open to introducing new technologies. Thats why the government mustnt succumb to ideological lobbying."

Some came from Delhi, some from far-off states. This was a growing tribe of professionals, moving to this Delhi suburb that was fast becoming a corporate hub and a melting pot of identities and culture. It would take a while before a new identity would get forged, a Gurugrammer identity that we see today. But what was it like in those early days? And who were the first Gurugrammers? In the third part of our new weekly series, TOI turns the spotlight on the early settlers Dinesh Khanna and Rachana Yadav fled the steep rents of Delhi for a relatively comfortable life, in a then-nondescript town set amid mustard fields and jungle. Back then, there was no cable TV, but weekend parties, and booze in the time of prohibition, kept boredom at bay. Sohna Road was empty and beautiful, and the Gurgaon-Faridabad road was an adventure. Khanna and Yadav, who quit advertising to embrace their passions (photography and dance), came to Gurgaon in 1996, and found a place they could call home in 2005 (in DLF Phase-III). But both yearn for the peace and quiet - and verdant vistas as far as the eye could see - of those early days.Dinesh: It was our own place, the house was the way we wanted it to be. All around, it was open and it was clean. We moved because we couldn't afford to buy our own place in Delhi.We came to a suburb of Delhi, which was close enough that I could commute to my studio, in Panchsheel, every day. When we came, there were mustard fields around us. It was beautiful and it was charming. On Golf Course Road, where DLF Phase-I ended, it was all fields.Rachana: It was quiet and green. And unpolluted. There was hardly any traffic. Also, there were very few people, but there were enough people of our kind. And over a period of time, our friends moved here.Dinesh: And we made friends here.Rachana: From our circle of friends, and from our family, we were the first to move here. But we had a good social life. Our friends would come over, or we'd go to Delhi. For our friends who came on weekends, it was like a trip out of town. They would arrive crammed in cars and stay overnight. Then slowly, these visits reduced, because they felt we were too far away!A lonely (but exciting) lifeGetting daily provisions was a challenge - there were no markets, no malls. In our block, there were maybe one or two shops. There was just a Crossroads supermarket near Bristol Hotel. So we'd buy our vegetables and groceries in Sarojini Nagar and Hauz Khas, and meat from Hauz Khas.Dinesh: Also, there was prohibition for two to three years, a little after we came. We would hear rumours of raids, so we had to be careful bringing and storing stuff! I remember once, on my birthday, we had invited 25-30 people to the house. Outside it was raining, but we were all having a good time. Some of us were dancing. Then the doorbell rang. It was 1am, and we thought it was the cops, and panicked. We quickly hid all the booze, only to find the visitor was a late entrant to the party!Limited entertainmentDinesh: Coming here, our cultural life took a huge dip. It only came back when Rachana got into dance. Even now, when it comes to culture, Gurgaon is a desert  it's fine for eating and drinking out, and watching movies, but not for culture. There are no art galleries, no libraries, no theatres. Only 'Kingdom of Dreams'.And DLF Phase-III, over time, got left behind. It's a bungalow colony with no market and no social club - the club that we have here is an apology of a club.A love affair turned sourRachana: The sense we got of a country life is no longer there - I'm ready to move to Delhi, I'm not attached to Gurgaon one bit.Dinesh The roads have remained the same, but the quantum of traffic has grown 50 times. Only in Old Gurgaon have things stayed much as they were, like in sectors 14 and 15.When there was nothing here, there was still charm. But that's all gone now."
593ae8dd7be9e00e1ecd434a,'Anti-national' tag on GM nod,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170514/jsp/nation/story_151536.jsp,2017-05-14,"Prashant Bhushan New Delhi, May 13: Supreme Court advocate Prashant Bhushan today urged environment minister Anil Dave to reject a regulatory panel's recommendation to release genetically modified mustard for commercial cultivation, questioning the regulatory process and claims about the plant's superiority. In a letter to Dave, Bhushan cited a Supreme Court hearing on GM crops and described India's regulatory mechanisms for such crops as ""farcical"". He asked Dave to ""withhold"" his approval to the GM mustard, DMH11, developed by Delhi University scientists. Bhushan added that claims that DMH11 would help increase mustard yields by 25 to 30 per cent were ""not true"". He argued that India's best-performing non-GM hybrids and other varieties were already ""significantly outperforming"" DMH 11. The environment ministry's Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) had earlier this week recommended to the ministry that GM mustard be approved for commercial release. A GEAC subcommittee had last year looked at dossiers of data furnished by scientists and observed that the GM mustard was safe for human and animal consumption and did not raise public health or safety concerns. Plant molecular biologist Deepak Pental, who led the scientific team that developed the GM mustard, has said the technology was independently assessed through field trials by agricultural scientists and the data sent to the GEAC after extensive studies. ""We have developed a generic technology that will allow us to make hybrids in large quantities using any two parents,"" Pental said today. ""This technology may be used to increase yields. This is important for mustard because mustard yields have been stagnating."" But those campaigning against GM mustard and seeking better regulatory oversight mechanisms say the GM mustard is irrelevant to the country. ""This mustard does not out-yield India's best varieties: this has been admitted by the Union government in court,"" said Aruna Rodrigues, who had filed her petition opposing the introduction of GM crops in 2005. ""None of the three transgenes in the GM mustard carries a trait for yield. This mustard is entirely irrelevant to India, and its approval is dangerous and anti-national."" The environment ministry had on Friday uploaded a document on its website saying the country's regulatory agencies had ""thoroughly assessed"" the GM mustard for toxicity and determined that it did not pose any threat to humans or animals. The document was missing from the website today. A ministry spokesperson could not say who had uploaded or pulled down the document or why this was done. Bhushan's letter highlights how the government had last year assured the Supreme Court, which is hearing a petition against the introduction of GM crops in the country, that it would not release DMH11 without the court's approval. It says the regulatory mechanisms for GM crops in India are embedded in ""serious conflicts of interest and lack of expertise where regulation has become farcical"". It adds that the ""self-assessed safety dossiers"" from crop developers have been ""kept secret by our regulators and governing ministries"". The GM mustard dossier remains unpublished. GM mustard's proponents have cited how the environment ministry published a summary of the scientific studies and made the entire sets of dossiers available for public scrutiny for a month last year."
59284ec37be9e0137c77cb79,Adopt GM mustard to boost farm yield,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/611751/adopt-gm-mustard-boost-farm.html,2017-05-15,"Adopt GM mustard to boost farm yieldDH News Service, May 15 2017, 23:46 ISTThe government now has to take a decision on commercialisation of genetically modified (GM) mustard, after the recent recommendation made by Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC). The GEAC is the governments technical body which examines the safety of GM crops. The government is not bound to accept its recommendation but there are strong reasons why it should not reject it too. The UPA government had in 2010 refused to accept the GEAC recommendation for commercialisation of Bt brinjal and put a moratorium on it. The main reason was that Bt brinjal was a food crop, and unlike Bt cotton which has been cultivated successfully in the country for many years, it may have implications on the health of the people. But this and many other questions about GM crops have been adequately answered. The UPA government, perhaps, erred on the side of caution but it may be time to review the decision.India imports large quantities of edible oils. A good part of it is made from GM crops like transgenic soyabean. Cottonseed oil made from Bt cotton is also widely consumed in the country. The opposition, therefore, to oil made from GM mustard is difficult to understand. GM mustard has been indigenously developed by scientists at the Delhi University, so there is no scope for the apprehension that farmers will be at the mercy of multinationals like Monsanto which will control the supply of seeds or otherwise exploit the farmers. There is the need to increase Indias edible oil production as the country is largely dependent on imports to meet the rising demand. GM mustard has been proven to increase yields by 30% and will reduce farming costs. It has been declared ready for commercial use after years of extensive tests in labs and on farms. All the safety-related data has also been placed in the public realm for scrutiny.The government will have to await the decision of the Supreme Court which is hearing a case on the matter. It is likely to come under pressure from several interest groups which are opposed to GM crops for different reasons. These include the likes of the Swadeshi Jagaran Manch which are ideologically close to the BJP. To give more credibility to decisions relating to safety and other issues concerning GM crops and their technology, the government can set up an independent regulatory body in place of or in addition to the GEAC. However, this should not be a ruse to delay decisions. The country needs to increase its agricultural production and GM crops can enable this. It is unwise to reject them without convincing grounds."

Broadly, the then governments exceptionalism on Bt brinjal was framed along these lines: it was an edible substance unlike Bt cotton; long-term studies may be required to check its safety and environmental impact; it involved technology developed by the multinational Monsanto (which had an indirect stake in Mahyco). On the other hand, GM mustard (DMH-11) was developed by a team of scientists at Delhi University led by former vice-chancellor Deepak Pental under a government-funded project.In essence, it uses three genes from soil bacterium that makes self-pollinating plants such as mustard amenable to hybridisation. This means local crop developers have the equivalent of a platform technology to more easily develop versions of mustard with custom traits such as higher oil content and pest resistance. It has also gone through safety and toxicity tests (on mice) prescribed by the regulator, but this is unlikely to convince opponents of GM technology. Many of them are opposed to the commercial release of any form of transgenic plants; they fear that introducing genes from soil bacterium or other forms of animal life into plants will amount to playing with the natural order of plant life. Proponents of GM crops say plants and animals are constantly swapping bacterial genes with air, soil and water, and also that the only way of determining if a gene can produce proteins toxic to humans is to subject it to a systematic testing process. Years of field tests on transgenic corn, soyabean and brinjal in other countries have shown no health risks that vary with their non-GM versions. The concern that DMH-11 employs a gene that will compel farmers to use specific herbicides and be dependent on one or two companies deserves serious attention. However, these are matters for the government, regulators, labour markets and the courts to decide. Farmers need technology, new knowledge and governmental support to get the best out of their seeds. Successive governments have failed to move on the draft National Biotechnology Regulatory Bill, 2008 that would enable a biotechnology regulator to take shape. Sans such legislation, issues to be decided on the basis of science will be at the mercy of political expediency."

Now, the Union Ministry for Environment has to take the final decision.The GEACs recommendation is shocking. It has failed to act as per its mandate: to protect citizens from the risks posed by genetically modified organisms (GMOs). We will move court if approval is given by the Ministry, Umendra Dutt, member of the Coalition for a GM-Free India, told The Hindu .Women will be hit hardMr. Dutt said GM mustard is a herbicide-tolerant crop. Such crops would increase the use of chemicals and of which cultivation would affect a large number of farmers, farmworkers and consumers.Furthermore, allowing the cultivation of GM mustard would amount to a direct attack on women involved in the mustard crop weeding. Our conservative estimates show that even 25% adoption of GM mustard in India would lead to the loss of over 4 crore employment days, he said. GM mustard cultivation would not require weeding.In its election manifesto, the BJP promised that it would not allow GM food crops without a long-term scientific evaluation. Hence, the Ministry of Environment should reject the GEACs recommendation, said Mr. Dutt, adding that the episodes of herbicide drifts destroying crops in neighboring fields and leading to farmer-to-farmer litigations in U.S. courts is well documented. One can imagine the disaster that lies in store in India with its small landholdings, on this front, he said.Food and agricultural policy analyst Devinder Sharma called a scientific sham the assertion that the GM mustard variety DMH-11  for which the Ministrys approval is pending  will boost production and help India cut edible oil import costs. The country suffered from no mustard shortage, he said, and if the government wanted to cut edible oil import costs, it should increase import tariffs.Lets have a public dialogue on GM mustard before the final decision as was done for Bt cotton."

593563097be9e061b17376cf,Why do we suffer acidity — heartburn and acid reflux,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/back2basics/why-do-we-suffer-acidity-heartburn-and-acid-reflux/,2017-05-16,"Many of us have suffered through symptoms of acidity and heartburn after a wedding celebration dinner or a late night party. We blame it on the spicy food, the fried stuff and the late night shenanigans. But we never seem to go down to the basics of understanding why till it becomes a frequently repetitive situation or gets so chronic that family members may have to rush you to the hospital suspecting a heart attack.Acidity occurs when the basic PH balance of our stomach remains acidic over larger periods of time, upsetting the tender linings of our stomach. In certain cases a stomach abnormality called hiatal hernia can cause acid reflux. This happens when the stomach acid is thrown back into the esophagus because of the partial closing or failing of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If one is overweight then the diaphragm which is the muscle that separates your stomach from your chest is pushed upwards causing the LES to be stressed open.As we grow older, if one leads a sedentary lifestyle its not just your outer muscles but even the internal organs that slowly lose their tenacity and the LES can become weak as with the other sphincters and valves throughout your body.The stomach naturally produces HCl (Hydrochloric acid) to help with the digestion of food and has a higher acidic level than rest of the body (between to 2 to 5.5 as compared with 7.45 of rest of the body). The stomach also produces mucus at the same time which acts as a lining to protect its inner walls against the action of HCl.The HCl is required to kill bacteria that enters the body through food, and also to activate enzyme pepsin that helps in the breakdown of proteins in the stomach and the enzyme, Intrinsic factor that absorbs B12. Pepsin can only work in an acidic environment. If the food sits in the stomach for a longer period of time then the chances of increased acid levels can cause gases to be formed which in turn can result in bloating, burping, nausea, and heartburn due to acid reflux. Eating too much food can pressurize the stomach. Eating too high alkaline foods can cause more stomach acid to be produced to enable digestion, so balancing your meals are very important.Carbohydrates move quickly through the stomach, while proteins take longer and fats can sit in your stomach for almost 6 hours.While choosing your meals we should make sure we combine our food in such a way where we can get the maximum absorption of proteins while the carbs and fiber bind them while maintaining a good insulin balance. Fats should be preferably the unsaturated ones that go smoothly through the stomach till they are emulsified with bile in the small intestine to aid in absorption of the fat soluble vitamins, A,D,E and K.High alkaline foods are : Cabbage, broccoli, cucumber, avocado, spinach, kale, beets, celery, onion, tomato, garlic, carrot, almonds, coconut, pomegranate, olives, chickpeas, sprouted moong, soy.High acidic foods are : Meat (red meat as well as chicken, duck, turkey), eggs, Dairy (cheese, milk), oils, butter, cashews, peanuts, white rice, honey, jams, vinegar, mustard, cocoa, tea, coffee, alcohol, sweets, chocolate, fruit juices, and any food with preservatives.The rest of the foods fall into the medium category which we can incorporate into our everyday diets, in moderation ofcourse. However, it is very essential that when we have too much of either one of the high acidic or high alkaline foods we balance it with the other.Acidity should not be counteracted with anti acidity medicines over a prolonged time as they can inhibit your bodys absorption of essential nutrients. Make it a point therefore to eat well balanced, proportionate meals. Smaller meals that do not stay in the stomach too long, keep hydrating yourself in between the meals to make sure the stomach acids do not hurt the sensitive mucus linings of your inner walls.Eat before you are hungry and stop before you are full."

My friends coaxing and my having finally relented, was one of the best decisions of my lifeThe early days were raw and hard. In a Maruti Gypsy (the only few seen now are the Gurgaon Police driving on their beat). it took 22 minutes from Hauz Khas to drive down to the border, and then no time to get to my condominium.Arriving late at night, we drove past a sea of mustard fields in the winter, their bright yellow flowers swaying to cold winds from Rajasthan. In the morning, which still remains the best part of the day, there would sometimes be camels and elephants on the narrow dusty road seemingly going everywhere. The road was soon aptly named the Mehrauli-Gurgaon Road.Things have changed in Gurgaon. From a sleepy little farming village to an expanding metropolis, it strives to carve a slice of the pie in a new, emerging India.Traffic is getting out of control; road non-sense and road rage are on the rise.

Stress to be the first to flash the newest smartphone.In the middle of all this, the buzz of Gurgaon is buzzing the world.Many years after I first got here, Gurgaon is the most sought-after place to be, to live in, to dream in.Despite many twists, turns and stumbles the VTM (Village Turned Mod) houses CEOs of Fortune 500 companies, all living in their state-of-the-art condos. The Gurgaon experiment is now the Gurgaon achievement.As for me, the vibe of Gurgaon gets me going. The cross -section of folks arriving from everywhere, some by choice, some by compulsion, all mingling and making new friends in new ways.There are theatrical groups where professionals quote Shakespeare at each other, places to chill, the best places to eat. There are parts of the new city that never sleep.Its true that the garbage can be obnoxiously rude to the nasal and visual senses, that potholed roads beyond the major arterials can be a nightmare to drive on.Yet, despite these irritants, communities work together, in tandem, to clean their act, to harvest rainwater, to make the city safer, to be proud Gurgaonans . Or should we say Gurgaonites?There is activity: the bio-diversity park where a million saplings have been planted, and the amphitheatre which hosts the best of Indias culture. There is nature: Gurgaon is where a million sparrows thrive, where parrots make a racket, where robin red breasts and nightingales shelter among lush, green trees .On board the Metro, watching the ever-changing face of Gurgaon, one can see how much more the city planners wish to achieve. I often think of how far we have come, and how much farther we are set to go.This is my Gurgaon, my Sugar Ville, embedded in todays challenging and changing world.(Capt Vivek C.

He was reportedly unwell since January this year and was also not attending office.The minister is unwell and has not been coming to office on regular basis. We brief him at his residence, a senior environment ministry official had told HT on Wednesday, a day before his death.Dave was rushed to the cardiology department around 9am after he complained of uneasiness, shortness of breath and chest pain.He was brought straight to the cardio- thorasic tower two at the hospital and admitted into the cardiac care unit (ccu), which is the Intensive Care Unit for cardiac emergencies, said a source in the hospital, requesting anonymity as the person is not authorised to speak to media.Doctors tried hard to revive him, but his condition kept on deteriorating, said the source.Dave was under the care of Dr Gautam Sharma, professor in the department of cardiology at the hospital.His body is being taken from the AIIMS Mortuary to the department of anatomy for embalming. It will be flown to his hometown Indore later for the last rites.AIIMS released an official statement that said Dave was brought to AIIMS in a state of cardiac arrest. All possible measures were taken immediately at AIIMS, but he could not survive and declared dead around 9.45 am.His death was condoled by senior politicians, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi who said he was in a meeting with Dave on Wednesday evening and described the demise as a personal loss.Anil Madhav Dave ji will be remembered as a devoted public servant.

But, then he started working on environment related issues on Narmada in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat and was nominated to the Rajya Sabha in 2009.Those close to him said Modi was impressed with his organisation of a seminar on Hinduism and rivers at an event during 2015 Ujjain Kumbh.Experts from across the world attended the three-day conference inaugurated by the PM. A few months later, he was nominated as environment minister, replacing Prakash Javadekar.From the start, the minister had shown his disdain for civil society activists and had told the HT that he will not talk with those who give speeches sitting in air-conditioned offices.He had also rubbished a Health Effects Institute study that said that 1.1 million Indians died because of air pollution in 2015 and requested the health ministry to conduct study on impact of air pollution.As environment minister, Dave had fastened approval of Indias first river-linking project Ken-Betwa falling in Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.On Wednesday, the Forest Advisory Committee (FAC) gave its conditional principle approval to the project that will submerge one-third of Panna tiger reserve in Madhya Pradesh and will irrigate 6.35 lakh hectares of land in drought- prone Bundelkhand.Dave took several policy initiatives, including delegating power to give environment clearance to building projects to the state governments and time-bound approval to projects.He pushed approval for genetically modified Mustard which was stalled for the last two years. The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) last week recommended to the government its commercial release."

DMH 11 is produced by an Indian government institution and said to be commercialised by an Indian company; thus addressing the concerns of farmers of a corporate capture of agriculture. The variety has two main functions that could be attributed to its genetic modification. The first is it makes hybridisation for mustard easier, since mustard is a self-pollinated plant and it is not easy to produce hybrids for mustard. Second, it has a gene that provides the plant with herbicide tolerance.There are speculations and concerns about what it would mean to approve the cultivation of the first genetically modified food crop in India. Till now, Bt cotton, a non-food crop, has been the only GM crop cultivated in India. Similar attempts were made in 2009 to commercially release Bt brinjal, but were stalled by a moratorium in 2010 by the then minister of MoEF Jairam Ramesh.From the Bt Brinjal consultation and moratorium to the nod for commercial cultivation of GM Mustard, what really has changed in the Indian agricultural biotechnology landscape that would give sufficient reasons for common citizens and farmers in remote villages to choose GM mustard this time?Scientists have made claims about the increased productivity of GM mustard, but these claims are not fully supported by available scientific data. On the contrary, civil society organisations have claimed that given the right inputs, some local varieties can produce the same amount of yield with lower farm costs that the GM varieties.The detrimental impacts of synthetic chemicals in the form of pesticides, herbicides, and fertilisers are becoming prominently visible for environment and human health. The increase in the cases of cancer in certain farming regions of Punjab is one such example. In this case, just like in the case of Bt cotton (an insect resistant crop), bringing in a herbicide tolerant crop would increase the tendency of farmers to spray chemicals on the crops and jeopardizing their own health as well as that of water bodies, flora and fauna. This means that even if the yields from GM mustard increases, it is highly unlikely that farm incomes would increase proportionately, as a large amount of money would go in buying more herbicides. Also, weeds will develop herbicide tolerance, leading to even more spraying of herbicides.Many scientists suggest that there should be rules to regulate herbicide spray by farmers, which means they could be penalized or jailed for excessive spraying of chemicals. A similar attempt has been made in the case of farmers who burn agricultural residues on their fields. I met some of these farmers while conducting research, and found that criminalising farmers in this way has a huge negative impact on their dignity and self-esteem rather than changing the practice in any considerable way.Many scientists also claim that commercialisation is the only way to test the viability of GM mustard and it should be left to farmers and consumers to decide what they actually want. This means that scientists want the market mechanism to facilitate the choices of farmers and consumers rather than the democratic system. Markets operate on the principles of monopoly, persuasion, and asymmetry of information and it would not take a genius to guess that intellectual and property rights could be easily transferred to multinational companies as and when required. The acquisition of well performing domestic companies by big multinational is a routine phenomenon in the pharmaceutical industry.The mandates of the Bt brinjal consultation were to develop institutional structures and capacity to ensure safety to environmental and human health, farmers and consumers rights and inclusive decision making for GM crops. Not a single attempt has made in this direction after the Bt brinjal consultation. It remains to be seen whether the government decides on the commercialisation of GM mustard on the basis of half-baked scientific facts and expectations or engages all stakeholders in a more inclusive and democratic manner.Poonam Pandey is postdoctoral fellow, Maastricht University Science Technology and Society Program (MUSTS), The NetherlandsThe views expressed are personal"

This demise is a personal loss, Mr. Modi said.Mr. Daves last day in office was spent meeting not just the Prime Minister but also activists who opposed the possible environmental release of transgenic mustard, and those were not the only loose ends that he tied up. Known to be ailing for some time, Mr. Dave had left explicit instructions for a simple cremation with Vedic rites on the banks of the Narmada at Bandrabhan in Madhya Pradesh, where he, through a non-governmental organiasation of his, Narmada Samagra, held an annual river festival. He has asked for no memorials, except perhaps the planting of saplings.Mr. Dave, 60, was born at Barnagar village in Ujjain and went to school in Gujarat, before taking a Masters degree in Commerce and Rural Development in Indore. A trained pilot, he once flew a Cessna along the banks of the Narmada for 18 hours. He rafted 1,312 km on the river in 19 days.Organisation manFrom social work to joining the RSS and the BJP was a short step for Mr. Dave, who was one of the main architects of the partys victory in the Madhya Pradesh Assembly polls in 2003. After the elections, he was appointed adviser to the then Chief Minister, Uma Bharti. For the BJP, which sent him to the Rajya Sabha in 2009, he was the quintessential organisation and details man. The partys nominee for tough parliamentary committees such as the Select Committee on the Prevention of Corruption Bill and the Coal Mines Bill, he was again nominated to the Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh in 2015 and made Environment Minister in July 2016.Though frequently unwell and skipping meetings over the past two months, he was actively at work for over a fortnight. He was admitted to hospital early on Thursday after complaining of uneasiness and died within an hour, an AIIMS press release said.Mr. Dave was unmarried, and he leaves behind several books such as Shivaji & Suraaj , Creation to Cremation; rafting through a civilisation: a travelogue , and Beyond Copenhagen; Yes I Can, So Can We .Union Minister for Science and Technology Harshvardhan has been given additional charge of the Ministry of Environment and Forests."

No decision on GM crops should be taken in haste as it can harm the interests of farmers and the people of the India in general,"" Nitish wrote.He said he was writing the letter in acknowledgement of reports of regulatory clearance accorded by Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee for commercial cultivation of GM mustard. The matter now awaits Union environment minister's nod.Referring to his October 6 letter to PM Narendra Modi on GM crops, Nitish said, ""Our concerns and objections remain unresolved. The state governments will be forced to bear the adverse consequences of this technology if the Centre approves it even as the agriculture is a state subject. The said technology is likely to be commercialised by seed MNCs, which will be highly monopolistic and leave millions of farmers in the hands of seed companies.""Incidentally, mustard is an important crop of Bihar. Apart from its oil being used for cooking purposes and cakes for animal feed, the yellow flowers of mustard plant also serves as food for honeybees in winter.""Bihar will not be able to escape the consequences of the technology. When it comes to food crops, the country has to be particularly cautious. Health impact on consumers cannot be ruled out,"" Nitish had written in his letter to PM."

The organization was planning to hold a National River Festival at Nila and Dave was to attend the programme on June 3.His sojourns on the banks of various important rivers of India had included Nila. ""He had camped for two days on the banks of Nila then and had walked from Palakkad to Ponnani, through the areas where the river flows,"" said Vipin Koodiyedath, the secretary of the Vichar Vedi.He had then visited the cultural centres along the banks of the river, including the Vedic Village at Panjal, Thunchanparambu, Thirunavaya and Thrithala, which is known for its association with the legend of Parayi Petta Pathirukulam.According to Vipin, he had been supporting the various programmes of the Vichar Vedi even after becoming a minister.Kerala State Biodiversity Board chairman Oommen V Oommen said he was saddened by the demise of Dave. ""He was supposed to preside over the annual biodiversity conference to be held later this month. We were expecting to have a detailed interaction with him on issues relating to the Western Ghats. Also on the cards were discussion on the amended Kasturirangan report the final draft of which is being prepared by the MoEF,"" he said.However, environmentalists like S Faizi, member of the expert group on biodiversity and development of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), said the minister's performance was often disappointing in terms of the conservation of environment or the protection of the rights of the deprived sections over the natural endowments.According to him, the recent clearance given by the genetic engineering approval committee (GEAC) of the environment ministry for commercialisation of GM Mustard is one example of an environmentally-negative decision of the ministry. There have also been significant moves to water down the Forest Rights Act which ensured numerous livelihood rights to the tribespeople, Faizi said."

Some came from Delhi, some from far-off states. This was a growing tribe of professionals, moving to this Delhi suburb that was fast becoming a corporate hub and a melting pot of identities and culture. It would take a while before a new identity would get forged, a Gurugrammer identity that we see today. But what was it like in those early days? And who were the first Gurugrammers? In the fourth part of our new weekly series, TOI turns the spotlight on the early settlersA year after he built a farmhouse near Sohna Aditya Arya , self-made man with a DIY streak, landed up in Gurgaon - with wife Rita, their two children, and his mother-in-law - to build a house of his own, and a life for himself. He's done both, with enviable success. Arya owns one of the city's landmarks, an intimate space that pays tribute to the history of photography (though his plans for a bigger museum continue to be infuriatingly mired in red tape). The trees in DLF Phase-III? Oh, they were planted by Arya. Gurgaon's rulers could do worse than follow this early settler's empathy for the environment, and his all-embracing pioneering spirit.The pioneerTwo things I really wanted to do were farming and photography. So in 1996, I set up my farm, near Sohna. But it was too long a drive from east Delhi, and I wanted to be closer to the farm, so we moved here soon after.Back then, there were mustard fields in and around Gurgaon - on Sohna Road, where Malibu Towne is now, there was only mustard fields!For me, to live close to nature was very important. But little did I realise the house would end up in the backyard of Cyber City, that we'd be struggling for water and power!The 'hands on' daily wage earner!I've started my life at zero level - always. I like to build things, and to start fresh is for me a simple process. So, I built a house, I built a farm, I planted trees. I like to make things, like to work with my hands - I love playing with materials, with sand and gravel and dirt. And I keep each and every tool in the house - why not do your own welding and woodwork, and cut stone yourself?The house took nine months to complete, from start to finish - it was one of the first to come up in the area. And I can tell you what was going on when each brick, each wall, was coming up - it is ingrained in my mind!Man of actionMany people moved into DLF Phase-III after they came to visit me. If there's an issue affecting the area, I'm the first one to get involved, whether it means fighting with the neighbour, or arguing with the builder. We have too many people who like to discuss things - let's do something about it!For I come from a time when there was no Facebook, WhatsApp or social media. So we had ample time to read, study, go places, meet people, and learn how things happen. Because there were no distractions like malls and pubs.Starting from scratchNothing was unnerving for me when I came here. Everything was exciting. You started your life fresh every day, nothing was laid out for you. I enjoyed the part of setting up new things every day.When we came, there were no trees - from the first floor, I could see the border. I planted all the trees in the area and now they're overflowing with birds. There are babblers, sunbirds, mynahs and, occasionally, hornbills - sometimes, I get to see hawks.Future uncertainI'm worried about the water situation. When we came here, there was water at 80 feet. Now, there's no water even at 300 feet - and nobody's talking about water conservation!The only thing I'm hopeful about is the Aravali Biodiversity Park. Here, you can breathe, you can be with nature. Whenever I feel like it, I just get up and go for a walk there.I can't imagine living on MG Road. But thankfully, once we enter our colony, we're in a tranquil place."

We tend to work as were immortals, but death comes unannounced. Hate, jealousy and arrogance can be seen in our public life, but Dave was different. His death has come as a message to us all that its not the degrees , decorations and the designations that make you big. It is the fragrance of your good words and the noble deeds that remain even when your physical remains have merged with the elements of the earth. And thats exactly what it means to be living beyond death.Four months younger to me, he left a bit early. We sat together in the Rajya Sabha, well almost; being senior in politics, he was allotted a seat one bench ahead of me.He spoke mildly, but his words were powerful. His delivery bore a mark of deep commitment and conviction and drew attention of the entire House. He was a master shabd shilpi, the craftsman of the words. His book on Shivajis noble administration- Shivajis Surajya has been often quoted by senior administrators. His famous one liners  Yudh Jeetne ke Liye Lada Jaata Hai- Haarne ke liye nahin ( war is waged to win, not to end in a defeat) and Shasan karne ke like hota hai, chhorne ke liye nahin ( seat of power is meant to govern, not to abdicate the responsibility ) are still reverberating in a million minds. Shivaji was his ideal and he organised shows of famous Baba Saheb Purandares Jaanta Raja in many cities.Narmada remained his first commitment. I remember when I started Sindhu Darshan, and had it named so, we discussed celebrations on the river Narmada in detaisl. He gave photos and the video of his famous aerial survey- rather Vayu-Marg Parikrama of Narmada and we published a story on it.Those were the days when the rivers drew lesser attention by the politicians. Dave brought the river issue to the fore of the social action plans of not only the RSS volunteers, but as an important agenda on the political front. The Hindus worship rivers as mothers, but do they take care of them with the commitment of a son? He once raised this question.Rivers are not a matter to be dealt by professionals, globe-trotters, or, environmentalists. It is a peoples issue, and hence must be dealt by people in the form of mass movement. He was contained in his words, but was unsparing when it came to hit hard at the violators of the Constitution. His calm composure and cool demeanour drew everybodys admiration and he never needed to shout to draw the attention of the House. The cooler you are, the more respect you get, was his mantra and he proved it over the time.He was an affable, soft-spoken person who earned respect from all party leaders. He chaired an important select committee and it was an incredible scene in the Rajya Sabha to see almost all party leaders speaking in praise of him. This was a matter of a special mention by veteran leader Venkaiah Naidu in the BJP parliamentary party meeting next Tuesday and Prime Minister applauded it making it an example to be emulated by all.Like a fish to the water he adopted the working of his environment ministry and began working on a bigger canvas. Quick clearance of environment projects, green signals to development projects, and of course, working relentlessly on his dream idea- interlinking of the Ken-Betwa rivers kept him going in a vigorous way. He was to take a final decision on an application for an indigenously-developed GM crop of mustard. Everyone who knew him was sure that he would ban it in India.Given his expertise and life mission, the ministry of environment and forests was just the right place for him. It was a made for each other combination. As an RSS swayamsewak he remained essentially an RSS worker till his death. Never to say no to any visitor, any time, never to take rest till the table work is finished and never to find time for personal recreation, he was a fighter all along.Before his final adieu he was discussing important policy matters related to environment with the Prime Minister. He was also scheduled to go to Coimbatore and so on. He was not among those leaders who lead a comfortable life and have their political agendas ahead of their public works.Through thick and thin, his comforting hands were always felt by his colleagues on their shoulders. That is the warmth and the affectionate feel of belongingness which will be missed by us all.Quintessentially a riverman, Dave would always be remembered for his missionary zeal for saving the rivers and a humility thats so rare these days."

The Union Ministry of Environment and the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) have given approval for the cultivation and production of GM mustard. The Centre should not implement it, he said in the resolution.The minister said it would destroy seeds and farmers would have to depend on multinationals for cultivation. Moreover, it will only increase the expenses which the farmers cannot afford, said the resolution.The resolution also pointed out most of the states were opposed to genetically modified crops. He said it had not been proven if the yield of GM crops was more. The minister also alleged the altered seeds were known to attract new insects leading to the use of powerful insecticides. This will have an adverse impact on the environment, he said.Sunilkumar also said the introduction of new seeds would destroy the concept of organic farming. He alleged groups with vested interests, under the guise of achieving self-sufficiency in edible oil, were trying to get sanction for GM mustard.Genetic trials are going on for 75 crops and these groups will seek approval for each variety after getting the green signal for mustard, said the minister.

The GEAC should have held consultations with more scientists and other professionals before giving its approval, said Dr T Haque, Advisor, NITI Aayog.Stating that biodiversity should be the top most concerns, Haque told EXPRESS that the Indian experience with Bt Cotton has been quite disappointing, as about 30 varieties of cotton have gone out of cultivation.The Bt Cotton came with the claims that it was resistant to the American bollworm pest. But farmers in Punjab found that the Bt Cotton was struck by the white flag posts, which led to a severe loss to the cultivators, said Haque, while arguing that biodiversity must be preserved to ensure farmers from uncertain future developments.Incidentally, India is not yet self-sufficient in edible oils and spends substantial forex in imports to meet the demand within the country. But Haque says that the use of biotechnology in seed development could give the farmers high yielding hybrid seed varieties without making them solely dependent on the corporate enjoying monopoly.Besides the issue of biodiversity, health and environmental concerns just cannot be ignored while adopting the GM crops. There are genuine concerns of health safety as well. Also, making farmers captive to a corporate house is against the agricultural interests of the country. The farmers should be made stakeholders in seed development with sharing of patents with them, which could be done by forging a partnership with agricultural research institutions, said Haque.Incidentally, the Three Years Action Plan of the NITI Aayog has also stated that the widespread concerns with respect to the GM crops cannot be ignored. The document has advocated the use of alternative technology to push the high agricultural productions in the country.With clear voices emerging out of the NITI Aayog against the immediate of the rollout of GM Mustard, which has been developed by Delhi University, the government, sources said, the government will be extra-cautious in taking any step."

Besides, it has also been opposed by the Haryana, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Punjabgovernments, which are major mustard producing States, said Mr. Gandhi.Barred processMr. Gandhi said that GM mustard uses genetic use restriction technology, which is barred under Section 29 (3) of the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Act, 2001.The use of GM mustard will lead to accumulation of pesticides, nitrates and heavy metals in human bodies, which can cause a number of chronic and incurable diseases, he said.He said it was unfortunate and unacceptable that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) was not ready to accept that GM crops were a failure and posed a threat to livelihoods of farmers.If the Centre gives its nod to commercial cultivation of GM mustard, it would defy the voice of scientists and the public, who have called for a precautionary approach with regard to GM crops. Any release of GM crops into the environment is anti-farmer, anti-people and anti-national, said Mr. Gandhi, adding that he would raise the issue in Parliament until the government takes note.The GEAC, the apex body that accords approval for large-scale use and commercial release of genetically modified organisms in India, had on May 11 given a positive recommendation for commercial cultivation of GM mustard.

DMH11 has been developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP), University of Delhi South Campus (UDSC), New Delhi.Talking to The Hindu , Mathew Koshy Punnackad, Director of the Department of Ecological Concerns, said the proposed GM mustard engineered with three genes is a herbicide-tolerant crop and has not been evaluated for its impact. The herbicide tolerance trait has been problematic due to its negative impact on ecology, creation of unmanageable super weeds and deleterious impact on rural health.Honey trade to be hitDr. Punnackad said mustard is a major forage crop for honeybees. Honey from GM crop fields will be rejected by consumers, both within and outside the country, thereby devastating the honey trade. In addition, honeybees are adversely impacted by GM crops, which may not only decrease the honey production but also crop yields in mustard and other crops.He said it was quite perturbing that the proponents of GM mustard (Delhi University) have refused to put out the biosafety reports on the trials made so far. The impact of GM crops on the therapeutic values of the particular vegetable or seed must be assessed before taking any decision on GM mustard, as mustard is an important items in Ayurveda treatment.

""He comes to Bihar merely to criticise the state government and to get photographed,"" he added.Singh said Nitish had written to late MoS for environment, forest and climate change Anil Madhav Dave on May 18, urging him to reject the application seeking clearance for GM mustard.The letter of the CM read, ""The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee has accorded regulatory clearance to GM mustard's commercial cultivation in India, and that the matter now awaits your decision of rejection or approval of this application. Our concerns and objection to this proposal for GM food crop cultivation remain unresolved.""Nitish's letter to Dave also referred to his letter sent to PM Modi on October 6 last year. The CM's stand is that no clearance should be given to the GM food crop without taking the state governments in confidence, as agriculture is state subject."

PTI File PhotoAs GM Mustard awaits Centres nod for commercial cultivation, Food Processing Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal has cautioned that the introduction of genetically modified (GM) food may hit Indias prospects in cashing in on the global demand for organic food.There are many food importing nations that are looking at India rather than China or other countries because they view us as a non-GM nation. They say our food is safe, Harsimrat told DH.She was responding to a question on the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) approval for commercial cultivation of genetically modified mustard.I feel anything connected with food must be backed up with solid research and we must be very sure of what we are going into, the minister said. Harsimrat made it clear that she has neither spoken to any of the stakeholders nor has she got the access to scientific studies that have gone into it.Based on factsI am basing my comments purely on the fact that many countries have told us that they want to source from us because they feel our food is safe as we do not promote GM crops, she said.The demand (for organic food) is increasing and we are getting three times the price for organic food, she said.When we have opportunities like that, why dont we push for those and capture the organic market? Organic food is not only healthy and safe, but can get us good prices as well, she said.According to the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, Indian farmers produced around 1.35 million tonnes of certified organic products worth Rs 26,000 crore in 2015-16. Of this, 2,63,687 tonnes worth Rs 1,900 crore were exported.The GEAC, Indias top biotechnology regulator, had on May 11 declared transgenic mustard plant safe for consumption.The final decision on its introduction or rejection has to be taken by the environment minister."

Earlier this month, the ministry had estimated foodgrain production for the 2016-17 crop year (July-June) at 273.38 million tonnes (MT), which is over 8 MT higher than the previous record, 265.04 MT in 2013-14, and 8.67% higher than last year's foodgrain production. The weatherman has added to the cheer.""The India Meteorological Department has predicted a normal monsoon for this year. If the monsoon is good, I am confident that the foodgrain production will be a new record (in 2017-18). It will boost growth rate in agriculture and allied sectors to more than 4.4% achieved in 2016-17,"" Singh said.The ministry's roadmap for the next three years lists initiatives to the growth of farm sector and ensure that farmers' income doubles by 2022. The new initiatives include use of cutting-edge technology to increase farm productivity, promotion of climate-resilient indigenous breeds of cows and buffaloes, launch of a nationwide programme to harvest the advantages of space technology in agriculture and allied sectors, promotion of deep sea fishing, setting up of seed production and processing units at 'panchayat' level, increase of cropping intensity by 1 million hectares per year through the utilisation of rice fallow areas for pulses and oil-seeds, and consolidation of online trading and inter-market transactions, among others. The minister said, ""The ongoing programmes and new initiatives will definitely double farmers' income by 2022. It will take the country towards the 'evergreen' revolution, as desired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ."" However, the minister evaded a direct response on the issue of commercial cultivation of genetically modified (GM) mustard, instead focusing on his ministry's performance in the past three years. He said his ministry's role was limited to implement the notified order of the government, whether it was related to GM or non-GM crops. ""Whatever crops are notified once the environment ministry and scientists approve it, then our ministry's mandate is to increase production, productivity, bring down cost of production and ensure right price to farmers,"" he added."

The claim that GM Mustard is indigenous is completely untrue. In 2002, Proagro Seed Company (Bayers subsidiary), applied for commercial approval for similar construct that Prof. Pental and his team are now promoting as HT Mustard DMH 11.Bayers application at that point of time was turned down because the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) said that their field trials did not give evidence of superior yield, the SJM convenor Ashwani Mahajan has stated in the letter to the Prime Minister, while adding that the hybridisation of GM Mustard is achieved by means of the two genes barnase and barstar, derived from a soil bacterium called Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. He claimed that the bar-barstar-barnase gene is a patented technology of the Bayer Crop Science.The SJM has argued in the letter that the fact that multi-national company Bayer Corp owns the patent of the genes used in Prof. Pentals GM Mustard has been deliberately concealed.Countering the claims of the high yield of the GM Mustard, the SJM in the letter to the PM has stated that indigenous hybrids according to the data from Rapeseed Mustard Research (DRMR), Bharatpur show that there are several existing hybrid varieties that outperform the GM Mustard.The SJM has further raised the health concerns on account of the GM Mustard by stating that it has been engineered with a trait for resistance to BASTA, which is Bayers herbicide having one ingredient called glufosinate, besides other poisons as adjuvants and surfactants. Glufosinate is a neurotoxin. No assessment of Basta residues in mustard was made.An unscientific statement has been made that the herbicide tolerant trait was used as a marker. But once the Basta resistant trait is introduced, nothing will stop Bayer from selling Basta to farmers through the herbicide resistant traits. Spreading poisons in our farming is a recipe for spreading diseases.It is suspected that use of Bayers herbicide will make land under GM Mustard cultivation and substantially adjoining areas unfit for other crops, the SJM has claimed in its letter to the Prime Minister."

Agriculture scientists believe that canola is one of the best possible options available to lead a yellow revolution in Punjab and that the State can emerge as the canola hub of the country.Health issuesDue to mounting health issues and awareness, theres now growing demand for canola oil across the country. During 2014-15, around 3, 56,000 tonnes of canola oil was imported and sold in Indian markets.Farmers in Punjab can benefit from increasing demand for canola oil as the State has significant area under canola [mustard and rapeseed] cultivation. We have released high-yielding international standard canola-quality varieties of gobhi sarson [rapeseed]  GSC-6, GSC-7 and mustard RLC-3. These are capable of meeting canola oil demand of the entire country, Surinder Sandhu, the head of oilseed section at PAU, told The Hindu .In Punjab, rapeseed-mustard was sown in 31,000 hectares, which reaped a production of over 38,000 tonnes during 2014-15. As per trade terms, toria , gobhi sarson and taramira are categorised as rapeseed, while raya and African sarson as mustard.Yield potentialGSC-7 has demonstrated excellent yield potential. If sown on time, economic returns from GSC-7 can at least equal those of wheat. Besides, we have released the countrys first yellow-seeded canola-quality Indian mustard variety named RLC-3. Theres no dearth of these seed at PAU and farmers can get them at a nominal price, she said.Pointing that the countrys annual edible oil demand stands at nearly 22 million tonnes and is growing by 3% to 4% per year, she said India meets only about 40% of its total edible oil demand. This burgeoning demand-supply gap necessitates large imports from other countries. During 2015-2016, India imported about 16 million tonnes of edible oil at an estimated expenditure of Rs. 75,000 crore. Under this scenario, attaining self-sufficiency in the edible oil sector is crucial to reduce current deficit and to ensure edible oil security for the increasing population.However, in absence of assured market and assured price for their produce from government agencies, farmers have reservations.Canola is a viable alternative for wheat but the only problem is assured returns. If the government sets up an effective system to provide assured purchase, Im sure canola farming will thrive in Punjab, said Amrinder Singh of Lakhowal village, who recently harvested canola crop planted on his three acres of land. Mr. Singh, who has set up an oil extraction unit in his village, is working towards realisation of the canola village concept by selling the oil to cater to local demands and earn better returns. While we can sell canola seeds at the mandi , extraction of oil can help farmers increase profits. Canola business holds good potential at the local level since edible oil is needed in every household. With increasing health awareness, most people are ready to pay for quality products. Thus, the concept of canola villages can be successfully developed in niche areas, he said.Most area in Punjab during the rabi (winter) season is under wheat and farmers are reluctant to adopt any other crop due to assured marketing, low risk factors and largely mechanised farming techniques. Mustard farming is far more labour intensive, especially for weeding during harvest.Crop diversificationP.S. Rangi, agriculture expert and the former Punjab State Farmers Commission adviser, said adopting canola cultivation would give impetus to crop diversification, something that Punjab needs urgently.Farm experts have been pushing for crop diversification in Punjab for a while now. They have also been urging the government to take steps to reduce the cultivation of water-guzzling paddy (rice) to keep a check on the depleting water table."

Thanks to the large number of multinational companies (MNCs) that have set up base in Gurgaon, the city has a young, educated and upwardly mobile crowd. A new population that has expectations and aspirations from this old land.And Gurgaon is meeting those expectations, albeit gradually. Accommodation, entertainment and employment opportunities are prime concerns and Gurgaon is gearing up to meet these challenges. If there is any quibble, it mostly comes from the old timers who feel a tad left out.One has to feel the youthful buzz to believe it. An evening spent in any of the pubs, bars or restaurants that dot the city will convince a visitor of the verve here. You could also make a casual visit to CyberHub and MG Road to feel the energy that the city encapsulates.Read | I love Gurgaon: How the citys changing canvas stirs the soul of an artistLife is literally 24x7 here and the work culture too revolves around the concept. Offices are buzzing with activity round the clock and the average age of employees is not too high either. Many of them are freshers right out of college while others are on their first assignments.To imbibe this youthful vibe, I often hold quizzes, painting competitions, and interactions through various heritage clubs.However, things were not always this happening in Gurgaon. In the 1950s, when I was in school, my father would visit Gurgaon from our home in Nizamuddin East, New Delhi, regularly. On most visits, I too would accompany him.Read | I love Gurgaon: Chhole-kulche seller on a culture that nurtures, aids entrepreneursI still recall the route we took  now known as the Old Delhi-Gurgaon Road. He would visit some of the refugee families settled in Gurgaon after Partition. While returning, we would regularly buy gur (jaggery) and shakkar (sugar) from the market. Thus, for us, Gurgaon was a place to visit with friends and get our regular supply of gur and shakkar. Little did I know that someday I would give up my nest in Nizamuddin and settle in this place, although it took me over four decades to do so.By the 90s, developers in Gurgaon had put up attractive advertisements luring Delhiites to relocate to the calm, peaceful, and serene place just south of Delhi. After searching for a full year, we zeroed in on an apartment in Sushant Lok. We became the proud owners of the apartment in the early 90s, but it was not until 1998 that we moved in.Things were quiet, peaceful, and settled back then, the hustle and bustle of today was missing , but so was this youthful energy.My choice of an apartment was well thought out. Here again, the sprightly energy and freshness that a new residential colony offers attracted me.I still remember the view from my apartment at the time. We could see aircraft take off and land at the Palam airport across green fields. In January and February, those very fields took on the lovely, golden hue of mustard.Within a few years, all the fields and green areas gave way to towering glass and steel structures and malls became a part of the landscape.Whenever things start feeling stale, a visit to malls on the mall mile on MG Road provides a much-needed dose of freshness. The malls not only serve as shopping destinations, but also as rendezvous points.Gurgaon has grown by leaps and bounds. Even its name has grown  from seven letters to the eight-lettered Gurugram.Unfortunately, some of the people who sold their farmlands to developers did not quite comprehend the change it would bring about in their yard. From farming, they turned to other means of livelihood  some adjusted well, while others have still not realised that life is no longer what it used to be.Gurgaon has the potential of being a world-class city, provided the civic services and infrastructure is handled professionally. For this, the youth has to be taken along and their energy used in a constructive manner. There are issues that are holding the city back, but I have hopes that the energy of the youth will help the city lose its shackles and soar to the heights its meant to touch.(Major (retd.)

593df0d07be9e00dabcc6a28,Say no to GM mustard,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/say-no-to-gm-mustard/article18573883.ece,2017-05-25,"The manner in which the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) recently cleared the proposal for genetically modified (GM) mustard is extraordinary to say the least. It makes a mockery of the commitment in the Bharatiya Janata Party manifesto that GM foods will not be allowed without full scientific evaluation on the long term effects on soil, production and biological impact on consumers. The Prime Minister had delighted consumers by lending his weight to the promotion of organic food. On the other hand, GM and organic are completely incompatible.The alluring promises of higher yield and lower pesticide usage which induced many, including myself as Textile Secretary to the Government of India in the 1990s, to welcome Bt cotton have now been belied. Despite increased fertilisers and irrigation, the expectations of enhanced cotton yield have not been realised. Most of the countries that have higher cotton yields than India do not grow GM cotton. The package of promises sold to us did not reveal all of this. If I had an inkling of the future at that time, Bt cotton would not have been introduced in India.Yields as a touchstoneWe would now be foolish in accepting the yield promises of the GM variety of mustard, a crop which is an integral part of every Indians food. Ab initio the yield claims on which GM mustard has been cleared are not even remotely reliable  being based on comparisons with 30-year-old cultivars, and not on more recent high-yielding hybrids. The highest yields in mustard are from the five countries which do not grow GM mustard  U.K., France, Poland, Germany and Czech Republic  and not from the GM-growing U.S. or Canada ( see graph based on FAO data ). If India is desirous to increase its mustard yield rapidly and safely, this can be done by adopting the practice of System of Mustard Intensification, for which successful trials have been done in Bihar through a World Bank project. Results showed higher yields and better income. All this without the spraying of any toxic herbicides, which is the undisclosed story of GM mustard.GM mustards yield increase claims have been successfully challenged now, prompting the crop developers and regulators to retract on that front  it is another matter that many reports continue to claim that GM mustard will increase yields.Gaps in evaluationThere have been numerous severe deficiencies in the evaluation process of GM mustard. The risks to health, environment and agriculture have not been evaluated even through those inadequate tests which were conducted at the time of Bt brinjal examination, though mustard is far more extensively grown and consumed than brinjal.HT (herbicide tolerant) GM crops have been condemned by a number of medical professionals and other scientists for increasing chemical herbicide use, leading to serious health conditions  at all stages, but most worryingly at the foetal stage. A scientific report from Argentina found a fourfold increase in birth defects and a threefold increase in childhood cancers in HT soya areas. Shockingly, the GEAC has conveniently omitted to have any herbicide-related studies. A small committee was constituted to examine the safety dossier  the tests that were done and the deliberations of GEAC were shrouded in secrecy. After a scathing order from the Central Information Commission, the GEAC made a sham of public consultations, through an opaque and perfunctory eyewash process.The U.S. is a prime example of a country which has galloped into the GM mode of agriculture. Studies have shown a strong correlation between growth of GM crops, the herbicides they promote, and diseases such as acute kidney injury, diabetes, autism, Alzheimers and cancers in the past 20 years in the U.S. Seventeen of the 20 most developed countries  including Japan, Russia, Israel and most of Europe  refuse to grow GM crops. An unacceptable marketing trick, that of promotion of a swadeshi GM, is being used to break down resistance to GM crops in Indias vast market, ignoring that safety concerns are the same  swadeshi GM or not.Losses and pernicious effectsThe GEAC had itself rejected a similar HT GM mustard proposal by Bayer in 2002. The same reasons apply now. A herbicide-tolerant crop promotes constant exposure to a single herbicide  which eventually results in weeds becoming resistant. Over 20 species of weeds in the U.S. are now resistant to Monsantos glyphosate-based herbicide. As desperate farmers tried to control these superweeds, there was a tenfold increase in use of glyphosate in 16 years.Glyphosate has been declared to be a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organisation. The glufosinate-based herbicide to which the proposed GM mustard is tolerant will also have adverse impacts on health.If GM mustard is now introduced, who will lose? Every Indian who consumes mustard in any form, as s/he will also consume the herbicide residues on it; the millions of poor women who depend on weeding to support their family who will be displaced; the bee keepers whose honey will be contaminated; farmers whose yields will fall eventually as bees die out; and the Indian nation, which will find that it has lost its seed diversity and the international competitive advantage of its non-GM mustard and honey.A recent report, not by activists but by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, sums up the end game when it says: Recent mergers have resulted in just three powerful corporations: Monsanto and Bayer, Dow and Dupont, and Syngenta and ChemChina. They control more than 65 per cent of global pesticide sales. Serious conflicts of interest issues arise, as they also control almost 61 per cent of commercial seed sales. The pesticide industrys efforts to influence policymakers and regulators have obstructed reforms and paralysed global pesticide restrictions globally. Their business model ensures that no matter who produces a GM seed, they profit.The main advantage trotted out in favour of GM mustard is increased yield  there is sufficient evidence that this claim is a myth. As against this alleged advantage, there are formidable social, economic and environmental reasons which cry out against GM mustard  examination of these has been hardly done by the GEAC.

Kishan Suman of Girdharpur village under Ladpura Tehsil in Kota, whose specially cultivated varity of Sadabahaar Aam (Evergreen Mango) send to Mughal Gardens of Rastrapati Bhawan , was disappointed by facilities there.""At GRAM, there is no advanced training on agriculture and farming"", Suman said adding, government's tall claims of assisting farmers in waving off loans are also hollow. Government had promised to relax farmers from paying two month's interest after demonetisation. Suman claimed, he has availed loan of Rs 50,000 from Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana but has not been given any relaxation in interest and regularly paying instalments with interests.Government claimed to bring about 5,000-6,000 farmers at GRAM in Kota, which turned out to be only 2,000-3,000 and they were not provided facilities even, said another farmer. He claimed several local farmers were not invited to the event as they had no inclination towards the party.Terming GRAM a 'gimmick' former Congress minister Bharat Singh alleged that state government has just invited 'specially selected' BJP workers to take part in GRAM and has not allowed farmers at grassroot level. He termed GRAM a total waste of public money.Singh said there is no point in organising event like GRAM for farmers when they are not paid fair prices of their produce. They are being denied bonus from government purchase of wheat for last three years and mustard has not been purchased despite its price falling every year, Singh further said.""MoUs are just game of grabbing government lands for party leaders and their relatives. Farmer, who is the first producer, is not getting any benefit of MOUs which is availed by people indulged in marketing sector,'' said Singh."

If the city-based Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR) has its way , the Indian market will soon be flooded with genetically modified or transgenic jowar.Four years after launching research on transgenic sorghum, the IIMR has successfully developed genetically modified jowar with Bt genes for better grain size and resistance to pests. The IIMR's admission that it has created genetically modified (GM) jowar has taken farm and health rights activists by surprise. They demand that the Central government stop the release of GM jowar for human or animal consumption.Jowar, long considered as a poor man's food, is now in high demand with the rich and the middle classes preferring to savour Jonna Roti to fight high blood sugar levels. Only recently the transgenic variety of mustard, an essential ingredient in Indian kitchens, received the Centre's nod for release in the market. The harm the GM jowar would cause to humans and animals will be far more than the GM mustard as sorghum is consumed in large quantities all over the country , rights activists warn.The IIMR's official site takes pride in stem borer-resistant transgenic sorghum plants through Bt technology . It has also developed "" genetic transformation technology to suit the needs of Indian sorghum genotypes"".Expressing shock at the development of transgenic sorghum, the Southern Action on Genetic Engineering (SAGE) on Friday demanded a ""firm and unequivocal"" stand against GM sorghum by the Centre. It has asked the Centre to clearly state that it will not approve GM jowar.SAGE, a coalition of farmers, scientists, environmental activists and civil society groups from South India, dashed off a letter to the Union minister of environment and forests. It said jowar offers complete food and nutritional security to people in dry lands across the country . It also provides rich fodder for cattle. It accused the IIMR of ""succumbing"" to international temptations by the GM lobby . The recent development of GM mustard by Delhi University and the development of GM Sorghum of IIMR are results of the Global Food Security Act, it alleged.It pointed out that sorghum plants are fascinating tapestry of biodiversity warning that introduction of GM genes into jowar fields would result in the death of the grand biodiversity .""The case of Mexico, the origin of maize biodiversity where an accidental introduction of GM maize killed the maize diversity, must offer a clear lesson for India, warns SAGE convener PV Satheesh."

Only a handful of the wondrous khejdi and ruida trees and a cluster of vilayati babool add a tinge of green. In this rather weather-beaten side of Ramgarh, a kasbah about 65 kms from Jaisalmer, hundreds of sheep and goats crowd around livestock farmer Bhim Singh in a midday ritual that lasts almost half an hour.Bhim lowers an improvised plastic bucket tied to a rope into a beri - a shallow sweet-water community well - draws out the life-giving liquid and pours them into a small stone tub. In an adjacent beri, another livestock farmer does the same. As the animals gratefully quench their thirst, another couple of farmers with their flocks wait at a distance to avoid overlapping of the herds. ""These two beris are the only water source here during summer. Without them, the animals would have probably died,"" says Bhim.Born out of a traditional system of harvesting rainwater, beris are lifesavers for both humans and animals in parts of western Rajasthan for centuries. Shaped like matkas (pitcher), these shallow wells are dug up in areas with gypsum or bentonite beds which prevent the rainwater from percolating downwards but guide them towards the wells through capillary action.""Last year, Ramgarh and its surrounding villages hardly received any rain. But even then, these beris are fully charged. You can draw at least 10,000 litres of drinking water every day. It gets replenished overnight,"" says Chatar Singh, a 56-year-old local eco warrior with a masterly knowledge of desert water conservation. His initiatives, in tandem with Sambhaav, an NGO aiding the restoration of aquifers, has led to the digging of dozens of new beris and the revival of others that had fallen fell into disuse. The long trek for drinking water is not so long anymore.The importance of beris is further underlined by what one notices a few kilometres away. Water from the humongous Indira Gandhi canal gathers in a pond-like structure on its way to the filtering unit. Near the canal's Sagarmal Gopa branch, one also notices a cow's rotting carcass. The unclean water, full of green algae, looks unfit for consumption yet tractors line up to carry it away in huge cans. ""Hum yahi pani peete hain (Everyone drinks this water),"" says class X student Suraj Singh Bhati, who's ferrying the water home for consumption.On the outskirts of Netsi village, 23 beris are in use. The village has a huge cement tank that stores water released from the IG canal. But many women trek a kilometer away to the village outskirts, where the beris are located. ""Most of us drink the beri's water,"" says Mala Devi. Undeniably, water from the IG canal has eased their woes but most villagers that TOI spoke also said that the taps are often run dry. ""We got water after a gap of five days,"" said Guddi of Ekalpar village.The traditional beris were made of wood. ""They would rot after a year. The new beris are built with long-lasting blocks of yellow stones that Jaisalmer is known for,"" says retired armyman Jitu Singh.The success in these water-harvesting projects has come by forging a partnership with locals. Netsi villagers provided free-of-charge labour required to make the beris functional again. Chatar spells out that the villagers were motivated to join the project while Sambhaav chipped in with materials.Nearly three decades ago, Chatar started teaching children of the bhil tribes in Ekalpar and Dobalpar, once regarded among the two poorest village in the area. But over the last 10 years, he was worked primarily in the field of water conservation in association with Farhad Contractor of Sambhaav, who routinely visits these villages.Part of their vast work is helping the bhil tribe learn the traditional art of khadeen, a form of cultivation in arid, scanty-rainfall region where the land's moistness is harnessed to produce wheat, mustard and black gram, among other things. ""We help them help themselves,"" says Farhad.Before Chatar's engagement, the bhils were largely a hunting community. Often they were asked to shift from one place to another by the local administration. ""They did not know how to harness water. Sometimes they would even lie down on the field to stop rainwater from escaping,"" recalls Chatar Singh, who is hugely influenced by environmentalist Anupam Mishra's seminal book, Rajasthan Ki Rajat Boondein (The radiant raindrops of Rajasthan).Over the years the bhils learnt to use water-saving techniques such as toba, which allows rainwater to be stored for drinking, and dhora, a technique that ensures rainwater storage for irrigation.""We did not know how to grow crops. We learnt everything from him,"" says Padma Ram, a 60-year-old bhil who owns 75 bighas of land. In 2015, he earned Rs 3 lakh cultivating black gram. Such examples abound. The two bhil villages now have 30 motorcycles and 15 tractors; unthinkable some years ago.At a distance from his village, Padma is constructing a mound three feet high and over 500 feet long. ""When the rains come, the dhora will trap the water,"" he says. The monsoon generally arrives late in Jaisalmer. Sometimes it even plays hookey in Ramgarh. But the bhil is an optimist. ""It will rain one day,"" he says, ""and whenever it does, I want to trap every drop of water."""

The key ingredient in the dish is jackfruit, aged in brine.As the region has an abundance of jackfruit, residents have devised various means of using the fruit at every stage of its ripening. For salla, the jackfruit is plucked when it is close to maturing, but has not yet started to ripen and, therefore, is still bland in taste.""To make the pickled jackfruit, first remove the seeds and the vein-like growth around the fruity part. Cut each of the fruit pieces into two. Make sure your hands are dry and the fruit does not come into contact with water at any stage because this determines for how long the pickled jackfruit will survive without going bad,"" says Vaishali Naik , a Cumbharjua resident.These cut pieces of fruit are then placed in three to four layers in an open vessel and covered with rock salt. This process is followed till you get multiple layers. A heavy stone is placed on top for added pressure and left overnight.""Using rock salt is important. Using table salt will take the crispiness out of the fruit and will ruin the taste of the salla,"" says Lalitha Shenoy from Porvorim.The next day, the jackfruit pieces have to be squeezed dry and the water drained from it has to be discarded.A dry jar is used this time and the same layering method is followed, alternating layers of jackfruit and rock salt. This is also left overnight but without the stone on top. Usually a cloth is tied tightly to the mouth of the jar to keep insects and dust out. On the third day, the salt water is once again squeezed out and discarded.The process is repeated and the fruit replaced in the jar with some more layers of rock salt. The mouth of the jar is tied and is left to age. It takes at least 20 days for the jackfruit to reach the desired state. ""If this entire process is done with care, these preserved salla last for up to two years,"" says Shenoy.Once the salla are ready, to make the upkari, carefully take a few pieces of the salla from the jar (with dry hands again) and soak them in water to do away with any of the excess saltiness.""Squeeze the salla dry and discard the water. Prepare a tadka by heating oil and adding mustard seeds, dry chilies, asafoetida and curry leaves. Add this to the salla in a wide-mouthed vessel and cook for a while with a splash of water. Garnish with grated coconut and your upkari is ready,"" said Shenoy."

The ICMR noted that each GM product should be assessed on merit, with appropriate studies to assess their safety.AMID THE debate over GM Mustard, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has told a parliamentary panel that while genetically modified crops are generally safe, the individual GM foods should be assessed on a case by case basis, either by the government or an independent credible third party.The review of available literature indicates that genetically modified crops available in the market that are intended for human consumption are generally safe and their consumption is not associated with serious health problems. However, as different GM organisms include different genes inserted in different ways, individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed on a case by case basis, Soumya Swaminathan, ICMR Director General, told the parliamentary standing committee on science and technology, environment and forests last week.The ICMR noted that each GM product should be assessed on merit, with appropriate studies to assess their safety. Individual GM foods and their safety should be assessed as per national regulatory norms. These assessments should be done by the government or an independent credible third party agency, Swaminathan told the panel headed by Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury.In its submission, the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change told the panel that tests done on animals and studies conducted by the National Institute of Nutrition revealed nil/ negligible risks. Addressing concerns regarding the toxicity and allergenicity of GM Mustard, it said the use of leaves, seed and oil derived from transgenic mustard were not likely to pose any risk to humans and animals. The ministry also pointed out that GM food and feed are being consumed in a number of countries since 1996, and there have been no negative reports so far.In a detailed note on the impact of GM food on animals, the Department of Biotechnology cited studies to show that it has no negative effect and is as safe as non-GM crops.The parliamentary panel has decided to hold further discussions on June 8. Chaudhary, who had earlier asked the government not to take a decision on the issue till the panel formulates its opinion, is set to write to Health Minister J P Nadda, seeking clarifications on the health concerns raised over GM Mustard.Earlier this month, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), which functions under the Environment Ministry, cleared a genetically-modified variety of mustard for commercial cultivation. When the parliamentary panel called senior officials of the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and Department of Biotechnology on May 25, some members questioned the constitution of the GEAC. The GEAC was last reconstituted on March 11, 2013 for a period of three years, after which its tenure was extended.Many organisations, including RSS affiliates like the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh and the Swadeshi Jagran Manch, have opposed clearance to GM Mustard. The only genetically modified crop that is under cultivation in India is Bt Cotton. During the previous UPA government, the then environment minister Jairam Ramesh had refused to grant clearance to Bt Brinjal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The all-night cafeteria at the call centre where I worked had colleagues from around the country tucking into insipid food sourced from an airline caterer.Our only respite from stale buns, watery pasta and yesterdays dessert was Zaika at Iffco Chowk, which was open (read: served booze) 24 hours, the old faithful Nirulas in Sector 14 and Dana Choga, right next to that. The street stalls of momos/kebabs/idli sambhar outside the office campus were barely palatable; the fiery sauce keeping us in the toilet more often than where we should have been  in our seats with fake American accents.But that was then. Now you can find just about every cuisine known to mankind within a 10-km radius  if you take into account the DLF phases and sectors 56, 29 and 14. Meanwhile ,the momo-kebab-idli stalls have moved into swanky malls, Dana Choga is now DCK (thats Dana Choga Kitchen) and Nirulas is nowhere.Today, everything from wraps and rolls, pizzas and thalis, burgers and littis, thukpas and pastas, biryanis and risottos to sushi and sorpotel is available. The streets are abuzz with shikanji (lemon-jeera-soda) vendors in summer and with shakarganji (sweet potato) carts in the winter. The sheer variety of takeaway is so much that you could order from a different outlet every evening of the week and not eat the same food for a month! If you live in Gurgaon, you can be sure to have a few takeaway pamphlets from a brand-new outlet with your newspaper pretty much every morning.Of course, there are the star eateries with better PR and the much-publicised resto-bars in the Sector 29 complex that came into focus only because they were supposed to be within 500 metres of the national highway. Sure, there are the Delhi stalwarts and international chains who have moved to Gurgaon, but there is also a home-grown burger chain trying to make its mark.There is even a Korean place serving up massive portions everyday and the NCRs only Goan restaurant is still doing its thing in an expanded space.But its the small, niche players that really stand out  Zaika has been replaced on the favourites list by the Muradabadi chicken biryani guy a few doors down (no booze but what a marinade!). There is also a Kashmiri place near the Iffco Chowk metro station that is definitely worth a visit.The latest phenomenon thats taking Gurgaon by storm, however, is the squads of food trucks  although their clientele tends to change with the weather. This passing heat wave must be murder for them, but hopefully they will bounce back once the monsoon arrives. The range of menus and service available at these joints rivals many established restaurants. The other enterprise that seemed to have been going great guns was the booming micro-brewery fad, But it seems to have fizzled out. Maybe Gurgaonwallas still prefer drinking at home  or rather  in their cars.(Colin Fernandes is a former journalist and author of Viva Santiago.)"

Far from the networks of seed corporations , farmers here still do agriculture in the traditional way where they are not only cultivators but also field scientists and seed tinkerers Most farmers in the Garhwal and Kumaon hills have never bought commercial seeds. They cultivate their own and share them with other farmers, who repay with their own local seeds or return double the quantity of the borrowed variety from the next crop. This system has preserved seed diversity and quality for centuries.""You will not be able to count the number of seed varieties we have in our village. People come here to borrow and we give away happily,"" said Pushpa Devi, who was tilling the soil for planting vegetables in Jhardargaon near Upli Nagni with a younger woman farmer named Hima Meher.Their village has about 350 varieties of paddy, including dryland ones, 32 of wheat, 220 of kidney beans or rajma, 12 of millets (63 sub-varieties of foxtail millet alone), and 5-7 varieties of each vegetable that grows here.Jhardargaon is home to farmer leader Vijay Jhardari who leads the Beej Bachao Andolan for preserving traditional seed varieties. He and other farmer leaders are now worried as the promised yields of the newly-approved genetically modified (GM) mustard could give the corporations an upper hand in their David-and-Goliath fight.""The hills of Uttarakhand have a culture of mixed cropping. Just like you can't eat the same food every day, the soil doesn't like a monopoly of crops. It wants variety. The crop cycle here is what suits the climate and gives the nutrients to soil and people,"" said Jhardari, adding, ""GM technology will ruin the Himalayan ecology."" Jhardari is a veteran of Chipko Andolan that aimed to save trees in the 1970s. He started Beej Bachao with other Chipko members. When TOI met him, he was preparing for a festival to commemorate the tree-hugging movement. ""We had a slogan for our seed movement: kya hai jungle ke upkar? Mitti, pani aur byar (what are the benefits of forests? Soil, water and air),"" he said.He opposes the intellectual property rights (IPR) corporations' claim on their seeds. ""I would say all patents on seeds should be banned. Seed is a common resource for farmers. If farmers lose access to their seeds, they will lose their independence and dignity."" Satish Dhar, another activist and Dehradun-based farmer, agreed with Jhardari: ""Nature tries to create a seed suited to an area's geography. Local seeds are in harmony with local environment,"" Jhardari said.He also added that, ""Today, seed accounts for 10-15% of a crop are cost. Farmers can't afford it. It comes with a package of herbicides and crop insurance. It's a nexus and the farmer gets trapped.""Beej Bachao members distrust not only corporations but also agricultural universities and national institutions. ""I am not in favour of giving my seeds to the National Gene Bank. Why should we? Will they return those varieties to us when we need them? Will they promise not to share them with companies? I know that they gave some of our millet varieties to leading biscuit companies,"" said Jhardari.Jhardari said G B Pant University of Technology and Agriculture, and Vivekananda Parvatiya Krishi Anusandhan Sanstha in Almora had modified their seed varieties but ""the new varieties they give haven't worked for most, so people avoid them.""Like Jhardargaon in Garhwal, Gallakot village in the state's Kumaon region is also famous for its seed diversity. A steep hike within sight of Ranikhet hills brings you to the farm of 75-year-old Dayanand Joshi who grows several varieties of mandwa, jhungar or koni (millets), amaranth, a number of dals and vegetables. In 1962, he bred a radish variety that can weigh up to 15kg and tastes better than the commercial variety. His attempt to patent it was thwarted by the Protection of Plant Varieties and Farmers Rights Authority (PPFRA). ""They said they don't cover minor crops like radish.""Dayanand with RadishJoshi also cultivates a 100-year-old okra variety. His seeds have travelled to the eastern Himalayas too with visiting farmers from Sikkim and West Bengal. ""It's important for us not to give in to pressures from corporations because we farmers have seeds for all seasons and no matter how badly you sow them, they will come up,"" he said.The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) and the Uttarakhand Biodiversity Board have not commented so far on how GM crops will affect agro-biodiversity, especially in ecologically sensitive areas like the Himalayas. Off the record, an official told TOI: ""GMOs are prohibited. Communities can take a call. The Cartagena protocol is there, and the state biodiversity board can advise against it.""Farmers want the government to support traditional crops like millets and pulses by including them in the public distribution system (PDS) and the integrated child development services (ICDS). ""Our government promised to supply them in PDS but there is no purchase mechanism, while Karnataka is already doing it,"" said Ajay Rastogi, agriculture expert who works with farmers here. ""The minimum support price (MSP) mechanism is for selected crops and it is based on quantity, not quality. If Jhungar has far more protein than wheat, shouldn't it fetch a higher price?""(The story was produced with support of the Earth Journalism Network and the Arcadia Fund)"

The cuisine is actually a tribute to all the three prevalent and still dominant cultures of this state. Imagine mackerels, crabs, prawns and squids, cooked in coconut milk, coriander, mustard and all those intense local spices. Drooling yet? Head over to Qube Cafe at Siesta Hitech to enjoy their ongoing Goan Food Festival.As you enter the restaurant a pink fruit cocktail will be placed in front of you as someone lights a floating candle to set you up with the peaceful vibes of the cafe.Goan cuisine is never about intricacy or complex ingredients. Its about local spices, traditional home cooking and fresh produce, says executive chef Pravakar. The cuisine owes a lot to the South when it comes to its selection of spices.Coconut plays a major part in the making of these dishes as it adds to the richness and creamy texture of the food.The crab curry is a testament to this. The crab meat is succulent and juicy, so fresh that you will gobble it right up. The best way to relish the crab curry is with steaming hot rice, he advises.Not only that, but dishes like mutton Vindaloo, Chicken Xacuti, Cobari Pulao, Mackarel Reacheado etc are lip smackingly good. Vegetarians don't need to fret much for there is a whole array of dishes at your service.Colocasia fry, drumstick dal, bamboo shoot with shitaki mushroom and spice broccoli with cheese pasta are a some of those dishes of the heavenly platter. Apart from these, there is a whole selection of different salads and breads to go with the main dishes.Along with the traditional Bebinca and Coconut Souffle, there will be other Indian sweets and pastries.The festival will be on till June 4.

It is the new business address of many leading international and home-grown companies. Thecity gives upwardly mobile Indians employment, economic empowerment and a meaningful life. If these are not enough reasons to love Gurgaon, then what are?Three decades ago, Delhis Connaught Place (CP) was where all major commercial houses of India were located, and they were mostly branch offices. The headquarters were in Mumbai.Then the office hub of the National Capital Region (NCR) moved southwards, to Nehru Place, and many headquarters of new entrants into the India growth story sprang up in Noida, while the IT-related businesses soon discovered Bengaluru. I have worked in all these places.But a decade-and-a-half ago, Gurgaons Cyber City, and rapidly expanding Udyog Vihar, with their glass and steel tower office spaces, caught the fancy of Indian industry and foreign multinationals.The fact that this sudden surge in newly built modern and hi-tech office spaces was accompanied by a mushrooming of beautifully constructed condominiums and glitzy malls added to the charm of Gurgaon for executives of leading companies.They, like me, discovered that professional growth could be easily married with a happy home life and excitingcultural and entertainment opportunities  all at a stones throw from each other.Their employees discovered that the India growth story could be accompanied by a satisfactory work-life balance, if they relocated to Gurgaon. Of course, Gurgaons proximity to the domestic and international airport was a huge bonus for the many frequent fliers.The result today is a vibrant and modern city, rivalling some international hot spots in terms of lifestyle and professional opportunities.I recall how three decades ago, relatives and friends questioned my decision to shift my family from our rented accommodation in south Delhi to my new home in a remote outpost beyond the end of the world. Today, many of them have also shifted to Gurgaon.I remember how, in the initial years, we travelled to Delhi for employment, recreation and entertainment. Now, we no longer need to. In fact, the traffic flows in the opposite direction. Delhiites now come to Gurgaon for all this and more.The social construct of Gurgaon has undergone a dramatic change. Business leaders live here. Senior managers, both expatriates and Indian, rub shoulders with cultural divas and dons of literature. The resultant opportunities and need for cultural and entertainment hubs has not escaped the notice of entrepreneurs.Not only does Gurgaon lead the nation in the number of malls and supermarkets, but also in the huge variety of eateries and the number of cinema screens and book clubs.CyberHub is a recent addition to the social and entertainment landscape of Gurgaon, with its fancy bars, fancier restaurants and amphitheatre.I began my professional career as a marketing manager in Delhi three decades ago and used to come, somewhat infrequently, to Gurgaons dusty but thriving Sadar Bazar market to visit my wholesalers located in its bylanes. I crossed farmland, mustard fields and tiny hamlets to get to my dealers whose orders from my salesmans product lists mostly revolved around lower-priced and relatively downmarket items preferred by rustic customers.I also inspected the new residential projects coming up on the outskirts of the old town and finally invested in a small house since it was all I could afford then as property prices in Delhi were out of reach. What a sea change I have witnessed in the economic and social ecosystem of Gurgaon since then.Buying a house in Gurgaon in my twenties was one of the best decisions of my life, as it turned out.I love Gurgaon because of the unique opportunity it gives me to spread my wings, even in my fifties. It is a vibrant city which rubs off its dynamism on its citizens, offering them a variety of life experiences along with economic momentum, professional growth, personal happiness and a world view.(Joygopal Podder is a marketing professional and author of Millennium City)"

(Source: common wikimedia) One reason is because the alien Barnase and Barstar genes are both isolated from a soil bacterium, making for a mustard that is transgenic or GM. (Source: common wikimedia)The car we drive has hundreds of patents on the components and systems  from the internal combustion engine, fuel injection, drivetrain, suspension and steering/brake controls, to the electricals and air-conditioning  that work together to run it. The smartphone we use is nothing but an assemblage of patents numbering over 2,50,000, whether these relate to its operating system, processor, wireless local area networking, camera, display screen or protective glass. The aircraft we fly in are made by Boeing or Airbus.Yet, monopolies/duopolies in airplanes, mobile operating systems (Google Android/Apple iOS) and baseband processors (Qualcomm/MediaTek), or royalties on their components and technologies, do not deter us from driving, flying and using smartphones. Rather, we wait with bated breath for the launch of the next iPhone 8 or the latest Maruti Dzire variant.But strangely, this absence of guilt, or being deterred by corporate dominance with regard to consuming things we want, does not apply to technologies in agriculture. There, the focus suddenly shifts to preventing a corporate agribusiness takeover of food production and ensuring our farmers dont turn into slaves of Bayer-Monsanto or Dow-DuPont. Further, all thats traditional and organically grown, without the use of any chemical fertilisers, pesticides, tractors and combine harvesters, becomes the ideal standard. Farmers are expected to conform  because we know whats best for them.Nowhere is this hypocrisy  double standards as far as technologies for us and them go  more apparent than in our hostility to genetically modified (GM) mustard, now awaiting regulatory clearance. This is fundamentally a technology to make a self-pollinating plant  mustard flowers contain both female and male reproductive organs  amenable to hybridisation and exploit the potential yield gains from crossing genetically diverse parents from even within the same species. To facilitate it, a Barnase gene coding for a protein that impairs pollen production is introduced into one of the parents.The resultant male-sterile line can then receive pollen from another parent, which has, in turn, been introgressed with a separate Barstar gene that blocks the action of the Barnase gene. The progeny from cross-pollination is a hybrid plant having a higher yield than either of the parents and also fertile, that is, capable of producing seed/grain.Now, why should we object to this technology?One reason is because the alien Barnase and Barstar genes are both isolated from a soil bacterium, making for a mustard that is transgenic or GM. But India is importing nearly four lakh tonnes (lt) of rapeseed/canola oil every year, a lot of it being GM and based on the same Barnase-Barstar technology. This is apart from the 40 lt-plus of imported soyabean oil, which is entirely GM. If imported edible oil can be GM, why should our farmers be stopped from planting mustard that is GM? The country is, moreover, producing some 13 lt of cottonseed oil, now the second-largest indigenous edible oil after mustard, at 19 lt. This oil is again GM, derived from domestically grown Bt cotton.If roughly a quarter of our annual vegetable oil consumption of 220 lt is already GM, how does transgenic mustard radically alter the picture? A second objection could have to do with the presence of a third Bar gene in GM mustard, making the plant resistant to the herbicide, glufosinate ammonium. This is basically a marker gene, used to identify those plants that have been genetically modified  the non-GM ones cant withstand applications of this herbicide  and necessary especially for large-scale hybrid seed production. The naysayers contention, however, is that it will also enable farmers to spray the herbicide and hence displace rural labour engaged in manual weeding. But by that logic, shouldnt we junk washing machines that take away work from domestic helps? Does the responsibility of job creation lie with the farmer alone?A third allegation is about the yield gains from DMH-11, the GM mustard hybrid developed by Delhi Universitys Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP). These, it is said, arent spectacular and are lower than yields from CGMCPs own mustard hybrids bred through non-transgenic methods. The argument misses the point. DMH-11 is just the start. More important is the Barnase-Barstar-Bar (BBB) technology itself, which is a far more robust and viable system for hybrid breeding. It allows for crossing a wider range of Indian and even East European origin mustard lines, to breed for both higher yields as well as disease resistance. Conventional hybridisation techniques such as cytoplasmic male sterility do not permit this level of flexibility, which also explains why CGMCPs scientists chose BBB.That brings us to the central point: Why is there so much opposition to a technology developed, after all, by Indian scientists in the public sector? Yes, the original patent for the BBB system was filed by Plant Genetics Systems (now part of Bayer CropScience), but the CGMCP scientists improved upon it, for which they obtained patents (three US, two Canadian, one European Union and Australian each). Yet, we see no value in their work. The opponents  from the so-called Left or the Right  havent even bothered to visit the CGMCP, most accessibly located in Delhi Universitys South Campus, while taking time out for anti-GMO jamborees in Brussels and The Hague.All this opposition is reflective of a unique Us and Them syndrome. For us, nothing but the latest would do. But farmers will have no right to grow GM mustard and assess its performance on the field. This, even after toxicity and allergenicity studies conducted by the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, have shown no adverse effects. But that apparently isnt good enough; we want conclusive evidence. Well, was such irrefutable proof of zero-risk for all times a consideration in mobile towers, Viagra or human insulin thats also GMO? No, because these concern us. The Kerala legislative assembly has passed a resolution opposing the commercialisation of GM mustard, stating it endangered the purity of farming. Holding farmers to pure standards is not limited to a denial of the right to use or reject a technology. It extends to their obligation to safeguard Bharatiya Sanskriti and conserve gauvansh as per our noble desire, even if this entails maintaining cattle that are of no use to them. Will we keep these animals in our homes? New Environment Ministry rules prevent farmers from even taking spent bovines to livestock markets without furnishing written declarations that the intended sale isnt for slaughter purposes.The Ease of Doing Business, it seems, applies only to us. The Left and the Right are seldom known to come together. But when they do  whether, in this case, to protect the Purity of Farming or Bharatiya Sanskriti  one can be sure it will, to paraphrase Adam Smith, end in a conspiracy against the Indian farmer.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Head chef Cyrus Irani says that this time round they have added layers and more textures with slaw fillings, nachos and crispy onions.First the cocktails; these are generous with beer and summer flavours. Love is in the air is delicious with five spirits, red wine and a hint of lychee. Bulldog Margarita is a cascade of beer thrown into a frozen margarita and Hangmans Blood has dark rum, whiskey, brandy, gin, red wine, and a sweet and sour mix all of it topped with beer.The Quesadilla Burger - MexicoThis was the best among the three veggie burgers. The filling had the right blend of spices and vegetables, but what made it stand out was its tangy enchilada salad. The layers were with polenta slabs made from maize flour, sweet corn, avocado and nachos. The Swiss cheese gave it a creamy finish.The New Delhi BurgerInspired by the capital, this burger has fresh ingredients and bold spices. Even the rocket lettuce, which has an edge of bitterness and peppery hotness, was spiced. It has two patties  golden-fried, spiced veggie patty and herbed lentil patty  layered with marinated tomato, a sharp sauce and the spiced rocket lettuce.Tango Salsa Burger - ArgentinaThis is smoky with hints of sweetness, much like Argentinas tango. Who wouldve thought of putting a fruit in? There is smoky spiced and grilled chicken, laced with honey mustard sauce and topped with cheddar cheese, green apple and rocket slaw. The green apple goes well with grilled chicken.Lebanese Burger - LebanonThis has the diverse flavours from Lebanese cuisine: shawarma-spiced chicken patty, garlic hummus aioli, kofta-spiced onion, mushroom, peppers and creamy feta crumble.The Tennesessee BBQBurger MemphisThis is for a day when you are planning a day outdoors -- when you need to stay full for hours and dont mind smelling of onions. Theres plenty of good meat. It has a juicy beef patty, BBQed soft chicken and a fried egg. The layers are of fried onion, cheddar cheese and the zippy sauce. In all, it is mildly hot.The Riviera Burger - Nice, FranceFood experts and cookbook authors adore the Mediterranean cuisine. This burger embraces all that the coast has to offer -- there is the herby chimichurri cream laced with spicy mango aioli, cheddar cheese and fresh slaw. The cheese evens out the zing of herbs and garlic.The Sucker Punch -Las VegasThe star here is the grilled beef patty oozing cream cheese, cheddar and jalapeno. It has been paired with coleslaw, perfectly pulled pork, bacon and a sauce that has the final say. The sauce is an acquired taste, much like that feisty friend who talks the loudest."

We will consult scientists, the biotechnology ministry, and the Chief Minister before taking a stand, he said. Though no time limit has been set, the consultation process will commence soon, he said.Major mustard producing States, including Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Rajasthan, have already opposed introducing GM mustard, and southern States of Kerala and Tamil Nadu  though not major mustard producers  have also written to the Union government opposing it.Meanwhile farmers groups have urged Chief Minister Siddaramaiah to write to the Centre urging it to reject the GM crop. Their demand comes in the wake of the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) recommending commercialisation of GM mustard, developed by Delhi University. The Union Ministry of Forests, Environment and Climate Change is yet to take a final call. Minister of State for Information Technology, Biotechnology and Science & Technology Priyank Kharge said that two rounds of meetings had taken place with the Agriculture ministry and one round of consultations with the Vision Group on BT on the issue.The Biotechnology department does not recommend the technology to the farming community directly. Ultimately, the State government and the Agriculture Department has to take a call on the commercialisation of GM mustard, and the ministry will give necessary inputs.Mr. Kharge agreed that the decision has to be taken cautiously. He said the general policy on commercialisation of GM crops could be taken on a case to case basis as they can have different impact. Mr. Kharge felt that irrespective of the States stand on the issue, scientific research on biotechnology or GM crops should continue. Incidentally, mustard is a minor crop in Karnataka and is cultivated as an inter-crop or a border crop. Of the nine oil seeds grown in the State, mustard cultivation and production is the least. Of the total of 33 lakh acres under oil seed cultivation, mustard is cultivated in about 13,000 acres.KRRS leader Kodihalli Chandrashekar said mustard is being considered for future expansion by premier mustard research institutes in the country. What farmers need, including groundnut farmers and other oilseed farmers in Karnataka, is better pricing and procurement policies instead of corporate-driven technologies like GMO (genetically modified organisms).Kavitha Kuruganti of Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture, who met Mr. Krishna Byre Gowda in Bengaluru recently to highlight the issue, said, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, like Karnataka, are not major producers. But consumer interest should also be considered."

Much before moringa found its way into some of the world's swankiest organic stores, gourmet menus, health food diets and even natural body butter brands, it was a much fancied Indian snack that villagers chewed on between lazy afternoon banter or as a fix for midmeal cravings. ""All it took was a little boiling, some garnish of mustard seeds and sun-dried chillies, and a mild seasoning of salt,"" says Vishwanathan. ""Almost every home in the village had a Moringa olifeira tree .""As with countless native foods that have with global research and expanding markets, gone on to take the world by storm, moringa -or leaves of the drumstick plant -are now being known around the world for its health benefits.According to the United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) it has ""antibiotic, antitrypanosomal, hypotensive, antispasmodic, anti-inflammatory, hypo-cholesterolemic, and hypoglycemic properties"".In the country, moringa has had several lips-smacking recipes to its name -from pachchadi made from its ground leaves and coconut, to soup, moringa paruppu usuli and murunga elai adai.But its growing significance world over and the resultant revival here, could be owed to the ""serious hemoglobin, calcium and vitamin deficiencies that those working against the biological clock in BPO and IT sectors face today,"" says city dietician Dharini Krishnan. ""And moringa is a well-advocated fix for iron deficiency; 30% of the world's population has after all been found anaemic,"" she adds. Moringa is high on vitamins A, B and C, and minerals that are highly recommended for pregnant and nursing mothers as well as young children, say experts. Dry powder of the leaf is also used as herbal supplements and available at various organic and health food stores.Amid the wellness products that Coimbatore-based Genius Nature Herbs offers, moringa takes up a generous space and is available in more than a dozen eclectic forms - seeds, leaf powder, oil, tea and even shampoo. ""We've been selling moringa-based products from the time we started eight years ago,"" says CEO Eswar Iyappan. ""We've tied up with farmers across Erode, Coimbatore and Karur who are trained to cultivate it organically. An intake of four grams of moringa powder every day can fulfill all nutritional needs.

The first few lines of Mexican wheat had a yield of about 3.5 tonnes per hectare, but years of plant breeding led to the current yield level of about 9 tonnes per hectare. It is the same story for Bt cotton.

5a0534449855b76bf13c01ad,Why agriculture matters: An irony,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-agriculture-matters-an-irony-4694780/,2017-06-08,"The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach.The reasons that agriculture matters are well-known: it provides sustenance to so many, food to all, and employment to many. In addition to these intrinsic positive reasons to invest in agriculture, there are other instrumental reasons: poor agricultural performance can lead to inflation, political and social disaffection, and restiveness all of which can hold back the economy. There are intrinsic as well as instrumental reasons for prioritising agriculture.But we must be clear and honest about one important link. The Nobel Prize winner, Sir Arthur Lewis, showed that economic development is always and everywhere about getting people out of agriculture and of agriculture becoming over time a less important part of the economy (not in absolute terms but as a share of GDP). But this must happen along with rapid productivity growth, ensuring rising farm incomes and adequate food supplies for the people. The reason why agriculture cannot be the dominant source of livelihood is that levels of productivity and hence living standards can never approach and have historically never approached those in manufacturing and services. That, of course, means that we must get our industrialization and urbanization right for the alternatives toagriculture to become meaningful, prosperous alternatives.When Dr. Ambedkar, famously derided the village as ?a sink of localism, a den of ignorance, narrow mindedness and communalism,? he was perhaps on to a deeper truth an Indian social complement to the Lewisian economic insight that in the long run people need to move and be moved out of agriculture. Dr. Ambedkar was warning about the patronization of agriculture masquerading as a romanticization of rural India.So the irony is this: we must care deeply about farmers and agriculture today because we want there to be fewer but more productive and prosperous farms and farmers tomorrow. In other words, all good and successful development is about facilitating this transition in the context of a prosperous agriculture and of rising productivity in agriculture not least because that will facilitate good urbanization and rising productivity in other sectors of the economy.So, today, I am going to provoke to force us all into collective self-reflection on the state of agriculture and its future. It is easy for me or for anyone  to list 10 or 20 different things that need to be done to improve our agricultural performance: stem the deterioration in agricultural research, educational, and extension institutions, improve resilience, incentivize drip irrigation, etc. But it is as easy to list them as it is perhaps useless. Because for any improvement or reform that all the experts recommend, we have to ask the simple question: ?If that is so obviously good for agriculture why hasnt it happened already? Or, put differently, ?What it is about today that will make these proposals successful when they have demonstratively failed to persuade in the past?Rather, I want to ask a question or tentatively pose a hypothesis: is it possible that we actually love some crops (cereals) and their farmers too much and, for all the pious professions and mythologizing, and other crops and their farmers not enough. To put it more bluntly, perhaps we are now smothering cereals with too much government support and other cropspulses, dairy, oilseeds, livestock, and fruits and vegetablesnot enough?The SuccessesBefore I elaborate on the main themes of my talk today, I would like to take stock of our achievements and shortcomings in agriculture. Given where we began in 1947, Indian agriculture has come a long way. We have achieved food security  at least on the major crops; rural poverty rates have declined substantially; agricultural incomes have risen; nutrition levels have risen.In terms of successes, I would highlight the following: The green revolution transformed Indian agriculture by increasing yields of wheat and rice, especially in Northern and then in Southern India. Credit here goes to international research but perhaps even more so to Indian scientists, agronomists and researchers, extension workers in public institutions that completed the link from technology to actual farm output.The white revolution that transformed the Indian dairy sector, increasing milk production, reducing dependence on imports, creating vibrant and participating institutional structures on agriculture and founding a vibrant consumer goods industry based on diary. Credit here goes, of course, to Dr. Kurien, leader of the Kheda Cooperative movement, and enlightened leadership of the NDDB. In addition to these sectoral successes, there have been, other regional achievements cotton in Gujarat, Maize in Bihar, Sugar in Uttar Pradesh, wheat in Madhya Pradesh, potatoes in West Bengal.Smothering with love: Cereal-CentricityThink of how and how much we support cereal and especially rice production. They are too numerous to exhaustively enumerate. The government helps the farmers through policies that affect the prices of outputs and inputs; through schemes and through institutions. We provide minimum support prices to farmers and the benefits accrue mainly to farmers who produce marketable output and that too mostly in cereals and wheat, which in turn is confined largely to a few States, notably in the North (Punjab and Haryana).We then provide subsidies for power, water, fertilizer (now the second largest subsidy), seeds, credit, we exempt agricultural income from income taxes, and we periodically grant loan waivers. The figure above shows how clearly agricultural incomes in Punjab and Haryana exceed those in the rest of India to get a sense of this biased smothering with love.Smothering with love: Big not Small FarmersThere is a second aspect to this smothering with love: not only does it mainly benefit the cereal farmers, it also tends to favour larger farmers, or at least it does not adequately reach the smaller farmer. Several examples: by definition, the exemption of agricultural income from tax favours those with larger incomes. In fertilizer, we estimated in the Economic Survey that only about one-third of the total subsidy went to small and marginal farmers. On agricultural credit, there is now growing evidence that not all of this goes to farmers. On the loan waiver, it is surprising how little the small and marginal farmer borrow from formal financial institutions (less than 50%) and how much from informal sources, while the large farmer relies on formal sources to the extent of about 75%; on power, we estimated in the Economic Survey that the bottom quintile received about 10% of the total subsidy while the top quintal about 37% because of highly skewed electricity consumption.But is there something as loving too much? The experience of Punjab is perhaps suggestive. Thanks to support, incomes are high and amongst the highest but there is growing evidence that this is proving now to be counter-productive. Punjab has lost most of its earlier agricultural dynamism. Between 1971-72 and 1985-86, agricultural growth was 5.7% percent compared to the All-India number of 2.3 percent. Since 2005-06, its average agricultural growth has declined to 1.6% compared to Indias 3.5%.One can hazard that Punjabs dynamism will only be restored if it weans itself off its agriculture that has taken a toll of its water resources, soil quality, and human health (refer to cancer district). Its fading dynamism may be in part due to the excessive support that its agriculture receives.Loving Too LittleIf we love some crops too much, perhaps we love many of the others too little. I have in mind here pulses, dairy and livestock, fruits and vegetables, and oilseeds. How do we love them too little? In the case of pulses, commendable efforts have been made to increase procurement at MSP (MSP without procurement, it must be emphasized, offers little comfort for farmers) and this Kharif season there was indeed a substantial increase to 2 million (out of a total output of 8.7 million). Despite this, it is estimated that about 60% of the record Tur output was sold at less than MSP, resulting in depressed income. Stock limits and export restrictions kept market prices low; had they been eased the fortunes of farmers would have been better.I think we misunderstand an important economic insight here that we highlighted in the pulses report. Some of the loving-too-little occurs because of the perception of a tension between farmer and powerful middle-class consumer interests. This leads to a response that creates policy volatility and pro-cyclicality, which increases price uncertainty for farmers: so when prices go up, export restrictions are imposed, and when prices decline, import restrictions are imposed and so on. But this perception and the consequent policy action do not adequately recogonize a fundamental alignment of interests. Lower farmer prices today will adversely affect future agricultural supplies (especially in crops that are predominantly produced domestically such as pulses, fruits and vegetables) which will increase consumer prices tomorrow. So, even over reasonable planning and political horizons, what is good for the farmer is good for the consumer.On fruits and vegetables, restrictions on selling imposed via APMCs are perhaps taking a toll. The government has created an electronic common market and the results are awaited. On dairy and livestock, two points are worth emphasizing. Governments have the right to choose their social policies. But in doing so they must be fully aware of the economic costs of these policies. If social policies impede the workings of the livestock market, the impact on the economics of livestock farming could be considerable. These must be costed for appropriate choices to be made.Second, it must be recognized that the economics of livestock farming, and hence the fate and future of this source of livelihood will depend critically on the terminal value of assets, in this case the no-longer-productive livestock. If social policies drive this terminal value precipitously down, private returns could be affected in a manner that could make livestock farming less profitable (and recent research by Anagol, Etang and Karlan (2013)NBER Working paper No. 19437suggests that returns to livestock farming are in any case very low and even negative) . This declining terminal value arises both because of the loss of income from livestock as meat and the additional costs that will arise from having to maintain unproductive livestock. But there is more. It is possible that social policies could affect social returns even more adversely. Stray cattle, and a lot of it, will have to be looked after, otherwise diseases (foot and mouth) could spread, leading to health hazards and social costs.(Let me add as an aside that responding to changing consumer preference for proteins, which Indians under-consume to the detriment of their health, needs both reduced cereal-centricity, and at the same time promotingnot hindering alternative sources of protein from pulses, dairy and livestock). Finally, there is technology that again is especially important for pulses, oil seeds and dairy. Harish Damodaran of the Indian Express has written persuasively about the choices we face on GM. To paraphrase him, it seems that the patronization of farmers masquerading as romanticization is rife.This must be addressed rationally even beyond mustard. If we want farmers to benefit from new technology we must allow them these benefits regardless of the provenance of the technologies just as we do in other sectors. Expropriating property rights retroactively and undermining sanctity of contracts as sought by voices on opposing ends of the ideological spectrum could impede the flow of technology and thus end up hurting not helping farmers. To be sure, we must absolutely ensure that there is no abuse of patent rights or other monopolistic practices but the right instruments must be chosen; moreover, there must always be an underlying cost-benefit analysis but an analysis as farmers themselves would do it rather than as how the analysis might be done for them.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"
5a0528389855b76bf13bfeb0,Need to conserve mustard diversity,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/616048/need-conserve-mustard-diversity.html,2017-06-08,"Shalini Bhutani, Jun 8 2017, 0:22 ISTThere have been a flood of media reports about the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) under the Environment Ministry having recommended the release of genetically modified (GM) mustard developed by the Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants (CGMCP), University of Delhi.At the centre of the news is the GEACs decision and the GEAC itself. But there is another regulatory authority in the ministry itself, which can be its voice of conscience.Miles away from the ministry headquarters of Paryavaran Bhawan in New Delhi, the Chennai-based National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) seems as distant from Delhi as its office is. The NBA was set up in 2003 under the Biological Diversity Act, 2002 to implement the same.It is an autonomous body meant to be like an amicus curiae to the ministry. The NBA is tasked with giving advice to the ministry on matters related to biodiversity. If the NBA does choose to do what it is meant to do, these are some key issues in the context of GM crops it must consider.NBA competence: The Authority is a body with competence on the subject of GM crops. The membership of the NBA comprises ex officio representatives from the Government of India departments that among others, deal with biotechnology, science and technology. The NBA has the responsibility to look into the impact of the application of modern biotechnology on biodiversity.A critical aspect of risk analysis in such matters is risk communication. Unless the NBA, tasked with conservation, is fully cognisant of the matter, and it makes the state level biodiversity boards (SBBs) and local-level biodiversity management committees (BMCs) aware of the issue too, they cannot carry out their conservation responsibilities under the biodiversity regulatory regime.The NBA can rightfully ask for the full communication on GM mustard made by the GEAC to the environment minister and thereafter make that available to the SBBs and BMCs, particularly in the states in which mustard is grown.Duties of the government: Section 36(4)(ii) of the BD Act makes it a legal duty of the central government to regulate, manage or control the risks associated with the use and release of living modified organisms resulting from biotechnology likely to have adverse impact on the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and human health.The present is a fit situation for the NBA to invoke this particular provision of the law. The GM mustard is an LMO (living modified organism)  a live seed, from which gene flow cannot physically be controlled once grown in the open environment. Thus, adherence to the precautionary principle is warranted.The NBA should insist on the minister to apply the precautionary principle in this matter and encourage the available local alternatives to GM mustard.Expert committee: The NBA has a 21-member expert committee (EC) on agro biodiversity. The committee has a duty to conserve mustard diversity in the country. Given its mandate, the panel has a critical role to play in aiding the ministry on how to proceed with the subject from the point of view of agro biodiversity.Unless the NBA keeps track of the state of biodiversity in our fields, there is no baseline from which to compare and measure the extent of damage from GM crops to pin liability if things go wrong.The NBA must call for an urgent meeting of this EC to consider the recommendations of the GEAC and their implications on agro biodiversity. The expert opinion of the EC on this issue may also be put up on the NBA website, as minutes of EC meetings are not publicly accessible.Documented agro biodiversity: The NBA has been encouraging SBBs to undertake documentation of local biodiversity across India through BMCs. The key function of BMCs has been reduced to the making of peoples biodiversity registers (PBRs) to list out local seeds, breeds, etc.As per NBAs own statistics, 2,485 PBRs have been prepared up to September 2015. These registers bear testament to Indias agro biodiversity. They are several farmers varieties of Indian mustard documented in the PBRs.Existing local varieties of mustard should not remain as mere entries in a register while they are made to go out of use in our farms. In fact, it is this documented crop diversity that has to be kept alive. Agro biodiversity is our only insurance as climatic and other challenges confront our food and farm systems.The NBA ought to direct the SBBs to collate information on local mustard varieties from the PBRs made in their states and make it known to the environment minister as evidence of the existing crop diversity that both needs to be promoted as well as protected from GM mustard."

It also has an incremental effect on farming with lesser number of farmers opting to cultivate these varieties leading to environmental ramifications.To conserve the rich biodiversity of food grains and vegetables of the state, the Madhya Pradesh State Biodiversity Board in collaboration with agriculture department has launched a "" Madhya Pradesh Beej Bachao: Krishi Bachao Yatra"" from May 2 to June 27. The 55-day 'yatra' set to cover 35 districts will culminate in Bhopal after which a conservation plan will be finalized.MP is agriculturally well endowed state with production of wheat, paddy, soyabean as well as coarse grains like kodu, kutki among others. A survey in 1980 by R K Richharia, eminent rice scientist, stated the state had 23,800 species of paddy. The same survey stated that the paddy species in Seoni district numbered at 570. However, another survey by the MP forest department in 2003 found out that only 110 species of paddy were left remaining in Seoni district. In a matter of 23 years, 460 species  81 %  had vanished.""The Beej Yatra is an attempt to survey the traditional species still present in the state, to identify those cultivating them and to spread awareness about the need to conserve indigenous species. Once the survey is complete, conservation steps will be initiated,"" said R Sreenivas Murthy, member secretary, MP State Biodiversity Board.""The 35 districts were chosen based on a criteria. The group A districts are those where the traditional species are still grown like Mandla, Dindori, Anoopur, Seoni, the group B covers those districts where even though less the farming of traditional species is yet to die down like Satna, Rewa, Panna, Sheopur,"" added Murthy.Six resource persons  Babulal Dahiya, Jagdish Rawat, Shailesh Singh, Ram Lotan Kushwaha, Anil Karn, Neelesh Kapoor  are covering the distance in order to survey the indigenous species of foodgrains and vegetables.Babulal Dahiya of Pithorabad village of Satna district has been involved in conserving and developing around 100 odd indigenous species of paddy for a decade now. Dahiya says this attempt is not only to save the traditional species of the state but also the dying rivers  thereby conserving the biological diversity.""All the rivers in the state are rain-fed. The agriculture of MP was largely dependent on monsoon. The high-yielding variety (HYV) of seeds needs a robust irrigation system and chemical fertilizers to sustain them. Indigenous species over the years have adapted themselves to the soil and monsoon pattern of the state and therefore need less maintenance as compared to the HYV seeds.""""In addition, the chemical constituents of the soil must be altered as per the seed variety, harming the natural composition of the soil.""We have found 70-80 species of paddy which if not conserved will soon vanish. Similarly, we found 7-8 species of wheat. Not commonly found seeds kali tuar, peeli sarso among others. Some farmers of Baiga tribe are cultivating coarse grain variety which will vanish if not conserved,"" added Dahiya.Betul, Chhindwara, Mandla, Dindori: Coarse grainsSeoni, Balaghat, Shahdol, Sidhi, Umaria: Paddy and coarse grainsRewa, Satna, Panna: Paddy, coarse grains and wheatSagar, Chhatarpur and western Madhya Pradesh: wheatBordering Rajasthan: Groundnuts, mustard, coriander, jowar.Bordering Gujarat: Cotton"

5a05ded99855b76bf13c17f3,Gaggan Anand’s retirement plan,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/gaggan-anands-retirement-plan/article18954001.ece,2017-06-10,"Gaggan Anand says what he thinks and does what he wants. When he won his 50 Best Restaurants award this year, he promptly announced his intention to close his eponymous restaurant in 2020. It made the headlines and went viral. Why would the Indian chef, whose Bangkok restaurant topped Asias 50 Best list for three consecutive years and is now at No 7 on the Worlds 50 Best ranking, not want to set up a global Gaggan empire? Especially, when many celebrity chefs are cashing in on their bestsellers. Because I dont want to just become a brand. I have 67 employees to motivate, I make it a point to talk to everyone who comes to dine, and still am criticised that I am not at my restaurant every day, admits AnandThere is also his love for all things Japanese and his decision to open a new restaurant with friend and collaborator, Chef Takeshi Fukuyama. At 39, his move to dodge burnout could also be influenced by mentor Ferran Adria of El Bulli; the ground-breaking Spanish chef closed shop when his Michelin three-star restaurant in Catalonia was still enormously successful. Anand, who interned with him in 2010, has often named Adria (besides his own mother) as his inspiration.1080 days to rememberWith 36 months to go before he shuts his progressive Indian restaurant  about four menus a year, and 25 courses in each menu  he exhorts his team on WhatsApp to create 300 memorable dishes. The former drummer runs a tight ship of chefs from 18 countries, including Serbia, Spain and India. In their glass-walled kitchen that overlooks a private dining room, they work with the synchronised precision of musicians, but with enough back-slapping. It is back-breaking work: the tiny eggplant cookie which is Gaggans take on baingan ka bharta served as the fourth course, sees the vegetable mashed and charred in the tandoor , before being freeze-dried and compressed into cookies, then sandwiched with onion chutney. Coriander Nest and Green Apple involves several hours of shaving both coriander root and apple. Each course is a work of art.Alternative realityWhen I visit, the wait staff announces each course with a flourish  one has mustard wrapped sea bass cooked in cedar wood and charred on the table (Anands take on the Bengali fish paturi ); another is a spicy Chettinad quail served in a cage. It is a heady journey, where culinary and performance art unite, and where the menu (only emoji-filled, the key to what you have eaten comes after you have dined) throws up surprises like goat brain in a waffle or scallop curry cooked and broken down to a cold form. There is beetroot meringue with gooseberry and blue cheese and also mushroom that sits pretty like a bonsai and mango wasabi ice cream with sea urchin. The German couple seated at the next table is full of praise, and I have to agree with them, Anands wizardry with molecular gastronomy, authentic Indian flavours and the Japanese pursuit of perfection makes him deserving of his many awards. The first Michelin guide in Bangkok is due in December, and not surprisingly, he will earn a spot there too.Reinvention is keyAnand is dismissive of the adulation. What you are eating will be stale in five days, when I launch my new menu, he pronounces. Just back from a working holiday in Switzerland and Rome, he is in his trademark black jacket, with its strip of blue. He is bleary-eyed behind his Gentle Monster frames, but has his hair in a Samurai topknot and is ready to brainstorm with his team. The stories about 500 booking requests a day and the three-month waiting list at Gaggan are true, he confirms, which is why he now has a five-person team to handle reservations. Yet, social media is also abuzz over his new projects: Gaa, Raa, Sol, GohGan and a second branch of Meatlicious.Made in BangkokThe last, a steakhouse in partnership with his wife, is a runaway hit. On his Instagram account, there is a bubbling pan of yellow: fish curry at Meatlicious, sold out days in advance, with 12,000 likes and counting. Suhring, another investment, and headed by German twins, Thomas and Mathiass Suhring, has also won its share of awards. The only dark cloud, it appears, is Gaa, a brand new project helmed by his former sous chef, Garima Arora. Initially supposed to be a curry house, Anand says it is now Thai, confusion and neo-Nordic. Clearly, things have soured between the two, and he adds, Every dish at Gaa was a Noma copy. I told them that and it was not taken well. I put my money and name on new talent, but then they think they are rebels.Rockstar chefs from his team will be heading projects such as Wet, a Japanese gastropub, and Sol, a dessert address. With his Serbian sommelier Vladimir Kojic calling the shots, Wet will have at least 30,000 bottles of wine and fried chicken. Yakitori, or Japanese-style grilled skewered chicken, to be specific. A collaboration with Mihara tofu ten, from Fukuoka, will see a Japanese fine-dining restaurant, where tofu is the subject. These projects will bring him the funds to experiment with GohGan, his project with long-time friend Fukuyama (of La Maison de la Nature Goh). Gaggan will reopen in a different format, as Raa, to be run by his current staff. Everybody on the team gets an opportunity. I give them my money, fame, and infrastructure. But they are warned that with fame comes criticism, he concludes.The new menu, 25 courses,is 5,000 baht ++, 2 1/2 hours.6 p.m. to 12 a.m. Reservations on thewebsite.The problem with many Indian restaurants is that there is no innovation. Rich billionaires who want to make money, want to introduce molecular gastronomy in every mall! And if I dont watch it, I will be dancing on reality shows and selling coconut oil. I wont discredit those who do it, but its not for me. That is why I have project JapanThe other sideGaggan wears Onitsuka Tiger shoes, and has 97 pairs already; Zita eyewear; and clothes by Yohji Yamamoto, Sacai, Junya Watanabe and Commes des Garcons.The fan of progressive rock says Gimme Shelter (The Rolling Stones) is his current anthem, then generously offers to buy tickets to a Foo Fighters concert in Bangkok later this month.His T-shirt, Hug me I smell like curry has achieved cult status. Coming up: Dont fork with my curry.He prefers to post selfies with the global community of chefs, rather than the many celebrities who stream into his restaurant, and enjoys cooking for sushi and ramen masters.His year-old daughter Tara has taught him to be more approachable, as many of my chefs are nervous in my presence. She has inspired a childrens menu at Gaggan, to be launched in August.Pop ups include one in Tokyo this week, followed by Singapore and Switzerland. London and New York might have them early next year. And India? Thats always a surprise.After Gaggan"

Spokesperson of Orissa Nari Samaj Karmi Beshra said the GM mustard will kill all traditional and sustainable mustards in the State.She came down heavily on Union Ministers who are supporting national and international corporate houses for obvious reasons. While owners of many corporate houses are moving scot-free with waiver of loans, poor farmers are getting killed by police or committing suicide. The country needs to introspect and the Government should initiate steps to protect the interest of farmers, she said.The agitators demanded that the State government, which banned Bt Brinjal after continuous agitations, should also go against GM mustard if they want the support of farmers as in the past.In fact, Odisha was the first State to ban Bt Brinjal. But unfortunately, the government has not yet taken any initiative to ban GM mustard whereas other states, including Kerala, have already passed resolution against it, Beshra added.Farmers fear that GM mustard has potential adverse impacts on honey bees. This will also impact crop and honey production. As honey is a sunrise industry, mustard is one of the major sources for bee keepers. Bee keeping with mustard cultivation creates a win-win situation by increasing yields by about 20 per cent, even as it supports honey production and additional income for the bee keepers.Besides, mustard is used both as food and medicine in Ayurveda. Mustard seeds and oil are used in various formulations for a variety of treatments. The impact of GM mustard on such uses is unstudied and unclear so far.Later, they met Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout and handed over their demands. They also submitted a memorandum addressed to the Chief Minister."

The partys manifesto took a strong stand against GM foods; ignoring it, the Governments Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC) green-lighted genetically engineered mustard in India. GM mustard is known to be more dangerous than GM cotton (which has caused havoc already) and GM brinjal (which was stopped in the nick of time).Because mustard is used in every household every day in India, its health implications are of special importance to us. GM mustard is an HT (herbicide tolerant) crop. This euphemism means it uses a single herbicide, eventually becoming resistant and necessitating heavy use of chemical herbicide. Such excessive use has been linked to birth defects and childhood cancers. Almost all of Europe has discontinued the GM concept altogether because of health issues.Why then does India welcome these traps? There are three reasons: The vested interests of politicians, over-enthusiasm of civil servants, and the apparent ease with which watchdogs like GEAC can be compromised. Much of this is facilitated by the worlds most powerful lobbying groups, which routinely influence US government policies. (Barack Obama appointed several Monsanto executives in his governments food and agriculture supervisory bodies).These lobbies are no less powerful in India. Remember those horrid, heart-wrenching videos of endosulfan victims in Kasargod areas? They are still therepitiably malformed children and men with bloated body parts. Every time such pathetic pictures of human suffering appeared on television screens, people would ask: Why doesnt the government ban endosulfan? And every time Agriculture Minister Sharad Pawar was confronted with the question, he would say: We need to do more tests to know if endosulfan is harmful. How thick can political skins get?Insensitive politicians are aided and abetted by specialists in the governments planning bodies. Niti Aayog has argued in favour of GM mustard on the ground that the GM technology will substantially increase yield. This is a myth as UN statistics prove. Non-GM users have the highest mustard yieldGermany, France, UK, Poland, Czech Republic. Way down in the table are GM usersUSA, Canada, Australia. Why did Niti Aayog rely on other self-serving statistics? And why did it ignore social and health issues?The bigger tragedy is that we cannot be sure of our watchdogs; under pressure, they become promoters rather than preventers of malpractices. India has for long been a victim of this malaise. In 2009, the Food & Safety Standards Authority of India, our only food regulatory body, saw Pepsi and Coca-Cola officials becoming members of panels to judge various technical matters such as sampling methods, additives and flavourings. With a board comprising representatives of the very companies it was supposed to regulate, what safety standards could FSSAI ensure?Similar manipulations made the GEAC clear GM brinjal in 2009. Monsanto, described by The Guardian of UK as the worlds most hated company, infiltrated the GEAC and also gave various research assignments to field researchers and sundry agricultural scientists in the country. The result was that Monsanto-flavoured research reached the GEAC for Monsanto-flavoured decisions. Activist Kavita Kuruganti publicly charged that the chairman of the Expert Committee appointed to examine the matter was pressurised by the Agriculture Minister, GEAC and the industry to clear GM brinjal. We were saved from it only because an alert minister, Jairam Ramesh, put it safely in Trishanku Swarga.The lobbyists turned smarter this time. They presented GM mustard as the product of a Delhi University teams research. This was followed by another report: The genes that went into the DU mustard were the property of Bayer, a merged part of Monsanto. Three giant corporations, including Monsanto-Bayer, control both the seeds market and the pesticide market globally. Its a win-win situation for them and Swadeshi scientists, too, necessarily work as their foot soldiers.The only thing that can be done about technologies based on chemical pesticides is to eliminate them. Reckless use of pesticides in the cotton region of Punjab ruined a generation of farmers. Their tragedy was dramatised by the cancer train that took afflicted farmers daily from Bhatinda station to Bikaner (where the Acharya Tulsi Cancer Institute was more affordable). Biologist Pushpa Bhargava, appointed by the Supreme Court in 2008 to observe the GEACs functioning, was outraged by the manipulations he saw. Whatever Monsanto said was Gods own word, he said and warned: If BT Brinjal is released, it will be the single largest disaster in the country. Larger still will be the mustard disaster."

So this crop is not going to be beneficial to farmers, said Devinder Sharma, a food and trade policy analyst, adding that the country was fully self-reliant on oil seeds until the import duty was reduced. The seed would qualify only as junk seed and most benefits claimed by the Centre would account for scientific fraud.Commenting on the lack of economic benefits, Paamayan, a farmer and head of Thaalanmai Uzhavar Iyakkam said the procurement of these seeds end up in the hands of just a few commercial bodies and that the small farmers are left out. While the activists ruled out the possibility of economic benefits from GM mustard, they added that the introduction of these crops may have health related drawbacks."

However, the MSP for crops is fixed by the union government.While some other recommendations such as improvement in irrigation facilities come under the state governments domain, others such as the import duty issue is also a union government subject. Ours is a sensitive government and we are open to the proposals of farmers, but the MSP is fixed by the union government, said Prabhulal Saini, the state agriculture minister.Bharatiya Kisan Sangh, an organisation of farmers, has announced a statewide dharna from June 15 if the government does not meet its demands. Other farmer bodies including Kisan Mahapanchayat and All India Kisan Sabha have also warned of major agitation in the coming days. Our agitation will be peaceful. We have written to both the prime minister and the state chief minister, but are yet to get any response, said Kisan Mahapanchayat president Ramlal Jat.The main demands of the farmers are hike in MSP by 50%, pension for farmers aged 60 years or above, loan waiver, hike in milk prices and cash payment for their produce at mandis.Meanwhile, the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Pratapgarh, which borders Madhya Pradesh, is expected to open on Monday after remaining shut for a week. However, farmers have threatened to shut down the mandi and disrupt the supply of vegetables and milk if their demands are not met by June 15. Pratapgarh is 30 km from Mandsaur, where five farmers were killed in the police firing last Tuesday.Farmers in Jodhpur are also upset with the state government as the government agencies have not purchased mustard and groundnut crop at the MSP this season.The Swaminathan Commission report submitted in 2006 states that the major causes of the agrarian crisis are unfinished agenda in land reform, quantity and quality of water, technology fatigue, access and adequacy of institutional credit, and opportunities for assured and remunerative marketing apart from adverse meteorological factors. It has also recommended formulation of a National Food Guarantee Act continuing the useful features of the Food for Work and Employment Guarantee programmes."

PTI photoThe Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council Sunday revised downward tax rates for 66 items including movie tickets of Rs 100 and below, incense sticks, insulin, school bags, computer printers  133 items were considered for review at the sixteenth meeting of the Council. Relief was also given to small and medium enterprises, with the threshold for composition scheme raised to Rs 75 lakh from the earlier decided level of Rs 50 lakh.The composition scheme, with a flat 1 per cent tax rate for traders, 2 per cent for manufacturers and 5 per cent for restaurants with a cut-off of annual turnover of up to Rs 50 lakh, provides for a simpler method of calculating tax liability for registered dealers with turnover below the compounding cut-off to reduce the administration cost associated with collection of tax from small traders. However, those who opt for the scheme will not be eligible for input tax credit.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said the revision in GST rates was considered after receiving several representations from trade and industry.The objective was to maintain equivalence to the existing taxation level and, in some cases, the fitment committees recommendation went beyond the equivalence principle. Because some items have been historically charged at a higher rate but today, in the changed economic concept, the burden requires to be reduced. So, after considering the recommendations, the GST Council has reduced the tax levels in 66 out of 133 cases, he said.There were two objectives behind this. One, we tried to maintain revenue neutrality to the extent possible because this can also mean some loss of revenue but it eases the burden on SMEs and small traders, restaurants. And it also reduces the burden on these three categories because these are mass job creators. So that is why, after detailed discussions, this (threshold for composition scheme) was increased to Rs 75 lakh, he said.On the targeted date for GST rollout, officials said July 1 date stays.Irrespective of the date on which it starts, some people will say they are not ready, so they have no option but to get ready, Jaitley said when he was asked about some traders protesting against the July 1 rollout date.West Bengal Finance Minister Amit Mitra said: July 1 looks extremely difficult. But you cannot be doing jugaad for the worlds largest fiscal reform called GST. Small businesses have to fill up spreadsheets which then has to go through a software process to get uplinked so let us be sure, Mahabharat ashuddh nahi ho jayega if you postpone by one month or so.The tax rate on certain packaged food items like pickles, mustard sauce, murabba, ketchup has been reduced to 12 per cent from the earlier decided 18 per cent, while that on cashew nuts has been cut to 5 per cent from 12 per cent.The GST rate for entertainment has been split into two categories, with movie tickets below Rs 100 now proposed to be taxed at 18 per cent, while those above will continue to be taxed at 28 per cent.The Council also exempted childrens picture, drawing books from 12 per cent proposed earlier, while lowering that for computer printers to 18 per cent from 28 per cent.School bags will attract tax of 18 per cent as against 28 per cent proposed earlier. Tax rate on kajal has been lowered to 18 per cent from 28 per cent. The GST rate on cutlery has been reduced to 12 per cent from 18 per cent, while that for some tractor components, plastic beads and plastic tarpaulins has been cut to 18 per cent from 28 per cent.Also, the tax rate for job work for textiles, diamond processing, leather, jewellery and printing was reduced to 5 per cent from 18 per cent. These are items where job workers typically take the work home, and work on textile or diamond processing or jewellery work. Now the normal GST rate for these services is 18 per cent but because in these sectors the rate itself has been reduced, for job work in these sectors the rate has been fixed at 5 per cent, so that outsourcing through job work in these sectors could be encouraged, Jaitley said.The draft rules for accounts and records were also approved at the meeting. The approved version of the rule has done away with the need for a registered person to provide, on demand, account of the audit trail and interlinkages including source document, record layout and explanation for codes used and total number of records in each field along with sample copies of documents as was proposed earlier.The next meeting of the Council will be on June 18, which will take up lottery taxes and e-way bill and any other issue which may come up, Jaitley said.On the issue of review of GST rate on hybrid cars, a detailed paper will be circulated and, after taking comments from states, it will be taken up by the Council later, if necessary, Jaitley said.For all the latest Business News, download Indian Express App"

Meanwhile, tax rate on kajal was lowered by 10 pc.Yes, it is the representation of Indian culture, hence there must be a reduction, said Rukmini Rao, from Gramya Resource Centre. On the issue of sanitary napkins, she said: It seems like anything to empower girls is not governments concern. Girls in many social welfare hostels are supplied with free sanitary napkins. This move is likely to increase the price, thereby pushing people to purchase cheaper ones which are not made hygienically. She pointed that this can lead to complications for young girls.On the other hand, certain small scale entrepreneurs are rejoicing after the fall in kitchen use items including pickle and mustard sauce.Anuradha Goud, a city-based pickle seller for last 28 years, is happy with the move.

We will come with our families and cattle and cook food there. The agitation will continue until the government agrees to our demands, BKS state general secretary Kailash Gandolia told reporters here.After two years of drought, the farmers reaped a good harvest this year but the government did not purchase many crops such as groundnut, mustard, and moong dal at MSP. We approached the government but it paid no attention. The attitude of the government towards the farmers is not right, Gandolia added.Gandolia said that this year the mustard production in Rajasthan was 37 lakh tonnes but farmers sustained a loss of 2,600 crore as government did not purchase the oil seed at MSP.In March, we held demonstrations in all the districts after which the government assured that it will begin procuring mustard at MSP from April 1. The government, however, kept delaying the procurement process and as a result many farmers committed suicide. When we told state agriculture minister Prabulal Saini about the crash in prices of garlic during his visit to Kota, he said who had asked us to plant so much garlic, he alleged.Unlike the farmers in some other state, the BKS is not demanding loan waiver.THE BKS demands1. Call a special Assembly session to make suitable changes in policies for benefit of farmers2. Purchase the agriculture produce at MSP3. Purchase of crops below MSP should be made a crime4. Implementation of irrigation projects5. Electricity to those whose applications are pending6. Electricity should be provided at flat rates"

India produces sufficient mustard to meet its consumption requirements. The claim that GM mustard will reduce dependence on oil imports is baseless, she told a panel here at Anna University.She further claimed that some of the hybrid varieties of indigenous mustard in India have been shown to give better yield, when compared to what GM mustard could provide.Organised by Poovulagin Nanbargal, an environmental organisation, the panel hosted biologists, medical practitioners and activists, who discussed why allowing commercial cultivation of GM mustard could prove harmful later.One-gene, one-enzymeDr. Sultan Ahmed Ismail, a soil biologist and former Head, Department of Biotechnology, The New College, Chennai, spoke about how GM seeds could alter the amino acid sequences of the original host plant that carried the modified gene, thus producing new effects on its surrounding environment in a manner that couldnt be anticipated.In science, we call it the one-gene, one-enzyme hypothesis. It is the theory that each gene directly produces a single enzyme, which affects an individual step in a metabolic pathway. When the gene is altered, the metabolic process is altered too, changing the nature of the amino acid proteins generated, he said.Potentially carcinogenicHe further said that herbicides sprayed onto the crop to kill weeds were potentially carcinogenic with implications for health and safety of its consumers.Ms. Kuruganti pointed out that GM mustard being a herbicide-tolerant crop  meaning it wouldnt be killed if sprayed with herbicide  had a tendency to store residues of herbicides. This could mean increased exposure to chemicals in food for buyers. Both the BJP and the AIADMK promised in their election manifestos to not let GM crops enter India. They should keep their promises, she said.Dr. Devinder Sharma, a leading commentator on food and agriculture policy, said that the government must share the results of the clinical trial on GM mustard with the people so that they are aware of the potential risks.The panellists warned that allowing commercial cultivation of GM mustard, which has already been approved by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee, under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, could open the doors for other GM crops such as brinjal and corn too.Some hybrid varieties of indigenous mustard give better yieldKavitha KurugantiActivist"

The scheme was introduced for small businesses that would struggle to comply with the various requirements of GST.Those opting for the scheme will have to pay tax at the rate of 1% for the trading community, 2% for those engaged in manufacturing, and 5% for restaurants, Mr. Jaitley said.There are two objectives behind this move, he said. The first is to maintain revenue neutrality, and this also eases the burden on SMEs and small businesses in trading, manufacturing, and the restaurant business because they are mass job creators.This should mean that a significant number of SME sector players should benefit from not having to meet with detailed compliances under GST and also having a less financial burden, on account of GST, Mahesh Jaising, Partner, Indirect Tax, BMR & Associates said.Complete list soonWe have received 133 representations asking us to reconsider rates, and we have revised downwards the rates on 66 items, the Finance Minister said, adding that the complete list would be released soon. It has also been decided that for cinema tickets costing Rs. 100 or less, the tax rate will be reduced to 18%, and for tickets costing above Rs. 100, it will remain at 28%, Mr. Jaitley said.

It has recorded one alleged use of chemical weapons by the group in Syria this year, as opposed to 13 allegations in the previous six months. All other recorded allegations of IS using chemical agents in 2017 have been in Iraq  nine of them inside Mosul and one in Diyala province, it said.""The operation to isolate and recapture the Iraqi city of Mosul coincides with a massive reduction in Islamic State chemical weapons use in Syria,"" said Columb Strack, senior Middle East analyst at IHS Markit.""This suggests that the group has not established any further chemical weapons production sites outside Mosul, although it is likely that some specialists were evacuated to Syria and retain the expertise.""IS has lost more than half the territory it once controlled in Iraq. It's now fighting to defend a cluster of western neighborhoods in Mosul, Iraq's second-largest city. Mosul is the last major urban area held by the group in Iraq, and is believed to be at the heart of its efforts to produce chemical weapons.IHS Markit says the militant group has been accused of using chemical weapons at least 71 times since July 2014 in Iraq and Syria. Most of these involved either the use of chlorine or sulfur mustard agents, delivered with mortars, rockets and IEDs.The report released Tuesday says the continuing chemical weapons attacks in Mosul most likely draw on remaining stockpiles in the city.It warned, however, that the extremist group likely retains the capability to produce small batches of low quality chlorine and sulfur mustard agents elsewhere. It could use such agents to enhance the psychological impact of suicide car bombings in urban areas or in terrorist attacks abroad."

(Source: Bharat Sundaresan) In the predominantly Bangladeshi suburb of Brick Lane, London, most Indian food-joint owners will wear their Bangla hearts on their sleeves on Thursday. (Source: Bharat Sundaresan)BANGLADESH WILL win, Bangladesh will win. If Tamim scores a ton, India is finished, Shafayat Rahman starts declaring as soon as he realizes where youre from.Rahman, like 80,000 other Bangladeshis who live on or alongside Brick Lane, moved here from Sylhet. And like most of them, hes a cricket nut and very confident about the result in the second Champions Trophy semi-final on Thursday.Shafayat manages Preem Restaurant, one of the dozen or so curry houses on the narrow street, and plays club cricket for his Borough over the weekends. He will be working while the match is on, but insists that he will be live streaming the game on his phone because as he says, how can I miss the biggest match in Bangladesh history. He then grudgingly reveals that hundreds of more fortunate fans from Brick Lane will, however, be travelling to Birmingham to see the biggest match of their lives in person. The rest will, like Shafayat, be using their own tactics to catch the action.Unlike Shafayat, Islamuddin was born right here and has spent all his life on Brick Lane. He is an oddity of sorts and doesnt really follow cricket unless when Bangladesh is playing. And he too doesnt give India much of a chance at Edgbaston.He can name only a handful of players in his team, but is desperate for Bangladesh to win. Its a matter of pride. Indians have underestimated us for long enough, despite us being of the same skin-colour. If they win, we can walk around with our chests puffed out and tell them that we are equal, he says.Its a thought that seems to resonate around what is popularly known as Banglatown-even the signboard outside the local metropolitan police station refers to the area as that. This sense of retribution, to finally show the big bullies, who have always kept them at arms length on and off the cricket field, their place.Brick Lane is situated in the East End of London right next to Whitechapel, which till the early part of the 20th century used to be one of the most impoverished and downtrodden areas of the capital, with a massive population of immigrants and a very high crime-rate. Its Whitechapel that witnessed the notorious Jack the Ripper murders but Islamuddin recalls that death was very much a part of everyday life even while he was growing up.A complete takeoverI grew up running through these streets, and was used to seeing people being killed and random dead bodies around. This used to be a rough neighbourhood till recently when it got more cosmopolitan, he says. The Bangladeshis started settling here right after the war of independence, and many like Islamuddins father just broke into houses abandoned by Jewish immigrants over the years and started occupying them. The Bangaldeshi population kept burgeoning rather rapidly and before long the London city council was forced to recognize it officially as Banglatown. To the extent that some 15 years ago they added street-signs in Bengali below the traditional English ones.You are welcomed to Brick Lane by the sounds of Bengali and the smell of mustard-oil and the distinct gondhoraj lebu. The lamp-posts are all painted in the colours of the Bangladeshi flag, green and red. Just a 10-minute walk away is Shoreditch High Road, known for its hipster culture and loads of chic and retro cafes and bars and even the odd Jamaican braai shop. But on Brick Lane, you are transported to the streets of Dhaka, Mirpur to be precise with shinghadas being sold alongside fish and mutton chops. Strangely you also find a dosa shop in one of the narrow lanes, which not surprisingly is empty on the weekday evening.Back in the day, Brick Lane would play host to the members of the Bangladeshi team on a regular basis. These days security regulations have limited these visits. Both Misbah and Shafayat recall having spotted fast bowlers Taksin Ahmed and Rubel Hossain at Nazrul Restaurant, which calls itself the oldest curry house on Brick Lane.It was established in 1971, the year of Bangladeshs liberation. And owner Romz Shehel is already planning a celebration for when Bangladesh beat India. He recalls the rowdy scenes that followed Bangladeshs shock win over Pakistan in the 1999 World Cup and how there was no space for cars to pass with people crowding Brick Lane with flags and bugles. He expects the scenes to be played out similarly, and is already looking for tickets for the final at the Oval. For him, the Champions Trophy semifinal is more than even a victory on the field, its about helping his country create its own identity, even if only on Brick Lane alone.We have been synonymous only with Balti shops, selling so-called authentic Indian food. A win against them on Thursday will give us the individual identity that weve always sought, says Shehel.For all the latest Sports News, download Indian Express App"

The farmers have been warning the state government of an agitation since April but the government has failed to respond so far.On June 6, five farmers were allegedly killed in police firing in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur district during a protest.While the state government has cancelled leaves of all police personnel, sources said that it is also in touch with RSS leaders in a bid to put pressure on the RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) to call off its sit-in agitation from Thursday. However, a state RSS leader, who did not want to be named, told HT that theres no question of intervention at this stage. We would like to keep distant from both BKS and the BJP government on this issue. It is BKS right to raise farmers issues and we cannot stop them from doing so, he said.Rajasthan Congress, which has openly come out in support of the farmers, will be launching a statewide protest on Wednesday. State Congress president Sachin Pilot attacked the state government claiming that farmers suicide is on the rise and lakhs of farmers in Rajasthan are yet to get compensation for unseasonal rains and hailstorms that struck three years ago.While state agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini has tried to pass the buck by saying that minimum support price (MSP) of the crop is fixed by the Centre, Congress has rejected the argument and pointed out that farmers have not got even the MSP for many crops, including groundnut and mustard.The state government on Monday announced the purchase of 10,000 metric tonne of garlic at 3,200 per quintal as damage control but its mum on other demands of the farmers.No minister or government representative has invited us for talks, BKS state general secretary Kailash Gandolia told HT.BKS has said that their demonstration would be peaceful but the farmers body has also warned the government that if any anti-social elements join the agitation and resort to violence, it will then be the sole responsibility of the state government.Meanwhile, state home minister Gulabchand Kataria chaired a high-level meet on Tuesday to review security arrangements in the wake of farmers agitation. Sources in the home ministry said they dont anticipate any trouble from BKS but dont rule out the possibility of anti-social elements taking advantage of the situation to foment trouble."

He said the farmers in the State had suffered a loss of Rs. 2,600 crore because of the governments failure to procure mustard at minimum support price.Special sessionThe BKS has demanded that a special session of the Assembly be convened to discuss the difficulties being faced by farmers and immediate orders issued to procure farm produce at MSP.Mr. Gandolia said the younger generation of farmers was giving up agriculture because of the governments indifferent attitude.The Opposition Congress has announced State-wide demonstrations in support of farmers demands on June 14. In view of the CPI(M)-backed All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) meeting in the Shekhawati region, the Congress plans to hold a massive farmers rally at Krishi Upaj Mandi in Sikar two days before that.A delegation of the AIKS will visit Mandsaur and Pipliya Mandi in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday to meet the families of farmers killed in the police firing.AIKS president and former CPI(M) MLA Amra Ram and former MP Hannan Mollah will lead the delegation and take stock of the situation.AIKS joint secretary Sanjay Madhav said the meeting in Sikar on June 16 would highlight the plight of farmers and agricultural workers."

Though such promotional offers are generally announced during the Diwali festive season, some retailers have announced discounts to clear inventories due to the cost and process associated with making old stocks compliant with the new indirect tax regime. The discounts come despite the GST Council increasing input tax credit to 60 per cent from 40 per cent on stocks lying unsold up to June 30.Besides that, under the incoming GST tax structure, prices of some household consumer goods such as televisions, air conditioners and refrigerators may go up as they fall in the 28 per cent tax slab of 28 per cent. Higher prices could hurt demand initially after the GST rollout.Meanwhile, leading retailers including Future Group, D-Mart and Aditya Birla Retail discussed in Mumbai on Tuesday issues related to GST, including pricing and margins. Over 12 top retailers met under the aegis of Retailers Association of India (RAI), which intends to approach the government on key areas like including GST as a component in the product price to avoid confusion, and clarification of taxation on packaged commodities.""The dealers also have to do a compliance under GST transitional provisions for the stock left on 30th June for claiming credit of duties and taxes paid on stock as on that date. To some, this could be a tedious and time-consuming exercise, hence they are minimising the stock,"" said Sandeep Sehgal, director tax and regulatory at Ashok Maheshwary & Associates LLP.The retailers also expressed concern about a 5 per cent tax levied on packaged goods that causes a discrepancy as loosely sold commodities are not taxed.""Ideally, taxes should not cause price increase. They should not create variations that adversely affect consumers,"" Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani said.Online retail giants Flipkart and Amazon have slashed prices in segments ranging from garments, home appliances, mobile accessories, watches, leather products and health and beauty products.Paytm Mall, a unit of digital payments platform Paytm, has also launched a clearance sale, in which its merchants or authorised retailers are offering discounts and cashbacks on many items including TVs, laptops, phones, ACs and refrigerators. ""This sale has come at an opportune time for offline retailers who are looking to offload their entire inventory before the new tax rates become effective,"" Paytm said.Meanwhile, the GST Council last week lowered tax rates for 66 items, placing products such as cutlery, pickles, ketchup, mustard sauce and toppings at a lower tax slab of 12 per cent compared with 18 per cent earlier.(With inputs from PTI)"

Since both my parents were teachers and would often be busy with work, I would cook basic dishes like khichdi and burji for myself. My love for food turned into my passion when I moved to Delhi for my higher studies. I had to cook for myself and that is when I started to explore. I was exposed to a lot of fresh ingredients and spices as I stayed very close to Azadpur Mandi, which was one of the largest vegetable markets.I decided to pursue a career in food and in 2003, I joined the Institute of Hotel Management, Bhubaneswar. It was a completely new experience for me. A new city, new cuisine and dishes like ghugni (snack), dalma (rice), and chhena poda (sweet) were all completely different from what I was used to in Delhi.I was 18 when I entered the industry and I worked with The Oberoi, Kolkata.There again I came across a completely new and different burst of flavours and dishes like rasgullas, sandesh (sweet), jalebis, kala jamun and much more. From Kolkata, I went straight to Kerala, in 2010 for a year, where I fell in love spices like the black pepper, cinnamon, mace, etc. We got fresh fish right out of the water. We were also part of an Ayurveda camp, wherein we had to cook food according to the prescriptions given by doctors for guests who were on medication. I also learnt to make sadhya, (means a feast), karimeen polichathu and Kerala sambar.In 2011, I went to the US and worked at the Steakhouse. There I learnt the fine tuning of steaks with expensive meat products. I also got the opportunity to work for the Carnival Cruise Lines. I travelled to different parts of Mexico, South America and Europe, where I got my hands on the best tomatoes, wines and cheese. I have been with Marriot Chennai since May 2017.I am so glad to have got such wonderful opportunities to travel to different places and explore so much of food, because it has really helped me grow as a chef. I have noticed that Chennai has a mixed set of cuisines, like Udipi, Chettinad, Andhra and so on.I am yet to master South Indian cuisine, but I am quite confident about the North Indian cuisine. Butter chicken, mutton rogan josh, chole, rajma chawal and karimeen pollichathu are some of my best dishes.Meen PollichathuIngredientsCleaned fish steaks/filet: 20 pieces, 1 kg (measured after cleaning)Turmeric powder: 10 gmPepper powder: 20 gmSmall onion: 200 gmCrushed ginger: 50 gmCrushed garlic: 50 gmGreen chilli: 20 gmChilli powder: 50 gmCoriander powder:50 gmTomato: 200 gmCoconut milk powder: 20 gmSalt: 20 gmCurry leaves: 5 gmCoconut oil: 30 mlBanana leaf: 1 bigMethodMake gashes on both sides of the cleaned fish.

PTIBihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar on Friday held a meeting with farmers representatives from across the state before announcing an agriculture roadmap for 2017-22. Speaking after the meeting, Nitish reiterated his reservations against Genetically Modified mustard. GM seeds would be dangerous for farmers. I have already taken up the matter with the Centre, he said.The state government received 534 suggestions on agriculture, 75 on animal husbandry, 25 each on fishery, cooperative and forest and environment, and 15 on sugarcane. Sunil Kumar, a farmer from Kaimur, listed the problems of the agriculture department before Nitish. Let me speak the truth. I am not an opponent of the CM but must tell him about the ground realities, he said.Several other farmers complained that subsidy and grants had not been reaching them due to a lack of proper survey to identify real beneficiaries. Following the meeting, the CM and his cabinet colleagues sat on the ground to eat with the farmers. The farmers were served puri, pulao, pulses and three vegetable dishes.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

And this time, it is from farmers of a body backed by the RSS, the BJP's ideological mentor. The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh on Thursday started indefinite protests across the state including a sit-in right in the heart of the capital Jaipur with a long list of demands including a loan waiver.The move was triggered by the Vasundhara Raje Scindia government's refusal to buy mustard at a minimum support price (MSP), or a floor price. Prices of mustard in Rajasthan, the country's largest producer of mustard, plunged after a bumper crop.This forced farmers to sell their harvest cheap to private players. It is estimated that the farmers would have got around Rs 37 for every kg if the government had procured mustard. Instead, farmers are forced to sell the oilseeds about 30 per cent cheaper, for about Rs 26 to 28 a kg.Kailash Gandoliya of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh insists that their protests had nothing to do with politics, the Congress or the ruling BJP.""For two years, we have been facing drought. Now that we have a good mustard crop, the rates went below the minimum support price. We asked the government to buy at the support price but they did not pick up a single quintal,"" he said.The RSS' farmers' body also wants a special session of the assembly to discuss the agricultural distress and implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report set up by the Centre that said farmers should get a return of at least 1.5 times over their investment.But farmers say they weren't even able to recover their investments.Phool Chand Verma is one of them; he has an outstanding farm loan of Rs 1.2 lakh that he had taken for his 3-hectare plot of land. For every kilogramme of onion that he produced this season, Mr Verma told NDTV, he had invested Rs 6. ""But in the mandi (farm produce markets), I am getting Rs 2 a kilo,"" says Phool Chand.The farmers are demanding a loan waiver but insist that the government should take long-term measures to pull them out of agricultural distress for good. It is estimated that the number of people engaged in farming in Rajasthan has shrunk by 30 per cent over the last two decades.""Loan waivers are not a solution. For how many years will the government waive loans? Actually the government should assure a good rate for farm produce so that we can make a profit. That is the only way to stop farmers from getting poorer each year,"" said Kamli Khan, a farmer from Sikar 100 km from the state capital said.With the Sangh affiliate joining the protests, the state government is worried.Agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini said the government would look into the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh's demands. ""They are part of our family... Whatever can be resolved at the level of the state government, we will address,"" he said.But it isn't going to be easy. In the last four years, the government says it given 53,000 crores in interest free loans. If it were to buy mustard at the floor price, it would have needed 500 crores more."

How can GEAC clear trials in which the recommendation of the GEAC itself were not followed on using the checks to compare the productivity of existing hybrids with the new GM hybrid,"" asked Pawar.According to him, the claim of 28% higher yield over 'Varuna' (not a national check now) is absurd. ""The seed size of the mustard is also very small. And, surprisingly, the new GM is being cleared when the country has excess production of mustard in states like Rajasthan where last year 25 lakh ton of seed from last year is till lying,"" said Pawar.The scientist strongly repeated the claim of the Nagpur University (NU) on one of the parents of the DMH-11, EH-2 (Early Heera) which was used in developing the hybrid. ""Pental has not given any credit to NU,"" said Pawar.Another big fault with the DMH-11 hybrid, according to Pawar, is that the Barnase-Barstar system in seed production programme in the research needs herbicide ""glufosinate ammonium' or Basta which is under the patent regime by Bayer, the German multinational.The use of this herbicide tolerant technology in crops will lead to development of super weeds which will be difficult to control. ""This herbicide is only allowed in tea gardens and not for commercial crops due to its bad effects,"" he said.The other scientists who were present with Pawar at the conference were former PDKV vice chancellor Sharad Nimbalkar, retired scientists Ramesh Thakre and M S Kairon, former director of Central Institute for Cotton Research Dilip Mohitkar, president Agrovet-Agro-engineering Mitra Pariwar which hosted the press conference, Milind Raut and Pranay Parate also from the Pariwar, K B Wanjari, associate dean at PDKV, N D Raut, former professor at JNKVV at Jabalpur."

While some stand by traditional cooking oils like coconut oil and mustard oil, there are others who vouch for newer variants like rice bran oil, canola oil and the like. In this battle of cooking oils, coconut oil has long held a strong hold of being good for health. It is one of the most commonly used oils in India, particularly South India, having a variety of purposes - from cooking to beauty needs, improving digestion, boosting immunity, facilitating weight loss, promoting healthy hair and skin, and maintaining heart health. But recent studies suggest that it may actually be worse than butter.According to a report, Dietary Fats Cardiovascular Disease: A Presidential Advisory from the American Heart Association, coconut oil consumption is worse than having butter and other sources of saturated fats. Saturated fat consumption has long been tied to the rising incident of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). ""Clinical trials that used polyunsaturated fat to replace saturated fat reduced the incidence of CVD. The main sources of saturated fat to be decreased are dairy fat (butter), lard (pork), palm oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil,"" noted AHA.As per the table given above, coconut oil consists of close to 80% of saturated fat, quite high when compared to other ingredients such as lard, peanut butter, pork among others. A diet high in saturated fat is one of the biggest perpetrators of cardiovascular ailments and high cholesterol. Experts suggest switching to unsaturated vegetable oils for better health.""A recent systematic review found 7 controlled trials, including the 2 just mentioned, that compared coconut oil with monounsaturated or polyunsaturated oils. Coconut oil raised LDL cholesterol in all 7 of these trials, significantly in 6 of them. Clinical trials that compared direct effects on CVD of coconut oil and other dietary oils have not been reported. However, because coconut oil increases LDL cholesterol, a cause of CVD, and has no known offsetting favorable effects, we advise against the use of coconut oil,"" noted the AHA research."

Ministers of 18 departments concerned and their principal secretaries were also present. The proposed road map is aimed at increasing the income of farmers.The CM said he had already held discussions with officials regarding payment of input cost as demanded by farmers. A decision will be taken soon, he said and added the government would prepare a list of farmers for the purpose.The input cost is proposed to be paid in proportion to the land used by farmers for cultivation in a particular cropping season. The beneficiaries will include the landowners, sharecroppers or lessees who cultivate land, said the CM.Referring to farmers' agitations in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and other states, the Bihar CM said bank loans were not the farmers' biggest problem as not all farmers took loans. Their biggest problem is poor MSP (minimum support price) fixed by the Centre for various crops.""A crop's MSP should be calculated by adding 50% profit to the cost of production, as suggested by the National Commission on Farmers headed by Prof M S Swaminathan,"" Nitish said.The Centre has cut allotments on agriculture schemes, the Bihar CM said and rued that though the Centre drums about PM Agriculture Crop Insurance Scheme, the scheme helps only the insurance companies.In Bihar in 2016, for instance, the CM said insurance company was paid Rs 1,119.99 crore (Rs 494 crore each paid by the Centre and state and Rs 130 crore by farmers) as premium, but the compensation paid to farmers was only Rs 347 crore. ""The figures are more or less the same in all the states,"" he said, adding he would not like to react to the statements of 'bayaan bahadurs' (read central ministers and state BJP leaders).He also appealed to farmers to resist the MNCs' bid to introduce genetically modified seeds for maize, mustard and brinjal with the Centre's nod."

He is convinced that it is his old city (forget the fact that he has not lived there for decades) which has the best Muslim cuisine in India. Well, its true that Delhis food is called Lashkhari, that is, it the food that was eaten by soldiers. I am all for it, and can happily feast on Dillis kababs and nihari. But I must admit that my Hyderabadi friend has a point. That the cuisine has been enriched by the royal family of Hyderabad  the Nizams  is an undisputable fact.In fact, the biryani that I love the most is the kuchchey gosht ki biryani from Hyderabad. Long years ago, another friend who grew up in Hyderabad would make it a point to come back to Delhi with tubs of biryani from his home city every time he went on a visit there. And we would devour it in silence, and thank him profusely  but only after wed eaten every morsel, for we raced to see who could eat the most at the shortest possible time.I was reminded of that glorious biryani some days ago when a friend at ITC Maurya invited me to a royal festival that the hotel has been organising. Every Friday, Saturday and Sunday, there is a banquet at The Pavilion celebrating the food of a former royal family  of Sailana and Hyderabad (which are over), Akheraj (June 16-18), Kangra (June 23-25), Kashmir (June 30-July 2), Rampur (July 7-9) and Bhainsrogarh (July 14-15).Heart of malai!I enjoy the food of Kangra, though, after spending several weeks there, way back in the eighties, I must admit I got a bit tired of the khatti dal that I ate every day and everywhere. I have had great encounters with Kashmiri, Rampuri and Sailana royal food. I recall eating a kabab cooked with the guler fruit and a shikampuri kabab, with a heart of malai (instead of hung curd), prepared by the Sailana scion in Delhi some years ago. The taar korma of Rampur is an eternal favourite, and I enjoy everything Kashmiri from the gushtaba to the rishta.But I think my favourite is still the food of Hyderabad. The Salar Jung festival at the hotel included some of the best known Hyderabadi dishes  including kachchey goshti ki biryani and hari mirch murgh masala. The biryani was the way I like it, fragrant rice, perfectly spiced and with deliciously tender pieces of meat. In this style of cooking, the juices of the meat get infused in the rice, and I suppose that is why I enjoy it so much.The chicken dish was excellent, sharp in taste and pleasant to look at, thanks to the green chillies, and a taste of tamarind and mustard. There was a paneer timatari  cooked in a nicely tart tomato curry. What I also enjoyed was the arbi kalimirch  a dry dish of arbi that had been in coated with carom seeds and black pepper.Surprisingly, the dish that didnt appeal to me was the jafrani machli, cooked in yoghurt and an almond paste. I found the gravy too thick, and the fish itself much too bland.I think the festival should have included the royal food of Bhopal. I find their rezala, mildly green in colour because of the use of coriander and mint leaves deliciously different. Theres a school of thought (based in Bhopal, of course), which believes that the royal food of Bhopal is particularly good because unlike elsewhere, begums were the rulers there.But I am not getting into this war of whose royal food is the best.

The panel is examining the issue of GM crops and its impact on environment and is learnt to have called for samples of the crop developed by the Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR).EVEN AS the controversy over GM Mustard rages on, another row is in the offing over genetically modified (GM) crop version of jowar  or sorghum, said to be the poor mans food in India  as some members of a Parliamentary committee is learnt to have taken strong note of it.The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Science and Technology, Environment and Forests, headed by Congress leader Renuka Chowdhury, has decided to seek clarifications from Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh, and also ask the National Institute of Nutrition (NIN) to do a comparative analysis of the nutritional values of GM and non-GM sorghum.The panel is examining the issue of GM crops and its impact on environment and is learnt to have called for samples of the crop developed by the Hyderabad-based Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR).The committee is likely to send the samples to NIN. The panel will ask NIN to make a comparative study of nutritional values of GM Sorghum and conventional sorghum. We are keen to know what was the need to develop a genetically modified version of sorghum, which is the poor mans food, a source with knowledge of developments in the standing committee said. Sorghum yield was already not fetching a good market price and was more than enough to meet the demand. So why was it (GM Sorghum) required?The source said the committee wants to know whether there is a plan to introduce GM Sorghum in ration shops under the Public Distribution System. There are several apprehensions. The panel will examine it thoroughly, according to a source in the committee.The panel will also look into issues such as expenditure incurred on research for GM Sorghum and seek the Agriculture Ministers views on it. How was money from the public exchequer spent on GM Sorghum research even before any forward-backward linkage planning was done, an Opposition member in the panel asked.The IIMR had begun research on transgenic jowar around four years ago, and has now developed Bt Sorghum, which is bigger in size and ostensibly has greater pest resistance. Activists contend that the Central government should not allow consumption of genetically modified jowar by either humans or animals. They argue that since jowar is largely consumed by the poor, any ill-effect of the GM variety will impact more people, and especially those without much access to preventive medicare.The Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) has already given its clearance to GM Mustard and recommended approval for its commercial cultivation to the Environment Ministry. But the decision has met stiff resistance from a large number of social activists and farmers organisations, including RSS-affiliated ones such as the Swadeshi Jagran Manch and the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh.The only genetically modified crop that is under cultivation in India is Bt Cotton, which is grown over 10.8 million hectares. Under the UPA government, the Environment Ministry headed by Jairam Ramesh had disallowed a proposal to allow cultivation of Bt Brinjal, a transgenic variety of brinjal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This is also to communicate that we would like to be part of such meaningful consultations, said Sridhar Radhakrishnan, who is the co-convenor of Coalition for a GM-Free India in a letter to Vardhan.Coalition for a GM-Free India is an informal network of experts and hundreds of farmers, consumers, environmental and womens organisations campaigning for a GM-free India.The group also asked the environment minister to, get state government views and independent experts analyses of full biosafety data before taking a final decision.The controversy is about GM mustard which crop which has been developed by Delhi Universitys Centre for Genetic Manipulation of Crop Plants. On 11th May, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) of the environment ministry recommended approval for commercial production of GM mustard and now it awaits final decision of the environment ministry.Indias first GM food crop if approvedRight now only GM cotton is allowed in India but if Dr Harsh Vardhan clears the proposal for GM mustards production it would become Indias first GM food crop.

It's just not milk or cooking oil, prized spices too are heavily adulterated, according to officials of National Institute of Nutrition ""Many times, papaya seeds are grounded and mixed with synthetic gum to make it seem like black-pepper.This happens as pepper is costly and mixing them with papaya seeds makes it cheaper for miscreants,"" Dr V Sudarshan Rao, a scientist from the Food Safety Division of NIN , told TOI.Following black pepper, the next most adulterated food item is fennel, which is mixed with sodium hydrosulphite. ""This is then blended with sawdust and brick dust and sold in the market as masala powder,"" said an official from Nutrition Society of India.Not just food meant for daily consumption, even cold drinks and ice-creams are mixed with high quantities of glycerol monostearate, an emulsifying agent, which is meant to be used in moderate amounts as prescribed by Food Standards and Safety Authority of India (FSSAI).""People are not aware that in current times, everything we eat could be adulterated. Earlier, the practice was limited to mixing rice with stones to fudge weight. Now, it has become modern with miscreants using chemicals. Even mustard oil is sold by mixing it with a low-grade oil. There's no mechanism in place to curb this menace,"" said Dr B Sesikiran, director of NSI ""While the food regulator has to monitor, check and penalize people who adulterate food, nothing moves on the ground. Till punishment is harsh, you cannot expect to have safe food,"" he said.TIMES VIEW:While its a welcome move that cops have finally launched a sustained crackdown against adulteration of spices and other food items in the city, efforts must be made to ensure that these traders do not get back to their old practice. Authorities should also ensure that these offenders get strict punishment and are not allowed to get away with minor penalties for playing with lives of people on a daily basis."
5a06067e9855b76bf13c2f82,Bringing GM to the table,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/bringing-gm-to-the-table/article19111858.ece,2017-06-21,"On May 11, 2017, the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)  the scientific committee of the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change  that regulates genetically modified (GM) crops in India  had cleared GM mustard for commercial production. Anti-GM groups immediately opposed the decision and appealed to the Minister for Environment, who gives the final clearance, not to accept the GEACs recommendation.Issues at core of oppositionThe question of whether India should allow commercial production of GM crops has been one of the more enduring public policy debates over the last decade-and-a-half. After the approval of Bt cotton in 2002, the attempt to bring Bt Brinjal into commercial production faced serious resistance in 2010. After the GEAC approved Bt brinjal for commercial production, the then Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, placed a moratorium after undertaking extensive public consultation. Proponents of GM crops, including Noble laureates, insist that opposition to GM crops is driven by irrational fears of harm to human health and having an environmental impact and accuse opposing environmental groups of misrepresenting facts. Such arguments, however, are unlikely to convince the opponents of GM crops. While the debate is complex, involving a wide range of scientific, socio-economic, and political factors, it is important to understand two related issues that are fundamental to the opposition: invoking the precautionary principle for regulatory decision-making and a lack of trust in government and industry that promotes and benefits from GM technologies.One of the principal reasons for opposition to GM crops is the potential for serious, irreversible damage to human health and the environment. This is especially relevant in the context of crops such as Bt brinjal which involve direct consumption by humans, unlike Bt cotton. The widespread havoc that chemical pesticides and fertilizers have caused since the Green Revolution only adds credence to these concerns. While GM supporters claim that there is little scientific evidence of adverse impacts so far, GM opponents cite the need for longer term assessment of adverse impacts and more concrete evidence of no adverse effects. Implicitly, GM opponents are invoking the precautionary principle, which is a widely incorporated one in several international agreements and treaties on the environment. In the context of technologies such as GM crops, where there is significant scientific uncertainty over their safety, the precautionary principle suggests that we wait until a broader scientific consensus is achieved. For example, regulations in Europe, where GM crops face similar opposition, explicitly invoke the precautionary principle as the basis for deciding whether GM foods should be allowed.Lack of transparencyThe lack of transparency in the regulatory process further amplifies apprehensions stemming from a precautionary approach. All the safety tests for regulatory approvals are typically conducted by the same party that applies for commercialisation of GM crops  whether it is Mahyco on Bt brinjal or Delhi University on GM mustard. This conflict of interest was made worse by the refusal of GEAC (in both cases) to publicly release the safety testing data submitted for regulatory approval until GM opponents filed a Right to Information petition. This tendency to operate in secrecy has not only created a serious distrust of the government and the promoters of GM crops but is also fuelling the conflict. Extensive research on public acceptance of GM foods in the European context identifies trust in regulatory agencies and industry as being a critical factor in public willingness to accept GM technology.In a well-articulated decision letter at the time of rejecting Bt brinjal, the then Environment Minister, Jairam Ramesh, outlined the need for the GEAC to draw up a fresh protocol for the specific tests that will have to be conducted in order to generate public confidence. The GM mustard case does not provide much evidence that anything has changed since the moratorium on Bt brinjal.If there is a genuine case to be made to allow GM crops to improve yields and address Indias food security, GM supporters might want to start cultivating an environment of openness and transparency to allay genuine fears instead of dismissing GM opponents as being irrational. On its part, the government should adopt a participatory approach to bring together all stakeholders to develop regulatory protocols that restore trust in the process. The burden of proof lies with the promoters of GM technology to persuade consumers, farmers and activists that among various alternatives available for sustainable food production  e.g., organic farming, use of biopesticides  GM technology is at least a serious option that we should embrace.Rama Mohana R.

The government has also promised relief measures.Farm distressThe sit-in had embarrassed the State government, as the BKS had extended its support to the farmers agitation and flayed the agricultural policies, which it said were creating an intense farm distress. The farmers' body stopped short of demanding a loan waiver, but asked the government to procure more crops such as groundnut, mustard and moong, at MSP after two years of drought.After a marathon meeting which continued till late on Monday night, the State government assured the BKS leaders that a law would be enacted to make the pricing of agricultural produces below MSP in the open market a punishable offence. A committee will study the existing legislations in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat on this aspect.BKS general secretary Kailash Gandolia said the State government had also agreed to have a debate on the farmers' issues during the initial days of the State Assembly's next session. For the electricity bills, farmers were given relaxation to make the payments in six months instead of every two months.With the agitation called by other farmers' groups, including CPI(M)-backed All India Kisan Sabha, still continuing, the Opposition Congress took exception to the State government holding talks only with the BKS.The Congress said there was no positive outcome to the negotiations as neither was a guarantee given for procurement of produce at MSP nor an assurance of loan waiver.Pradesh Congress president Sachin Pilot said the BJP government had failed to fulfil its promise made in the election manifesto for payment of 50% profit over the input costs in agriculture. He demanded immediate waiver of farmers' loans on the lines of Punjab, where the Congress government has waived loans of small and marginal farmers owning land up to five acres.Insult to injuryThe BJP government has added insult to injury by talking to just a section of farmers... this is not going to provide relief to the entire farmer community, said Mr. Pilot, while declaring his party's support to all genuine demands of farmers.The call for a bandh in the grain mandis across the State was also withdrawn after the sit-in was called off. The agitation of Kisan Mahapanchayat continued on Tuesday in the shape of meetings in different towns."

(File | REUTERS)NEW DELHI: Edible oil industry body SEA fears that farmers may shift from oilseed cultivation to some other crops as domestic prices have crashed to five-year low.The association demanded that the government raise import duty on edible oil and boost procurement to check sliding domestic prices and protect interest of farmers as well as processors.Soyabean, groundnut and sunflower are grown in kharif (July-October) season. The sowing operation has started with onset of monsoon, which is projected to be normal this year.In a letter to its members, Solvent Extractors' Association (SEA) President Atul Chaturvedi said prices of soyabean, mustard and groundnut have fallen below the minimum support price (MSP).He demanded that import duty on crude edible oil be raised to 20 per cent and refined oil to 35 per cent.""After two years of drought, the current year has witnessed oilseed production rebounding. However, the increase in production has not brought any cheer to our farmers as prices have collapsed below the MSP levels,"" Chaturvedi said in the letter.""Probably, for the first time in decades, soyabean, rapeseed and groundnut have moved below MSP. Current price level is the lowest in the last five years and farmers are discouraged to sow oilseeds in kharif season,"" he said.To ensure that farmers do not loose their interest in oilseed cultivation, he said the association wants hike in import duty as a short-term measure to support the price.""Currently, oilseeds are being sold below MSP and there is hardly any Market Intervention Operation (MIO) to support these price levels. While we appreciate the government's decision to raise the MSP to support farmers, there is an urgent need to strengthen procurement system, otherwise it will not benefit farmers,"" Chaturvedi said.He said the government has increased the MSP substantially to cool down farmers' agitation in various states.The MSP of soyabean, a major crop in Madhya Pradesh, has been raised by Rs 275 per quintal to Rs 3,050 per quintal.Groundnut-in-shell and sunflower seed MSPs have been raised by Rs 230 and Rs 150 per quintal respectively. Their support prices now stand at Rs 4,450 per quintal and Rs 4,100 per quintal.Nigerseed MSP has been increased to Rs 4,050 from Rs 3,825 per quintal and sesamum MSP to Rs 5,300 from Rs 5,000 per quintal.Chaturvedi also raised concern over 30 per cent rise in import of edible oil during last month despite bumper oilseed production in the country.""Import of edible oil during May 2017 jumped by 30 per cent compared to May 2016 and overall import for November 2016 to May 2017 is more or less the same for the last year. On one hand we had a record oilseed crop and on the other hand we are forced to import larger quantity of vegetable oils,"" he said.Chaturvedi said while farmers are reluctant to sell the produce below MSP, industry is unable to pay them higher price due to large-scale import of edible oil at lower duty and disparity in processing.""Government must regulate inflow of refined edible oil import through tariff measures to enable market forces to pay a remunerative price to farmers,"" he said.India imports more than half of its vegetable oil requirement. At present, the import duty on crude palm oil and crude soft oil is 7.5 per cent and 12.5 per cent respectively, while duty on refined palmolein is 15 per cent and 20 per cent on other refined oils."

Patanjalis Amla juice had also been suspended by the armed forces Canteen Stores Department (CSD) in April after it failed the quality test at a Public Health Laboratory in Kolkata. Factly reported in January this year that 25 out of 33 complaints registered against advertisements of Patanjali products in various sectors such as Food and Beverages, Personal care, Health care etc, between April 2015 and July 2016, were found to be in violation of the ASCI (Advertising Standards Council of India) code for making misleading, false and unsubstantiated claims. In December 2016, a Haridwar court had slapped five production units of Patanjali Ayurved with a fine of Rs 11 lakh for misbranding and putting up misleading advertisements of their products. The company had been found guilty of outsourcing the products that it claimed to have manufactured in its own units. In April 2016, Patanjali aata noodles were found to be substandard since they contained three times more ash than the acceptable limit. In the same month, Patanjalis desi ghee was also found to contain artificial colour.

Farmers in the area on several occasions petitioned local authorities to halt work - an anicut under construction is bound to keep water from reaching fertile fields where farmers have been cultivating moong, guar, bajra and other crops for generations. If there is rain in winter, a crop of either chickpeas or mustard is also sown.On May 29, 2012, Rajasthan High Court , in an order pertaining to the Ramgarh Dam and applicable across the state, said, ""Construction of anicuts should not be permitted unless a proper survey is made to assess rainfall in the area indicating sufficiency of water for the anicuts and overflow."" Villagers say works are being undertaken without consultation or proper planning, in violation of court orders.Over Rs 40 lakh has been sanctioned for work in Bhopa and Pithodai villages, according to a circular from the district collector on March 16. Villagers are concerned that traditional systems that have served well for generations will now be starved of water this monsoon, thanks to the new anicut that is currently under construction.Lands locally called ""khadin"" - extremely fertile and wet lands irrigated by streams in the area that flow after the monsoon, will be disturbed by all the digging. Two khadins in the area have served as fertile fields for about 150 villagers, and the streams that form after the monsoon irrigate about 600 acres here. Farmers fear the anicut will divert water from their fields and any overflow will only go to lands not irrigated or cultivated at present.Over 40 villagers petitioned the district collector on May 23 this year, saying the district receives good rains only once in about five years. Traditionally, the desert region sees just about 165 ml rain annually, and this water is carefully conserved.Hukam Singh, a farmer in Bhopa, told TOI, ""We went as a group of about 40 people to meet the collector and also the Block Development Officer. Only two of us were allowed entry into the office. Each time, we are told our concerns will be taken care of. Work on the anicut has just gone on, despite our pleas and protests.""Over the years, the state irrigation department, working closely with villagers, evolved mechanisms to conserve water. There are two open wells at the endpoint of the flow of the natural stream. Villagers say they were not consulted at the planning stage of the Jal Swavlamban project. Besides, the tender process has occurred in violation of norms - under the rules, a gram sabha must be held and these projects discussed with locals before implementation. ""This is sheer waste of public money,"" said one villager, unwilling to be named.Villagers say any conservation measure should ideally have been planned at the point where the water collects in two open wells, at the end point of the stream. This would then not have disturbed the natural flow of the short-lived stream. Anurag Bhardwaj, commissioner of the watershed development and soil conservation department of the state government, in a letter of June 1, also noticed cracks in the pond under construction here for water conservation. He said the mini-percolation tank's side slopes also needed proper maintenance.District collector Kailash Chand told TOI, ""Yes, I did receive a complaint but all technical parameters are being observed and there will be no problem because of this anicut."""

5a06103b9855b76bf13c35a0,Mandsaur  the farmers’ story,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/mandsaur-the-farmers-story/article19137870.ece,2017-06-24,"I remember years ago the Delhi School of Economics had many great scholars visit the campus. They talked passionately and knowledgeably not just about the subject but about knowledge as a vocation. One of the most memorable of these performances was by Teodor Shanin, the economic historian who also edited Peasants and Peasant Societies . He talked quietly about his love for his subject and confessed, I have been studying the peasantry when it was out of fashion, I am in it now when it is fashionable, and I will be there long after it has become out of fashion again. I recollected his passion as I read sadly about farmers protests across India, particularly in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh.It was not the nature of the reports that was distressing. It was more the way the regime was reacting to it. It was a kind of repeat of its response to the farmers complaining about the long drought in Tamil Nadu. Watching the protest and its drama, one sensed the regime did not care. The protest was dismissed as a colourful spectacle. The peasant as victim was dismissed as a futile clown, a failed trickster.Weaving the narrativeOne must emphasise that this was not due to the callousness of media reporting. Over the last month, journalists have captured the protests of the farmers in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh. They have emphasised that what is rocking India is not only the battle of caste groups or worker struggles but the huge range of farmer protests across the country. Yet, one senses news is not enough. Information has not graduated to storytelling or even knowledge to dent the regimes idea of agricultural policy. Something like what Buddhist monks dub a touch of wholeness. Somehow the narratives of agriculture have never possessed that sense. One misses an Indian Shanin, who can weave theory and practice, storytelling and policy together.The governments reaction, bordering between illiteracy and indifference, has often made social scientists cynical. They retreat into the realm of jokes, of slapstick or concentration camp humour. The jokes might sound silly but they hit home, conveying the despair of the spectator and witness. I remember two in particular.A former member of the now disbanded Planning Commission asks his class at the Delhi School of Economics, What is the difference between the Congress and the BJP? Answer: the Congress knows economics but not agriculture. The BJP (Bharatiya Janata Party) is illiterate about both.The second comment comes from the tragedy, the continuous epidemic of agricultural suicides that have haunted India for over a decade. The question is why John Maynard Keynes is not applicable to India. This joke remembers Keyness observation that in the long run, we are all dead. In India, we are dead in the short run too if one looks at suicide and starvation deaths. Behind the drab comedy, there is a poignant point. We might be an agricultural country, but our rulers lack a sense of political economy or sociology of agriculture.The security paradigmOne has sensed this watching Home Minister Rajnath Singh and Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan respond to the protests at Mandsaur. There has been no sense of an agricultural crisis in their language. The BJP, in its paranoid way, converts every protest into a problem of law and order, into an internal security threat, imagining the forces of insurgency behind it. It creates a cordon sanitaire around the area, preventing activists and Congress leaders from reaching the area. The suicides of more than a dozen farmers create no sense of connectivity with similar happenings elsewhere.Muting protest without articulating debate corrodes the texture of democracy. The BJP fails to understand any problem sociologically. Behind every protest it sees an insurgent or a terrorist. As a result, the sufferings of citizens go unheeded. Their sense of the hidden or invisible hand lies in security threats or terror, not in the forces of economics. Policy hardly responds to the suffering on the ground.Worse, Mr. Chouhan added his own obscenity by starting a counter-fast against the violence. Threatening an indefinite fast against what he dubbed incendiary activities, he expectedly cut it short, quickly accepting the proverbial glass of lemon juice and announcing a whole slew of policies. The farmers were not impressed, invoking the all but forgotten recommendations of the Swaminathan Report that the support subsidy should cover half the production costs of a crop.A meeting of farmers associations condemned this as a nautanki. To the crudity of the Chief Ministers response, one has to add the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. But since Mr. Chouhan has been in power for over a decade, it is his policies we need to examine, and policy is almost ironic in its consequences.Ethnographies at the ground level in villages around Mandsaur reveal four disastrous decisions. First, the procurement price of the crop. The prices have plunged so disastrously that the farmer is not able to recover the mere cost of investment. Second, adding salt to the procurement injury, is the demonetisation policy of the regime which has devastated the economy. For instance, farmers receive cheques which were not cashable for over a month. They remained literally promissory notes that could not be redeemed. Third, the government does not allow the export of many crops. And fourth, the farm holdings in many cases are so small that survival is difficult. The changes in cost as crops follow the cash crop economy has created its own strains. What democracy needs is an answer to this, but the responses cannot be palliative. Policy does not seek problem-solving. We are groping from crisis to crisis as even a bumper crop becomes a prelude to a disaster. Questions of sustainability and livelihood need debate. One has to rethink the axiomatics of agriculture beyond price to water, soil management, diversity, questions of food processing. The current scandal has to be located within the overall crisis of agriculture. Instead of seeing agriculture as problematic and crisis-ridden, I wish the regime would see agriculture as a way of life. Instead of fetishising agriculture into a false gau rakshak economy, one wishes the government would open up the debate on agriculture.Light at the end of the tunnel?I wish Mr. Chouhan and Mr. Singh had visited the National Seed Diversity Festival at Anna University, Chennai, held earlier this month. It was a scientific mela in the true sense of the term, with the Indian farmer elaborating his knowledge about diversity, especially when a society can talk of the nearly 40,000 varieties of rice. It was literally a festival of agriculture, not an attempt to enact out agriculture as a dismal science as policy groups often do. Second, one also wishes that civil society activists proficient in policy were consulted in policymaking. They would go beyond cost-benefit to a sense of suffering of a people. The governments hysterical attempt to introduce genetically modified (GM) mustard might meet with more thoughtful and ethical responses in this group. Third, the question of farmers agency must be emphasised. Sometimes, agriculture as a form of victimology loses the sense of farming as creative and competent. What I want to emphasise is the necessity to see agriculture holistically, not in terms of the silos of the mind. If the protests at Mandsaur can trigger that one thought, maybe all the hardship will have a meaning some day.Shiv Visvanathan is Professor, Jindal Global Law School and Director, Centre for the Study of Knowledge Systems, O.P.

We have already witnessed how cotton cultivators are now under the clutches of the MNCs. What has already come true in case of cotton will come true with regard to other GM crops as well and hence should be opposed, he added. Vast swathes of H.D. Kote in Mysuru district was under organic cotton and indigenous cotton till a few years ago. But over time it has been supplanted by Bt cotton. This has not only supplanted the indigenous cotton variety but has also resulted in native cotton seeds disappearing from the market. Farmers are thus forced to procure them from MNCs who, reportedly, manipulate prices.Statistics indicate that cotton cultivation is the highest in H.D. Kote accounting for almost 65% of the total cultivation in the district.As against nearly 48,000 hectares under cotton cultivation in 2014-15, H.D. Kote has 31,000 hectares now and more than 95% are under Bt cotton."

5a05cfff9855b76bf13c1106,Modified approaches,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170628/jsp/opinion/story_158981.jsp,2017-06-28,"The Central biotech regulator, the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee has recommended the commercial use of genetically modified or GM mustard after much deliberation and several rounds of field trials. It is believed that GM mustard would be beneficial for agricultural growth in the country and would end India's dependence on other countries for the import of edible oil. At present, India imports edible oil worth 11 million dollars, nearly one-third of what the country gains by exporting agricultural commodities. After three years of deliberation, the biotech regulator has agreed to its limited use for commercial purposes from the coming rabi season. GM mustard seeds have been developed in an Indian laboratory and by a group of scientists from the Delhi University, which makes it a truly desi product. The project was funded by two national organizations, the National Dairy Development Board (the largest producer and supplier of the Dhara brand of oil) and the government's department of biotechnology. The idea behind this new project was to make the country self-reliant in mustard oil production. Countries like the United States of America, Brazil, Argentina, China and others are using GM seeds for the production of maize, soya bean, cotton, canola, papaya and paddy. In the US, 72.9 million hectares of land are being used for the production of GM crops. Brazil is using roughly 49 million hectares of land. At present, India is trying out only with BT cotton in 10.8 million hectares. Because of stiff opposition from activists, the introduction of BT brinjal was stalled in 2010. Since 2013, GM mustard has been opposed by activists on the ground that the new seeds can pose serious scientific and technical challenges to farmers, besides causing environmental degradation and health hazards. Activists allege that no attempt has been made to share field trial data with the farmers. The Supreme Court will have to take a call on this contentious issue in the coming months. Before the new seeds cause another spate of farmers' suicides something needs to be done. The GM mustard seeds have been opposed on other counts too. Aruna Rodrigues, an activist, argued that the Centre's preliminary clearance to GM mustard, named Dhara Mustard Hybrid-11 (DMH-11), contravenes a 2013 report by a Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee. This committee had said, among other things, that herbicide-tolerant crops ought not to be permitted in India. One of the genes in DMH-11, developed by researchers, contains 'bar' that makes it herbicide tolerant. This makes plants resistant to a class of insecticide containing the chemical, glufosinate. After the disastrous consequences of using BT cotton seeds in Vidarbha, Maharashtra and other parts of the country, questions are being raised about the efficacy of GM mustard. Initially, in the 1990s, BT cotton seeds were imported in a clandestine manner bypassing all checks and control by government agencies. The farmers were told by the agents of the wholesale dealers that BT cotton output would ensure a quantum jump in the cotton production. The cost of production of the new crop was three to four times higher, farmers had to borrow money at a high rate of interest from moneylenders. After sowing, they waited, only to find insecticides destroying the cotton fields. The disaster led to a large number of farmers' suicides. In the early 1990s, nearly one thousand farmers committed suicide by consuming pesticide in Maharashtra alone. Why did the farmers use new genetically modified BT cotton seeds of the multinational company called Monsanto in the 1990s? One answer to this question is that they took the risk because they had gained some kind of confidence in using new seeds after the successful introduction of high yielding varieties and various other inputs during the Green Revolution. Moreover, different types of HYV seeds were also introduced by the Indian agricultural research institutes with which farmers had no problems. However, the simple narratives of risk and trust fell apart when BT cotton seeds were introduced: the new seeds gave farmers a nightmare and within a short time cotton cultivation with the new seeds was abandoned in many parts of the country. Other problems aggravated the crises in Maharashtra, like adulterated and spurious inputs, lopsided flow of institutional credits and indebtedness, the mismatch between the expected and actual yield of cotton, the breakdown of the joint family system, ecological factors like soil degradation owing to the excessive use of chemicals and fertilizers. The factors worked in a complicated way in leading to suicides. However, the Green Revolution made scientific knowledge popular among farmers. Agricultural innovations with new HYV seeds has changed the contours of local knowledge about farming in the last five decades. Science made inroads into the world of local knowledge in remote areas in agriculturally backward states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan. The triumph of science over traditional techniques of cultivation helped farmers gain trust in new discoveries, especially in seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. Constant interaction between agricultural scientists and farmers made it easier to spread Green Revolution technology. Agricultural scientists made it a point to ensure that farmers became important stakeholders in spreading this in rural areas; frequent field trials by agricultural scientists helped bridge the gap between scientists and farmers. The disaster in Vidarbha has broken the trust that farmers gained after the Green Revolution and it has allowed local knowledge to regain lost ground. Indian agriculture would hardly benefit if scientific knowledge does not percolate down to the villages. Science has an important role to play in augmenting agricultural production and from this point of view new seeds or GM crops can fulfil two primary objectives: first, they can increase food production and second, they can make India self-sufficient in producing edible oil and cotton. In order to fulfil these two broader objectives, science has to reach those who till the land. But this is not happening with GM seeds; farmers are being ignored by the State and by scientists. Before introducing GM mustard, it would be necessary to involve farmers, the main stakeholders, in this new venture. In many parts of India, farmers are well-organized; they are controlled either by unions or by their caste associations. Sometimes they join hands without taking support from unions or caste associations as is the case in the present farmers' agitation in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. In West Bengal, the Left Front paid a heavy price for not consulting peasants before land acquisition in Singur and Nandigram. A spontaneous agrarian struggle forced the state government to abandon land acquisition. On a contentious issue like the introduction of GM crops, farmers should get an opportunity to express their opinion. After all they are the main stakeholders, they must be heard."

It prompted a US missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike.After interviewing witnesses and examining samples, a fact- finding mission (FFM) of the OPCW concluded that a large number of people, some of whom died, were exposed to sarin or a sarin-like substance.It is the conclusion of the FFM that such a release can only be determined as the use of sarin, as a chemical weapon, a summary of the report said.Now that we know the undeniable truth, we look forward to an independent investigation to confirm exactly who was responsible for these brutal attacks so we can find justice for the victims, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said in a statement on Thursday.A joint United Nations and OPCW investigation, known as the JIM, can now look at the incident to determine who is to blame, she said.The JIM has found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015 and that Islamic State militants used mustard gas.Western intelligence agencies had also blamed the government of Bashar al-Assad for the April chemical attack. Syrian officials have repeatedly denied using banned toxins in the conflict.The mission was unable to visit the site itself due to security concerns and will not attempt to get there, the head of the OPCW was said to have decided.Syria joined the chemicals weapons convention in 2013 under a Russian-US agreement, averting military intervention under then US President Barack Obama.The United States said on Wednesday the Syrian government appeared to have heeded a warning this week from Washington not to carry out a chemical weapons attack.Russia, the Syrian governments main backer in the civil war, warned it would respond proportionately if the United States took pre-emptive measures against Syrian forces after Washington said on Monday it appeared the Syrian military was preparing to conduct a chemical weapons attack."

With four rates being levied under GST, the software of the shops mentioned each product elaborately, resulting in `literally' longer bills.Baffled by the bills, consumers at Big Bazaar in T Nagar couldn't make out whether they were paying more or less than what they used to under the old tax regime.When Sarala R stepped out to buy her monthly groceries, she was up for an agonizing experience. Armed with several rolls of bills, she seemed confused and distraught about the money she had to shell out for her purchase.

5a0409bf9855b76bf13bc00d,Syria says chemical attack probe work of 'sick mind',http://www.newindianexpress.com/world/2017/jul/02/syria-says-chemical-attack-probe-work-of-sick-mind-1623275.html,2017-07-02,"BEIRUT: Syria's government accused Saturday the international chemical weapons watchdog of relying on the testimonies of ""terrorists"" in its probe that concluded sarin gas was used in a deadly attack in Syria two months ago.The Syrian Foreign Ministry in a statement also lashed out at the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons, saying its investigation has been subjected to political extortion, costing the agency its credibility and impartiality. The ministry called its findings ""the creation of a sick mind.""While the OPCW didn't apportion blame, the U.S., the U.K. and Syrian activists have held the Syrian government responsible for the April 4 on Khan Sheikhoun in the opposition-controlled Idlib province. More than 90 people, including women and children, were killed, sparking outrage around the world as photos and video of the aftermath, which included quivering children dying on camera, were widely broadcast.The U.S. launched a punitive strike against the Syrian military days after the attack. Syrian President Bashar Assad and his main backer Russia have denied the use of chemical weapons, accusing the Syrian opposition of launching the attacks.The Syrian foreign ministry said the OPCW had declined to visit Khan Sheikhoun or the base from which the alleged attack was purportedly launched. It said the Syrian government was prepared to cooperate with the investigators.""The report comes up with a fabricated and exaggerated story that has no credibility and can't be accepted in any way because it is illogical and is the creation of a sick mind,"" the ministry's statement said. It questioned the testimonies collected by the OPCW in Turkey from witnesses it called ""terrorists"" and ""perjurers"" controlled by western intelligence agents.It called on the OPCW to prepare ""impartial and credible reports that have not been subjected to extortions by countries and parties that prevent it from reaching the truth.""Both the U.S. and the OPCW defended the probe's methodology. Investigators did not visit the scene of the attack, deeming it too dangerous, but analyzed samples from victims and survivors, and interviewed witnesses.The investigation's findings will be used by a joint U.N.-OPCW investigation team to determine who was behind the attack. The team is expected to issue its next report sometime around October. The OPCW has scheduled a July 5 meeting of its executive council to discuss the matter.Syria joined the OPCW in 2013 after it was blamed for a deadly poison gas attack in a Damascus suburb. Assad's government then declared some 1,300 tons of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals that were subsequently destroyed in an unprecedented international operation.However, the organization still has unanswered questions regarding Syria's initial declaration and whether it has wholly disposed of its chemical weapons stockpile.The report's investigative team has previously concluded that chlorine and sulfur mustard  commonly known as mustard gas  were used as weapons in Syria.On Saturday, a Syrian insurgent group said Syrian government troops used chlorine gas on its fighters during clashes near the capital Damascus.Faylaq al-Rahman group has been fighting advancing government and allied forces on its stronghold of Ain Terma, in eastern Ghouta suburb, for days. It was not immediately possible to corroborate the frontline report of chlorine use. Activists reported the insurgent group's claim but no images or firsthand accounts were made available. One activist said most of those injured were fighters. The Syrian military called reports of a chlorine attack in Ain Terma ""baseless lies."""

(Source: Express Photo) Activists at Sukhna Lake on Saturday. (Source: Express Photo)PEOPLE CONCERNED about changes being made in their food, especially at the genetic level, came together at the Sukhna Lake on Friday morning under the umberalla of Sarson Satyagraha. The activists, connected with morning walkers, spoke to them about the dangers of genetically modified food being promoted by multi-national corporations and carried placards and banners decrying GM food, particularly GM mustard.In May this year, a regulatory body under the Ministry of Environment and Forests, had given its go-ahead for cultivation of genetically modified mustard. Earlier, it was Bt cotton that was genetically modified and its ill-effects on the ecology are for all to see.Now mustard, a traditional and important crop linked to good health, will be manipulated so that traditional seeds of this crop will be destoyed in a systemic manner. The awareness drive against such changes under the name of Sarson Satyagraha is being carried out by citizens all over India. Propagation of GM technology is ill-conceived and doesnt take into account the fact that the nature is alive and you cannot mess with it for your short-term goals, said Shivraj Bhullar, a local farmer from Chandigarh Organic Farmers Market.Seeza Bhardwaj said she was for sustainable agriculture practices and GM crops once introduced would contaminate all varieties of mustard in India by cross-pollination and people had the right to demand safe food. All we are saying is please have a dialogue on the safety of GM crops, which have never been tested for human consumption, before introducing an irreversible change in our food chain, said Harkamal.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

GBIT got around 12,000 male OX513A mosquitoes in 2011, several generations have evolved in its Jalna lab.EVEN as urban local bodies gear up for annual monsoon outbreaks of dengue and malaria, inside a nondescript mesh cage at Jalna in central Maharashtra, trials are underway on several generations of a friendly mosquito that a handful of countries are already experimenting with for vector control programmes.In the cage are hundreds of Aedes Aegypti vector mosquitoes, responsible for spreading dengue and chikungunya among other diseases, but engineered through advanced biotechnology to be self-limiting  in other words, genetically modified to cause offspring to die.While GM Mustard continues to await a final nod from the Union government, Gangabishan Bhikulal Investment and Trading Limited (GBIT), which is testing the transgenic mosquitoes along with Oxitec Limited, an Oxford University spin-out biotech company, is pinning its hopes on the urgency around finding effective vector management technologies.The Aedes Aegypti mosquito, the vector responsible for dengue and chikungunya outbreaks, has survived traditional fumigating and there is no immediate mass-scale programme to control these outbreaks. From a public health perspective, this is a crucial area where intervention can be made, says Shirish Barwale, director of GBIT, one of the Barwale Group companies that include hybrid seed major Mahyco.GBIT got around 12,000 male OX513A mosquitoes in 2011, several generations have evolved in its Jalna lab. Nirmal Harindran GBIT got around 12,000 male OX513A mosquitoes in 2011, several generations have evolved in its Jalna lab. Nirmal HarindranAlready, Oxitec is partnering with agencies in Brazil, Panama, the US and the Cayman Islands for trials and pilot projects. In India, GBIT expects to approach regulators seeking permissions for the next phase  limited trials in an open field  early next year. Phase One of the trials was in the laboratory, and Phase Two, a contained trial in cages, is currently underway. Once the results of this phase are ready, then we expect to go into Phase Three, which would be open field trials, said Dr Shaibal Dasgupta, GBITs lead scientist on the project. By February or March 2018, we will be more or less ready and will submit results.Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) director Dr Soumya Swaminathan agrees that there is a need for a graded response to trials around GM technology meant for disease control. We definitely need to look for alternative technologies for the future, she said.The friendly Aedes has already been trademarked by Oxitec. These are transgenic male mosquitoes with a self-limiting gene inserted through advanced genetics. Banking upon the males natural instinct to mate with a wild female, the OX513A strain is inherited by offspring, causing the larvae to die before maturing into adult mosquitoes.Since GBIT brought in over 10,000-12,000 male OX513A mosquitoes from Oxitec in September 2011, several generations have evolved in its Jalna laboratory and cage, with larvae successfully maturing into adults only with doses of tetracycline added into the water where the larvae grow. GBIT scientists say batches of larvae treated with tetracycline survive, mate and produce offspring, some of which are again maintained with a dose of tetracycline.What we do is a regular quality check on the effectivity of the gene. We mate the OX513A male mosquito with the local female and check the mortality. That is the test of effectivity of the gene, says Dr Dasgupta. GBIT says their quality checks have shown no deviation from the expected performance of the gene in subsequent generations of the mosquito. At Oxitec, over 150 generations of the mosquito have been tested by now, only batches getting tetracycline surviving into adulthood. Again, no deviation has been found in gene penetrance.Asked whether the local agricultural community around the Jalna facility is aware of the active test site, GBIT says they have a detailed engagement plan to set into motion before open trials. We would need to involve the local community for the next round of open trials, as and when we get approvals. At present, discussion with the village close to the site is on and is at the initial stages, said an official of GBIT.Among the things they expect to tell villagers is that only male mosquitoes are to be released  the male Aedes Aegypti neither bites humans nor spreads disease. Also, the OX513A gene being self limiting, it does not remain in the environment unless it gets tetracycline. Scientists also say no toxins are introduced in the bio-engineered OX513A mosquitoes, so birds eating these mosquitoes will not be in any danger. Also, as the Aedes Aegypti only mates with its own kind, DNA sequences will not be spread to any other organism.But one problem, is the absence of convincing data from previous trials on the impact of a reduced vector population on incidence of disease. Other doubts include the possibility that the wild female will, over generations, prefer only the wild male Aedes Aegypti.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Rising input costs and lack of technical support to fight crop diseases have forced many villagers in Rajasthan to give up betel farming and migrate to cities to work as daily wagers for a living.People of Tamoli caste have been growing plants for hundreds of years at Khareri, Bagrain, Khankheda and Umrain villages in Bayana sub-division of Bharatpur district. Betel leaves are also produced in Masalpur, Uprera and Rathmora villages in Karauli district.Betel leaves, called paan, are supplied from these villages to Delhi, Mumbai, Agra, Mathura, Aligarh, Varanasi and Bulandshahar. Known for good quality and taste, the leaves are also exported to Pakistan, Bangladesh and Arab countries.Betel leaves are sold in many cities through mediators in Delhi; we get 200 to 300 for each packet of 200 leaves, said Daujiram Tamoli of Bagrain village.Nearly 500 households of Tamoli caste have been involved in betel farming, but 50% of them left the cultivation after they failed to meet the costs, mainly for irrigation, and fight the leaf diseases. They said they did not get financial assistance from government.Our ancestors from Karauli started betel cultivation 900 years ago. Maximum farmers are now forced to leave the cultivation due to leaf diseases and for failing to afford farming costs, Daujiram said.Most of the farmers are settled in Jaipur to earn a livelihood and support their families.Betel leaves, once dubbed green gold, are used as chewing stimulants. They are widely used during religious events and festivals.Artificial blocks (bereja) are constructed with bricks to grow betel vines. Blocks are necessary to control temperature and protect leaves from direct sunlight and fog. Betel needs moderate temperature and is vulnerable to weather changes.About 250 households cultivated betel leaves at Khareri, 60 at Bagrain, and 40 at Khankheda. They faced leaf diseases in 2003. The diseases continued to damage leaves till 2012, but officials did not provide expert advice, farmers said. They said they did not get loans to develop farming.Betel plants are grown in April and leaves are plucked from July first week. Leaves grow in a plant for five years.Betel farming needs regular irrigation -- five times a day; leaves are covered with clothes to protect them from sunlight. Each farmer uses nearly 8 acres of land to grow betel leaves and he can earn 2-3 lakh in a year from this cultivated area.Palmolive and mustard oil, milk, curd, flour and turmeric powder are put in plant roots to produce high-quality green leaves.Women also collect leaves and then clean them for sale. We have adopted Khareri village to help out Tamoli caste people who grew betel leaves. A sum of 4 lakh was provided as bank loan to women who participate in betel farming, said Sitaram Gupta, director of Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation.The foundation is committed to providing education and medical help for their children.He said, Betel farmers face natural calamity and need crop insurance. After betel leaves start smelling, snakes come to betel fields. Farmers work with fear of snakes."

Four farmers, burdened under financial distress if their families are to be believed, chose death over life in June. Another 30-year-old died of a cardiac arrest, right when he was stepping out of a mandi where he failed to recover one-third of the cost he has invested in his crop.Officially, `reason of suicide can be anything but financial trouble' but a visit to the houses of the victims makes it quite difficult for the argument to be taken on face-value.The present alarming situation cannot be understood unless the last two years of crop productivity and pattern should be analysed. The infamouse hail storm of 2015 had damaged the standing crops followed by the erratic rains in 2016 reduced the production. The failure left farmers to borrow additional loans while the principal amount remains the same.""This year (2017) has been phenomenal for farmers' because of appropriate rains, better clamitic conditions. This led to good yields per hectare of garlic, wheat, mustard and coriander. The setback was these cash crops, which saw high market price at one time, failed to match the expectations of the farmers. The scarcity of cash for the third consecutive year has put them in utter pressure of repaying loans, arranging funds for fresh sowing session and other expenses like education, marriages etc is making them vulnerable,"" said B S Meena, assistant professor at Kota Agricuture University The ill-fated policies of the state government are proving fatal for the farmers of agricultural rich Hadoti region, claim experts and farmers along with the opposition. Those alive are stressed too. They are getting less than one-third of the cost of producing garlic, fifty percent for mustard and around 70 percent for wheat - produced in the Rabi season.Thousands have incurring heavy losses. TOI travelled in the region to see that farmers are under immense pressure to repay loans. Most cultivated garlic and government's announcement to purchase 10,000 meteric ton at the cost of Rs 3200 per quintal under Market Intervention Scheme (MIS), has brought little relief. The simmering tension among farmers of Kota, Jhalawar and Baran, due to apathy is palpable. Garlic production in Hadauti region was 7.87 lacs metric tons.A brief conversation with a 70 year old Kasturi Chand Meena, whose son and a state level Kabbadi player Satya Narayan Meena died out of cardic attack in Kota Krishi Mandi on June 3, held state apathy responsible. A resident of Raun village, he sat on a tarpaulin sheet with a handful of others observing the last week of mourning period.In a coarse voice laced with anger, Meena asserts, ""State lured us to change our crop pattern to garlic. They gave us good returns under MSP last year. This year they abandon us and didn't come up with MSP. As we continued with the same crop unaware that it will not yield us price even enough to ferry it in the market. My son couldn't bear the pressure of repaying loans to Kisan Mitra and Kisan Credit Card. State killed my son......,"" said Meena.Almost 300 kilometres from from the Raun village lay Sakrowda village in Baran district, farmers are angry and hurt ""If UP, Maharastra and Madhya Pradesh can waive of loans why Raje government can't? asked angry Buddhi Prakash The statement by Rajasthan's agricultural minister Prabhulal Saini, who claimed that suicides are taking place due to family feuds, has caused damage beyond repair.

About a decade ago, the farmers here were mainly cultivating soybean, mustard and coriander. Garlic was cultivated only for local consumption. Over the past five years, farmers have started growing garlic, which is a labour intensive crop. Since they lack experience, the farmers are now in a fix.""Garlic is a labour intensive crop which requires almost double the workers than soybean and coriander. Secondly, this crop requires skilled ploughing. This means high cost of production. Any correction in prices also means heavy losses,"" said B S Meena, assistant professor, Kota Agriculture University (KAU).Garlic has replaced soybean and coriander as the most popular crop during the rabi season, along with mustard and wheat which are grown by farmers in both seasons. The main four crops require fewer resources than garlic.""For better results, many farmers purchased automatic equipment such as garlic diggers and planters. They have also gone for garlic capsules (seeds) of the top variety without checking the soil. This has not given the top quality produce they expected,"" said K M Gautam , professor and researcher, KAU.It was readily accepted by farmers as the most secure crop to be cultivated in the interiors of Hadauti. ""I have grown it for the simple reason that it grows below the soil. So, the chances of damage by animals, cattle are very less,"" said Ram Suthar, a farmer from Sripura. The entire village has grown garlic and reported no damage by animals.Hadauti has 10 lakh hectares under cultivation, including 2.5 lakh under irrigation. Farmers use the best areas to cultivate garlic. This has now gone against them. Experts have also asked the state to take measures to encourage famers to follow crop rotation.Garlic absorbs iron, protients and other valuable nutrients from soil. The soil becomes exhausted if the same crop continues. ""I fear that if the farmers continue with the same crop next year too, the produce may fall,"" Gautam said."

Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan has to give final nod.Seeking PMs urgent attention, scientists wrote: We therefore sincerely pray to you Sir to intervene in the matter and direct the concerned authorities to investigate and stop the release to save the Indian farmers from the clutches of MNCs, to avoid indiscriminate use of the herbicides in near future, to save indigenous high yielding varieties of crop plants. We are always with you as soldiers in nation building.They alleged that there is hidden agenda behind release of GM Mustard.Moreover, they (part of government) have hidden agenda to exhaust indigenous seed of the crops over powering with those under patent regime of foreign multinationals. There is sufficient ground to doubt their integrity towards Indian farmers, who are being made more dependent on monopolised seed under IPR regime of foreign multinational companies, they added.Once approved, GM Mustard will be the first transgenic food crop allowed in India. A moratorium was put in GM brinjal in 2010 following protests by civil society and farmers groups. Right wing groups like Swadeshi Jagran Manch have also registered their protests over GM Mustard."

The exhibition has been organised with the support of the Bengal Weavers Service Society, an NGO, which works for the upliftment of the weavers.Dipped in the kaleidoscopic colours of Persian Blue, Mustard Yellow, Bright Orange, Cherry Red and Maroon, each material is a masterpiece. We conduct this exhibition every year and this is the tenth time we have come, says Sharmistha Das Biswas, the exhibition coordinator.The hand-woven sarees, with intricate patterns, is the work of 250 weavers. They have spent at least five days to make one saree, she said.The show-stealers are the beautifully designed Shibori sarees, which has been made using an ancient Japanese procedure of resist dyeing, wherein some areas of the fabric remain untouched, while others have Bengal style patterns and designs. The other attraction is the Ajrak printed sarees.The light-weight, colourful Tangail Nakshi sarees is also one of the highlights. The prices are fixed by the weavers.And there are many fans. Every year I come for this exhibition as they have a good collection of handlooms and Reshams. I have never been disappointed, said a customer.For the trend seekers, the Kalamkari designs, which is printed using patterned wooden stamps, is the best. The Shibori has natural dyes and the fabric is folded and unwrapped, so that a geometric effect is produced.To make a Naxi-border saree, it takes about five days to do these designs because it is hand-painted, says Amar Mandal, an artisan.The exhibition will conclude on July 17."

The U.S. invented GMOs and commercialised them despite serious safety concerns expressed by government scientists.Myths and realitiesGMOs carry risks of unintended effects and toxicity, which confront us with a double problem: scientists dont know what to look for, and health impacts become apparent only in the long term, such as cancer. California reaffirmed last month, despite GM behemoth Monsantos best efforts, that its glyphosate, considered the safest herbicide, will be included in a list of chemicals labelled as cancer-causing (following the categorisation of glyphosate by the World Health Organization as a probable carcinogen).There is serious concern that Monsanto may have known for 30 years that glyphosate is an endocrine (hormone) disruptor; no regulatory agency anywhere regulates for endocrine disruption despite overwhelming evidence from Argentina of horrendous birth defects because of glyphosate used in herbicide-tolerant (HT) soybeans. In this context, Bayers glufosinate, the herbicide linked with Indian HT mustard, is an acknowledged neurotoxin banned in the EU. The Supreme Court-appointed technical expert committee recommended a ban on any HT crop in India for this among several other reasons.The myths that have sustained the propaganda of a safe and highly productive GM crop technology for two decades  that it will feed the world  are fast dissolving. The current stable of GMOs comprises just two products, Bt (e.g. Bt cotton) and HT crops (HT mustard), and they account for nearly 99% of GMOs planted worldwide. Both, on empirical evidence (including Indias Bt cotton), are proven unsustainable technologies. There are promises of GMOs with traits for disease, drought etc., but these are complex, multi-gene traits and remain futuristic. What is abundantly clear is that traditional breeding outperforms GMOs hands down.Going against evidenceGlobally and in India, the conflict of interest is pernicious: our regulatory institutions/ministries are funders, promoters, developers and regulators, a fine blend of multitasking. There is neither independence nor rigour. Add to this the serious lack of expertise in risk assessment, and we are sitting on an agri-biosecurity powder keg. These matters are fully attested to in four official Government of India reports. We have moved from dismal regulation in Bt cotton in 2002 to outright delinquency evident in the current plot to commercialise HT mustard. The regulation is subterranean, unconstitutional and also in contempt of Supreme Court orders pertaining to Bt brinjal/mustard.The HT mustard field trials, which were accessed under the Right to Information Act, are a revelation of regulatory shambles. This hybrid-making HT mustard, on the governments own admission in the Supreme Court, has not out-yielded our best non-GMO hybrids and varieties. Yet this is the notion sung in high decibels in an ever-increasing crescendo by the media.We must learn from the lessons of the history of hazardous technologies, DDT, asbestos, etc. But GMOs, critically, stand apart from these. GMOs are self-replicating organisms and genetic contamination of the environment, of non-GM crops and wild species through gene flow is certain: it cannot be contained, reversed, remedied or quantified. Our seed stock will also be contaminated at the molecular level. Any toxicity that there is will remain in perpetuity. The traits for disease, saline and drought resistance, yield, etc. are found in nature, not biotech labs. We must maintain Indias still-rich genetic diversity for the future of our agriculture."

Maharashtra government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the APMCs to enable them to earn higher profits.The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to bring in reforms in the farm sector to provide farmers an alternative to the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) to enable them to earn higher profits. The state government is consulting the Niti Aayog to usher in sweeping reforms, which would be long-lasting and provide an alternative to the present regulated Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee, sources in the ministry of agriculture told The Indian Express.Preliminary reports indicate that present markets cannot cope with the challenges of farmers striving to double their farm production and seek higher remuneration. Reforms that would be discussed in the Monsoon Session of the state legislature commencing from July 24, include deregulation of food grains from the APMC to provide more private and direct markets operating between farmers and consumers. The model suggested would be similar to the reforms in the vegetable and fruit markets where farmers have been provided with freedom to sell their goods outside the APMCs.While the government is not going to intervene in existing the APMC structures, it is trying to provide freedom to farmers to explore larger markets outside to fetch higher returns. According to a cabinet minister, a competitive food grain market on the lines of the vegetables and fruits markets would set the process for generating higher returns for the farmers.While acknowledging that the government would not shed its responsibility of procurement of food grains, the minister said: To begin with, we will bring the legislation to make non-implementation of MSP (Minimum Support Price) by traders a punishable act. Almost three farmers organisations that are in discussion with the government on the MSP have also demanded reforms in the APMCs, which often force farmers to sell crops at lower prices.There is a move to raise the number of vegetable and fruit markets from the present 48 to 100 across 36 districts of Maharashtra. Similarly, a larger network to channel the food grains to private markets in larger quantities is high on the government agenda.Today, the MSP is confined to foods grains and pulses. The list (MSP/quintal) is as follows: paddy (Rs 1470), jowar (Rs 1625), wheat (Rs 1625), maize (Rs 1365), bajra (Rs 1330), gram (Rs 4000), tur (Rs 5050), moong (Rs 5225), udit (Rs 5000), sunflower (Rs 3950), soyabean (Rs 2775), groundnut (Rs 4220), cotton (R 4160), safflower (Rs 3700), masoor (Rs 3900), ragi (Rs 1725), sesam (Rs5000); nigerseed (Rs 3825) and mustard ( Rs 3700). The prices of all the other crops, vegetables and fruits are driven by demand and supply, as per the markets.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

The scientists have pointed out their observations and said that the GEAC ignored serious issues.Some prominent scientists in the list include former vice chancellor of the PDKV University Sharad Nimbalkar, former pulses scientist PDKV Akola KB Wanjari, former director of Central Institute for Cotton Research (CICR) MS Kairon, ex-associate director research JNKV Jabalpur ND Raut, and former head of Botany department of Nagpur University AD Chaudhary.The letter says that the DMH-11 has dominant male sterility system based on Bar-Barnase-Barstar gene. But to make use of the sterile plants of female parent of hybrid sister plants in the female line are to salvaged by spraying herbicide 'Glufosinate Ammonia' (commercial name Basta) which is under patent regime of Bayer India Ltd.So far dominant male sterility has never been used in crop plants because it adversely affects the reproduction of the species.There are multiple threats to Indian agriculture if the Bar-Barnase-Barstar hybrid technology is allowed via DMH-11 in food crops. If this technology is approved in mustard, there is no ground to avoid its use in other food crops.It can lead to many detrimental effects like indiscriminate use of herbicide by farmers which may create new problems of resistance in weeds. Spread of dominant male sterility will endanger the indigenous germ plasm including high yielding crop varieties of all crops.Farmers will be attracted to such hybrids which will lead to monopoly of this herbicide. Seed production will be directly licensed by the MNCs holding IPR for herbicide Basta leading to monopolization of seeds of many food crops by the MNC.The herbicide is a known carcinogen and will affect farm workers and farmers. The entry of the carcinogen herbicide in food chain will affect both rural and urban population.The scientists also requested the PM to investigate and stop the release of HT transgenic hybrid to save Indian farmers from clutches of MNCs, avoid indiscriminate use of herbicide in near future, save indigenous high yielding varieties of crop plants and to save the Indian Brassica (mustard) germ plasm.In a nutshellWhile developing DMH-11, one of the Nagpur University mutant (EH2- early Hira 2 developed by Late Anil Khalatkar) was used by Pental in developing DMH-1 without giving any credit to the UniversityProduction of DMH-11 hybrid requires Basta herbicide spray which increases the production cost manifoldThere is virtually no need for a GM hybrid in mustard as the existing hybrids are much cheaperThe biosafety data of trials has not been put in public domain and certain data has been fabricated"

Pain is hard. Separation is hard. I hope that this is the conclusion of Syria's sorrows,"" he told AFP.He visited his children's graves as dusk fell, pulling out weeds from around their simple markers.Nearby, an elderly man crouched on the ground and rocked back and forth in silence while staring at a tombstone.The United Nations' chemical weapons watchdog, the OPCW, concluded last month that sarin was used as a chemical weapon in Khan Sheikhun.The report did not assign blame for the attack, but many -- from Western powers to the town's own residents -- put the blame squarely with the government of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad.""I had hoped that the pain would disappear with the overthrow of Bashar al-Assad and an end to the violence in Syria,"" Youssef told AFP, but today an end to the conflict is still nowhere in sight.Locals called for a general strike in the town, and shopkeepers closed their businesses to stand in solidarity with victims' families.Residents were ""trying to draw the international community's attention to the fact that the regime that committed this crime and most crimes in Syria remains free"", said Mohammad Ahmad Maarati, who heads the local administrative council.An joint OPCW-UN team will now be responsible for determining who carried out the attack on Khan Sheikhun.The team has already concluded that Syrian government forces were responsible for chlorine attacks on three villages in 2014 and 2015, and that the Islamic State used mustard gas in 2015."

I had stumbled upon the name while surfing the net. It sounded good, for on the menu were all kinds of interesting sandwiches and pasta dishes. But the problem was that I just couldnt find it.The address was 39 Meharchand Market. I found No. 39, but that was not an eatery. I walked up the stairs and knocked at a door, and found it locked. I came down, asked some peoplemost of whom were clueless. Then a good Samaritan asked me to try the back entry through a small lane behind the shops lining the main market. I followed the directions, and luckily found a small sticker that told me I was on the right track. I followed the sign, walked up a steep flight of stairsand finally I was in CJs Fresh.Interesting menuCJs Fresh is a take-away which does deliveries (Phone: 9910501234; email: fresh@cjsfresh.com). Run by a young lady called Chahat Jain, it has an interesting menuwith sandwiches, pasta, pizzas, burgers, fries, milkshakes and desserts. I had done my research, so I knew what I wanted even before I landed up there. I had seen a picture of a bowl of pasta with juicy pieces of bacon on it, so that was on top of my list. Then we had decided to have a vegetable sandwich, and a meaty one.The formercalled Getting Grilled (Rs. 280), comprised eggplant, zucchini, mushroom, cherry tomatoes, rocket leaves, smoked cheese, herbs and CJs secret sauce. The Ham and Cheddar Affiliation (Rs. 349 ) had roasted ham and melted cheddar cheese with aioli and herbs. The Carbonara Crewfor Rs. 349was a bacon, cheese and pasta dish.I got talking to a lady at the counter, and heard that the place was started by her daughter just four months ago. She had studied in the US, and had returned to India full of food plans. She now wants to start an outlet near Chhattarpur.It should prosper, for the sandwiches were excellent. The pasta was superb, creamy and cheesy, as Carbonara is meant to be, and the bacon pieces were juicy and plump and fried just right. I had asked for a wheat pasta preparation, so I felt quite healthydespite all the rich bits that had gone in itwhen I was done with it.Secret sauceThe sandwiches (grilled panini, focaccia or multigrain) were soft and full of goodies. The fillings were fresh, and the cheese had oozed nicely into the ham-and-cheddar sandwich. The veggie one had a burst of flavourswith rockets and cherry tomatoes complementing the smoothness of the smoked cheese. I dont know what their secret sauce is (its secret, so I didnt ask), but it certainly gave a zing to the sandwich.I am quite a burger fiend, so I want to try out CJs burgers one of these days. The descriptions sound good: Twisty Aloo Burger (Rs. 279) has a potato filling with mint mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, sauted onions and cheddar cheese; the Pork Pack (Rs. 379) consists of pulled pork tossed in sweet chipotle, pickled black olives and mozzarella and Gangsta Lamb (Rs. 399) has a lamb patty topped with a three cheese blend, pine nuts, caramelised onions, lettuce and herbs, in a special hung curd dip.The lady insisted that I try out a slice of their fresh cheesecake. I agreed, and found it delicious, though I thought it was somewhere in between a cheesecake and a souffl. The Cheesecake Monopoly is for Rs. 210, and they have, among other things, a peanut butter and white chocolate cookie coalition (Rs. 120 for two) and Mos Nutella Fried Oreos (Rs. 150 for 5 pieces).I like young people with big dreams, and hope their dreams all come to true. The secret sauce should do its bit."

Kesavan, also a Fellow of the NAAS, wrote that he disagreed with this endorsement. I believe the resolution of the NAAS is neither scientifically valid, nor ethical, and therefore not maintainable I suggest its withdrawal, he said.Mr. Kesavan, a senior fellow of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, said DMH-11 did not perform as well as several other varieties and mustard hybrids and that the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC), the Environment Ministry body that cleared DMH-11, was riddled by a conflict of interest. DMH-11 is a hybrid variety of mustard developed by crossing a traditional variety of mustard, called Varuna, and an East European variety.Mr. Kesavan emphasised that using genetically-modified technology to produce hybrid seed varieties was a failed experiment as evidenced by the experience of Bt cotton.Though the latter occupied 95% of Indias acreage, its yields were on the decline since 2006, largely due to insect resistance, and that it nearly tripled the cost of producing cotton between 2006-2013, he argued in his letter, a copy of which was sent to the PM as well.The NAAS  a 625-member body of agricultural scientists  had about 200 scientists in its quorum when it passed a resolution endorsing the GEACs decision to clear DMH-11 for commercial field trials.Mr. Singh told The Hindu that he would be replying to Mr. Kesavan but this would not affect the NAAS decision.Mr. Kesavan has raised these points earlier too. Wed asked members for any objections and there were none except for those raised by him. Its a unanimous decision, he said in a phone conversation.The GEAC, Indias apex regulator for genetically modified seeds, had cleared GM mustard for environmental release and use in farmer fields on May 11 this year.However, the approval is contingent on a final nod from Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan."

It had asked the Centre to collect public opinion before the release.The government had assured the court that there would be no commercial release of GM seeds till the views of the public were collected and placed before the appraisal committee.Sowing without safetyThe hearing was conducted on the basis of a petition filed by activist Aruna Rodrigues, who had alleged that the government was sowing GM seeds without the relevant tests.Mustard is one of Indias most important winter crops, sown between mid-October and late November.Advocate Prashant Bhushan, appearing for Ms. Rodrigues, alleged the government was sowing the seeds in various fields and that the bio-safety dossier, which has to be made public by putting it on the website, had not yet been done.Alleging that field trials were being carried out without the relevant tests, Mr. Bhushan had sought a 10-year moratorium on them."

'The bottom line for any biotechnology regulatory policy should be the safety of the environment, the well-being of farming families, the ecological and economic sustainability of farming systems, the health and nutrition security of consumers, safeguarding of home and external trade, and the biosecurity of our nation.'""Swaminathan said he had stressed that while evolving a regulatory policy, ""we should first find out whether the objective the breeder has could be achieved through non-GMO methods including marker assisted selection.""""I also pointed out that the recombinant DNA technology is best used for introducing characters related to drought, floods, coastal storms and other non-biotic stresses. In the case of biotic stresses including Bt cotton, there will be mutations and a need to replace the variety frequently.

The committee led a coalition of over 150 farmers' organisations on the march from a village in Mandsaur where six farmers had been shot by the police last month.They had two specific demands: a one-time loan waiver to make them debt-free and remunerative prices for their crops.A poignant note was added to the event by a skit performed by the children of the farmers who had committed suicide. One such child, Ashok Patil, told the gathering: ""I am suffering because my father committed suicide. But I want to tell all the farmers of this country that suicide is not an option -- the only option is to fight for our rights.""The protest will continue tomorrow with a ""potato andolan"". Potatoes will be distributed for free to press home the demand for fair pricing.MP Raju Shetty, Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and one of the main organisers along with Swaraj Abhiyan's Yoginder Yadav , said: ""The Narendra Modi government had promised to waive the loans of farmers but later said it wasn't possible. We have not been told what's the alternative."" Shetty said he had campaigned for Modi expecting this promise to be fulfilled.Dr. Sunilam, moderator of the Sansad, demanded that action must be taken against the police officers who had shot the six farmers. Civil activist Prashant Bhushan added: ""The latest schemes of the government have become anti-farmer and pro-corporate. The government supports products such as GM mustard which benefit the corporates but destroy farming. The government also gives the corporates a lot of leeway with their debts which is not offered to the farmers.""""It is not the farmers that are under debt but the whole country that is under the debt of the farmers,"" said Yadav. ""We are not asking for a debt waiver but freedom from debt.""Social activist Medha Patkar, CPI-M leader Sitaram Yechury and Shiv Sena MP Arvind Sawant were among those who attended the protest."

Now, there's very little support for the traditional sport, since the focus is on Oympics-rules wrestling reports, straight from the dangal sidelines Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose , Benoy, Badal and Dinesh used to regularly come here, and this place was a regular haunt of freedom fightersNone other than the great Dara Singh used to come here and practice in the mud pits, along with famous pehlwans like Anta Pehlwan, Baru Pehlwan, Bhagwandas Pehlwan and Basantu Pehlwan; this was the meeting place of legendsSuch stories  maybe apocryphal, maybe not, who knows  are common in the dark and dank kushti akhadas of Kolkata, where the smell of sweat on glistening, muscled bodies becomes inseparable from the aroma of freshly dug earth, and where harsh realities are woven with the stuff of legend. Kolkata, even two decades ago, used to be the centre of traditional kushti, with pehlwans from all over the world making a beeline to its akhadas to participate in high-voltage dangals (kushti competitions).Today, only six mud-pit akhadas survive, all located within a two-kilometre radius of Burrabazar. Save for three of these, where mud wrestling still happens, the others are almost gone, save for the one day of the year  Nagpanchami  when all six of them come alive. Traditionally, Nagpanchami is the day when dangals are organized in akhadas all over the country, and the ones here are no exception. From the early hours of July 27, you will get to see a ringside view of pehlwans grappling with and pinning each other down in rare 'dav-pench' grips, that will definitely bring back flashes of the Aamir Khan-starrer that stirred imaginations even as far as distant China. Only, this is not reel life, but as real as it gets.Times have changed, rue practitioners of this traditional sport. Today's generation feels mud-wrestling is a colossal waste of time, an unfashionable option for keeping fit. A large number of akhadas, thus, have turned into gyms where young boys go for weight training. And there's a very tangible class difference: the more money you have, the fancier the gym you go to.The very few senior pehlwans who still cannot do without their morning and evening regimen of mud-wrestling, say that in the heydays of kushti, such class distinctions did not exist. North Kolkata was home to the rich gentry and the young scions of the most powerful families like the Tagores, Debs, Lahas, Mitras and Mullicks got trained under the akhada pehlwans. While pehlwans mostly visited their homes, it was not uncommon to see the nobility in horse-drawn carriages and, later, in motor cars, waiting outside akhadas for training sessions and also competitions. Keeping fit through wrestling was a part of the rich man's daily regimen and there are many stories about Rabindranath himself and his brothers, Swami Vivekananda and, later, Netaji and other freedom fighters being avid wrestlers. Gobor Goho, a traditional wrestler in the first decades of the 20th century in Kolkata, stunned the world when he became the first Asian to win the World Light Heavyweight Championship in the US in 1921. The mud-pit akhada that Goho used was set up by his great-grandfather at Masjidbari Street, which still exists and is maintained by the family.Cotton Street is a nondescript narrow lane, dark and dingy, not comfortable for a four-wheeler. But you will be surprised when you have crossed the threshold of the centuries old building at 126, Cotton Street and come face-to-face with one of the oldest akhadas of the country, maintained by the Yoganand Puri Math. Kushti practice starts here from as early as 4.30am and interestingly, most of those who come for their daily dose of exercise are pehlwans in their late 60s and 70s. Bhagwandas Kewat (72), a pehlwan from Varanasi, is a case in point. He is the seniormost guru here, who will tell you of the many wrestlers he has trained all his life. ""Today, very few akhadas with mud pits are left. It is a dying tradition. Those who are still becoming wrestlers are joining the different clubs where they can learn on mats, following Olympics rules. So we are being forced to send our best boys for training on the mat in clubs,"" he says. Bhagwandas shuttles between Varanasi and Kolkata and is often called to referee in the traditional wrestling circuits of Delhi, Haryana and UP, where mud wrestling competitions are still extremely popular in rural areas.The site is home to hectic activity as the pit is being prepared for the big occasion on Nagpanchami. Ganga mitti is being brought in and mixed with the existing mud that has been turned in to make it supple yet firm, just the right consistency for mud-wrestling, so that one doesn't slip and fall while taking position. There is a ratio of water, milk, red ochre, multani mitti, buttermilk, mustard oil, sandal powder, ghee, neem leaves and flower petals that are mixed into this mud to prepare it for competitions. One sees the 24-year-old Raja Singh, who has joined hands with the others at the akhada to prepare the soil, since pehlwans do this work themselves as labourers are not allowed to enter the ring.Raja is a state-level wrestling champion and trains on the mat at a nearby club at Jorabagan, registered with the West Bengal Olympic Wrestling Association. ""We also have Rohit Singh, who is the national No. 4 now. We are happy that these talented pehlwans have not left mud-wrestling. But since there is no patronage or recognition for us in Bengal, we will not survive very long. Elsewhere in north India, though we are not allowed to send mud wrestlers for state/national championships, there is no dearth of local competitions and adulation that keep us, the traditional pehlwans, alive,"" says aide Manoj Sonkar, the akhada's caretaker.Adjacent to Tarasundari Park, not too far from here, is the Arjun Vyayamshaala, named after the legendary pehlwan Arjun Singh, who was a freedom fighter and was known to have been close to Netaji. Arjun Pehlwan of the Benaras gharana has gone down in history for leading freedom fighters against the Simon Commission in 1928. The akhada was frequented by freedom fighters and Netaji's name features on top of the list along with that of Benoy, Badal and Dinesh. ""We maintain the mud pit ourselves and are all set for Nagpanchami. At least 50 pehlwans have already confirmed participation and we will have drums and desi-style cymbals, along with pipes playing full throttle as the pehlwans go for their choicest dao-pench. In traditional kushti, we have barilla dao, kainchia dao, kanpattiya dao and then the very challenging dhobi pachhad,"" says Hanuman Pehlwan, the guru of the akhada, showing off his 48-inch chest which, he says, was the result of a daily rigorous routine of five hours of kushti.Ask anyone near Machhua who Nandu Paanwala is, and you will be led to this 72-year-old man with a smiling face, lacing one paan after another with lime and supari, as his customers keep swelling around his perch. One look at him will tell you that he is a wrestler, and he is very pleased to talk about kushti, keeping aside paan, his other love. At 4.30am, you will find him wrestling his mate, Jwala Pehlwan, on the banks of the Hooghly at the mud pit of Mullickghat, or the Jagannath Ghat flower market. The Siyaram Akhara has been here for the past 60 years, but before that, it has existed at Burrabazar's Dhakaputty since the late 18th century. The akhada is associated with famous names in pehlwani like Nathmal Parikh and Siyaram Pehlwan, and has seen traditional wrestlers like Bansi Singh of Chhapra, Puransingh of Punjab, Baramdeb Mishra of Gorakhpur come and practice regularly. Jwala Pehlwan stays in rooms adjacent to the akhada on the ghat itself and opens the pit with a daily puja before dawn. He hails from Gorakhpur, which remains one of the country's major kushti hubs. Jwala cannot stand the comparison between traditional and competitive wrestling. ""Mud wrestling is India's original strength. The state and the Centre should have patronized it at the competitive level. Instead, it is just the Olympics-approved mat wrestling that is being promoted. There is no reason to think that mud wrestlers do not have the skill for mat wrestling. There is just a slight difference in technique, because while in mud pits the winner has to pin down the opponent holding his back flat on the mud, in case of mat wrestling the winner has to win points on every move as he advances towards the finish,"" Jwala explains.So is he, an ace mud wrestler, able to perform on the mat? ""Of course I can. Between 1991 and 2000, I was the Bengal champion in the 74kg, 85kg, 82kg and 97kg categories. In the national circuit, I have won against BSF and CRPF,"" says Jwala, who is in his late 60s. ""The idea is to learn the technique on mud, gain strength there and then practise the acquired skill on the mat. I did it myself and made my son do it too,"" he adds. Suraj Kant Tewari has been Bengal champion from the time he competed in the 30kg championship to the time he went on to be 62kg, and ranks fourth nationally.The mud-pit akhadas are crying out for support and recognition that is hard to come by at a time when even competitive wrestling is finding it difficult to get patronage and state support. ""Five years ago, we were promised state recognition that would have got us special grants from the Sports Authority of India (SAI). But it is yet to come,"" rues Asit Saha, former national-level wrestler and secretary of Panchanan Byayam Samity, a 150-year-old club at Jorabagan, which switched over to mat wrestling decades ago, to enter the national and international competition circuit following Olympic norms. Today, young wrestlers who might have started out at traditional akhadas but want to take up career wrestling come to this club to practice and learn the skills required to wrestle on the mat. ""Below our expensive mat, we still have the mud arena. But it is of no use today because we would have also met with a slow death had we not changed,"" Saha says. He belongs to a family of wrestlers that produced names like Sudhir Chandra Saha, the chief coach of the country at the Tokyo Olympics. Saha himself remained a state champion for 14 years uninterrupted and won silver in the national circuit and later trained as a coach from Iran.The club doubles up as the West Bengal Wrestling Association, recognized by SAI, and has won 36 golds in national championships till date, apart from its biggest achievement  sending wrestlers K P Roy and Niranjan Das to the 1948 and 1952 Olympics. ""Mud akhadas are our tradition, but its style is distinctly different from the demands of the Olympics, which had laid out its mat rules way back in 1804. A person trained on the mud pit might have great skills but tends to lose grip on the mat. We have time limits and points attached to specific moves  pinning down the opponent gets you four points, getting him down with knees on the ground gets you two points and 'suplex' gets you a full five. Traditional wrestlers have to get used to the Greco-Roman style,"" he explains. Pehlwans pooh-pooh this, pointing out that they too have their inimitable dao-pench like the barilla dao, kainchia dao, kanpattiya dao and finally the dhobi pachhad, where the winner picks the opponent up and smashes him on the mud.While crisis has hit the mud akhadas of Bengal, the scene is quite different in rural north India, where dangals are organized as weekend entertainment and a lot of money spins around it which, in turn, helps keep both pehlwans and akhadas in good shape. ""I have been scouring akhadas in Haryana and UP to find out new ways to run and maintain our heritage mud akhada,"" says Indroneel Goho, Gobor Goho's grandson. The akhada that this family owns, off Beadon Street, is perhaps the best maintained mud akhada of the city, but Goho rues that though it has been churning out wrestlers, they are not able to enter state- or national-level championships because of lack of mat training.""Perhaps we need to modernize a bit, without breaking off with our heritage/tradition,"" Goho says."

It is mostly used for flavouring curries owing to its fragrance.Kabab chini is popularly known as Allspice in English because it smells like a combination of spices including cloves, black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg.It plays a vital role in culinary arts; it is used as a tenderiser and preservative, and to give flavour and colour. Kebab chini is also widely used in potpourri.This spice has a longer shelf life as whole fruits, so in most kitchens, they are powdered right before cooking.Kebab chini plays a vital role in garam masala; if you are making 1 kg of garam masala, the amount of kebab chini used will be 15g.Gosht Ka Taar KormaIngredientsGhee - 7 gMustard oil - 5 gWhole garammasala - 2 gOnion - 10 gGinger garlic paste - 2 gTurmeric - 2 gCoriander powder - 7 gResham patti - 2 gLamb nalli - 90 gPaya stock - 100 gCurd - 7 gGaram masala - 2 gRose water - 2 gFennel - 2 gSaffron - 2 gMace cardamompowder - 2 gBoti - 90 gSaltMethod:-For Stock Burn the paya on a burner to get rid of the hair on it Wash the paya well, put it in a stock pot filled with water Boil; Get rid of the water after the first boil to get rid of the impurities With fresh water, re boil the paya.

5a0b56529855b76bf13ce55d,The lowdown on minimum support price for crops,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/the-lowdown-on-minimum-support-price-for-crops/article19334423.ece,2017-07-23,"Amid farmers unrest in many parts of the country, the demand for an increase in minimum support price (MSP) has been voiced regularly. A part of the agricultural price policy, MSP is the price at which the government offers to procure farmers produce during the season. While farmers are free to sell their produce to government agencies or in the open market, it is when market prices fall below the MSP that government agencies step in to buy the crop to protect the growers. Also, the aim is to safeguard the interest of the consumer by ensuring supplies at a reasonable price.The Cabinet Committee of Economic Affairs announces the MSP at the start of each sowing season, taking into account the recommendations of the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). The key considerations, while recommending the MSP for crops, are demand and supply, production cost, price trends in the domestic and international market and the likely implications of the price on consumers. The CACPs recommendations are in the form of price policy reports every year, separately for five groups of commodities: kharif crops, rabi crops, sugarcane, raw jute and copra. At present, agricultural commodities for which MSP is given include paddy, wheat, maize, sorghum, pearl millet, barley, ragi, gram, tur, moong, urad, lentil, groundnut, rapeseed-mustard, soyabean, sesamum, sunflower, safflower, nigerseed, copra, sugarcane, cotton and raw jute.Recognising the need to evolve a balanced and integrated price structure to serve the interests of both producers (farmers) and consumers, the Union government set up a committee on August 1, 1964 to advise the Agriculture Ministry to determine the prices of rice and wheat. The domain of coverage was expanded to coarse cereals. Later, the government decided to set up a permanent body, called the Agricultural Prices Commission, in 1965. This was renamed as the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices in 1985. To ensure remunerative price to farmers, the government procured 38.65 million tonnes of rice, 22.93 million tonnes of wheat and 1.3 million tonnes of pulses during 2016-17 in various States.The key purpose of the governments price support policy is to provide a fair return to efficient farmers and to protect the interests of consumers by keeping the prices of food and other agriculture commodities at reasonable levels. Agricultural commodities are prone to price fluctuations: while a farmer may get a handsome return for his produce in a short supply scenario, the same commodity may fetch him a poor price during years of bumper production. MSP ensures that farmers get a minimum price for their produce in unfavourable market conditions. Also with MSP, farmers are incentivised to grow crops, which are short in supply. In the absence of support price, farmers may not find certain crops lucrative, which would lead to poor production, resulting in high prices. The MSP works as a tool to stabilise production and control consumer prices and sounds good, but farmers across the country have been facing problems of selling their produce at the minimum support price.Agricultural experts point out that there is hardly any dependable mechanism of government procurement for crops on the MSP in most parts of the country. Problems like delay in the setting up of procurement centres, exploitation by commission agents ( Arthiyas ), who most of the time buy the produce from farmers below MSP on one pretext or the other, defeat its purpose. Farming for a majority of small and marginal farmers has not been remunerative. Even though the long-term answer to farmers indebtedness and distress is a rise in their income, the government till then should either purchase all major crops at the MSP, as is done in the case of wheat and rice in Punjab and Haryana, or subsidise the input costs. The concern that a rise in MSP would push up the prices seems unfounded. Taking advantage of the complexities in the supply chain, middlemen appear to be causing disparities in the price. Theres a gap between the price of the produce got from the farmer and the price it is sold to the consumer.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

""But, look at the cost and output. Organic vegetables, grains or fruits are not for the poor. It is the rich man's food. After investing so much, the yield is not enough to feed the whole country.""But if technology is used in farming, then the use of pesticides too will reduce, he said. ""GM crops too are pesticide-free. Look at Bt cotton, not only the technology has helped us tackle the problem of bollworms but also increased the yield. The size of flower is increased,"" Sesikeran said.Sesikeran said in every technology there is a risk and we need a plan to manage it. ""The government should have made a risk management plan. If I tell you how harmful the cellular radiation is, will you stop using mobile? No. You may adopt preventive measures.

Mustard is one of Indias most important winter crops, which is sown between mid-October and late November.Her counsel, advocate Prashant Bhushan pointed to the top court-appointed expert committees report and said the panel had held against cultivation of crop engineered to tolerate Herbicide, including HT Mustard and its parent lines. The Technical Expert Committee (TEC) had also said no GM seed should be allowed for which India is Centre of origin or centre of biodiversity.Thirdly, Bhushan argued, the regulatory body is riddled with conflict of interest. Therefore, he questioned the permission granted to the commercial release of GM Mustard.Although Mehta tried to convince the court that the government was still considering the commercial release of the crop and had not taken any final decision, the court asked him to supply scientific data to support the regulators approval.What he (Bhushan) is saying is that he is also supported by our panels report.

The situation is equally distressful in states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh.Soon after daybreak, driving through the forests of Sonitpur district in Assam in late 2005 we made a quick U-turn when a herd of around 15-20 elephants, young ones in tow, emerged from the forest to forage right next to the road leading to the fishing camp at the Nameri Tiger Reserve. The night before, we watched as elephants raided paddy stocks in a village near Balipara, unafraid of the mashaals (fire torches), drums and yells of the distressed villagers. Even as we turned, the matriarch followed our vehicle for 20 metres or so, trumpeting protectively from around 30 metres to make sure we got her message loud and clear.I know this part of India well and before my eyes, I have seen some of Indias most precious forests sacrificed to satiate political expediency using mistaken notions of tribal rights as a fig leaf to exchange land for votes. On a site visit to the same area 10 years later, I found myself speechless at the sheer destruction. In a decade, virtually the entire standing forest on the right bank of the Jiya Bharoli river had vanished. In its place were sparse mustard fields and scattered tree stumps that spoke of once-tall hardwoods whose trunk girth would have been three or four metres at the very least.Similar stories unfold across vast areas of Sonitpur. We had predicted such disaster when the Forest Rights Bill was being debated way back in 2004-05. We asked, at the very least, a consensus be arrived at that individual rights not be included. A leading NGO, Kalpavriksh, amongst the most vociferous supporters of the flawed FRA, agreed with us in principle but went forward with other groups who threw such suggestions to the wind. Today, much too late, Kalpavriksh agrees that a site-specific amendment to Section 3 (1) of the Forest Rights Act (FRA), 2006, should have been made in Sonitpur to roll back the 2005 cut-off date to 1980, in consonance with the Forest Conservation Act. Subsequent to that admission, no further action was taken.As we have seen happen time and again with urban slum rehabilitation and regularisation schemes, the horse had bolted. The barn door was never shut. What ails the FRA?To begin with, the Act was intended only for tribal communities, but this was later extended to all forest dwellers. Second, individual rights trumped community rights which is evident from the statistics taken from the website of the ministry of tribal affairs from the report on FRA implementation. According to these statistics, people are predictably keen to claim individual rights as this enables them to encash real estate and other financial opportunities. Third, no time limit was definitively set. Had a cut-off date been effectively applied, we would not be in a position where even today deforest, encroach and claim rights continue unabated because gram sabhas would have finalised all rights within two years. And the date was 1980 in the first version of the bill.Here is what the learned Supreme Court judges had to say in an order passed in response to Writ Petition(s)(Civil) No(s) 109/2008 and 50/2008.Mr Shyam Divan, learned senior counsel for the petitioner placed before us certain statistical data which indicates that as on September 30, 2015, approximately 44 lakh claims for recognition of the rights under the above-mentioned Act and grant of pattas came to be filed before the authorities competent to deal with those claims in various states out of which some of the claims were accepted and some were rejected. From the information placed before this court by the petitioners, it appears, approximately 20.5 lakh claims were rejected in the above-mentioned 44 lakh claims. Obviously, a claim in the context of the above-mentioned Act is based on an assertion that a claimant has been in possession of a certain parcel of land located in the forest areas. If the claim is found to be not tenable by the competent authority, the result would be that the claimant is not entitled for the grant of any patta or any other right under the Act but such a claimant is also either required to be evicted from that parcel of land or some other action is to be taken in accordance with law.Nevertheless, encroachers are not being evicted even after their claims have been rejected. What is more, most lands allotted are unfit for agriculture, condemning claimants to work as landless labour on the properties of richer landholders. The allotment of such lands means that the tribal families have to survive on sustenance farming without access to water, sanitation, health, education and medical facilities.Even today, the cutting of trees continues. None of the cutting was or is legal. The tribals never had and still do not have title to the land. The elephant herds have vanished, but every once in a while, they return to raid crops. As many as 30 were poisoned in Sonitpur by angry farmers. Neither humans nor elephants are safe any longer. The Kameng-Sonitpur Elephant Reserve (KSER) offers refuge to elephants, in a small measure, but almost daily, as a direct result of human interventions, reports of wild elephant herds creating havoc in Sonitpur, appear in the media.The situation is equally distressful in states such as Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar, Orissa and Andhra Pradesh. Here, too, in order to grow food on forestlands, locals were encouraged to deforest areas with political patronage. The objective is achieved by burning trees and ground vegetation, then planting food crops on the ash-fertilised remains. But, because the vast bulk of the forest nutrients are quickly washed or blown away, such farms are incapable of offering anything more than borderline livelihoods to farmers. This is precisely what gave rise to marginal farming, coined by economists to describe millions condemned to penury. Far from creating self-sufficiency, this has ended up eroding Indias food security, in part because downstream farms find themselves deprived of the flood, drought-control and nutrient-spread gifted by upstream forests.As I write, the discussion seems Daliesque. The FRA provides a 90-day limit for filing claims. The Act was passed in 2005 (Rules in 2007). Can we seriously be discussing new claims even today? Surely we should collectively agree that no limits be allowed or extended under any circumstances? Remember, that our protected area network barely covers three per cent of our land and acts as an insurance against climate change, floods and droughts. Under no circumstances should such lands be open to the claim of any private rights whatsoever. In fact, it is vital that the long-pending rules to define Critical Wildlife Habitats be framed without further delay and that those deemed to be encroachers vacate such biodiverse lands.Social activists and wildlife groups must both accept that no rights can be championed, nor wildlife saved, if the forests at the centre of the tussle vanish. Social activists talk of harmonious co-existence. But I ask  can 6,000 people live in harmony in 600 sq km with 60 tigers and over 600 elephants with the nearest market for forest produce being six km away? Given that the FRA is a reality and without going into the merits or demerits of the legislation itself, I wonder whether it might be possible for those living next to forests to form cooperatives with the singular purpose of restoring eco-systems back to health on their own lands. This may be easier said than done, but it is possible if a basket of benefits can be channelled to communities that opt for eco-system farming, instead of bajra, wheat or paddy. If this is achieved, the answer to the rhetorical question Can the Forest Rights and Wildlife (Protection) Acts be friends? might well be Yes!. But I am not holding my breath.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

These included a proposal for legal action on farmers using the glufosinate-based herbicide (Basta) on the crop unless otherwise approved by the Central Insecticides Board and Registration Committee.In response to an RTI query, the GEAC has provided minutes of the sub-committees May 11, 2017 meeting. The minutes, accessed by The Hindu, reflect an apprehension that farmers may use herbicides to kill weeds that grow in crops of herbicide-tolerant GM Mustard.Detrimental to humansGlufosinate-based herbicides act as a neurotoxin and have adverse impacts on humans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Health.To a query on how the GEAC proposes to ensure adherence to its recommendations, GEAC sub-committee member C.R. Babu, also Director of the Centre for Environmental Management of Degraded Ecosystems, University of Delhi, told The Hindu that the Ministry of Environment and Forests was contemplating setting up a system to monitor the planting of GM mustard seeds when commercially released.Bt cotton lessonsHowever, anti-GM activists question how effective such regulation will be, drawing attention to the experience with Bt cotton, the countrys first and only commercially released GM crop. The GEAC had recommended plant refuges wherever Bt cotton was planted to ensure pests did not develop resistance to the Bt toxin.In the case of Bt cotton the governments record of ensuring adherence to recommendations has been very poor, said Kavitha Kuruganti, activist and convenor of ASHA (Alliance for Sustainable & Holistic Agriculture).On Monday, the Centre submitted to the Supreme Court that it would file its affidavit on its preparedness for commercial release of GM Mustard on July 29. The Supreme Court has asked the government to stay the commercial release of GM mustard until it does so."

Even allergy to dal items also seems to be uncommon, states 'A cross sectional study of the profile of food allergy among patients with chronic urticaria in Kerala'.The study was conducted by the department of pulmonary medicine, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, to identify the skin sensitivity to various food allergens in patients with chronic urticaria and to analyse the regional pattern of food allergy in Kerala. The study shows that 98% of patients with chronic urticaria had some form of food allergy. The common offending food allergens were wheat (28%), garlic (22%), ground nut (20%), cashew nut (18%), prawns (17%), ginger (16%), peas (12%) and black pepper (10%).""Food allergy can occur in isolation or in association with various clinical conditions such as chronic urticaria. The prevalence of food allergy is on the rise, owing probably to the changing food habits, multiplicity of food items with innumerable components and overuse of food additives and colouring agents. Identifying the offending allergens and avoidance is one of the most important measures which may help in the management of skin allergy,"" said Dr Venugopal Panicker, additional professor, department of pulmonary medicine, Government TD Medical College, Alappuzha, and one of the authors of the study.Urticaria, also called hives or wheals, is a common disorder with a prevalence of around 15%-20% in the general population, with patient complaining of severe itching and redness of the skin. The itching of the skin in case of chronic urticaria is more prominent at night. Prevalence of chronic urticaria is around 1% in general population and both children and adults can develop it. Women are affected twice as often as men and the common age group affected is between 30 and 50 years.Published in the Journal of Evidence Based Medicine and Healthcare (JEBMH), the study selected 100 patients with chronic urticaria who had predisposition towards developing certain allergic hypersensitivity reactions.""The treatment of chronic urticaria is challenging and if the aetiology is food allergy, the patients can lead a normal life by simply avoiding the offending foods and its components. Almost 79% patients with food allergy are allergic to multiple allergens,"" added Dr Panicker."

Bhushan said a Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report has pointed out that the entire regulatory system was in shambles and a 10-year moratorium should be given.Rodrigues had filed the plea seeking a stay on the commercial release of Genetically Modified (GM) Mustard crop and prohibition of its open field trials.He had also urged the court to prohibit open field trials and commercial release of Herbicide Tolerant (HT) crops including HT Mustard DMH 11 and its parent lines/variants as recommended by the Technical Expert Committee (TEC) report."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, July 31: Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal will apprise Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the state's requirement for Rs 2,393 crore to repair infrastructure, including major breaches in embankments caused by the Brahmaputra and other rivers. An official source said according to a preliminary assessment made by the state government, of the Rs 2,939 crore, about Rs 1,800 crore would be required to repair and strengthen embankments and initiate flood control measures. The Prime Minister will chair a series of high-level meetings to review the situation and the relief operations in the northeastern states, particularly in Assam, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Manipur. Chief ministers and senior officials of these states will be present at the meetings. The Tai Ahom Yuba Parishad, Assam, today appealed to the Prime Minister to visit the flood-affected areas and meet those still living in refugee camps, instead of taking an aerial route during his visit to the state tomorrow. The Parishad said time has elapsed since the last wave of floods unleashed by the waters of the Ranganadi dam and the floodwaters have receded. An aerial view will not reveal the magnitude of suffering that the people have undergone. A vast area of agricultural land in Lakhimpur district has been covered by silt. The role of the Ranganadi Hydroelectric Project in Arunachal Pradesh in the recent wave of floods in Lakhimpur was discussed by the organisation. Tai Ahom Yuba Parishad officials in Guwahati on Monday. Picture by UB Photos In a meeting of departments of the state government on July 3, 2010, several recommendations were made to Neepco. But these measures were not implemented in full, leading to the disaster this year, alleged the Parishad. It sought punitive measures against Neepco officials. Speaking at a press meet here today, the Parishad's publicity secretary, Dharmakanta Gogoi, said, ""The Prime Minister would not have come to Assam if the Gujarat floods had not happened and had he not gone there in the first place. After visiting Gujarat, he has been forced to come to Assam but after 22 days of the last wave of floods to hit Lakhimpur district, he will not be able to realise the suffering of the people. He should go to the flood-affected places by road and meet the people. He should visit places like Lakhimpur, Majuli, Morigaon and Kaziranga. ""A package of Rs 1,000 crore for the state and special relief package of Rs 200 crore to the worst-affected Lakhimpur district should be announced by the Prime Minister. It is a shame that the state government has distributed relief materials consisting of a total of only 4kg rice, two litres of water, one litre of mustard oil and a tarpaulin for 22 days. Can a family live on 4kg rice for 22 days? Moreover, neither the chief minister, Sarbananda Sonowal, nor the local MLA Utpal Dutta, or the MP, Pradan Barua, has visited Lakhimpur till date,"" added Gogoi. The organisation has raised several demands like announcement of the state flood problem as a national problem, a Rs 1,000-crore flood relief package for the state, special package of Rs 200 crore for Lakhimpur district, shutdown of the Ranganadi project, compensation to those who have lost their houses, compensation and food for two years to farmers whose fields have been covered with silt, punitive action against Neepco officials and investigation into alleged deviation from norms in the construction of the Rs 361 crore embankment on the Ranganadi river. Assam BJP president Ranjeet Kumar Dass today said no special reception will be arranged for Modi during his visit to Assam tomorrow. Only six or seven members of the state unit will receive the Prime Minister at Lokpriya Gopinath Bordoloi International Airport. ""We have received instructions from the Prime Minister's Office not to arrange any reception programme for him. The PMO's office said Modi is coming to Assam only to review the flood situation. This way, he will pay homage to those who lost their lives in the flood,"" said Dass. ""By this decision Modi has shown his love for the people of Assam. In the previous government, no Prime Minister had taken such a stern decision,"" he added. Dass said the state government had prepared an audio-visual presentation on the flood situation."

Keeping up with the tradition of his ustad, Ansar trains his students for free. Thirty five-year-old Gafar, who has been training for the past 10 years, says that he would choose a garadi mane any day over a gymnasium. ""I have been training here for the past 10 years and I feel this is way better than any gym. Gyms only help you bulk up but kushti increases your stamina, builds your muscles, and physically makes you strong,"" he says.Thirty one-year-old Naeem adds that there is no point training at a gym. ""If you train at a gym, you blow up like a balloon. When we practice here, our upper body gains a lot of strength and also helps strengthen our muscles,"" he says. In the midst of all the chatter of 'why akhadas are better than gyms', we hear one of the pehalwans say that passion drives him to be here. Query him about it and he says, ""It is my passion. I like training here. This place offers you things that a gym can't. My family members trained here and so do I,"" says 17-year-old Farooq. Ansar also trains school kids, who are seen at the akhada after school hours. ""They see all these boys practicing and at a young age they get drawn to the art of wrestling ,"" says Ansar.At another location in Vasanthnagar, ex-Army officer and chief coach and in-charge at Karnataka Vyamshala, MR Sharma explains to us the different formats of the game. ""There are usually two forms of wrestling  mud and mat. Mud wrestling is the traditional form and only two countries conduct competition in this form  India and Pakistan. At the international level, competitions are held in the mat wrestling format,"" he explains.Unlike other southern states, Karnataka has plenty of competitions for budding and professional wrestlers, which encourages them and also keeps the traditional form of wrestling alive. ""Competitions are usually held in Mysuru, Belagavi, Dharwad and other districts,"" says Sharma. Ansar's students agree and say that it is a boost for them when they win or even just participate in competitions. ""The winners as well as participants get cash prize, which is a big thing for us,"" adds Ansar's student Irfan.However, with less or no support from the government, the local akhadas struggle on their own. ""Most of them, who come here to train, are either students or working professionals. They either have support from their parents or donate whatever amount they are comfortable with,"" adds Aiyaaz, Ansar's nephew, who helps in the maintenance of the akhada with his uncle.Similarly, Sharma says that though there are centres for boys and girls in the state at different locations with better facilities, more is needed from the government. The Karnataka Vyamshala at Vasanthnagar, is devoid of a covered stage, laments Sharma. ""If I have to train girls for the mat format, I have to spread a tarpaulin sheet over the mud pit and then continue,"" he adds.So do movies like Dangal and Sultan help the sport we ask? ""Absolutely. In fact once Dangal had released, I had a lot of school girls come up to me and enquire about the sport. In a way, it helped create some awareness. I feel we need such films, as movies reach out to a wider audience,"" he sums up.The mud that is used for the wrestling pit is also different and not what we come across daily. Most of the times, the mud is procured from Devanahalli or from the outskirts of the city. What makes it different is the addition of ingredients like coconut or mustard oil, kumkum, sandalwood powder and tumeric that gives it a smooth texture. The mud also has anti-bacterial properties, we are told.VEGETARIANSharma suggests vegetarian diet for his students that includes daliya (broken wheat), milk, desi ghee, butter, dal, almonds and vegetables.

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"
5a1134039855b76bf13ddf95,A persistent dilemma,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170805/jsp/opinion/story_165524.jsp,2017-08-05,"If Mirage Art Gallery favoured for its recent summer show craft over concept, illusionism over abstraction, earnestness over irreverence, it's because it shares with many a struggling artist a classic, persistent dilemma: whom to serve, Muse or market? Because, all too often in the modern age, they can't seem to co-exist. Therefore you find that quite a few artists represented here, whether known or unknown, are stalked by the spectre of past stalwarts such as Hemen Majumdar, Bikash Bhattacharjee and Suhas Roy whose women - whether teasingly draped in wet cloth; provocatively sultry; or fetchingly vulnerable - have an enduring appeal for deep pockets. Surprisingly enough, even an established senior does a Bikash in conte (or is it meant as a homage...?) But why only past artists? The spectacular craft of a contemporary Zeuxis is dazzling many youngsters into imitation. Which, of course, means that, happily enough, these trompe l'oeil-ists don't necessarily lack skill, only the spirit of dare. But then, skill of a high order is rare. And then there's the tendency to fall back on the safety net of religious imagery afflicting some others. It's not surprising to find a sucrose Krishna here, a marble Ganesh there, a painted copy of a Shiva sculpture elsewhere, and so forth. However, Sanatan Dinda gets away with his Yugpurush simply on the strength of his craft. And yet some not-so-known names - Sudip Karmakar, Subrata Pal, Samir Paul, Satyabrata Karmakar, for example - have resisted this kind of conscious pandering to likely buyers, even if that means serving up unpretentious exercises: simple scenes, landscapes, the Varanasi ghat. What's to be noted here is that these complaints reflect less on artists anxious to break even - for the input cost isn't negligible - than on a community with a skewed distribution of informed taste and dispensable means. It's not that this mixed collection of some 76 works from about 40 or so artists doesn't reward the viewer who knows how to skim, skip and concentrate. Indeed, there is some fine work, both from reputed seniors and from the younger ones. For example, Prakash Karmakar's two small drawings of disarming simplicity with brusque black lines and cross-hatching on white, are to be cited. Particularly, Seascope 2. Rabin Mandal's mask-like Face 2, with its rugged outlines and thick jabs of mustard and black acrylic, is another case in point. Dhiraj Choudhury's sketchy strokes have this intrinsic ebullience. And an artist from the generation after theirs, Samir Aich, enquires into form in intriguing permutations, the inert and the organic mimicking each other in one work. Another, the best of his lot here, brings into the sensuous shape of an apple, an impish dimension of eroticism: something of a standard visual trope but given an individual touch by the artist. Such lessons in economy, in knowing how much is just enough, don't seem to hold back even a successful artist like Subrata Gangopadhyay, whose over-wrought allegory in Resurrection, romantic and political, hardly does justice to his undoubted skill. If Ajoy Banerjee and Gourango Beshai seem quite enchanted by Ravi Verma and Hemen Majumdar, respectively, Partha Bhattacharjee's oil is descended from Majumdar via Bikash Bhattacharjee. Nitya Kundu's Bengal School stylization isn't without a quaint charm, while Debabrata Chakrabarti's scrappy paint gives to his Horse Power the look of an ageing fresco. Juthika Sengupta, strangely enough, is represented by two works of differing standards. The one with promise portrays an adolescent girl. The patchwork of speckled, impasto acrylic strokes of the dress asks to be explored in imaginative ways. An artist who stands out as a fluent abstractionist is Babita Das. Perhaps the best among the not-so-known names is Gautam Pramanick who senses the endless possibilities of a traditional genre, the landscape. His palette - blues, greens, purples, pinks - brings to mind Howard Hodgkin, while the picturesque simplification of form and perspective goes back to child art and the Naive tradition. His choice of the medium, tempera, turns his Hillscape series into a fey, quite inviting fantasy. Of the many sculptures on view you immediately notice the huddle of three hooded women in Chaitali Chanda's bronze. But the best example is surely Debjyoti Purkayastha's small Vinayak, in bronze. Since viewers are inundated with the image of the rotund, elephant-headed god on a daily basis, the artist must be credited with refreshing it. Instead of opting for cire perdue, he has cobbled together, what seem to be, bits of bronze sheets and/or parts of machinery, to arrive at a spry deviation from the common form."

Traditionally used by the Lingayat community, the weave was slowly dying out as there were no takers.""The sari used to be gifted to the bride after it was offered to the temple goddess. But as people moved to urban areas, they stopped wearing it as it is short in length,"" says Jain, who got remnants of the original weave from a devadasi and, with some money given by Dastkari Haat Samiti , began reviving it. ""We started with two weavers, today we have 16 looms in Gajendragargh,"" says Jain, who is doing her PhD on the traditional textile at National Institute of Fashion Technology, New Delhi. While the basic pattern of the sari has been retained - fine checks with broad borders - the colour palette has moved beyond the original red and mustard. ""It has two pallus on both sides and can be draped both ways,"" she says.Jain will be sharing her experiences on August 7 as part of Celebrating Handlooms, a discussion on sari revival, organised by the Crafts Council Of India at Kamala Crafts Shop in Egmore. On the occasion, textile expert Sabita Radhakrishna will also talk about the revival of the kodali karuppur sari of Tamil Nadu, while Rohit R Phalgaonkar will speak about the Goa Adivasi sari (Christian gauda sari).The kodali karuppur saris were produced in the village of the same name near Kumbakonam in Thanjavur. The karuppur cloth was worn only by the Thanjavur nobility and the saris were made exclusively for the ranis of Thanjavur till the 19th century. In Baroda, Kohlapur and Satara, the sari was an essential part of the bride's trousseau, as was the karuppur turban for the groom. The craft died out with the end of royalty in the country. ""It is rare and expensive because of the highly skilled labour involved,"" says Radhakrishna, who worked to revive it with the help of Kalakshetra Foundation as Craft Education and Research Centre (CERC), which has the necessary infrastructure, roping in the expertise of the Weavers Service Centre. ""Dakshinamurthy, an expert in natural dyes, and a printer, did the initial layout, while Bhanumurthi, master weaver at CERC, created the cloth using 100% cotton,"" says Radhakrishna, adding that Prabhakar, an expert in kalamkari painting and his team hand-painted the entire sari. The off-white cotton sari, interspersed with gold buttis, with a sheath of gold on the pallu, is now exhibited at Kalakshetra. ""I suggested that the karuppur blocks be used to print saris so that they are affordable without the original technique and yet contribute to the feel of the karuppur sari,"" says Radhakrishna.Goa-based historian Rohit R Phalgaonkar, on the other hand, has been working to bring back the red and white checked Christian gauda sari. ""I spent about 12 years collecting samples of the saris, which were originally worn by tribals,"" says Phalgaonkar, who has chosen four models from the samples.""I was able to persuade one weaver in TN and another in Karnataka to weave the saris,"" he says, adding that about 400 saris have been made in the past year. ""Though we are awaiting more orders, we have given money to the weavers and placed orders,"" he says. ""We want to make the pattern, colour and style popular."""

For instance, in July the cooperative generated Rs 8 lakh revenue by selling grocery items in small 10 rupee packets. This was a huge jump from the Rs 2.50 lakh their business raked in during the month of April, the cooperative authorities said.""We are selling a total of 25 items including Bengal gram, green gram, red gram, poppy, coriander, mustard, cumin, turmeric, Ajowan, fenugreek, garlic, red chilli powder, asafoetida, fried gram dal, hyacinth etc. in small packets. All the packets are only priced at Rs 10. At present, our employees are selling groceries at Woraiyur vegetable market, near Chathiram and Central bus stands, Thayanur shandy on Saturdays and on Sundays in Ponmlai shandy"", said K P Vanathi, joint registrar of Amaravathi Limited.Earlier, these items could be had only from ration shops. But after they were made available in various places where people converge in large numbers, business has increased by leaps and bounds. ""It has been lapped up by those who commute every day. They can buy their daily needs on their way home on a daily basis,"" an official pointed out.The consumer cooperative which mainly concentrates on public distribution system (PDS) also runs two self-service outlets at Kailasapuram and Ponmalai where they sell non-controlled commodities (NCC) like groceries, oil items and cosmetics. A couple of employees of Amaravathi Ltd are entrusted to look after each spot. Their modus operandi is simple: spread these 25 items in any corner of markets or shandy or roadsides, bus stands and people just flock to them.""A majority of our customers are daily wagers. They preferred our stalls as we have small packets as per their requirements with quality assured"", says N Sivakumar, a sales man at the Woraiyur stall. People from middle class and above flock to big malls even to buy a match box or a bunch of curry leaves. However, the poor and daily breadwinners have no option but to seek ordinary 'maligai kadai' (small grocery shops). Targeting these people, Amaravathi has taken the initiative to distribute quality goods with very minimal profit,"" said Vanathi.Amaravathi has its own wholesale units in Manapparai and Lalgudi. From these units the items would be transported to self-service outlets as well as shandy and markets. Normally, grocery items are being sent to government hostels, hospital canteens etc. In order to enhance revenue, she decided to extend sales to other private institutions also. When she approached educational institutions, they readily agreed to buy groceries from Amaravathi. ""Some more institutions have promised to tie up with us. Once it materialises, it would help generate more revenue for the cooperative sector"", she said."

What's worse, the district health department does not have enough personnel to deal with the situation, and has been forced to ask health department staffers from other districts to work on deputation.There are 84 sanctioned posts in the malaria control department in Mewat. Out of these, only five are filled. Therefore, the district health department is getting a batch of 40 health workers from other districts every month. This still brings the head count to only half of that required.Just before the monsoon had set in, the state health department had announced that Haryana would seek to become free of vector-borne diseases by 2020. This was in keeping with the Union government's aim to make the country free of malaria by 2030, the department had said.The district administration has now rushed 55,482 rapid diagnostic test slides to check suspected malaria patients. The only saving grace for the authorities is that the number of patients so far is comparatively less than in previous years.Last year, more than 5,500 cases of malaria were reported in Mewat. Out of these, around 2,170 were confirmed till July 31. In 2015, 6,638 cases were reported, and 50 people lost their lives to the disease. This year, majority of the cases have been reported from Punhana and Nuh blocks. Residents claim that the Ujina drain, which crosses these two areas, is a breeding ground for mosquitoes.Notably, there haven't been any cases of dengue in the district because the dengue mosquito breeds in clear water. Mewat, on the other hand, mostly has drains, where water accumulates and the malaria mosquito breeds.To control mosquito breeding, teams conduct house-to-house surveys. They check for patients suffering from fever and conduct on-the-spot tests. If the tests are positive, medicines are given with doses lasting for two weeks. Regular monitoring is carried out to watch over the patient's health, and to check whether complete dosage is taken.Besides, 32 teams have been formed, of six members each, including workers from the municipal corporation. These teams will visit houses for anti-larvae spray. Health officials advise that people can also add oils like kerosene or mustard to the stagnant water. The oil forms a layer above the water and controls the breeding of larvae."

More than 20 months have passed since 921 Indians, who used to stay in Indian enclaves landlocked within Bangladesh, stepped into the Indian mainland, with the hope of a better life. But now, they want to return to Bangladesh. ""We were assured of a proper rehabilitation package, including job opportunities for a member of each family. But in the past two years, there has been no initiative from the government. I used to sell medicines in Bangladesh but ever since I have come here, I am sitting idle and forced to do odd jobs to run the family.... I want to go back to Bangladesh,"" said a disenchanted Osman Gani, sitting at the camp built for them at Krishimela Ground in Dinhata. Koushik Saha, the district magistrate of Cooch Behar, said he had no information that a section of the enclave dwellers wanted to return to Bangladesh. Thirty-five year-old Gani used to stay at Chotogaraljhora - II, a former Indian enclave located under Kurigram district of Bangladesh. His family is among the 58 families which stay at the same camp since crossing over to India on 22, 2015. Each family has been provided with a tinned-roof hutment, a small kitchen and an electric connection. Also, there are general connections for water supply and toilets at the camp premises, which has been developed as a part of the rehabilitation plan. Foreign ministry officials are conceding that there is some disenchantment among the about 920 Indians who came across the border after the Land Boundary Agreement (LBA) was implemented, in particular because local authorities have taken time to process the documents they need to be able to access social services. But they haven't heard, they say, reports of people preparing to return. What has happened though - according to the joint secretary in charge of ties with Bangladesh, who visits the enclaves frequently - is that the Bangladeshi enclaves that became a part of India though the agreement have turned into hotbeds of Trinamul versus BJP politics. ""There is some political tussle and that's why the discontent quotient is high,"" said a state government official. But the enclave dwellers said they were shattered because the promises made to them were not fulfilled. Asked what prompted him to consider returning to other side of the border, Gani said:""The Bangladesh government is carrying out infrastructure development in these areas and have made arrangements to provide employment to the residents of former enclaves. ""While we are living at these hutments now and lack any permanent source of earning, our former neighbours are being provided with different assistance in Bangladesh. That is why some of us are thinking of returning back to Bangladesh."" State minister Rabindranath Ghosh, who is from Cooch Behar, however, claimed that elaborate work was going on for rehabilitation of the erstwhile enclave residents. He, however, was silent over the issue of providing employment to these families. ""Locations have been identified where multi-storied buildings would be constructed and each family will be provided with a flat. Also, work of community halls is going one. Electricity has been provided in the camps and all other basic infrastructure would be made ready in due course. Simultaneously, the state is also carrying out development in the erstwhile Bangladeshi enclaves which have merged into Indian mainland now,"" he said. He also pointed out that other than shelter and basic amenities, each family has been provided with 30 kilos of rice, five kilos of mustard oil, five litres of kerosene, five kilos of lentil, 1.50 kilos of salt and one kg of milk powder every month."

In addition, the NGO claimed, ghee, coconut, cashew and raisins were of poor quality.The NGO sampled 1,143 food items in the May-June period, and found 983 samples adulterated. Whats worse salt used for preparing food didnt contain iodine, said an NGO official.The findings found an overall adulteration of 86% of the total samples collected for tests. Eighty-one percent of salt samples did not have iodine. Mustard oil and vermillion were found adulterated. Some common items used to cook noodles such as chilli sauce, tomato sauce and vinegar were found unfit for consumption.Not only food, even prasad offered to the deities is of poor quality. Consumption of the food served to the people on yatra could mean a serious threat to life. Salt, an important ingredient was, found without iodine...which is dangerous, SPECS secretary Brijmohan Sharma said at a conference after releasing the findings on Wednesday.In the first 10 days, 2.21 lakh pilgrims paid obeisance at Badrinath and Kedarnath. Some 15 lakh pilgrims visited the four shrines within two months after the pilgrimage season began on April 27.Food Safety and Standards Authority (FSSA) additional commissioner Pankaj Pandey rejected the findings of the NGO. If the findings are genuine, then why dont they share statistics with the government? We dont claim that there is no adulteration along the route, but the report is exaggerated, he told Hindustan Times.Secretary, tourism, R Meenakshi Sundaram came out in support of Pandey. I cant say whether the report is correct or not, but it brings a bad name to the state. If the NGO is so concerned of adulteration, then why doesnt it reach out to the authority?Sharma was clueless whether the report was to be shared with FSSA officials. He told Hindustan Times that the previous reports were submitted to former chief minister Harish Rawat, who forwarded the findings to the department concerned. Its difficult to meet secretaries and, therefore, we forward our reports to the chief minister."

Does failure, or success for that matter affects you?Success has its own sweet taste. It gives you a kick and of course you are under a hangover for quite some time. Failure, however, brings you back to the reality that everything in life is temporary. But I enjoy both the phases. Failure of a film affects me and I try to reason it but for a very short span. I do have a realization that its all part and parcel of your profession.You are in the city of Nawabs. How does it feel coming back here?I love this city as well as this state.

Its in politics, business, jobs, you just name it and you will realise what I mean by saying so.Your love for sarees is known wordwide... what is it with sarees?I love sarees. Now toh people even gift me sarees...(laughs). Its synonymous with me today. And trust me I have no qualms accepting this.Have you tried chikan sarees from Lucknow?Oh!

The survey found the uncertainty around GM crops as one of the policy risks in agriculture.It said, ""An important measure that can reduce risk is the introduction of HYV and GM seeds that have been stuck in controversies over decades.""The suggestion comes at a time when the government still has to make up its mind for allowing commercial release of GM mustard due to strong opposition from the RSS-linked outfit Swadeshi Jagran Manch (SJM) and other organisations despite its safety clearance from the central biotech regulator, Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC).The survey listed this suggestion as one of the multiple measures which the government should take to minimise risk in agriculture and deal with agrarian distress. The survey noted that the productivity issue can also be addressed by increasing coverage of water saving irrigation systems like micro irrigation systems and routing inputs through direct benefit transfer mode in a crop neutral manner.""The progress needs to be evaluated in terms of outcomes such as catching up with global yields as a means to increase income of farmers. The dissemination of scale neutral technology suited to small scale farming and use of IT is necessary to improve the productivity of small farm holdings which dominate the Indian agriculture sector"", said the survey."
5a1139b79855b76bf13de443,The modern masters,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/opinion/story_166718.jsp,2017-08-12,"That was a sumptuous banquet alright. If the viewer burped, it was from satisfaction, not indigestion. Because Akar Prakar's recent show, Synchrome-Masters, did, indeed, line up the masters. Well, yes, caution is advised when approaching works of those no longer around. And a majority shown here aren't. Without specialized examination, it's difficult to tell genuine from spurious with the naked eye, especially since skill and technique are purchasable. Galleries thus need to be vigilant in scrutinizing their provenance with care. But the viewer, without the burden of the authenticator, can guiltlessly savour the period ambience evoked. Forty-one artists from about three generations  those born in the late 19th century; those in the early years of the 20th; and those in the 1930s  were represented, each contributing to the making of the modern age in Indian art. The gallery was judicious in giving space for just one work to each artist in most cases which balanced the weight of big names with economy in presentation. Besides, the Tagores are conspicuously omitted, with possible plans for a later display.Not surprisingly, the accent is on drawing and sketching, on the irrepressible sentience of lines, to be precise. And that referred, quite compellingly, to what was the veritable anchor in traditional Indian art, whether Ajanta and the Miniatures or the Jain manuscripts and folk/tribal expressions. In fact, drawings and sketches come from a number of artists: K.C.S. Paniker, A.A. Almelkar, Manjit Bawa, F.N. Souza, Akbar Padamsee, A. Ramachandran. The wry figuration of K.G, Subramanyans watercolour sketch must be counted in this company as well. While a wall is devoted to Ganesh Pynes Jottings, a comically distorted figure  like in illustrations  is by Bikash Bhattacharjee. But to plot the narrative of modern Indian art around the masters you must begin with the earliest presented here: Dhurandhar. His pencil drawing of a pertly confident working class woman dated 1938 is merely an exercise and speaks of the British academic naturalism of the art schools in the late 19th century. But its meticulous fidelity is rejected by Nandalal Bose, whose flourish of lines is seen on a postcard he wrote. His practice of showering these little sketches on his correspondents tells you how alien the Western concept of the exclusive signature was to this generation. And that, of course, includes Jamini Roy, who followed the patua tradition in replicating with assistance, its rumoured  his own images; and the later Chittaprasad, who sometimes refused to sign his work due to ideological reasons. The four spare engravings on slate by Roy are undated but seem to suggest a phase when he was perfecting his mature idiom. And the 1960 portrait of a rugged, weathered face with sternly penetrating eyes by the latter recalls the manifesto-driven art of the famine years. Nandalal Boses students find themselves near their Mashtermoshai. The ink- and- brush trees of Benode Behari Mukherjee are tiny, yet replete with a gentle, East Asian lyricism, Santiniketan-style; and whats noticeable about the calligraphic watercolour lines of Ramkinkar Baij, that sometimes blot into bushy capillaries, is their breezy energy. To come to Paritosh Sen and M.F. Husain, Sailoz Mukherjea and S.H. Raza is to look at a generation that had outgrown the earlier obligation of Indianness, and chose to raid both Western and Indian sources, including folk/tribal visual dialects, in their search for form. Raza, of course, discovered his own language of Indian geometry, while Mukherjeas brooding romanticism suffuses a fine landscape on view (picture, top). Speaking of landscapes brings you to the agitated strokes of Gopal Ghoses watercolour and the short, bristly jabs in Paramjit Singhs mixed media work, so unlike the flowing lines that counterpoint the taut rigidity of a horse in Nikhil Biswass On Defeat. But abstraction, meanwhile, was scripting a parallel tradition, partly authored by V.S. Gaitonde, represented here by a signed print. Ram Kumar's black and grey bands - pale, dark, overlapping, staccato - bring to mind the reflective reticence of his junior contemporary, Ganesh Haloi, though the latter's watercolour here is a blend of foggy greens and mustard. But the best of the abstractions comes from Laxman Shreshtha with its smudges of black and sooty vapours; and J. Swaminathan, whose seminal role in both articulating this alternative vision and discovering for urban artists the tribal tradition can hardly be overstated. To end with the sculptures. There were two elders: Prodosh Das Gupta, seeking to wrest muted form from mass as in Lying Amazon; and Sankho Chaudhuri, abstracting its essence intuitively. What disturbs the viewer, however, is the environmental warning in Meera Mukherjee's bronze."

Despite flood situation at many districts this year, 12 districts in the state have received deficit rainfall which is a matter of concern for these districts.According to the data available with the water resources department, the state has got an average rainfall of 408.27 mm which is 21 percent higher compared to 337.32 mm received up to July, 13, 2016. ""In the three spells of south west monsoon so far, 12 districts including Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh, Bharatpur, Dholpur, Karauli, Sawai Madhopur, Jaipur, Alwar, Dausa, Jhunjhunu, Sikar and Baran have received a deficit rainfall,"" said an officer with the water resources department on Sunday.Sriganganagar and Hanumangarh are agriculture rich districts and like Sikar and Jhunjhunu contribute to the crop of mustard and onions. ""These districts should get a good amount of rainfall in the fourth spell, else the price of onions and mustard would be astronomically high in winters,"" said an officer with the irrigation department.The district that has got highest rainfall in the state so far is Sirohi where a rainfall of 1276.93 mm was received till Sunday. ""It is almost double of what it got in the year 2016,"" said an officer.In the monsoon season so far 7 districts have got abnormal rainfall which means they 60 percent higher rainfall compared to 2016, 5 districts got excess rainfall which means they got 25 percent higher rainfall compared to last year, 09 received normal rainfall means these districts got almost close to what they got in the year 2016 while 12 have got deficit means these districts got lesser rainfall compared to last year."
5b505de79855b70b4a41a8c4,From plate to plough: Plan for the agri-futures,https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/plan-for-the-agri-futures-e-nam-farmer-produce-market-4795368/,2017-08-14,"The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform. (Representational image) The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform. (Representational image)Even after 70 years of Independence, the marketing system for agri-products remains un-supportive to farmers. They cant discover and realise the best prices possible for their produce across space and time as markets are not sufficiently integrated. They sell in local markets where prices bust in case of bumper harvests, as happened in the last few months, not only for potatoes and onions but also for most pulses and oilseeds. The e-NAM aims to create an all-India spot market by creating an electronic platform.However, for transactions to take place across mandis and states, one has to do much more than installing a simple software. It needs assaying, grading, sorting, storing, delivering and settling disputes with respect to each transaction. Despite the good concept of e-NAM, creation of an all-India spot market for farmers is still at least five years away, if not more. If the government wants to do it faster, there could be some lessons from Indias nascent and Chinas well-developed futures markets.The agri-futures market is one way to ensure that farmers planting and selling decisions are forward-looking, and not based on past prices. This can help smoothen the typical boom and bust problem in agri-prices. However, there are two key problems with Indian agri-futures: One, they are often disrupted by sudden bans or suspensions by the government as many policy-makers have a deep mistrust in the functioning of these markets; and two, very few farmers or farmer producer organisations (FPOs) trade on futures, which in turn reinforces the mistrust of policymakers. No wonder, the overall size of agri-futures in India remains trapped at low levels, and the most worrying part is that since 2012, it has been tumbling down (see Figure-1). Although the onus of reviving this trend largely lies with agri-commodity exchanges and the regulator, it may be worth looking at the Chinese experience in this context, and see if anything useful can be learnt.Interestingly, India recorded the first trade in futures in 1875 in cotton in the Bombay Cotton Exchange, just 10 years after the first trade was consummated in USA. But Indias agri-futures could not develop much due to a series of suspensions around the Second World War in view of the shortage of essential commodities. This mindset continued post-Independence, and only pepper and turmeric were allowed to trade in 1977. However, it was the bold vision of Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee that in 2003 three national exchanges were set up and all commodities were allowed to be traded in futures markets. But since 2003, 15 commodity futures were suspended, leading to uncertainty in the market. Despite there being sufficient evidence that spot prices broadly converge with future prices, there remains a mistrust in commodity futures amongst policymakers. No wonder, agri-futures remained at low levels, forming only 2 per cent of 1.6 billion global agri- futures contracts during the triennium average ending (TE)-2016.In comparison, look at China, which started in the early 1990s, and by TE 2016, it was the largest player in global agri-futures contracts with a whopping share of 69 per cent. (Figure 2). What is the secret of Chinese success? China also did a lot of experimentation in the early years, starting as many as 33 commodity exchanges in 1993, but many of them had to be shut down by 1998, and several commodities suspended. One of the key lessons that China learnt from CBOT experts of the US was that a spot or wholesale market of sufficient size and efficiency has to be developed before establishing a vibrant futures market.The other takeaways from the Chinese success in agri-futures are: One, state participation in the futures markets through the State Trading Enterprises; two, no abrupt suspensions of commodities; and three, focus on choice of commodities, which are not very sensitive from the food security point of view. As one can see in Figure 2, the Chinese volume of contracts is much higher in soya, mustard, and corn complexes, which are basically for feed. Palm oil, sugar, cotton and rubber are other commodities that China imports in large volumes, and they are not part of the core food security basket.So, what is the lesson for our regulator and commodity exchanges? The key lesson is: Pick the commodities carefully, and deepen their markets first. SEBI has tried to come up with some indicative criteria in the choice of commodities to be developed for futures markets, but the basic distinction between feed and food commodities is missing. And it is here that the Chinese experience is relevant as they first tried to develop futures in commodities that are non-sensitive from the food security point of view.In this context, in a larger paper with Siraj Hussain, former Secretary, Agriculture, we carried out a Principal Component Analysis taking several commodity parameters into account with a view to identifying the most promising commodities for futures markets. Our results show that commodities with the highest potential for futures trading are either feed material (soybean meal, rapeseed meal, maize) or fibre (cotton), followed by spices and edible oils. Basic staple food items like rice, wheat, and even pulses get a low ranking due to their food security concerns. India being now the largest importer of edible oils, especially palm and soya oils, these are promising candidates for agri-futures provided global players are allowed to trade in these.It is thus obvious that a well thought-out strategy to pick the right commodities is a better way to develop agri-futures rather than a frequent stop-go policy. The trust in commodity futures will enhance once more FPOs start trading on agri-futures, and they start gaining directly or indirectly from agri-futures. SEBI can help incentivise the participation of FPOs on the futures trading platform, but the real onus lies with agri-commodity exchanges, and it is here that the progress has been extremely slow.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

This has again intensified the conflict among supporters and detractors of Genetically Modified crop technology. As we know, Bt cotton was the first GM crop to be approved by the countrys regulatory bodies. Therefore, taking Bt cotton as the reference point, supporters and detractors of GM technology have been engaged in building two contrasting narratives.Supporters have been showing data indicating an immense increase in cotton production in the country with the adoption of Bt cotton seeds by farmers. They argue that Bt cotton seeds have helped farmers reduce the use of chemical pesticides and thus helped them save money that they would spend on buying them. They further argue that it was not the government that approved Bt cotton initially.Farmers started cultivating the crop illegally but the benefits from Bt cotton cultivation were so impressive that the government couldnt do much to stop it and was compelled to fall in line by approving its commercial cultivation in 2002. According to them, farmers have the right to access high quality seeds and technologies for higher yield in agriculture. Therefore, farmers themselves chose Bt cotton seeds to earn higher income.Detractors have, however, drawn a contrasting picture of Bt cotton cultivation in India. They argue that Bt cotton cultivation has caused damage to the environment and biodiversity of cotton crops. Today, private seed companies have flooded the market with Bt seeds, because of which other hybrid and indigenous varieties of cotton crops have become extinct. They allege that Bt cotton seeds have not helped farmers increase yields. Rather, with its adoption, farmers have gone into debt and committed suicide in increasing numbers. Further, animals have been falling sick and have even died after feeding on Bt cotton plants.These are some of the facts presented by stakeholders either supporting or opposing the use of GM technology in agriculture to uphold their respective stands. These stakeholders include biotechnology scientists, medical scientists, environmentalists, farmers, business groups and consumers.With the coming of GM technology, concerns related to health, environment and ownership are raised, apart from benefits of the technology. These different concerns intensified the political discourse between its proponents and opponents. In the process, new political identities got recognised, with stakeholders on either side of the GM crop divide associating with like-minded individuals and organisations to form opposing coalitions.In the Indian context, there are four popular coalitions that have come into being to support or oppose GM crop technology. These coalitions are, the Consortium of Indian Farmers Association (CIFA) and the Association of Biotechnology Led Enterprises  Agriculture Group (ABLE-AG) in support of GM crops, and the Coalition for GM-Free India and the Alliance for Sustainable and Holistic Agriculture (ASHA) against the use of GM technology in agriculture.Civil society groups of farmers like the Shetkari Sanghatana, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Kisan Club, Naujawan Kisan Club, Nagarjuna Rythu Samakhya and Pratapa Rudra Farmers Mutually Aided Coop Credit and Marketing Federation are among the leading farmer organisations that are led by the CIFA. They demand access to modern technologies like GM crops to increase agricultural production.Similarly, to promote GM technology, biotech companies have formed the Association of Biotechnology-Led Enterprises  Agriculture Group (ABLE-AG), in which biotech companies such as Monsanto and Advanta are active members. ABLE projects itself as a not-for-profit pan-India forum representing the Indian Biotechnology sector.On the other side, the Coalition for GM-Free India and ASHA have been campaigning and advocating for a GM-free India, with the aim of shifting farming towards a sustainable path. Both these organisations are coalitions of hundreds of organisations and individuals, including farmers groups from more than 20 states.It can be observed that farmers are at the receiving end of the implications of GM technology and they are unaware of the future consequences of its use. They usually choose any technology to increase their crop yield so that they can improve their net income. In the process, they do not lay much store by larger concerns such as preserving the biodiversity of crops or the health of animals feeding on GM crops such as Bt cotton plants. After a decade of the introduction of Bt cotton into Indian agriculture, now only Bt cotton seeds can be found in the seed markets. Non-Bt and indigenous varieties of seeds do not exist anymore.Multiple campsThe real political conflict is happening among the policy elites of different coalitions or alliance groups. These policy elites are savants and experts of specific areas like farming, environment, biotechnology, health and agricultural economics and, therefore, analyse GM crops from their own specific perspectives. They often come into conflict with each other on an issue related to GM crops. The coalitions or alliance groups of both pro- and anti-GM crops project themselves to be on the side of farmers and claim to be working for their benefit. These members of the two camps come up with different truths related to GM crops to support or oppose the GM technology.However, the specific truth reflected by a particular coalition cannot be considered to be the complete picture so far as GM crops are concerned. For example, the truth related to yield is not the full picture about GM crops. There are other truths also, like issues related to biodiversity and public health that need to be taken into account to understand the holistic picture of GM crop technology.It is here that the role of regulatory bodies becomes critical in taking into account the voices of different stakeholders coming from different coalitions. The future of GM technology depends on finding a way in which different scientific truths can be brought together for discussions and overall analysis. Therefore, for the government, the need of the hour is to reform the regulatory bodies so that the conflicting arguments of the stakeholders can be heard, reconciled and a possible policy solution found.(Navneet is doctoral scholar at the Institute for Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru, and Kumar is Associate Professor at ISEC.

5a0dfd419855b76bf13d32e2,Falling in love once again at Kolkata’s Anadi Cabin,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-chopping-board/falling-in-love-once-again-at-kolkatas-aanadi-cabin/,2017-08-18,"I left Kolkata for Mumbai a couple of decades back. I keep going back to Kolkata when I can. My family is there after all. Most of my meals there are with family and friends, the most special of those are with my grandmother and my mother. I do eat out in Kolkata when I can but my choices are driven by nostalgia more than anything else.When in Kolkata, I want my phuchka, chop, cutlet, roll, biryani, luchi and mangsho. I couldnt care less about the new Italian or Vietnamese restaurant which might have opened in the city. There is enough time for those when I am away. In Kolkata, it would be the Shirazs and the Nizams, the Flurys and the Kookie Jars, the Bhojohori Mannas and 6 Ballygunge Places that I would go to chasing old memories.These days I also try to visit some of the classic restaurants from central and north Kolkata. Places I might not have visited when I lived in Kolkata as I was a south Kolkata boy then. In the pre-Metro era, there was a Game of Thrones like north-south divide in Kolkata after all. I am talking of the cabin restaurants, the sweet shops, the dishevelled remnants of the old China towns, places which paint a picture of Kolkata to me which is so adventurous and so unique, so full of colour and character and above all, memories.Places tourists and emigrants like to go back to even if those who stay in the city, understandably, seek new experiences.Lets take Anadi Cabin, for example, which I visited during my most recent visit to the city.Anadi Cabin is a Kolkata institution. Its name is synonymous with Moghlai parathas, a dish which despite its majestic name harking back to the Mughals, is something that you get across the humblest of eateries across the city.Anadi Cabin is located at S N Banerjee Road near Espalande. Today it is a bit of an urban legend. With the city expanding, and Esplanade not being as central as it once was, places like Anadi are not as frequented by people from across the city. Everyone knows that it exists but if you ask them how the food there is, reactions will vary from it is overrated to the quality is not the same. Two comments that iconic eateries across India are often subjected to not matter how packed they are with customers. The third epitaph would be, its too touristy!Whether its Paradise in Hyderabad (justifiably I might add), Karims in Delhi, Tunday in Lucknow or Britannia in Mumbai (again justifiably perhaps), they would all be subject to one or all of these judgements by locals.At times it is good to just go by yourself and try out these places in any case. You might actually discover what made them so special. If you are lucky, you will find that they still are.I was quite excited about my visit to Anadi. I had gone there a couple of decades back but in those days I would just go to a restaurant to fill my stomach. I would not go looking for a story. Id been wanting to go there for a while but hadnt been able to in recent trips. This time I managed to convince a couple of friends to join me to Anadi after we had eaten a sumptuous breakfast at Flurys, again on my request.It was close to 2 pm when we reached. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant seemed quite sleepy . The tables inside looked unoccupied. We were the first customers of the day it seemed. The staff at Anadi were divided in their opinion on whether we should be allowed to sit in or whether we should wait. The mood seemed to be, can we chill a little bit more before the day starts?.We were eventually seated after a number of intense parleys among the staff. The place got packed in a matter of minutes. Ten minutes later and we would have had to queue up. I saw the rush and realised why the staff wanted to make the most of the lull before the start. They would, after all, be on their feet till night after that.The seating at Anadi is spartan. There is no air-conditioning, toilets or wifi here. This is a world far removed from the GST and service charge imposing modern cafes, bistros and resto-bars that define new India.As it is in such eateries across India, you are expected to share tables with strangers if alone at Anadi Cabin. The restaurant seemed fairly clean when I was there. The jury is divided on whether it is always so according to comments that I received on social media.Though the restaurant is called a cabin, the waiter told me that this 98-year-old (according to him) restaurant didnt actually have cabins in the past. Cabin refer to partitions made for families to sit in privacy in restaurants during more conservative times in Kolkata. These were later havens for courting couples. Places which had such cabins have done away with them today. Whispering sweet nothings over a shared cold drinks (sic) is not good for business and who has the time and place for romance anymore in any case?There is a counter at the front of the restaurant where they fry the parathas that make the restaurant famous. This dates from a time when open kitchens were yet to be trendy.The tables by which you rest your weary bodies and wait for the parathas, have marble tops. The plates on which the food is served are of white bone china. The restaurant has the sort of distressed look that new restaurants in Mumbai pay designers big money to recreate these days.We had the duck egg (hasher deem) Moghlai paratha which Anadi is famous for. The paratha was served with the traditional, lightly spiced, cubed potato curry and ketchup. There was the mandatory salad, sliced cucumber, carrot and onion.Was the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi over-rated and not a patch on what it was?To be honest, I dont know. My memories of the past are hazy when it comes to Aanadi. I havent had a wide enough variety of Moghlai parathas in Kolkata in the recent past and am not equipped to do a comparative analysis.What I can tell you with surety is that I quite enjoyed the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi and that it made me fall in love with the treasured treat of my childhood days. The parathas was very well balanced in terms of flavour and had a lovely texture  neither too crisp, nor dense or chewy.What is a Moghlai paratha you ask?A Moghlai paratha is a paratha made with maida or refined flour. The flattened dough is stuffed with crushed peanuts, raisins, finely chopped carrots (at Anadi at least) and green chilies, all whisked into freshly cracked eggs. The dough, with the stuffing enveloped inside, is then shallow fried in dalda on a tava and served hot. I doubt if it will taste too good if reheated for having later.The paratha at Anadi didnt have any meat in it as far as I could see. I do have memories of having eaten Moghlai parathas with a sprinkling of minced meat in them as a kid.The other childhood memory that I have of Moghlai parathas is that the adults accompanying one during a Moghlai paratha treat would cut the parathas into cubes so that us kids could eat them easily with a fork. This time my mother or my grandfather or my mama or my mashis, who used to take me out then werent around so I had to cut the paratha into bite sized cubes myself.The Moghlai paratha of Kolkata is a cousin of the martabak of Penang, matabaq of the middle east, the palata (sic) of Myanmar and the baida roti of Mumbai. The base concept for each is similar though the versions differ in terms of thickness, size, stuffing and levels of crunchiness.My friend, Kaniska who accompanied me for the outing and who often visits Dhaka for work, told me that the Moghlai parathas are made crunchier in Dhaka where it is a streetfood dish unlike in Kolkata where it is a part of cabin fare. One theory says that Moghlai Paratha of Kolkata came to the city from Dhaka but in a country with little written food history, these theories are a bit inconclusive.Having tried versions of the paratha across the sub-continent (barring in Myanmar) I would say that the Moghlai paratha of Anadi did Kolkata proud.Aanadi is not a one dish restaurant though. The revelation of the afternoon at Anadi in fact was the kosha mangsho. This is a classic Bengali slow cooked semi-dry goat meat preparation which has mustard oil, onions and garam masala as its base. Like many dishes in the east, the Odiyas, the Biharis and the Assamese make versions of it too.We ordered a plate of kosha mangsho with plain parathas at Aanadi for Kaniskas wife, Manishita, who didnt want eggs. The number of pieces of mutton (goat meat) in the serving was ample. The meat was well cooked and not a single piece was tough or chewy unlike what I have seen in some Bengali restaurants that offer this dish. Some bits of the meat had delightful nibbles of chorbi, the forbidden fat, hidden in them. The thick curry which was wrapped around the meat had a deep and near mystic touch to it which had the three of us in its spell. It was not too high on chilli heat or oil and yet promised an experience that smacked of pomp and majesty. This was definitely one of the best kosha mangshos that I have eaten in restaurants and I have had quite a few for sure!Close to a century of practise and passion showed in what we ate at Anadi you could say and the service was lovely too. My submission is to visit places like Anadi when you visit Kolkata. In a city that loves food, you are rarely going to go wrong."
5a0f36f49855b76bf13d7288,Water harvesting to hike crop yield,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-otherstates/water-harvesting-to-hike-crop-yield/article19514105.ece,2017-08-18,"A step forward:A farm pond was built recently at the village and it has been geo-tagged for monitoring of its water level.Special arrangementBarely six months ago, few in the dusty and nondescript Bhojpura village of Phagi tehsil could believe that they will witness a change in the crop pattern for the better as well as an unexpected increase in the crop yield.The constant decline in the ground water level was also a concern for the farmers entirely dependent on rains.A campaign to build rainwater harvesting structures in the region now promises to bring benefits to the agriculturists in the shape of control of soil erosion, increase in moisture, vegetation and ground water table and prevention of wasteland expansion.Following this years monsoon, the lush green landscape has brought a smile to farmers.In the 50-bigha agricultural field of farmer brothers Harinarain and Jainarain Gujjar of Bhojpura  where a farm pond was built recently with 90% contribution of the State government  the jowar and moong crops will be ready for harvesting next month. The pond has been geo-tagged for monitoring of its water level.Immediately after the harvest, we will grow mustard and gram as the rabi crops with the help of water stored in the pond for irrigation. Such a crop pattern, one after another, was just out of question earlier, said Harinarain, 50. The rain water stored in the artificial pond touches the level of 3 feet.Structures such as farm ponds, anicuts, bunds, percolation tanks and waterways are being built all over Rajasthan in the second phase of the flagship Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan, which has combined various schemes and brought them under a single platform.It is targeted at conserving rainwater, run-off water, ground water and soil moisture to the maximum.The Watershed Departments Project Manager, Dinesh Kumar, said the farmers in the region were motivated during the campaign to get the ponds constructed in their agricultural fields.Harinarain plans to bring diesel pumps to supply water from the farm pond, built at a cost of Rs.2 lakh, to irrigate the next round of crops.An anicut constructed in the Jharana Khurd village, situated at a distance of 10 km from Bhojpura, has brought a rivulet back to life.Rajendra Bairwa, a local resident who owns 20 bigha land, said the anicut had increased soil moisture and was being used for bathing of the cattle and giving them the drinking water.The total estimated cost of the Jal Swavalamban Abhiyan is pegged at Rs.2,000 crore, while over 94,300 projects have been completed under its first phase.Mr. Kumar said the State government was expecting a bigger contribution from the people during the second phase, as the issue of water scarcity affected all sections of society.As many as 11 government departments have joined hands to execute the works under the Abhiyan.If the greenery witnessed in the Phagi tehsil is any indication, the desert States climate is likely to change in the near future and the rainwater harvesting techniques are set to scale up the crop yields."

Since agriculture makes up roughly 15% of India's GDP, a 4.5 to 9.0% negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to be roughly at 1.5% of GDP per year,"" reads the report.The committee said that various studies indicated overall reduction in productivity by 4-6% in rice, 6% in wheat, 18% in maize, 2.5% in sorghum, 2% in mustard and 2.5% in potato besides significant regional variability. Also, the committee has projected production deficit of 33% for cereals by 2015 and of 43% by 2050. Meanwhile, for pulses, the deficit has been projected at 3% by 2025 and 7% by 2050.Consequently, the committee has suggested that enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly poor, small and marginal farmers who would be affected the most.Further, the committee found that the total post-harvest losses to agricultural commodities are estimated to be from 6 to 18% and nearly 30% of the agricultural produce harvested is lost due to inadequate storage facilities in the country, including in Punjab and Haryana.On over exploitation of ground water, the committee found that the Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB ) has submitted plan for artificial recharge in 442 over exploited ground water blocks in Punjab, Harayana, Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,Tamilnadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.The report says that as per the ministry of earth sciences, during the period 1901-2010, heavy rainfall events (rainfall exceeding 15 cm in 24 hours) over northern parts of the country show an increasing trend of about 6% per decade. Also, as per 5th IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, climate projections developed for India for the 2050s indicate an increase in the average temperature by 2-4C during that period, an overall decrease in rainy days by more than 15 days in western and central India and an increase by 5-10 days near foothills of Himalayas and north-east India.The IPCC has also analyzed that there has been a decrease in rainfall in the month of July but there has been an increase in rains in June as well as August across the country indicating a change in the rainfall pattern.The committee observed that animal husbandry and cattle rearing are important source of income for majority of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.However, it expressed that national plan on dairying has ignored indigenous varieties of cattle leading to over dependence on crossbred varieties for milk production despite the fact that indigenous varieties of cattle possess many traits such as heat tolerance that can be very effective in future scenario projected for climate change.Mainly focusing on climate change effect on agriculture, the committee was of the view that there will be changes in consumption patterns in coming decades due to increasing rate of urbanization and increased income of households. It has been found that demand for fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry and fisheries will increase at faster rate than that of food grains. The need for a climate-resilient approach to agriculture is critical for India where more than 80 percent agriculturists are small farmers and the warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.60C, says the report."

For a few years now, ecologically conscious individuals have been thinking of alternatives for this, and that has resulted in Ganeshas being made with wool, coconut fibre and many other natural materials. Lately, after the popularity of seedballs for afforestation purposes, seedball Ganeshas can be seen doing the rounds. One such green buff, is Ganeshram, who is selling seedball Ganeshas to Bengalureans.The Bengaluru-based naturalist spends most of his time travelling for projects related to water conservation, sustainable food production and conservation of indigenous flora. This is an idea that has been in the air all the while, but with very few people acting on it. I am being helped by my brother and a few friends, and this is my second year at it, he says, adding that the city has really taken to this idea, as the response to his Ganeshas has been overwhelming. I have been swamped with queries for the past few days, and Im glad to see that youngsters and older people alike are opting for these idols. Most are curious to know how it works, and what seeds these idols have, says Ganeshram.They sell Ganeshas of different sizes, ranging from 4 to 12. The 4 idol costs `80, and that, he says, is the one that has been selling the most. The Ganeshas prepared this year by him have a mix of different vegetable seeds such as tomato, brinjal, chilli, ladies finger, mustard and greens such a fenugreek. We have been instructing people to not dump the idols into lakes or ponds, but to submerge them in water vessels at home and pour the mixture into a pot or onto soil. Alternatively, to place the idol in a pot containing soil, in an area receiving a good amount of sunlight and water it everyday, he says. He works along with a potter family near Frazer Town that makes these idols. This system has been working economically for them too, he says.Telling us a bit about the harmful effects of PoP on the environment, he says, PoP does not dissolve in water. Another issue is with various dyeing agents/ paints used on Ganesha idols these days. Many of them are heavy metal-based, and are toxic not just to smaller lifeforms, but also to the humans coming in contact with them. He adds that the food webs and interconnections between various organisms are so intricate in nature that more often than not, we really dont know how it affects the environment. All our anthropocentric inventions solve human needs/wants in the short term, and are generally not oriented towards sustainability or ecology, he says.

Leading designers in the state say there is an adhoc movement everywhere leading fashionistas to take the ethnic root. City Express finds out the latest trends in the industry and why designs have become more traditional, a little-less colourful, yet an amalgamation of the contemporary.HandwovenOrganic fashion store, Ethicus designs are weaved and handwoven on looms in Pollachi and handpainted using natural dyes by artisans in Andhra Pradesh. The designs are made with the idea of sustainability where the work of the artisans are recognised. We use ecologic cotton in our saris and other garments. Kalamkari fashion is also the latest trend where the sarees and blouses give a trendy look,said Vijayalakshmi Nachiar, founder of Ethicus. For Onam, kalamkari sarees is becoming a favourite. Ethicus has brought out their latest winter collections in brightly coloured hues of madder red, indigo blues, greens, yellows, blacks, greys and browns.Shade-preferencesThere is a general preference for shades such as parrot green and mustard yellow, both in bridal wear as well as in the sari collection. The ongoing trend is the use of traditional designs with gold works and kundan stone work. Even the zardosi work, a type of Iranian embroidery is another handwork which is being used by designers and is preferred by women.  The youngsters prefer sarees with net border works. The other works are sheering net and tissue net work which gives a trendy look to the outfits, says Seena Jerrin, Owner of Zatin designers.Subtly traditionalPoornima Indrajith, who has just come out with her new Onam collection, says there is a responsibility that is driving the traditional movement in the industry. You can see it in the make-in-India campaigns and in the sprouting demand for more heritage fabrics. As a designer, I feel it too and take it upon myself to preserve what is essentially our own, said Poornima, who is the owner of Pranaah boutique in Kochi. According to her, people have begun to appreciate the value of traditional handloom. Of course, that is still a niche market, but there is more awareness about this. Many people have also started considering it as part of their identity, she said.Poornima says, Pranaah has come out with an exclusively handwoven Kaithiri Kerala saree for this years Onam collection. However, this time, the theme is quite contemporary, unlike the previous wall kannadi and aanachandam, which were huge hits. I have chosen to keep it more subtle which is why we chose to try out the polka dots which are completely handwoven with the aana images on the off-white Kerala saree fabric. We have also chosen a colourul pattern including lotus peach and aqua blue so that people can wear it even after the Onam season, she said.Traditional-contemporaryBeshaa is one such clothing brand which has come out with the latest traditional-contemporary design collections in saris and kurtas for women. For men also, there is a collection of the traditional jubbas, long and short sleeve kurtas with different patterns.

For Onam, this cloth brand has also brought together a classic collection of some of the best designs in sarees, tunics, anarkalis and kurtas under the theme Kalamezhuthu.

Even the tags of the cloths are made of cotton.Typography designsSpecially hand-painted desginer saris and kurtas with mural designs, contemporary typography designs, Theyam work depicting the art forms of kerala is the latest collection of Sukriti, a cloth brand.  The designs have been inspired from the elements from natuire like the birds, animals and plants with the touch of traditional designs which have been designed by Vinetha Mahesh, a designer, said Jyoti Jawahar, Owner of Sukriti.

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Aug. 25: Activists of the Krishak Mukti Sangram Samiti (KMSS) protested here today demanding repair of breached embankments on a war-footing and declaring the floods and erosion in Assam as a national problem. The protesters submitted a memorandum to chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal of their demands, including preparation of a relief manual and adequate compensation for people who lost their houses, agricultural fields, fisheries and livestock in the deluge. The KMSS said the three waves of floods so far had turned lakhs of bighas of agricultural land into a wasteland by depositing sand and silt. It said cultivation on these fields will be impossible for years to come. It criticised the state government for its ""lukewarm response"" and alleged failure to provide adequate rescue and relief operations. KMSS adviser Akhil Gogoi said the swollen rivers had breached 26 embankments and demanded a CBI inquiry to pinpoint the reasons behind the breaches. He said those responsible for any lapse should be punished. Over 60 people died in the fresh wave of floods taking the overall toll in floods this year to over 100. It affected over 35 lakh people in 31 out of the 33 districts. Akhil said Rs 1 crore should be given to the next of kin of those who died in the floods. The KMSS said apart from rice, pulses, salt and mustard oil, relief materials should include infant food and fodder. Akhil demanded Rs 20 lakh compensation for those who lost their pucca house and Rs 10 lakh for a kuchha house. ""Families whose granaries were flooded should be provided enough food to last a year. Those who lost standing crops should be provided relief materials for two years and Rs 50,000 for those whose fish farms were damaged,"" he said. The KMSS also demanded waiver of all loans for the affected people, scientific methods to tackle erosion, construction of stronger embankments, scrapping of big dams under construction in China, Bhutan, Arunachal Pradesh and Manipur and permanent measures for protection of Kaziranga, Manas and Dibru-Saikhowa National Parks from floods and erosion."

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession.

We even celebrated the citys 378th birthday with much pomp and show recently. On the contrary, the stone inscription found near Krishnagiri provides evidences of a civilised Chennai 1,000 of years ago.S Rajavelu, senior epigraphist and former member of the Archeological Survey of India, said Chennais orignal name was Maadarasapattanam (cluster of cities and villages). Almost one lakh stone inscriptions have been found across the country of which almost 60,000 inscriptions belong to the Tamil community.The one found near the Pennar River near Krishnagiri was the inscription made by Kampana II a King of the Vijayanagara dynasty during the 13th Century. The king conquered the ports along Maadarasapattanam and taxes collected were used to build an artificial canal for irrigation. The stone was found many years ago and S Rajavelu deciphered the text which led to the untold history of the Dravidian culture.The name Maadarasapattanam became Madarasapattinam and later became Madras. The name was found to be of non-Tamil origin by many and hence the name got changed to Chennai which was derived from the Chennapattnam. It was named after King Chennappanayagam who provided the land to the British.Evidences also show that commerce from the Madras port happened till Alexandria, the then World Trade Center. Huge jars with Tamil names written over it were found in the excavation sites near the Red Sea. The Royapuram port was considered the main hub of trade among the 22 ports. The important goods exported during the 2nd century included teak, mustard, perfumes and woven dresses from Kancheepuram.The previously found stone inscription of 1361 found near Neelankarai (then Neelakarai blue shore) goes with the stone found near Krishnagiri. The inscription also explains the first election process, which happened in Uthramerur and also the expeditions that were made to the South Asian countries during the 2nd Century."
5a1120719855b76bf13dcf6b,Andhra Pradesh CM Chandrababu Naidu writes to centre against GM mustard,http://www.newindianexpress.com/nation/2017/sep/05/andhra-pradesh-cm-chandrababu-naidu-writes-to-centre-against-gm-mustard-1652597.html,2017-09-05,"NEW DELHI : Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu has written to the Centre against its nod to commercialise genetically modified (GM) mustard and said that concerns of states should be given due importance during the decision-making as agriculture is a State issue. Andhra Pradesh is the tenth State to oppose GM mustard. Despite being an important NDA ally, Telugu Desam Party (TDP) government said that several farmer unions in the State have approached it opposing the commercialisation. Bihar, Delhi, Kerala, TN, West Bengal, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Odisha have already expressed their reservations on the issue.As this is the first GM food crop that has reached this stage after Bt Brinjal, we would like to share our serious concerns about GM mustard. This has been a subject of serious discussion in the State, and several farmer unions have approached us with objections. The fact that the biosafety data of the three GM mustard lines has not been published and that adequate time has not been given for public response has been a matter of concern, said Naidu in his August 10 letter to Union Environment Minister Harsh Vardhan.Requesting the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change not to approve GM mustard for commercialisation. Naidu said, Further, we would like to state that it is not a practical approach to say that even after approval by the Government of India, each State can decide whether to allow the cultivation of the GM crop because once commercialisation is allowed it would be very difficult for State governments to regulate whether the seed is used in their states.The State has undertaken a large programme to develop natural farming. We believe that this is the best way forward for ensuring better incomes for farmers as well as sustaining soil fertility, crop diversity and cattle wealth. The reality is that genetically modified crops and organic farming cannot be compatible with each other. Allowing GM crops will seriously affect Indias status as a potential giant in organic food production, said Naidu. The State has expressed serious reservations over field trials of GM crops."

This has been proved true by 57-year-old Mashang Hemram of Pahadpur village under Chadheipahadi panchayat in Mayurbhanj district. After making meagre income from paddy crop for successive years, he tried his hand at banana plantation in his farmland situated in the hilly terrains four years back. Today, he is known as lakhpati (a man of lakhs) in his area.Hemrams success story began in 2013 when he attended a Jana Samparka Shibira at Chdheipahadi High School. Different departments including Horticulture from Rairangpur had set up stalls at the camp to encourage the farmers to take up banana cultivation as a profitable crop. Hemram bought a couple of banana saplings and planted it in the backyard of his house in a sloping land.After harvesting from the two plants, Hemram started banana farming as a main crop. In order to further encourage him, the Horticulture Department provided him 1200 plants at subsidised rate in first phase in 2014. He also applied new farming technology as provided by the Department in his plantation. In the current season, he has planted at least 1300 banana saplings.Hemram should earn around ` three lakh from his third crop. He sells banana bunches each for `300 to `350 while investing `60 for a bunch. He sells the produce at Rairangpur and the village weekly market, Assistant Director of Horticulture, Sukanta Kumar Nayak, said. Hemram is now a proud owner of 1.5 hectare of lush green patch with banana plants behind his house. While his elder son is a Plus Three first year Arts student in Seemanta College at Jharpokharia, his younger son studies at a residential Plus Two college in Balasore.He spends at least ` 2 lakh towards their education annually. His wife, Kapura, helps him in the plantation work.The Horticulture Department always inspires farmers to grow bananas, mustard, maize and other short-term profitable inter-crops, Deputy Director of District Horticulture, Dharanidhar Patra said.Meanwhile, Hemram has emerged as an inspiration for other farmers of Pahadpur which is surrounded by Chadheipahadi hills and river Katra in the Maoist affected area, around 35 kms from the neighbouring Jharkhand. With limited access to rest of the world, there is no motorable road, telephone network or power supply to the village. Despite all these constraints, 50-year-old Balaram Majhi, another villager, has followed the footsteps of Hemram by growing bananas over two hectares.Profit MarginsThe farmer sells banana bunches each for L300 to L350 in the village weekly market. He spends only L60 for cultivating a bunch of banana.He is likely to earn a profit of J2.5 lakh to Jthree lakh from his third cropThis season, he has planted at least 1,300 banana saplings in his orchard"
5a11510b9855b76bf13df5af,'Fund must for education',https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170909/jsp/odisha/story_171791.jsp,2017-09-09,"The state's eminent academics and the chancellor (governor) have time and again raised concern over the standard of education in Odisha. How do you think Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology (OUAT) is faring? The higher education system entirely depends on the school education system. If you have a good school education system, then we are good. But that is lacking. We are fortunate that we get students through the examination system, which stresses on career. Our students have done well in the Junior Research Fellowship. Now, we stand eighth among all state agriculture universities in the country. Our position is 11th if we include deemed universities Being a premier university in agriculture, has OUAT been successful in transferring the technology from laboratories to land? We have 31 Krishi Vigyan Kendras that play the role of a catalyst in transferring the technology to the field across the state. We signed an MOU with the National Remote Sensing Centre, Hyderabad, to use satellite data for real-time agricultural monitoring. It will help farmers plan by providing exact information on land and water availability. Besides, it can give accurate weather forecast. The centre will train young scientists from various disciplines in the use of satellite data for agriculture along with drought assessment and monitoring. We have also inked an MoU with Philippines-based International Rice Research Institute for production of high nutritional paddy seed in the state. We have developed stress-tolerant rice varieties that are performing exceptionally well under the adverse effects of climate change such as flooding, drought and salinity. We have signed MoUs with five institutions of international repute like the International Livestock Research Institute for production of feed and fodder. It will look into the issue of fodder supply and demand, improve feeding practices and building capacity of key players. Are there any more MoUs in the pipeline? We have initiated efforts for an agreement with the Software Technology Parks of India to introduce IT-enabled agriculture. It will provide an opportunity to farmers to get smart agriculture services. It will give ample scope to farmers to adopt best practices to get maximum yield with minimum manpower and less investment. We are focusing on giving market linkage through agri enterpreneuership. But what has been the contribution of OUAT to the state so far? It's the only agriculture university that deals with a wide range of subjects. It has made quite an intervention in the livelihood of the common man. We have produced more than 151 varieties of crops, including different varieties of paddy such as Lalat, Khandagiri, Parijata, Konark and Surendra. Because of this, we have become a surplus state in rice production. What are the projects that university is undertaking at this moment? We are focusing on developing cold and weed resistant pulse varieties. Under the project, five pulses such as green gram, red lentil, black gram, peas and fava beans will be cultivated in farms after paddy harvest. We have been successful in our interventions in maize, ginger, chilli, sunflower and mustard. The students are now being provided with training about hybrid maize production, rose, honey, mushroom cultivation and packaging and marketing, milk and fish cultivation. Are you satisfied with OUAT's research and development compared to other universities? One should not indulge in comparisons. The research activities undertaken at OUAT are marvellous compared to the money we have invested in them. We didn't have any contingency to undertake critical research work. Now, the state government increased our budgetary provision by 35 per cent after we raised the issue. We also have nearly 96 vacancies in the faculties despite the posts being sanctioned a decade ago. The workload has increased and many new research fields are opening up and we will certainly go ahead in the coming days. The OUAT has nearly 5,500 students. Do you have any plans to set up a second campus? We have not thought about a second campus. We have our 11 constituent colleges across the state in agriculture, engineering and horticulture. But we are acquiring space to improve the existing infrastructure here. The chief minister recently laid the foundation stone of various infrastructure projects, including new classrooms and examination hall of the college of forestry. He also visited the organic mushroom centre and the students' maize research fields and interacted with them on how the outcome of the research could be utilised by the farmers. The Assembly passed the OUAT Amendment Bill in 2013 to accord affiliation to private institutions for imparting education in agriculture. How many private institutions have applied for affiliation? Not a single one. Do you think we should encourage private institutions? In the changing world scenario, huge investment and infrastructure is required for the improvement of education. The government cannot do it alone. At the same time, the government has the mechanism to control and regulate faculty members to ensure that the quality of education is not compromised. In the 2012 annual budget, the Centre had announced Rs 50 crore to OUAT. Did you receive all the funds? So far, we have received only Rs 12 crore. However, I will not comment on the past. We have an agriculture university as well as a Central Rice Research Institute (Cuttack) in the state. But why has there not been a green revolution in Odisha like Punjab? To make significant progress in agriculture, we should have three basic things - enough irrigation, adequate fertilisers and assured supply of power. Besides, we also need funds. After Independence, Punjab got huge funds from the Centre. They have all the three things mentioned above. Agriculture in Odisha is a victim of natural hazards. But things have started taking off. After the second green revolution, we have surpassed many in the field of rice production and in some other sectors. The vice-chancellor of Ravenshaw University has stirred up a controversy by pointing fingers at unnecessary political interventions in university administration. What about you? Not at all. We had no election last time and there are no elections this time as well as the students are busy building their careers. With no elections, our atmosphere is peaceful. Yesterday you had been invited to share your thoughts on the Mahanadi river dispute. How serious is the problem? I am raising the issue as an agro-meteorologist and not as an Odia - man has exclusive right over water. For the cause of industrial growth of one state, one cannot give up water, which is crucial to the livelihood of lakhs of people. If the flow of water in the Mahanadi is checked, the surface water level in various parts of the state will go down and it will have a serious impact on the ecosystem and livelihood of people as well as the climate. You are closely associated with the farming sector. Experts are of the view that the government's Re 1 per kg rice scheme has made people lethargic and it its difficult to find labourers for agricultural activities. In a welfare state, the basic duty of the government is to adopt a food security policy for its citizens and to ensure that there is no starvation death. From that point of view, the government has done the right thing. That people are becoming lethargic is a social issue. What would you have been had you not been a teacher? Since my childhood I had thought of becoming a teacher. It's my dream that has been fulfilled with God's grace."

And during the five days of Puja, eating at home is a big no-no for most Kolkatans. No wonder, most city restaurants come up with Puja special menus, while others experiment with their regular offerings to woo customers during the festival. For some foodies, happiness is gorging on the traditional Bengali cuisine, while for others, Puja is the time to explore tastes. So, while you chalk out your pandal-hopping itinerary, it's time you also make plans of dropping into restaurants offering your favourite dishes with a quirky twist. Not only do the dishes have a hint of Bangaliana in them, but will also leave you with an ethereal aftertaste, making the festivities a yummy experience. Like the idea?A true-blue Bengali surely knows his fish. From pabda to parshe, from hilsa to katla, there's hardly anyone who can beat the Bangali babu when it comes to choosing the freshest of fish at a Sunday morning market. But while the maachh has remained constant, the jhol has seen transformation of tastes over the years. The plain simple fish curry, made mostly with paanch foron, now sees the inclusion of exotic items like lotus stems and elephant apple, among other things. The latest experiment with the Bengali fish curry is the addition of kamala or oranges, apart from other Indian spices, thereby giving an all new twist to the dish. Here's presenting you the kamala katla jhol. The dish draws inspiration from Pratim D Gupta's film, Maacher Jhol, and is available at 6 Ballygunge Place. Paoli, the leading lady of the film, joined us at the restaurant to experience the delicacy, which is surely going to be the must-have item for every Bengali this Puja.Maachher jhol and Bengalis are inseparable. A fish loving Bengali cannot even imagine a day without his bowl of maachher jhol and bhaat. And giving a quirky twist to the staple Bengali fish curry is the kamala katla jhol. Inspired by the recently released film Maacher Jhol, the dish, as the name suggests, has orange juice as one of the main ingredients. It not only lends a sweet and tangy taste to the dish, but also gives a strong aroma of orange. The chefs of 6 Ballygunge Place indulged in extensive brainstorming and research before coming up with the correct concoction of spices. Garnished with curry leaves and pieces of fresh oranges, the gravy of the dish will leave your tastebuds asking for more. A plate of steaming-hot basmati rice goes perfectly with this item.Biryani has been winning the hearts of Bengalis for ages now. And no celebration is complete without a steaming hot plateful. The aromatic spiced rice  a staple from the kitchen of the Nawab of Awadh, Wajid Ali Shah  came to the City of Joy in 1856. Over the years, the delectable Mughlai dish has been savoured in different forms  with aloo or without, sprinkled, at times, with golden fried onions, or shredded meat instead of a large chunk. A hot favourite for the Kolkatans this Puja would be Oudh 1590's raan biryani, in which hand-pulled tender shredded meat is generously sprinkled over flavoured rice and the combination is cooked in dum pukht style. The biryani comes without the round golden brown aloo, but the ample amount of meat makes up for its absence. And to give a hint of Bangaliana, the dish is topped with a generous dollop of khanti ghee!Murgir jhol or Bengali-style chicken curry has always been a delicacy, be it during the festive season or on a mundane weekday. The Chatgaiya murgir jhol is inspired by the culinary traditions of Chittagong in Bangladesh and is a typical home-style chicken curry. This dish will be enjoyed by lovers of spicy food, especially since it's simply made using coriander paste and green chilli paste. A plateful of hot ghee bhat is the best accompaniment with this dish.If you gather a bunch of argumentative Kolkatans and ask them about which place serves the best fish fry in town, you can expect the followingmonologue: ""I love Mitra Cafe, but Apanjan's fish fry is fluffy and has a thick slab of bekti fillet...."" But this common Bengali snack has experienced an innovative twist over the years and is available in different shapes, sizes and fillings, apart from the bekti fillet. The Tikki of Joy (name inspired from the City of Joy) is the Kolkata style fish fry, but here the fish is lightly poached as opposed to boiling it, and the coating is made with Japanese Panko style breadcrumbs and then deep fried. It is served with kasundi that's absolutely fresh and zingy.What saves you when you're dead hungry after hours of pandal hopping and want something filling to satiate your tummy? A pizza. And when this Italian staple dish comes with a quirky Bengali twist, your pet pujo is taken care of during the festive season. And when the Bengali's favourite daab chingri comes as a pizza topping, then happiness really knows no bounds. Slow cooked prawns with tender coconut, ground mustard, chilli and fennel are sprinkled generously on the pizza. If you're curious about the mention of Iti aunty, then the chef of Monkey Bar, told us that he once had a delectable daab chingri delicacy prepared by a woman named Iti. He loved the dish so much that he decided to make a pizza inspired by it, using it as a topping, and thus coined this special name.The Bong 's favourite hansher dim diye gorom bhaat gets a modern twist through this dish. The duck eggs are cleverly incorporated by adding diced runny half-boiled duck eggs and the yolk to a mixture of cream, butter and macaroni pasta before it is gratinated with sharp cheddar cheese.Bongs drool over crabs. Fondly called 'Dasarath' in Bengali households, the crabs are mixed with zesty seasonings in this dish, making it a must try this Puja. The well-cooked crab meat are topped with buttered breadcrumbs and served with boiled veggies. Sounds yummy, doesn't it? Trust us, it really is!Khubani is apricots in Hindi. Unlike the regular malai koftas, which are round, these are in the shape of kodma  a type of sweet used in several Pujas in the city. Apart from apricots, the stuffing of the kofta consists of mashed potato, cashew nuts, paneer, chopped garlic and green chillies. The koftas, after being fried separately, is dipped in sweet and spicy makhani gravy. The dish also has a dash of kasoori methi, which gives it a nice aroma.It's not often that we find chirey or flattened rice, a common food item in Bengali households, being used in an exotic dish. In this delicacy, the flattened rice is used in an innovative way along with paneer, green peas, palak, potato, kishmish, khoya and cashew nut. The chirey is used as the crumb in preparing the kebabs and since it also has a cheese filling, as you take each bite, the liquid cheese melts in your mouth! The dish is served with mint chutney. With acrispy outer coating and a soft stuffing inside, the kebabs make for the best accompaniment with beverages.Molecular gastronomy takes over the Bengali rannaghar as the age-old tradition of rubbing fish with spices and mustard oil before deep frying is retained here while preparing this delicacy. The bekti fillets are dry rubbed in a marinade of cream cheese and tangy sweet homemade aam kasundi and then, instead of deep frying, they are vacuum-sealed and poached in a sous vide machine at a controlled temperature, retaining the natural juiciness and flavours of the fish and extracting all the notes and textures of aam kasundi, which would otherwise be lost in deep frying. Sous vide is a method of cooking in which food is vacuum-sealed in a plastic pouch and then placed in a water bath or steam environment for longer than normal cooking times (usually 1 to 7 hours) at an accurately regulated temperature. The dish is served with a creme. Chantilly of whipped cream and Malibu rum.Happiness knows no bound when the kosha mangsho aka spicy Bengali mutton curry  a Sunday staple in the Bong household  finds a place on a pizza topping. Especially during Duga Puja, when you crave to have a traditional Bengali dish, yet look for a quirky twist, Hoppipola's kosha mangsho pizza should be the top choice. Chunks of spicy mutton pieces are placed on a layer of cheese in this thin crust pizza. It's crispy, cheesy, zesty and definitely oh so yummy."

Picture by UB Photos Guwahati, Sept. 11: Assam water resources minister Keshab Mahanta today told the Assembly that IIT Guwahati will be asked to study the causes behind yesterday's flash floods in Sonitpur district in central Assam. Raising the issue during zero hour, BJP MLA Padma Hazarika said the water level of the Jarasar river rose suddenly within half an hour late on Saturday and inundated Rangapara, Balipara and Chariduar areas and also swept away a youth, identified as Diganta Das, at Balipara. His body was retrieved today. Hazarika said the government should constitute an expert committee to study whether the flash floods was caused by heavy rainfall in adjoining hills of Arunachal Pradesh or because of possible damage or breach in any sluice gate or agricultural bund in Arunachal Pradesh. The water resources minister agreed that people were caught unawares by sudden surge of the Jarasar, which originates in Arunachal Pradesh. Mahanta, who visited the affected areas yesterday, said IIT Guwahati will study what caused the flash floods in Sonitpur district, which affected 41,500 people in more than 35 villages. Floodwaters also submerged a stretch of National Highway 15 at Balipara town. He said the district administration, state disaster response force and national disaster response force are engaged in rescue operations and relief distribution. NDRF personnel evacuated 753 marooned people to safer places at Chariduar revenue circle in Sonitpur district yesterday. ""An electrical sub-station was damaged and steps are being taken to repair it,"" he said. Floodwaters started receding from the Chariduar revenue circle today but more than 17 villages are still under water. Earlier during question hour today, minister of state for revenue and disaster management Pallab Lochan Das said according to the Assam Disaster Management Authority report, 158 people died and 220 domestic animals and 228 poultry have been killed in the three waves of floods this year till September 5. Replying to a question by Bodoland Peoples Front legislator Thaneswar Basumatary, Das said 956 relief camps were opened where 4.52 lakh flood-hit people took shelter. The minister said rice, dal, potato, salt, mustard oil, puffed rice ( muri), rice flakes (chira) and baby food were distributed among the flood-affected people. As of today, apart from Sonitpur, areas in six other districts - Dhemaji, Lakhimpur, Udalguri, Nagaon, Morigaon and Jorhat - are reeling under floods. Raising the issue of flood and erosion causing massive loss of life and livelihood every year, AGP legislator Phani Bhushan Choudhury called for sending an all-party delegation to New Delhi to impress upon the Centre to declare it a national calamity. ""While floods kill people and destroy cropland, nearly 8,000 hectares of land are eroded every year. The size of Majuli, the river island and seat of Vaishnavite culture, has been reduced by half since 1951. Most of the 4,474-km embankments which were constructed years ago to reduce the impact of floods have outlived their lifespan. Assam bears the impact of floods because of rain in neighbouring states but the efforts to involve other states to mitigate floods have not materialised yet."" Another senior AGP legislator Brindaban Goswami said the government should launch a drive to register and maintain records of erosion-affected people. Responding to them, chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal assured that the government with the help of the Centre had taken steps to mitigate the flood and erosion problem. He said a national-level conference to find solutions to these issues would be held here soon. ADDITIONAL REPORTING BY PRANAB KUMAR DAS"

Flowers too are healing; ever wondered why red roses are associated with love and romance? That is because they have the energy to open up the heart chakra.So says, flower-card reader and therapist Revathy Krishnakumar who has been certified by renowned naturopath Robert Reeves from Australia. Flowers can heal specific situations and physical, emotional and spiritual issues and bring back joy and beauty in peoples lives, says this therapist who practices in Bengaluru.Flowers with their vibrant colours, essences and energies can be used in various situations. For example if you want to remove negativity from your home, you can spread white rose petals all over and pick them up after a couple of hours and bury them in the earth. African violets can be placed in your office and home to cleanse and clear negativity. Frangipani aids in mediation as it helps to open up the crown chakra. It can up your energy levels and helps in spiritual communication, enhancing your intuition. The real flowers or picture of this flower can be used during meditation and also can be used during puja.Flower therapy cards are used by trained healers who have been certified by Robert Reeves and, it is believed that healing can even be done over long distances. The healer picks up cards for the client and can interpret them. You need to have a strong intuition and psychic abilities to read these cards, says Revathy.Lavender is destressing and spraying its essence on your pillows can help you relax after a tiring day, rose essence brings more love into your life as it opens your heart chakra and heals it.Daffodils (remember the poem by William Wordsworth?) open up communication channels and help in making better speeches and writing better. It also helps in completion of projects and meeting deadlines.Counselling follows the card reading session and the key words here are love yourself. Unless you like yourself and accept yourself for what you are, true happiness will always elude you, says Revathy.History of flower therapyEdward Bach, in the early thirties, devised this therapy after observing his patients.In this method, flower essences are administrated orally or percutaneouslyThese solutions are made in brandy or waterPhilosophy says that illnesses come when an individual acts in conflict with his or her souls purposeClinical trials have disputed claims of flower therapyIlls & remediesAgrimony - Tortured despite cheerful faceAspen - Fear of unknown thingsBeech - IntoleranceCentaury - Unable to say noCerato - Lack of self confidenceCherry Plum - Fear of giving upChestnut Bud - Failure to learn from mistakesChicoryChicory - Selfish and possessive loveClematis - Dreaming of a better future withoutconcentrating in the presentCrab Apple - Cleansing remedy, also for self-hatredElm - Overwhelmed by responsibilityGentian - Discouragement after a setbackGorse - Hopelessness and in distressHeather - Self-centredness and self-concernHollyHolly - Hatred, envy and jealousyHoneysuckle - Living in the pastHornbeam - Tiredness at the thought of doing somethingImpatiens - RestlessnessLarch - Lack of confidenceMimulus - Fear of known thingsMustard - Depressed for no reasonOakOak - The plodder who keeps going past the point of exhaustionOlive - Exhaustion after mental or physical workPine - GuiltRed Chestnut - Over-concern for your loved onesRock Rose - Terror and frightRock Water - Self-denial, rigidity and self-repressionScleranthus - Inability to choose an optionShock - Star of BethlehemSweet Chestnut - Extreme mental anguish, when everything has been tried and there is nothing leftVervain - Being over-enthusiasticVine - Dominance and inflexibilityWalnut - Protection from change and unwanted influencesWater Violet - Self-reliance leading to isolationWhite Chestnut - Unfavourable thoughts and mental argumentsWild OatWild Oat - Having doubts over ones direction in lifeWild Rose - Drifting, resignation, apathyWillow - Self-pity and resentmentSource: The Bach Centre"

Nearly 25,000 of the affected people are in the worst-hit Morigaon district, while another 19,000 are in Sonitpur district. More than 10,000 hectare of crop area has also been inundated.The Met department has forecast that rain or thundershower is very likely to occur at most places over Nagaland , Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura and at many places over Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and Meghalaya. The department's warning states, ""Heavy rain is very likely to occur at isolated places over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura on 12th September."" The earlier three waves of flood had left more than 180 people dead and a train of devastation across the state.The current wave has come in even before the assessment of the damage of the earlier three waves could be completed. The state government is seeking an interim central support of nearly Rs 4,000 crore for rebuilding damages. According to sources, more than 1,900 roads and 75 bridges have been damaged, while approach roads to more than 300 bridges have been washed away. There were also about 30 breaches in embankments across the state.Since the first wave in April, more than 3.97 lakh hectare of crop area has been damaged. The state government has so far distributed 1.7 lakh quintal of rice, 33,000 quintal of dal, 1,000 quintal of salt and 1.77 litre of mustard oil as relief material."
5a130ff59855b76bf13e2888,India has ‘narrow’ pool of mustard varieties  say agricultural scientists,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/india-has-narrow-pool-of-mustard-varieties-say-agricultural-scientists/article19679850.ece,2017-09-14,"Slamming activists for spreading misinformation on genetically-modified (GM) mustard, Indias premier association of agricultural scientists has said that India has a narrow pool of mustard varieties.That India had over 9,000 varieties of mustard and was the centre of origin and diversity (of mustard)  was among the key arguments made by Prashant Bhushan in the Supreme Court, as part of a petition by activist Aruna Rodrigues.Earlier a Supreme Court-appointed Technical Advisory Committee had also recommended a stay on GM mustard citing the breadth of Indias genetic diversity in mustard and that introducing it would lead to irreversible contamin- ation.Contrary to GM bashers (sic) propaganda  that very high diversity is available in Indian mustard  scientific analysis has shown that the Indian gene pool of mustard is very narrow as a consequence, in spite of extensive efforts by our plant breeders  there is very little impact of pure-line breeding on mustard yields in recent years, says a report by the National Academy of Agricultural Sciences (NAAS), a 600-member body of agricultural scientists.In June, a 230-member quorum of the NAAS had passed a resolution unanimously supporting the commercial release of Dhara Mustard Hybrid 11 (DMH-11), a transgenic food crop that had been cleared by the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC) for commercial release.The base is narrow and thats why we need hybrid technology for developing better mustard varieties, Panjab Singh, president, NAAS, told The Hindu . Though there were wild-related species, these were largely untenable for commercially extracting oil, he added. Unlike in wheat, for instance, where the male and female can be crossed to make a wide genetic range of hybrid seeds, mustard is a self-pollinating plant that isnt amenable to such crossings. DMH-11 uses a combination of genes from a soil bacterium that makes mustard amenable to hybridisation. The NAAS also refuted claims that non-GM varieties of rapeseed (a sister species of mustard and an oilseed) in Europe out-yielded GM varieties grown in Canada.In a rejoinder, a coalition of activists slammed the NAAS report and accused it of being a public relations agent.The source of the number of species is the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources (an agriculture ministry body) It is unscientific for a scientific body to ignore the diversity that exists, and the implications on that diversity from GM mustard, the Coalition for GM-Free India said in a statement."

One can choose the Bengali delights from the buffets spread.The hot Calcutta Chicken Biryani lives up to its name with fluffy fragrant granules and the chicken pieces with marinated and cooked with fragrant spices. For the starters the raw banana chops or mocha chops as they are better known in Bengal was nicely prepared and fried; the only disappointment was the mustard sauce which didnt taste as good as the typical kasundi sauce.The Khasir Shorba or mutton soup was mildly spiced, but the warmth kept the monsoon-rain chill away from my bones during the evening. To balance out the none-vegetarian palette which dominates the Bengali cuisine, we tried Radha Ballavi.The luchis filled with urad dal were soft and fried till golden making perfect pair with chholar daal or grams cooked in a gravy. It reminded me of a perfect Bengali breakfast on a Sunday. We recommend Ilish Machher Paturi: Hilsa, the monarch of fish, wrapped in a banana leaf and then cooked on the griddle.

The market price of moong (green gram) is Rs 3500-to-4000 per quintal against the MSP of Rs 5575.I sold around 8 quintals of urad at the mandi today at Rs 3601 per quintal, said Prahlad Bairwa (40), a farmer of Rajgarh village in Kota district. I have suffered a loss of around Rs 1800 per quintal since MSP of urad is around Rs 5400 per quintal.Basanti Lal, another farmer, said he sold moong at Rs 4000 per quintal, though the MSP is Rs 5575 (including Rs 200 bonus per quintal).The harvest of urad and moong has begun and the pulses have started arriving in the mandi; the harvest will reach it peak within a fortnight.According to Bhamashahmandi figures available in the last fortnight, urad was sold between Rs 3311 and Rs 4700 per quintal, and moong between Rs 3525 and Rs 4300.Earlier this year, the state government did not buy mustard crop and farmers faced losses; now there is no government purchase of pulses, and farmers are losing around Rs 1500-to-2000 per quintal, said Dashrath Kumar, general secretary of the Hadauti Kisan Union.Government should start purchase of pulses immediately to save farmers from losses; when harvest will reach its peak, a large number of farmers will face losses.Urad is grown more in the kharif season than moong; urad was sown in around 3.20 lakh hectares in Hadauti region, and moong in 35000 hectares.Kota MP Om Birla met union minister of state for agriculture Gajendra Singh Shekhawat and union minister of state for food, civil supplies and commerce CR Chaudhary on Tuesday, demanding government purchase of pulses.There is a high production of urad and moong pulses, so low prices will result in losses for farmers; government purchase of these pulses on MSP should start soon, he said.Birla said the union ministers told him that they have received the Rajasthan governments proposal to start purchasing pulses within 10 days.The Hadauti Kisan Union threatened to launch an agitation if the government does not start pursing pulses in 10 days."

There was absolutely nothing bad at The Calcutta Connection. Here is my top five picks that were simply awesome.Golborir Kosha MangshoInspired by an old restaurant that is considered as a heaven for meat lovers in Kolkata, this is the best Kosha Mangsho I have ever had. The perfectly cooked mutton, that beautiful brown colour, the bubbles of different spices, the aroma filling your nose... absolutely lip-smacking stuff. The taste multiplies when you have it with luchi.Machcher PaturiI was speechless after I had a first bite of this Bengali classic. Machcher Paturi is prepared by wrapping fish Bhetki in a banana leaf with mustard paste. It is slowly cooked in steam and served. The strong flavour of mustard is the soul of this dish. This is something, you would not want to miss.Shiraz Mutton BiryaniThe taste of Kolkata Biryani is one thing that has been tough to forget over the years. The boiled potatoes, the basmati rice, the aroma of Asghar Ali attar specially used in Biryanis and the finely cooked mutton evoked the wonderful memories I had in Kolkata.Lau er Ghanto Bori DiyeThis is Bottle Gourd curry in a Bengali style with vada. The beauty of this dish lies in its simplicity. When so much of action is happening on the plate with the likes of fish and mutton, it tends to get sidelined. But a small portion of it with rice or chapati will restore your faith in it. It is usually cooked with minimal spices, coriander being the most dominant among all. The aroma of ghee adds the needed finesse.Darjeeling Tea Panna Cotta and Gold Flake SmokeTea in one hand and cigarette in another is a common sight in Bengal. Taking a cue from this, the chefs have prepared this dish."

Soon, the starters were brought in quick succession.pics: r satish babuThe famous veg starter, Beguni Bhaja (mustard marinated batter fried eggplants), something that looked like our Mirchi Bhajji, was slightly oily but definitely delicious. Bhekti Machh Paturi (steamed Baramudi fish preparation) was served in a tiny banana leaf, wrapped like a gift  too pretty to eat. The mustard-marinade only enhanced the flavours. We recommend, try the starters with green mint chutney. But we really missed the traditional Bengali Kasundi sauce.The items in the main course were rich in flavour and delicately sweet. Expect Chholar Daal Narkel Diye (coconut flavoured chana daal), Aloo Posto (new potatoes tossed in poppy seeds) to go perfectly with a generous portion of ghee rice. We pay a lot of attention to the kind of potatoes we use in this dish. They need to be round, firm and tiny, informed the chef. Much like puri, the Bengali cuisine has Luchi, flour-based puffed Indian bread which is fried in oil. We waited with patience till the chef brought Kosha Mangsho (spicy lamb preparation).The meat pieces were cooked to perfection, the thick gravy only added to the taste. Both the dishes make for a wonderful combination. No Bengali meal is complete without sweets.

(ANI/Representational photo/Files) The emergence of an expensive yet non-productive lifestyle on the one hand, and Rajasthans withdrawal from the job market on the other, has created a severe socio-economic crisis. (ANI/Representational photo/Files)After Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, farmers from Rajasthan came out on the streets demanding loan waiver and implementation of the Swaminathan Committee report. Protesting against government policies and demanding their share in the countrys development, which they argue have been denied to them, the farmers have shown unity across caste and class lines. However, it is not merely the farm-related economic anxieties that explain this massive farmers mobilisation. These movements have to be contextualised in the evolution of the present model of development and the way it has reshaped societies.Much like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, where the farmers agitations were located in the economically better-performing districts, the epicentre of the farmers movements in Rajasthan were districts that have seen a qualitative change in the rural economy and society in the past three decades  Sikar and Sri Ganganagar. One can see shops selling branded items and luxury cars on the roads in Sri Ganganagar. There are similar shops in Sikar as well. Today, Sikar looks very different from what it was 10 years ago.The district has seen the emergence of a strong private education sector in the last three decades which has given a boost to its economy. Sikars proximity to Jaipur has also resulted in the emergence of a new middle class which has urban aspirations. Government data shows that in 2009 there were around 94 colleges in Sikar which increased to 124 in 2013. Coaching centres have also mushroomed in the district.Traditionally, Sikar has been amongst the few districts in Rajasthan (also Jhunjhunu and Churu) which have a large number of educated people. Despite economic hardships, dependence on rain-fed agriculture and a lack of alternative income resources in the rural areas, the district has a relatively high literacy rate of 70 per cent. Two-and-a-half decades ago, the educated youth was an active participant in the organised sector. However, since 1991, the state has gradually withdrawn from providing jobs in general and in the education, health and engineering sector in particular.Sikars educated youth got accommodated in the private education industry in the region due to growth in engineering, medical and other private enterprises. However, with the states withdrawal from various employment generating avenues and the gradual decline in employment opportunities in the private sector  a regular feature of Rajasthans political economy in the past few years  the youth have no other option but to go back and work on their farms. They also look for employment opportunities in the informal education sector.Sri Ganganagar and the nearby district, Hanumangarh, has also witnessed significant rural-agrarian change in the past three decades. The two districts are beneficiaries of the Green Revolution with irrigation water from the Ganga Singh Canal and Indira Gandhi Canal available to them. In the initial years, the region benefitted from using new agricultural technology. A new wealthy agrarian class emerged, which has invested heavily in an urbanised life style and also in the education of their male children. The cropping pattern in the region has also shifted towards cash crops like mustard and cotton (Sri Ganganagar contributes 18 per cent of Rajasthans cotton production). A gradual increase in the cost of farm inputs has led to a rise in the cost of agricultural production.Increasing access to education and high income levels in the two districts has led to consumerism among the rural youth. This economic change was, however, not accompanied by changes in social and cultural values. The youth became urbanised but have retained their rural cultural essence. The older values of rural community prestige have been clubbed with the urban values of extravagant marriages, heavy spending on rituals or religious activities, wealthaccumulation and, above all, an individualised life.This gap between the social and economic spheres is clearly visible in Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh districts. Despite a high per capita income, Sri Ganganagar has a very poor sex ratio. A large part of the farmers income in these districts goes in dowry or in rituals related to birth and death or in organising satsangs and jagrans. The Dera Saccha Sauda enjoys a lot of support in the two districts. In the last few years, expenditure on education and health has increased in the districts. The areas are also victims of a health crisis created by the overuse of chemicals in the production of food items, including vegetables and fruits.The emergence of an expensive yet non-productive lifestyle on the one hand, and the states withdrawal from the job market on the other, has created a severe socio-economic crisis. There are a large number of educated yet unemployed youth in all these districts. In their bid to bridge the gap between social aspirations and economic realities, they fall into a debt trap. Falling farm incomes, lack of jobs and absence of alternative sources of income on one hand, and increasing expenditure on health and education on the other, has destroyed the rural economy in these newly emerging zones of prosperity.Demonetisation delivered the final blow to the economy and society of these regions. The rural-agrarian cash economy which used to provide some income to the youth in the countryside collapsed after demonetisation. The state has tried to preserve traditional ethos and cultural traditions, rather than promote scientific temper amongst the younger generation. The situation was thus rife for a psychological outburst.The states policy towards rural development has been ad-hoc and devoid of a long-term vision of sustainable development. The Sikar, Sri Ganganagar and Hanumangarh models, despite their differences, have produced a generation of people who have expectations but lack the opportunities to fulfil them. Farmers are the worst victims of this unguided and unplanned process of change. In the changing nature of the rural structure, they have been left with no option but to agitate and demand short-term relief from the state.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

I can imagine what her dining table would look like  laden with some of the best known dishes of Bengal, from fish and mutton preparations, to fries and cutlets, stuffed vegetables and chutneys.Being a card-holding feminist  let me remind new readers that I protested in front of a Miss India pageant many years ago  I do not belong to that school of thought which states that the best chefs are always men. Though some of my best friends are men who cook, and rather well, I hold with high regard women who have been cooking delicious stuff  and writing about it, too. Consider all these names from Bengal  Bunny Gupta, Jaya Chaliha, Minakshie Das Gupta, Chitrita Banerjee, Satarupa Banerjee. I rely on their books whenever I want to try out something interesting from Bengal.And now I think I need to get some recipes out of Iti Aunty, who is based in Kolkata and is known to wield a mean ladle. I had a special thaala  thats thaali in Bengali  curated by her at the Monkey Bar the other evening, and have been licking my fingers ever since. The festival  on from tomorrow (September 24) to September 30  is a Puja special that also seeks to celebrate what is called pate puja in Bengal, or worshipping the stomach.I am, as you know, very fond of the Monkey Bar. The CP outlet has shut down, but the one in the Vasant Kunj Market is so full of life that I feel years younger whenever I am there. Theres loud music, no doubt, but the lights that glitter from funky chandeliers, the great menu and the friendly staff all make for a very happy meal.And I had a very, very happy meal when I was invited to try out Iti Auntys Pujor Special Thaala. There are three kinds of platters on offer  with fish (Rs. 1299 plus taxes), with chicken (Rs. 1199 plus taxes), and vegetarian (Rs. 999 plus taxes). Every thaala has in common aloor dom, a Bengali variation of dum aloo, flavoured with cumin and other spices, begun kasundi, which is an eggplant dish with a sharp mustard flavour, plastic chutney, cooked with raw papayas, and tomato chutney.I opted for the fish thhaala which also included fish kachori, bhoona khichri with fried mourola fish, steamed prawns wrapped in pumpkin leaves, fish cutlet and kamala bhetki. Each one was delicious.The gravy in the kamala bhetki was lightly flavoured with oranges, so it was mildly sweet, as Bengali food can be. The prawns were sharp with mustard and the fish cutlet  with mashed boneless fish mixed with potato, crumbed and fried  was just right.I have had various kinds of kachoris, or Bengali kochuris, but the fish kochuri was one of a kind, with a filling of mashed bhetki. The kachori, soft and puffy like a puri, was absolutely superb. I enjoyed the khichri immensely, too. It had been cooked with the fragrant gobindo bhog rice and moong dal, flavoured with ghee and topped with fried onions and fried mourala fish.Mourala is a small fish that I think is best eaten when fried with just a coating of salt, chillies and turmeric. Here they had put a besan batter around the fish. The problem with the fish is that it has to be eaten fresh off the kadhai, because if kept out for a while, it goes limp in this weather.The kasundi  a strong and mildly bitter mustard sauce  gave the begun kasundi a nice kick and I happily finished off the plastic chutney  so called because of its light, translucent look.The chicken thaala includes mughlai porotas, flaky, fried bread that Calcutta is known for, bhoona khichuri with chicken meatballs, chicken chop, chicken kosha and omelette curry, which is a great Bengali favourite of omelette pieces in a light gravy.The vegetarian thaala has luchi, or maida puris, parwal stuffed with cottage cheese, dhokar dalna, steamed dal cakes in gravy, sukto, a light vegetable mix, mildly bitter and sweet, steamed rice, apart from the four common dishes.The platter didnt come with a sweet. I told Chef Himmat, the man on the spot, hed have a mini Bengali rebellion at hand if there was no dessert. I got a call yesterday to say that mishti doi has now been added to the platter  which I think is a great idea.This may sound corny, but I have just two words for the festival  De taali.Address: Plot No 11, Pocket C 6 & 7, Commercial Complex Vasant Kunj; Tel: 011 41095155; Open from noon to midnight (those under 25 years are only allowed till 6:00 pm)"
5a1484889855b76bf13e521d,Cattle and cash curbs stoke farm revolt,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170925/jsp/nation/story_174909.jsp,2017-09-25,"Cattle graze on a field off the Sikar-Jaipur highway Sikar, Sept. 24: A 13-day agitation by Rajasthan's farmers, joined by about 100 disc jockeys with sound systems blaring, has forced the Vasundhara Raje government to agree to loan waivers up to Rs 50,000 and payment of the full minimum support price. Some 15,000 farmers had gathered at a mandi in Sikar town, 115km from Jaipur, on September 1 and by the time the government buckled on September 13 night, their strength had grown to nearly one lakh, according to spearhead All India Kisan Sabha. On September 9, the Sikar district DJs' association sent a cavalcade of over 100 sound system-fitted cars to join the protests. ""We too come from farming families, which too are burdened with loans,"" explained Babulal, a DJ who performs at weddings and other celebrations. While the mainstay of the movement was Sikar, where the Kisan Sabha has a strong base, the organisation with less than 4 lakh members in the state managed to mobilise support in 13 other districts too. Traders observed a day's strike in Sikar in support of the farmers and provided the agitators with food and water. Vasundhara Raje ""The trader who sells farm equipment is burdened with the goods and services tax. He knows that if the farmer is unable to sell his crop, he cannot buy the trader's products,"" said Navrang Lal, a trader from neighbouring Neemrana. Amra Ram, the All India Kisan Sabha national president and a four-time ex-legislator from the CPM, admits that the farmers have merely won the first round. ""A farmer has to first fight to get his demands accepted, and a second time to have them implemented. We are ready,"" he said in his chamber at ""Comrade Bhavan"", the district CPM headquarters in Sikar. A series of central government decisions over the past one year - from demonetisation to cattle sale curbs and the goods and services tax - had left farmers and allied traders reeling. Several decisions of the state's BJP government compounded the problems. Rajasthan, the only state with a full-fledged ministry dedicated to cows, imposed a 10 per surcharge on stamp duty on non-judicial instruments this year to raise money to protect cows. But the farmers say they have had enough of cow protection - it's they themselves who need protection now. Since the central government banned animal markets from transacting cattle sales for slaughter, farmers have been burdened with unproductive cows they can't sell - or have to sell locally at throwaway prices. Barbed fences, or makeshift barriers made of branches tied together to stave off old stray cattle, are common sights now across crop fields in Rajasthan. ""This isn't all. The government has laid down that a calf cannot be separated from its mother for the first six months of its life,"" said Ram Partap Bagariya, resident of Rashidpura near Sikar. ""We need the milk - for our families and to sell to customers. How'd we survive without the milk?"" Another problem, the farmers say, was that the state government did not pay the promised minimum support price for their crops. ""Across the border in Madhya Pradesh, farmers were selling onions at Rs 8 a kg while in Rajasthan they got half the price. Nor did the government procure mustard. We suffered heavy losses,"" said Dhani Ram of Reengus. Rajasthan produces 11 per cent of India's pulses, second only to Madhya Pradesh, but this year the growers faced ruin. While they invested Rs 13,000 per hectare of chickpea, the crop sold at Rs 4,800 a hectare. For green gram, the investment was Rs 9,000 per hectare and sold at Rs 3,000. ""Last year, 15 to 20 trucks carried barley from our mandi every day. This year, we have barely seen 4 to 5 truckloads a day,"" said Sandeep Agarwal, secretary of the Krishi Upaj Mandi in Sikar where the farmers had assembled for 13 days. ""In the case of mustard, the number of trucks has fallen from 30 to 3."" The state government has agreed to pay the minimum support price from October 1 while a task force will work out the details of the loan waiver after studying similar schemes in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab. The report will be submitted in a month's time. In June, Punjab had announced loan waivers of up to Rs 4 lakh for marginal farmers and Rs 2 lakh for small farmers, with the package expected to cost the exchequer around Rs 10,000 crore. Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra have announced waivers up to Rs 1 lakh, with the expected bills being Rs 36,359 crore and Rs 30,500 crore, respectively. Implementation has been riddled with controversy, though. This newspaper reported earlier this month how the Uttar Pradesh government had waived sums as low as Rs 27 and Rs 42 on loans of Rs 18,000 and Rs Rs 1 lakh. Amra Ram has his fingers crossed. ""In Maharashtra, farmers with pucca houses have been left out of the waiver scheme. Let's see what the government here comes up with,"" he said. The Kisan Sabha chief has a theory why the Rajasthan agitation succeeded at a time farmers from Tamil Nadu have been intermittently squatting at New Delhi's Jantar Mantar for months, waiting to be heard. ""Delhi is not bothered with what's happening thousands of kilometres away in the southern states. People from these states can't come to Delhi in large numbers,"" he said. ""But when a mass mobilisation happens anywhere in the Hindi belt, everyone takes notice."""
5a1483029855b76bf13e50f3,Just right for the day,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170926/jsp/opinion/story_174961.jsp,2017-09-26,"The first thing you eat and drink in the morning is hugely important. The beverage and food provides fuel to a body that has, usually, not ingested anything for a good few hours. The quality and quantity, the taste and the 'rightness' of the first meal also go a long way towards shaping the start of your day and possibly the whole day itself. Furthermore, that first intake also fits in with a whole cluster of morning rituals that define who you are, ethnically, culturally, socially and class-wise. Or, horror of horrors, it doesn't actually gel with your usual habits and needs, creating its own misregistration between you and the day. Or, then again, the change of morning alimentation could provide a delicious challenge to an intrepid, unprejudiced and curious traveller. In my family of three, breakfast didn't actually exist. My parents would drink tea in the morning ( desi style, CTC, milk and sugar), while listening to the radio and reading the newspaper. Watching them, I used to think the crackling pages were actually their morning nashta, though they would also snack on some non-oily, non-spicy chevdo and some biscuits. The real meal would only come in the shape of an early lunch around 11 am. They could afford to stick to this very Gujju routine because my father ran his own business and my mother taught in a college where she never had early classes. On the other hand, I had to be given fodder before school and so strategies were developed, involving fruits, Bournvita, Ovaltine, Cadbury's Hot Chocolate and toast. My Madrasi friend who lived down the road came to school having quaffed lovely home-made idli, vada and dosai, which I thought was hugely unfair. At some point, eggs and I were introduced to each other by my mother, but outside our strictly vegetarian home. By and by, I discovered the illicit, taboo-joy of meat, which meant bacon or sausages along with the eggs. There was an epiphanic moment at age 15, on the first day of my first trip to the West. Travelling with my father on a strict budget, we found ourselves in a small hotel in Paris, confronting the all-important free breakfast that came with the price of the room. I sipped on magical hot chocolate, the likes of which I'd never tasted before, and simultaneously discovered this flaky, buttery, airy thing called a croissant and the French jams that go with it. At that age I knew a tiny bit about French painting and sculpture but this breakfast was the first time I encountered Gallic culture viscerally, haptically, through touch, smell and taste, and I was left flabbergasted - no wonder they painted so brilliantly after such a breakfast. Later, I came across the comment of the great film-maker, Jean Renoir: ""the quality of the day's shooting depends on the taste of the first cup of coffee in the morning."" By this time I'd graduated through my first encounter with the French petit djeuner and had had close dealings with all sorts of different breakfasts. There was the ghastly 'dead omelette' and banana at boarding school, variations on the same theme on the Indian railways, and, in contrast, the winter joys of stuffed paranthas, achar and dahi in roadside dhabas in north India. Filming in rural Bengal, you realized that 'breakfast' was as alien a concept here as in a middle-class Gujju household, often consisting of lal chaa accompanied by chirey or dry muri with green chillies and mustard oil. Travelling in Rajasthan, the tea came with dry rotis and pickles. South India was a heaven of different kinds of home-made dosai, upmas and utthapams. In Maharashtra, the sweet Gujju tea was tweaked just that little bit with spices that made it undrinkable for someone like me, but the pohey were a revelation. In various parts of the country, people with a little bit of money were also able to bombard their stomachs, first thing in the morning, with deep fried samosas, filluries and bhajiyas. Upon travelling, all sorts of categorizations would attack the mind that was just waking up. Breakfasts were cold or hot, heavy or light, centred around sweet tastes or savoury, expansively vegetarian, with a small non-veg presence or a truckload of meat with some tiny vegetable alibis on the side; there were summer breakfasts in hot countries and then summer ones in cold countries; winter breakfasts in the tropics and winter breakfasts with icicles hanging from the window. The one hugely unhealthy thing that became a constant for far too many of us was the coupling of a cup of tea or coffee with a cigarette; this would be first thing we would touch in the morning before space was created, biologically and mentally, for any solid food. At some point in a wintry Paris very different from the one I first visited, working on finishing the post-production of a film, I was introduced to the 'French working man's breakfast', which added a shot or two of cognac to the already formidable coffee and cigarette combination. In contrast to the gut-scouring sparseness of this lunacy were the examples of extreme morning excess. At a certain young age in America, it seemed to me and my pals a fun idea to put away a stack of pancakes, two kinds of egg, sausages, bacon and hash browns plus coffee and juice, all in one eating frenzy in some diner. Across the Atlantic, the 'Full English' was no less bruising: eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, all the aforementioned pig variations plus black pudding (for those who don't know: a delicious, dark biscuit of dried beef blood). As a change from this, one thankfully came across one standard Middle Eastern breakfast which consisted of olives, hummus, various other pastes, roasted and raw vegetables, salad and pita bread. Speaking of a 'Full English', I recently found myself watching a documentary titled Secrets of the Royal Kitchen, where one got to see two kinds of breakfast being made in the British royal kitchens. One was a 'normal' breakfast for Her Maj, elaborately eviscerated discs of brioche were lightly fried to make cages for poached eggs, which were then served with sausages. The other was a reconstruction of the wedding brekker made for the union of Charles and Diana in 1981, a meal eaten by the royals and a hundred and twenty of their closest friends. Starring on the menu were quenelles of brill with a lobster sauce and a breast of chicken stuffed with a lamb mousse, coated with brioche breadcrumbs, a minted cream sauce and samphire. Somewhere else in the film it says Queen Elizabeth never travels without crates and crates of her own English bottled water. No matter where in the world, the royal tea is always made with this same water. Watching this food porn I felt no twitch of lust for all the expensive, elaborate food that was being made and displayed. One of the things that put me off was when they said no garlic at all was allowed into the royal kitchens. As one grows older the realization hits the gut: eating some things in the morning makes you happy while eating other things, no matter how delicious, can destroy your day; if you eat healthily most of the time you can indulge occasionally; a croissant is a confection of genius but it is essentially a very small, fluffy lachha parantha that's been rolled up; muesli, fruits and raw nuts are not just a fad; garlic is one of the healthiest things you can eat raw in the morning. Another realization also lands, perhaps only partly true, but I'll venture it anyway: you can mess with a person's eating habits for lunch and dinner far more easily than you can with their breakfast. Just as the first language you learn, your mother tongue, is said to be stored in a different part of the brain from all the subsequent languages you pick up, I suspect the construction and taste of one's basic breakfast is also stored in a special place. This is perhaps why I find myself craving a sada dosa or a plate of luchi-alu while looking at artisanal brioche being carved into twee little medallions."

Police said she largely restricted herself to the ground floor of their house in Shanti Marg in Mandawali.Swarnas son, Sumit, who worked at a fast food restaurant chain, was the sole income provider in the household with a monthly salary of 18,000. Other than Swarna, the family included Sumit, his wife Kanchan, and their three children, all of whom are under five years of age.According to Omvir Singh, DCP (east), Swarna and Kanchan frequently clashed over domestic issues. Kanchan had allegedly planned to kill her mother-in-law earlier as well, but was unable find an opportunity to execute the plan, the DCP added.The dispute late on Tuesday night had been triggered by the wails of Kanchans child when Sumit was not at home. Hearing the child cry on the upper floor, Swarna began abusing her daughter-in-law. A quarrel between them ensued during which Kanchan hit her mother-in-law on her head using a small wooden stool, said the DCP.As the victim collapsed outside her kitchen, Kanchan allegedly decided to set her mother-in-law ablaze. Kanchan assumed the fire would lead the police to think an outsider or a criminal committed the murder, police said.Investigators said that as the accused could not find kerosene or petrol in the house, she decided to use mustard oil to burn her mother-in-law. Police added that it will only be known after the autopsy report whether Swarna was still breathing at the time she was set ablaze.According to an investigator, Kanchan allegedly emptied an entire bottle of mustard oil on Swarnas body before lighting it on fire. But the oil only managed to burn the victims legs and some items in the room, the investigator added.Police said that Kanchan then panicked and rushed to her room upstairs. She then allegedly changed her clothes and waited for the murder to come to light. When her husband Sumit returned home from work sometime later, he found his mothers body and alerted the police.The investigators said they found the crime scene suspicious due to the strong odour of mustard oil. Suspecting the role of an insider, police began questioning Kanchan.Investigators said she initially tried to mislead them, but several inconsistencies in her statement eventually gave her away. After questioning, she finally confessed to having killed her mother-in-law.Police said they have recovered one of Kanchans gown soaked with blood and mustard oil, the small stool that was used to kill Swarna, and an empty jar of mustard oil.Kanchan, a homemaker and native of Ghaziabad, has been arrested and booked for the murder."

5a14a5f39855b76bf13e668d,A menu to suit your dosha,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-menu-to-suit-your-dosha/article19766643.ece,2017-09-28,"How do you eat food that matches your temperament and keeps you balanced in mind and body? Perhaps Ayurvedic meals are the answer. A culinary experience tailored to suit each guests dosha was curated by The Taj Mahal Hotel in Delhi recently. In Ayurvedic medicine, doshas are the three energies  Vata, Pitta and Kapha - believed to circulate in the body and govern physiological activity.Dr Ipsita Chatterjee, Ayurveda expert at Forest Essentials, supervised the Ayurvedic menu with the finalised dishes based on feedback provided by guests who were given a common questionnaire earlier.In Ayurveda, we believe in both external and internal beauty. So what you eat should be natural, fresh, organic and seasonal. You must have noticed that some people may not be exceptionally beautiful, but have a natural aura, charm and vivacity. This is because of their inner beauty, says Chatterjee. Whatever you eat reflects on your skin. And whatever you eat should be put on your skin.Another myth that the dinner dispelled was that Ayurveda has no place for non-vegetarian cuisine. According to Chatterjee, its a misconception that Ayurveda encourages only vegetarianism. In fact, Ayurveda also encourages eating of non-vegetarian food, says Chatterjee. Acharya Charaka in his book C haraka Sutra clearly mentions that alcohol in moderation ignites your digestive juices and relaxes your mind and body. It was written about 2,500 years ago but the text of this ancient book is relevant even now.Understanding doshasFor those with Vata dosha, the body constitution symbolises air and space. Meat meant for them needs to be cooked with plenty of butter and ghee, says Chatterjee. Vata dosha people are thin, have prominent jaw bones and can eat without putting on weight. They have dryness on their skin. They are creative, and intelligent people but can often be indecisive.Pitta, which represents fire, symbolises romanticism and commitment to work. People with Pitta dosha are born leaders. They have a regal way of life and are passionate and intense about what they do. They take pride in their work but life is never stable. Their temperament can both hurt and enlighten, says Chatterjee. To douse this fire, Pitta dosha people must consume cold foods, herbs, salads and ice cream. They must avoid garam masala and chillies. Mint, fennel, and coriander should be used liberally in their food. Rose white tea is recommended. Other coolants are white coriander or a bit of candied rose petal (gulkand) with chilled milk, she adds.But what if theres a craving for red meat? Warming red meat is contrary to Pitta. So use mint and fennel in your meat portions. You can enjoy your meat and the mint will act as a cooling agent, says Chatterjee. After meat, have a glass of rose milk. Chicken is a light variant but chillies and mustard are to be strictly avoided. Egg whites can be eaten in moderation.Kapha people are like water and earth. Generally they reflect lot of water attributes, says Chatterjee. These people are very loving and patient. They listen to people and are loyal friends. Its difficult to break into their inner circle.Taste testI got to taste a customised menu that was less on flavours but high on keeping me cool. Aubergine Quinoa and Tofu Salad with mint dressing, steamed fish with mint and coriander and Gulab Phirni, kept me relaxed and in a happy state of mind. Even though I felt like tasting the Irani chicken with saffron rice that was being served with vata dosha, I was advised not to deviate from the menu. Apart from chicken, guests with the vata constitution, enjoyed including fresh pea soup with pumpkin seed pesto and Andhra sauted sweet potatoes.For the steady, cautious and stable Kapha personalities, the menu focused on fresh vegetables, fruits and legumes consisting of dishes like Chickpea and Pink Lentil Ragout, Buckwheat Pancakes, fish steamed with star anise and ginger and Spiced Apple and Walnut Phirni to complete the meal.In Ayurveda, we believe in both external and internal beauty. So what you eat should be natural, fresh, organic and seasonal"

Kapoor set her legs on fire thinking that the flames would eventually engulf the entire body. Following that, Kapoor locked herself on the second floor of the five-storey building.Police claimed Kapoor has admitted to them that her 10-month-old daughters wailing irked Swarna, and that they had been fighting over the issue. The confrontation eventually snowballed into the murder, police claimed.The main gate of the building, and the main door of the house, were left ajar. When I peered through the door, I found Swarnas legs were on fire. I started shouting for help, calling people in the locality, Jyoti, an eyewitness, told The Indian Express.Within seconds, at least 15 people gathered at the spot, some with damp clothes, and doused the fire, the eyewitness said, adding, Kapoor also came out of her house and expressed shock at the incident.Swarnas son, Sumit, who works at a fast-food restaurant, was at on duty at the time of the incident. His relatives from Loni, Ghaziabad and Noida were informed, and they reached the spot by 1.30 am, police said.Swarna had been living on the ground floor of the house for the past two decades. Her son, his wife and three children live on the second floor, while the rest of the floors have been rented out.

The woman set the body on fire to make the crime look like the work of an outsider.DCP (east) Omvir Singh Bishnoi said the accused, identified as Kanchan Kapoor , was arrested within eight hours of the murder of Swarna Kapoor (62) being reported to the police. She has been charged under IPC Section 302 (murder).Police officials said they received a call from the victim's son, Sumit Kapoor, who said his mother has been murdered in their house. When police reached the spot, they found the victim's half-burnt body on the ground floor. Investigations revealed the daughter-in-law had been on the first floor of the house at the time of the murder and she was subsequently questioned. Kanchan initially told police she had last seen the victim at around 10:30 pm, after which she had gone to her room upstairs to take care of her three children. However, on sustained interrogation, the accused confessed her crime, police said.Kanchan told the police she had a troubled relationship with her mother-in-law and alleged that the victim, and Sumit, had not been giving her money for basic amenities. The accused and the victim would frequently fight over money. The only source of income was the accused's husband, who works at a fast food joint.On Tuesday night, Kanchan, trying to pacify her crying five-year-old child in her room on the first floor, slapped him in anger. On learning of that, the victim, who walks with the help of a walker, shouted at her. The two got into a heated exchange during which the victim verbally abused her daughter-in-law, police said.The accused wrested the walker from her mother-in-law and struck her with it on the forehead, knocking her unconscious, police said, adding they had recovered the walker. The accused then thought of making the incident look like a burglary gone horribly wrong. She poured mustard oil over her unconscious mother-in-law and set her on fire, police said.After the incident, the accused went to her room and changed her blood- and oil-stained clothes. When her husband returned from work two hours later, she feigned ignorance.Neighbours said there were frequent fights between the victim and the accused and police had been called on previous occasions. Kanchan had been married to Sumit for more than eight years."

As it is very fine, it can settle in the lungs and worsen asthma and other respiratory problems.Auto exhaust pollutants that include sulphur dioxide (SO2 ), nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), diesel and sulphate particulates, hydrocarbons, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), and volatile organic compounds such as benzene in the air can cause heart diseases. In the past two decades, the numbers of patients in the city are increasing mainly because of poor air quality, said BK Rajora, chief medical officer, Civil Hospital, Gurgaon.Doctors were of the opinion that air pollution clubbed with lifestyle disorders are the reason that more young people are complaining of heart issues.Dr. DK Jhamb, director & HOD,cCardiology, Paras Hospitals Gurgaon, said, I have been attending to 40 to 50 heart patients on a daily basis. It has been observed that air pollution is significantly worsening cardiovascular health as has been reported in recent studies. Particulate matter and nitrogen oxides have long-term adverse effects on your heart. Along with other lifestyle factors, pollution is now believed to be playing a significant role in causing heart diseases.While pollution extends its fangs to the heart directly, factors such as obesity, blood sugar levels, lack of physical activity and hypertension continue to put the human heart at risk.Long commuting time, in addition to stressful sedentary working hours, are leaving people with less time for rest and healthy activities. Inactive lifestyle increases the incidence of developing obesity, high blood pressure, cholesterol, type 2 diabetes, stress levels and all these cause various heart diseases. They increase the chances of getting a heart attack, said Dr Sanjat Chiwane, heart specialist, interventional cardiologist, Columbia Asia Hospital, Gurgaon.Doctors advised people to have an active lifestyle with plenty of exercise and fresh air, followed by healthy dietary habits, which includes avoiding food with high fat, sugar and salt content. They have also advised increasing intake of vegetables, fruits and fibre in the daily diet.Lifestyle modifications such as regular blood pressure monitoring, maintaining cholesterol levels, diabetes, non-smoking, weight management and regular exercises can contribute to a healthy heart, Dr Sanjeev Chaudhary, director cardiology, Fortis Memorial Research Institute, said.Steps to be taken for healthy heart 30 minutes of activity a day can help prevent heart attacks and stroke Strength and stretching exercises are best for overall stamina and flexibility Reducing stress  do meditation/yoga If one stops smoking, the risk for coronary heart disease is reduced by half Learn how to swap unhealthy food with healthier alternatives Keeping a healthy weight and limiting your salt intake to control blood pressure Make sure that your blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose levels are checked regularly and maintained within the normal range Increase intake of food such as green vegetables, fruits, grain/cereals, polyunsaturated oils such as mustard, olive, fish/seafood, blueberries, legumes, flax seeds and green tea."

5a155b8c9855b76bf13ed94f,Eating Bengal,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1171001/jsp/opinion/story_175573.jsp,2017-10-01,"For the non-Bengali like me, Puja tourism is about food. In the early Nineties, when I first began visiting pandals in Chittaranjan Park, I was baffled by the non-doing nature of the main enclosure that hosted the pratima. We seemed always to get there before or after the aarti so to the uninitiated outsider, the setting felt like a prelude to something that never happened. The first time the pandal and the pratima made sense to me as performance was years later while watching the film, Parineeta, when I saw a particularly energetic version of the dhunuchi dance. Except that the principal dancer was Sanjay Dutt and while I'm used to suspending disbelief at the pictures, it was hard to take in Munna Bhai in this new bhadralok avatar without giggling. I think one of the reasons people inspect the pratima so closely is that for the most part, there's so little else to do. I used to pay particular attention to the slain (or in the process of being slain) Mahishasura for the same reason that people watch action movies: for the gore. The first year that I toured the pandals, the Mahishasuras were small, pitiable figures, notable mainly for the bloody wound that Durga's trident had made, but I later encountered large, heavily muscled versions. What they had in common was a haplessness that was oddly moving. Durga herself seemed oblivious to the asura she had killed, as she looked into the middle distance, remotely smiling. It was her lion that seemed properly involved in the slaughter, his bloodied teeth and claws dug into Mahishasura's body which was often a bilious green and who can blame him? The saddest figure in the composition was the discarded buffalo, supine and hollowed out at the base of the tableau, like a filmi extra. My disenchantment with the tableaux had something to do with the fact that the first one I saw had Durga as a dead ringer for Hema Malini. The prig in me was offended: I had come looking for Bengali iconography and had found a still from a Bombay mythological instead. Looking back, though, I can see the point of the likeness: if the artist had been looking to model beatific blandness, he couldn't have done better. It was in the food stalls that I found consolation, in the deep fried, keema-stuffed porotas made out of maida. As someone born and raised in Delhi on first-rate Punjabi parathas, after that first taste of the Bengali version, I couldn't understand why north Indians bothered with aata when maida's elastic chewiness was self-evidently better. The same principle holds for pooris; why not, in a frank, manly way acknowledge superiority and eat luchis instead? The first time I encountered festive Bengali food was in 1983 when I travelled up to Calcutta for a friend's wedding. We stayed with the groom in his parents' house for several days and on the first day we settled down to eat lunch at a very long table flanked by benches. It was a catered meal and I still remember the name of the caterer: Bijoli Grill. We were served rice and dal and mashed potatoes which, in retrospect, I recognize as alu makha but at the time I thought was a kind of alu bharta. The dal was excellent and the sharpness of the mustard oil mixed into the potatoes was a new and adventurous taste. As someone who had been raised a vegetarian before going over to the dark side, I understood dal, chawal and alu and I made a meal of it. I was a little surprised at the plainness of the food, but it was barely noon so I decided it was meant to be a kind of brunch and there were after all, dozens of people to be fed. After stuffing myself, I made to get up and leave. This was awkward because I was sitting on a running bench so the thin young man to my right had to get up as well to make space for me to lever my legs out from under the table. I was midway through this manoeuvre when Mrs Sarkar, Abhijit's mother, materialized in front of me looking concerned. ""Where are you going?"" she asked. ""Is there something wrong with the food?"" I said it was wonderful but I had eaten enough. ""Enough?"" she repeated, baffled. ""But we have just begun!"" I had never eaten a desi meal in courses before. Where I came from you ate your staple - dal, roti, paratha - surrounded by the sabzis and chutneys and raitas and pickles that constituted the meal. An amused Hyderabadi friend once described this to me as 'your katori culture'. So when I was nudged back into my place on the bench, I realized that the wedding guest in Bengal needed to be a long-distance runner. After that initial course, we ate two kinds of fish, rui and ilish. This was followed by a mutton curry which I know now was kosha mangsho. All of this was accompanied by several servings of rice. After we had done with the meat, we moved on to chatni, a tomato chutney mined with dates, raisins and other sweetness that I wasn't sure I liked till I combined it with rice and then it was magical. I was feeling faintly sick by then because I had never eaten so much before and I hadn't paced myself. This was around the time that I began to attend to the thin young man to my right. He was extraordinarily thin, in that hipless, hollow-cheeked way that's special to India. He was virtually two-dimensional. And yet, he made his way through the rui, ilish and mangsho like a human tapeworm, helping himself more than once to each sort of fish and then the mutton and now he was doing a steady free-style through the chatni, never pausing to breathe or burp. We finished with three kinds of mishti; I use 'we' loosely, because I had fallen by the wayside by then. My participation was vicarious; I just watched my neighbour do the treble with ease, this Abebe Bikila of the six-course meal. We ate like this every day, twice a day, for three days. But this, I was assured, was nothing; the pice de rsistance according to the gourmands who surrounded me, was yet to come. These were the king prawns that would be served at the bou bhaat, the reception dinner the day after the wedding. I never got that far; I only ever heard Abhijit's king prawns described because by the evening of the wedding reception, I was a broken man, running a shuttle service to the nearest loo, my digestion destroyed by a regimen of gluttony that asked for more endurance than my north Indian constitution could supply. There is a reason why Abhijit, like many Bengali men, always carries a little pink bottle of Gelusil or its alternative, the orange Aqua Ptychotis. No culture can eat like this without chronic heartburn. But eating was never the same again after that 1983 wedding. I learnt to eat my way through fish heads as they squinted at me, to tease hair-thin bones out of ilish, to lay by enough room for the sweet at the end. When my niece declared the other day that she was going pandal-hopping with friends, I told her to skip the pratimas and home in on the porotas. She was kind enough to report that I was right. It's a simple truth that I learnt three-and-a-half decades ago: Bengali culture is basically food."

Workers said the municipal corporation (MC) had promised to provide them vaccination facilities , but nothing has happened so far for the past more than six months.Harish, a sanitation worker in Sector 46, said ""We work in such pathetic conditions that it is difficult to ascertain what will cause us harm. We too deserve a humanitarian treatment. Most of the workers do not have masks and gloves, while the ones distributed earlier have worn out with time.""Sanitation workers have not been getting even soaps and mustard oil needed to maintain cleanliness and prevent infections. Jai Kishan Dhule, president, Door-to-door Garbage Collection Society, said, ""The workers have been spending money from their own pocket to buy soaps and mustard oil. Both these items are part of the mandatory kit for workers as they are prone to catch infections.""The municipal corporation (MC) also has a provision to provide jaggery to the sanitation staff, which has not been distributed on a regular basis. Officials claimed the kit will soon be provided to all workers. According to standards of safety, workers should be wearing uniforms, rubber gloves and masks while performing their duties.Contrary to norms, the workers are seen performing duty without safety gear. Ajay, a sanitation worker on contract in Sector 21, said, ""During the course of our work, we learn to avoid the smell, but at times the pungent smell is just unbearable. People lock their garages and other closures, where garbage rots for days and months. At the end we are supposed to clean it with bare hands and without masks."" ""I get more than 10 calls every day from sanitation workers, who tell me about their illness. Many have cough, high fever and respiratory problems as well. I remember a worker named Sonu in Sector 37, who died after a used syringe pricked his leg,"" said Jai Kishan, who has been fightinh for issues concerning sanitation workers in the city.The sanitation staff is also exposed to biomedical waste, including clothes of patients suffering with chronic diseases. In the absence of any regular medical check up camps diseases among the workers is not identified.

With Rs 100 price hike every day, farmers are earning Rs 65,000-Rs 70,000 per acre, said Rajesh Kamboj, a farmer from Radaur in Yamunanagar district.Raj Kumar, a farmer from Ladwa of the district, said, We have Pusa 1509 variety and the prices are good this year. This will help us pay the debts as we did not see any hike in the prices of paddy since 2013.The traders and commission agents feel the prices may rise further due to a competition among the buyers and rice millers.As the prices of basmati varieties generally depend on the demand outside the country, it is for the first time since 2103 the prices have crossed the Rs 3,000 per quintal mark in the beginning of the procurement season. It may even rise further and the lateral variety of desi basmati (Taraori) may cross the Rs 4,000 per quintal mark, said Sohan Lal of Shri Ram Trading Company in Kurukshetra.The traders and commission agents feel the prices may rise further due to a competition among the buyers and rice millers.Even as several high-yielding paddy varieties are sown in the region, the farmers says that Pusa 1509 is considered the best because it is the only basmati variety which takes 90 days to mature, a month less than the other long-grained varieties. In this case, the farmers get an extra month to sow other crops like mustard and winter vegetables.What caused price riseSome people claimed that the basmati prices have increased following a demand in the Gulf countries such as Saudi Arabia and the European Union.Rice exporters, however, are of the opinion that the prices have jumped after a tax exemption on paddy and rice following implementation of the Goods and Service Tax (GST).Talking to HT, former president and governing body member of all India Rice Exporters Association Vijay Setia said there is no additional demand this time and it is the 5 per cent tax exemption before the GST that caused the rise. New traders had invested in the rice industry when demonetisation took place and they will make profit in the next few months, he said.But the increase in prices is not stable and nobody can predict what will be price of the basmati next year. The overall acreage under Basmati has dipped by 10 per cent in Haryana, he said.Haryanas share in basmati exportAs per the All India Rice Exporters Association, Haryana and Punjab each have 40 per cent share in the total 40 lakh metric tonnes (MT) of basmati export from the country. Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar and Panipat districts make a significant contribution to the states 16 lakh MT basmati production."

5a14c07a9855b76bf13e77ee,Mapping the not-so-normal monsoon,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/mapping-the-not-so-normal-monsoon/article19825298.ece,2017-10-09,"If youre statistically inclined, you may be celebrating the fact that the south-west monsoon for 2017, which is now bowing out, has turned out to be normal for the second consecutive year. But farmers know that there can be many shades of grey to an officially normal monsoon.Another bumper year?India has received a total 841.3 millimetres (mm) of rain in the south-west monsoon season from June 1 to September 30 this year.IMD deems the season normal if the all-India quantum of rain falls within a 10% range of its long-period average of 887.5 mm. The 2017 monsoon fell short of the number only by 5%. In fact, the cumulative rainfall numbers this year arent very different from 2016 when the country recorded 862 mm of rain. This may seem like good news. In 2016-17, India harvested a record crop of cereals (252.7 million tonnes) and managed a quantum jump in its output of both pulses (16.3 million tonnes in 2015 to 22.9 million tonnes in 2016) and oilseeds (25 to 32 million tonnes). This contributed to a significant bump-up in the agriculture leg of the GDP which grew 4.9% in FY17 compared with 0.7% in FY16.But expecting an encore of that impressive performance just because this years monsoon has turned out normal, would be unrealistic. More than the quantum of rainfall that is dumped on the sub-continent during the four critical months, it is the spatial and temporal distribution of rains that make or break crop prospects. On this score, the 2017 monsoon has been quite whimsical.Patchy distributionFor the purposes of measuring the spatial spread of rainfall, the IMD categorises India into 36 meteorological sub-divisions.IMDs wrap-up of the recent monsoon season tells us that in the just-concluded monsoon season, 5 of Indias 36 sub-divisions received excess rains, 25 received normal rains and 6 witnessed deficient rains. Last year, 4 sub-divisions were showered with excess rains, 23 were normal and 9 were deficient.But the devil really lies in the details and the identity of the States that suffered deficient rains really matter to crop prospects. This years monsoon has played truant in some key food-bowl States. For instance, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Punjab account for a lions share of kharif rice production. But this years monsoon has been 29% below normal in Uttar Pradesh and 22% short of normal in Punjab. West Bengal alone has enjoyed a near-normal season, as has much of the southern peninsula. Madhya Pradesh, which is a critical growing region for the rabi wheat crop, has seen a deficiency of 20%.Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra are similarly critical for pulses output. Of these, while Rajasthan has received excess rains (8% above normal) and Maharashtra has been just about normal, rains playing truant in Madhya Pradesh look set to impact pulses output.While excess rains in Gujarat (19% above normal) could augur well for the groundnut and cotton crops, the patchy show in both Madhya Pradesh and Haryana (26% below normal) cloud the prospects for oilseeds such as soyabean, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower. There have also been wide variations between growing regions within each state, which can have a bearing on crop prospects.Weak endingMonth-wise rainfall patterns during the south-west monsoon also play a big role in deciding cropping area and yield. In 2016, the monsoon got off to a snail-paced start, but picked up pace in the latter half of the season.But this years monsoon has behaved in exactly the opposite fashion. After excess rains of about 4% and 2% against normal seasonal patterns in June and July, the months of August and September have seen all-India rainfall fall 12-13% short of normal levels. Good rains in the months of June and July may have contributed to good sowing and coverage of the kharif crops. But deficit rains in August and September could impact the eventual output by pruning crop yields.It is also important to note that rainfall in the last two months of the south-west monsoon dictate reservoir storage and soil moisture, both of which set the tone for the planting of the winter crops. Though there is much tracking and analysis of Indias south-west monsoon and the kharif crop, the rabi season has been equally important to the countrys agricultural prospects in recent years. Rabi output often matches or even exceeds the kharif output.The rabi season accounts for the whole of Indias wheat and gram harvest, a fourth of the output for coarse cereals and chips in with over a third of the yearly harvest of urad and moong. Oilseeds such as rapeseed and mustard, sunflower and safflower are also predominantly winter crops. Therefore, dry spells in the latter half of this monsoon, taken with deficient rains in key rabi growing regions, can make for less than rosy rabi prospects.All this could explain why the agriculture ministry, in its First Advance Estimates, has painted a somewhat muted picture of crop prospects for FY18. The estimates are based mainly on cropping and sowing patterns and a lot can change on yields and output, as the year progresses. But so far, it appears as if India will have a hard time living up to the 4.9% expansion in agriculture GVA that it so comfortably managed last year."

He said they were facing serious problems because of this.Chandan Mahanta, another villager from the Dhopabor Chapori, told The Telegraph, ""We have been spending sleepless nights for the past 15 days. The elephants suddenly come and destroy all the crops, including the seasonal rabi crops. The elephants also stray into mustard fields or roam around in nearby areas or on the banks of the Brahmaputra, he added.Yesterday, the wild herd strayed into Buroi tea garden near National Highway 15 under Helem revenue circle. The animals were pushed back by local people and forest officials.Divisional forest officer (East Sonitpur division) Rajen Choudhury said the man-elephant conflict is a perennial problem in the region but forest officials manage to push them back but sometimes it takes time.The forest team is constantly monitoring the herd's movement but this group is larger compared to others."

The residents wait for the authorities to clean it, which has even covered the footpaths.President of neighborhood welfare association Phase II Atul Sharma had filed a case before the PUS and wanted direction to be passed to MMC and the GMADA, deputy Commissioner and the district health officer of the district mentioning that growth of congress grass is growing rapidly in the city and has even extended to the vacant plots and road sides.Following the directions passed by Lok Adalat, MMC and GMADA were directed to remove the congress grass within a period of two months as per their jurisdiction. According to majority residents, the MMC remove the grass after the monsoon. However, the two authorities were ordered to clean the congress grass on a regular basis.Though there have been drives in the past to remove the wild growth, which also includes the congress grass, but it has spread all over the city again. From isolated plots, parks to road sides, most areas of Mohali are covered with congress grass.Rajinder Chaudhary, a resident of Phase III said, ""The congress grass and other wild growth is something that should be trimmed from time to time. The owners of the vacant plots must take the responsibility to keep it free from congress grass and other litters"".A fine of Rs 250 was also fixed for a month in case if a private land is found having rapid growth of congress grass on it.Another resident Vipin Kumar of Phase V said, ""Apart from causing allergy, the wild growth and congress grass is also an eyesore. The wild growth is prone to become a garbage dump, and other mess also gets collected"".Notification alertIn the notification issued by the former chief minister and former chairman of GMADA Parkash Singh Badal in 2012-13, it was mandatory for the land owner to chop off weed to prevent its spread andreappearance. Notice remained in force until December 31, 2015.Harmful effects of congress grassYou might suffer from allergy if you come in direct or indirect contact with the congress grass.Symptoms- Itching and blisters on eyelids, neck, face, elbow, back and knees- Sneezing and coughing- Chest tightening- Fatigue- Fever- Nasal dischargeTreatment of allergy- Moving the individual to a weed-free area can be a temporary cure- Doctors consider this as a very general allergy and treat patientswith nasal sprays and corticosteroids instead of curing the allergyitself- Applying mustard oil to the affected area helps"

Syrian President Bashar Assad has denied using chemical weapons.US Ambassador Nikki Haley said Wednesday there is overwhelming support among Security Council members to extend the JIM mandate but she said Russia wants to see if the JIM blames Syria for the Khan Sheikhoun attack, in which case it will have no faith in the investigative body.If the report doesnt blame the Syrians then they say that they will renew the JIMs mandate, she said.We cant work like that, Haley said. We need to prove that it was actually a chemical, and then we need to look at who did it. We cant go and pick and choose who we want to be at fault, who we dont.The JIM is a joint investigative body of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and the United Nations.It determined last year that the Syrian government was behind at least three attacks involving chlorine gas, and the Islamic State group was responsible for at least one involving mustard gas.A fact-finding mission by the OPCW reported on June 30 that sarin nerve gas was used in the Khan Sheikhoun attack. But it is up to the JIM to determine responsibility.Russia has accused the United States and its Western allies of rushing to judgment and blaming the Syrian government for sarin use in Khan Sheikhoun.It has also criticised the June 30 report by the OPCW fact-finding mission as very biased.UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in late August that the OPCW fact-finding mission was looking at more than 60 alleged incidents of the use of chemical weapons in Syria between December 2015 and the end of March 2016. He said it would focus its future work on credible allegations.Edmund Mulet, the head of the JIM, appealed to governments in July to stop exerting political pressure on his teams investigators."

MukeshWomen working in a paddy field at Nagri in RanchiRanchi: The current spell of moderate to medium rains, triggered by a depression over coastal Odisha, has made conditions favourable for the sowing of rabi and vegetables but may prove detrimental to standing paddy crops that will be ready for harvest in two weeks, experts maintain.Paddy is harvested on around 17.7 lakh hectares in Jharkhand.According to A. Wadud, head of Birsa Agricultural University's (BAU) agro-meteorological division, the rains will hamper the yield of standing paddy crops and pose unwanted problems for farmers gearing up for harvest.""Ideally, the paddy crop should have been harvested by now, but in Jharkhand it was sowed late this time. Though the monsoon reached on time on June 15, it turned weak and only improved from second week of July. Now, there are many standing crops, which will mature in another 15 days but rains threat to damage some,"" Wadud said. He said late harvest of paddy would mean that sowing of rabi crops would also get delayed.However, D.N. Singh, director of the varsity's research wing, said, ""The damage will be limited to a maximum of 5 per cent of total area under cultivation going by the current trend.""Additional director of BAU's research wing Sushil Prasad too conceded that there would be minimum damage.""Only those crops that aren't mature yet run the risk of getting destroyed. Those that are awaiting harvest in another fortnight can pass this rain test,"" he said.Experts said it was the right time for sowing rabi and vegetables because there was sufficient moisture in soil.""It's the right time to prepare the ground and take up rabi and vegetable cultivation. Crops such as peas, pulses, mustard and oilseeds can be sowed now as conditions are ideal,"" Singh said, adding that the sky was expected to clear up in the next two days."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Before Mahyco Monsanto Biotech could be granted permission for HT cotton, some unscrupulous elements pirated this cotton variety, probably from countries like the US and Australia. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed his desire to make India a hub of innovations at several fora, be it in his address to young CEOs or in his speech during his recent visit to Israel. In his words: Innovation is life. When there is no innovation, there is stagnation. In his budget speech in 2015, the finance minister announced the setting up of the Atal Innovation Mission. But the progress in this respect has been tardy.This is not the first time that India has aspired to be an innovation hub. The importance of innovation was also recognised by the UPA government, which constituted the National Innovation Council (NIC) in 2010 under Sam Pitroda, then adviser to the prime minister on innovations. The NICs key mandate was to draw a roadmap for innovations between 2010 and 2020. The council submitted three annual reports to the government, the last of which was in 2013. Sectoral innovation councils were set up in 25 major departments of the Union government, including in the ministry of agriculture. State Innovation Councils were also set up. The idea behind the setting up of these councils was to mainstream the idea of innovation in the functioning of the Union and state governments. However, it soon became evident that despite the governments best intentions, there were hardly any innovative ideas which could be scaled up to the national level. This shows that government organisations are not ideally suited to devise game-changing innovations as they are mired in routine work. The work of the councils proves that innovations are designed in a supporting environment, irrespective of the size or nature of an organisation. The most important support that the government can provide is to protect the innovation itself.The first lesson, therefore, for the NDA government would be to create an enabling environment to safeguard the intellectual property of individuals, private and public companies that develop new products and ideas using their own investments. India is placed 60th among 127 countries according to the Global Innovation Index of 2017  an index prepared by Cornell University, INSEAD and the World Intellectual Property Organisation. Switzerland tops the list followed by Sweden, the Netherlands, the US and UK. Singapore is ranked seventh, Japan is at the 14th position, Israel is ranked 17th, and China 22nd.In the Forbes list of the 10 most innovative companies in the world, six come from the US. Interestingly, in a recently released International intellectual property (IP) index that studied 45 countries, India ranked a poor 43rd. It is this poor record on IP protection that is holding India back from being a leading nation when it comes to innovations.In this article we focus on innovations in agriculture as the challenge to feed 1.3 billion people cannot be met without innovations along the agri-value chains. Take the case of herbicide tolerant (HT) Bt cotton. It is now widely known that one of the biggest innovations in Indian agriculture in the past 15 years was the introduction of Bt cotton in 2002. The innovation owed much to a policy decision of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, which made India one of the top producers of cotton and the second largest exporter of the crop. Mahyco Monsanto Biotech, which released Bt cotton through its 40 or so odd licencees, wanted to release HT Bt cotton as well and applied to the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee (GEAC). HT cotton is an innovation on Bt cotton, as it takes care of the problem of weeds at a cost much lower than that incurred by farmers in employing labour to take out weeds.But before Mahyco Monsanto Biotech could be granted permission for HT cotton, some unscrupulous elements pirated this cotton variety, probably from countries like the US and Australia, where HT cotton had already been released. These pirated seeds were multiplied in the country and this kharif season, several companies have sold an estimated 35 to 45 lakh packets of HT Bt cotton seeds. About 7 per cent to 10 per cent of the area under cotton in the country is now under this counterfeit crop. In view of the blatant violation of its IPR, Mahyco Monsanto Biotech withdrew its application in 2016. Interestingly, the company had alerted the GEAC, the ministries concerned and the states way back in 2008 about such illegal activities. Mahyco Monsanto Biotech had even provided details of plots where such activities were taking place. But the government of the day did not take action to stop these activities. The scale of pirating has become so large that it poses a major challenge to the current government.It is, of course, noteworthy to see farmers appetite to acquire better technologies and even pay premium prices ranging from Rs 1,100-1,500 per packet  despite the price cap of Rs 800 per packet for Bt cotton. But such illegal sales of HT cotton seeds indicate an organised racket by a few companies that seem to be making a mockery of the regulatory system comprising the GEAC and the Ministry of Environment and Forests.How can India aspire to be an innovation hub, if such clandestine activities flourish and innovators suffer? Only stern and exemplary action by the prime minister can restore the credibility of Indias regulatory institutions and put innovations on a safe and reliable path. Also, regulatory bodies need to clear applications for innovative products (like GM mustard or Bt brinjal) quickly, lest they are introduced by pirates surreptitiously. Without such action, making India an innovation hub will remain a pipe dream for decades  pirates can never be innovators.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The crop will be marketed from next year April onwards.""MSP for main winter crop  wheat has been increased by 6.8 per cent year-on-year after rising 6.6 per cent in 2016-17,"" the report said adding for pulses, where lower market prices led to a reduction in area sown for summer (kharif) pulses, the hike is in the 5-10 per cent range."

He was my inspiration. After my stint at Taj, I have worked for cruise lines for 10 years. I came back to Bengaluru and joined The Pride Hotel as a Kitchen Executive, where I got the opportunity to work with Chef Jason, my mentor. Chef Jason later moved to Clarks Exotica and recommended me to join the newly launched resort  Clarks Exotica Convention Resort and Spa back in 2011. I thus began my journey here as a Sous Chef.Being a chef is not as glamourous as it seems on television. We work under constant pressure to deliver the food fast without sacrificing on the quality, standing on our feet for long hours and suffering cuts and burns, noise, heat, smokes and fumes. We work in the evenings and on weekends and holidays.On the other hand, being a chef has many advantages. You will never be bored, as there is always something going on in the kitchen. You will always be trying to outdo yourself and cook the most memorable meal possible for each of your patrons. The good comments from your customers, job satisfaction, companionship, teamwork, applying creativity to what you do and a mind open to lifelong learning and prospects of advancement are the right ingredients to become a chef.I specialise in Continental and Fusion cuisines. I like to experiment with various global cuisines and try to serve something new to the guests. While experimenting, I came across many unique ingredients, one that fascinated me a lot is water chestnut. Water Chestnut commonly known as Paniphal or Singhara in Hindi is a vegetable that is native to China.I have experimented and created different dishes with water chestnut such as salads, stir fry recipes and even dessert. Personally, my favorite dessert is Red Ruby. Red Ruby is a dessert served with coconut milk. It is made with wasabi, a Japanese sauce made out of cabbage and mustard that makes food more flavourful and spicy and water chestnuts which is white in colour and gives a fresh mild and crunchy texture.Immerse the water chestnuts in freshly made beetroot juice for a few minutes so that it is bright red in colour and then coat it with the wasabi paste. Soak it in sugar syrup so that it gives a flavour of both spice and sweet. Freeze it after adding coconut milk for 30 minutes and serve it cold.

(AP Photo/File) Turkish authorities carry a victim of alleged chemical weapons attacks in Syrian city of Idlib, at a local hospital in Reyhanli, Hatay, Turkey. (AP Photo/File)The Syrian government of Bashar al-Assad is to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people last April, according to a report sent to the United Nations Security Council on Thursday. The Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April 2017, the report from the UN and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) said.The attack prompted a US missile strike against a Syrian air base which Washington said was used to launch the strike.Time and again, we see independent confirmation of chemical weapons use by the Assad regime, Nikki Haley, the United States UN ambassador, said in a statement.The Security Council must send a clear message that the use of chemical weapons by anyone will not be tolerated, and must fully support the work of the impartial investigators.The report also said ISIS was to blame for the use of sulfur mustard in the Syrian town of Umm Hawsh on Sept. 15 and 16, 2016.The JIM was unanimously created by the 15-member U.N. Security Council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year. Its mandate is due to expire in mid-November, and Russia on Tuesday vetoed a proposal to further extend its mandate.Russian ambassador to the UN Vassily Nebenzia said earlier this week Russia would consider revisiting the mandate extension after Thursdays report is discussed.The continuing use of chemical weapons, including by non-State actors, is deeply disturbing, said the report.If such use, in spite of the prohibition by the international community, is not stopped now, a lack of consequences will surely encourage others to follow.The JIM has already found Syrian government forces were responsible for three chlorine gas attacks in 2014 and 2015.Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States. The Syrian government has repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the countrys more than six-year civil war.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

After the recent low-pressure induced rains, farmers were worried about crop damage. Sources said this kharif season, the sub-division has covered 17,827 hectares (ha) under non-paddy crops, while rest 49,553 ha have been covered under paddy and cereal crops, including raagi, maize, jowar and small millets.Bonai District Agriculture Officer (DAO) P H Kerketta said despite weak and erratic monsoon, both paddy and non-paddy crops in Bonai, Lahunipara, Gurundia and Koida blocks are in good shape. Usually non-paddy crops require less soil moisture and sowing is done late. Similarly, pulses like moong, arhar, biri and cow-pea cultivated in different phases are in flowering, fruiting to harvesting stages, while oil seeds crops, including sesame, are in flowering to fruiting stage and groundnut crops sown early have reached harvesting stage, he added.Kerketta said about 15-20 per cent of paddy crops cultivated early on upland have been harvested, while harvesting of standing paddy crops on medium land would start shortly and on low-land, it would continue till December end. He said due to water-logging following recent low-pressure induced rainfall, negligible portion of ready to harvest paddy crops with no dormancy genetic feature had developed sprouting. But, overall crop condition is very good in the sub-division, he said.Meanwhile, in the transition time to rabi crop season, farmers, after harvesting paddy crops, have readied to sow non-paddy crops on the same farm fields to utilise the residual soil moisture. Sowing of mustard, field-pea and red grams for rabi season would continue till middle of November as after that residual soil moisture may be lost, he added. The agriculture officer, however, informed that cultivation areas for rabi season has not been finalised as different irrigation authorities are yet to prepare programmes.Similarly, vegetable crops cultivated in different phases of the kharif season have also shown good yields."
5a525a6c9855b770e0376077,Formula to determine import duty on agricultural products soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/formula-to-determine-import-duty-on-agricultural-products-soon/articleshow/61428812.cms,2017-11-02,"NEW DELHI: The government will soon come out with a formula to increase or decrease import duty on agriculture commodities and to allow export or restrict it by fixing a benchmark price.If wholesale market price goes below that, import will be restricted by hiking the duty and export will be allowed. Similarly, if the wholesale price goes above the benchmark price then export will be restricted and more import will be allowed by lowering duty, along with fixing stock limits for traders to check hoarding.The decision for finalising the formula was taken at a meeting of an informal group of ministers headed by Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday, which was attended by agriculture minister Radhamohan Singh , consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan and top officials from Prime Minister's Office and finance ministry. The departments concerned will prepare the formula, said officials who attended the meeting.An official said the group agreed that the benchmark price would be 20% more or lower than minimum support price ( MSP ) for any agricultural commodity. Any breach of this by wholesale price will call for intervention by the government in terms of import or export restriction.MSP, which is assured by government to farmers, is fixed every year for 24 commodities and main items are rice, wheat, pulses and oilseeds. Data presented before the panel on oil seed prices showed how the prevailing market prices of ground nut, soyabean, sunflower and mustard have been below MSP. But, there has been substantial increase in import of crude palm (15%), refined palm (23%) and crude sunflower (58%) in January-July, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. Similarly, import of soyabean seed has increased by 64% in the same period.""In such case, import duty should be increased to protect domestic farmers. It's no different in case of arhar and masur dal where market prices have crashed below MSP and import of peas, chana and masur have gone up,"" said an official. Sources said representatives of PMO suggested to officials of other ministries that they need to balance the interest of consumers and farmers as well, while making policies."

It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.More than a fifth of Indias agricultural output by value today comes from milk. In 2014-15  the latest year for which detailed estimates at individual crop level is available  the value of milk production, at Rs 495,840.52 crore, for the first time, exceeded even the Rs 486,845.87 crore for foodgrains that includes all cereals and pulses.The accompanying table shows that in many states  virtually the entire northern belt covering Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu & Kashmir, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, plus Gujarat  milk accounts for over, or just under, a quarter of the value of their total output from farming and allied sectors. It puts paid to assumptions by policymakers and even academic scholars, who have for long viewed livestock farming as a subsidiary activity to regular crop agriculture.The subsidiary treatment to dairying may have some justification at an individual farmer level. Income from milk could well be lower than from their main crop for most farmers. However, even this might, in many cases, be obscured by the fact that milk marketing happens round-the-year, as opposed to the more visible money generated from the one-time sale of paddy, wheat, sugarcane or cotton. Bulk income from the so-called main crop may help marry ones daughter or build a new house, but the cash from milk sales is what is squirrelled away by the homemaker to meet the familys day-to-day expenses. It shouldnt surprise if the money from sale of milk in litres, at the end of the year, adds up to more than that from the quintals of paddy or sugarcane.Also, while a sugarcane grower may not cultivate cotton, just as mustard or chana farmers are unlikely to plant paddy, virtually all of them produce some quantity of milk. If every farmer is, by implication, a dairy farmer  a rising share of the milk that the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (Amul) procures is now being supplied those having 30 or more animals, fed on fodder grown in-house(see The Big Picture: A new churning )  it makes all the more sense to discard the traditional subsidiary view of dairying.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The ubiquitous French fries, made a household name by McDonalds, were invented in Belgium and not in France as the name implies. The origin of the term French fries can be traced back to WWI and to a group of clueless American soldiers who found themselves in a French-speaking part of Belgium, and unwittingly created culinary history!(All the characters in this story are purely a figment of the authors creative genius and bear no resemblance to any characters she has read about extensively.)GI Joe1: Man, these fried potatoes are really good!GI Joe 2: Where are we? Are we lost?GI Joe 3 (who prides himself on his geography): We are in France. Cant you see they are speaking French here!GI Joe 1 (a very focused soldier when it comes to food): I think I am going to write home to Ma and tell her to make me fries like dem French fries here!GI Joe 3: Dats good, man! We call them French Fries from now on.!And that was it. Poor Belgium, originator of those crunchy fries, lost out the name to a much-detested neighbor and the world was introduced to French Fries. Though I must say French Fries has a nice alliterative ring to it and sounds better than going up and saying, Give me large Belgian Fries please!The best place to get true Belgian Frites is from a friterie or frietkot. These fry stands can be anything from a small cart with deep-fryers to a shop in a bustling market square. Belgians eat their frites served in a paper cone and preferably with small plastic forks; and if you are a true Belgian, you will walk around while eating out of the cone with the fork! Belgian fries are short and stout, about a centimeter wide and are often hollow inside. Fries here are typically served with dollops of sauce which range from the more traditional favorites such as ketchup and mustard to more interesting concoctions like andalouse, samurai and joppieaus. The topping most Belgians prefer is spicy mayonnaise, which is also paired with most Belgian dishes. I had my paper cone of frites topped with spicy ketchup and spent an ideal 15 minutes soaking in the lovely view of the canal. And the calories!Besides fries, Belgians have been making waffles long before the Americans got their hands on to it and transformed it into a diner breakfast option. In Belgium, waffles is the perfect street food: you eat them on the run, the waffle fits very comfortably in your hand and unlike, the American iHop variety, you definitely do not slather them with toppings (very un-Belgian). And the best part is you can get your hands on a Belgian waffle anywhere: from stalls in the large stations to waffle trucks which you can smell coming a mile away!So what is the difference between the original Belgian waffle and its US Johnny-come-lately counterpart? Belgian waffle is essentially a denser, sweeter, chewier waffle that can brighten up ones day on the most dreary of days. And with the country having many unpredictable rainy days, these waffles are just the perfect remedy to plod through a gray day. The secret in making these waffles is pearl sugar. This is basically an integral part of European baking and is coarse, large chunks of sugar which does not melt at temperatures used in baking, giving the product an extra sweetness and crunch. So when this sugar is mixed into the dough, and cooked on the iron, the pearls melt and caramelize on the outside of the waffle forming big bites of crisp, browned sugar.I stand outside a waffle shop and watch the waffler (is that even a word?) prepare his wares expertly. The smell wafting from the shop is intoxicating. I ponder: would another round of a high-calorie food, after a large wretched cone of fries, send me into a diabetic coma? And then of course, there is another matter: Belgians pride themselves on their chocolate  and their beer.

Ole, I said to myself, and landed up there.The restaurant, called The Beer Caf, is present in many parts of Delhi but has just opened up an outlet in Khan Market. Its in the middle lane, on your right if you enter the lane from the Rabindra Nagar side. The cafe is on the second floor (Phone No. 9711316004).Its a neat place, with a bar on one side, comfortable sofas, tables for dining and a small terrace where you can sit and contemplate nature. There is music playing, but not so loud (as it is in several cafes) that you cannot hear yourself think.They have a Spanish theme, but actually it has a lot of other stuff as well  from dim sums and Bruschetta to pasta, pizza and grilled food and from keema pao and biryani to even peanut chaat.But my mind was on Spain, so I was keen on tapas and such like. A platter of tapas  Spanish finger-food  arrived, with pulled chicken, mustard and scallion herb fish, garlic prawn crostini, caprese, marinated olives, pickled gherkins and fried chillies (Rs. 695).The first dish to arrive was a prawn preparation  gambas al ajillo  prawns sizzled with garlic, chilli, parsley, olive oil and lemon (Rs. 425). Then came the pollo al ajillo  pan-seared garlic chicken thigh, sausages and wings (Rs. 375). And then there was coca-Catalan flatbread  oven-roasted vegetables, roasted tomatoes and fresh herbs (Rs. 325).The tapas were good, and I enjoyed the pulled chicken, the caprese  a piece of soft mozzarella and tomato stick  and the garlic prawn crostini served on a piece of small flat bread.The platter included some basa fish, which I politely refused. Basa, in my opinion, is the fish worlds paneer.The main prawn dish was served on a small slice of lemon, which gave it a nice tangy taste. The main flavours for the chicken and prawn dishes were similar, except that the chicken was chilli-hot. I enjoyed both.I liked the Catalan flatbread quite a bit. One, of course, because of the developments in Catalonia, and, two, because it was a crispy thin-crust bread with some delicious roasted toppings.It is almost like a pizza, but without the mandatory tomato sauce. It came with yellow and red roasted peppers, broccoli, zucchini, aubergines and tomatoes. The veggies were juicy, the bread was crisp, and the two complementary textures jived well together. And what added to the taste was the basil, which left its characteristically piquant flavours on the toppings of the flatbread.It was quite a nice meal, and since I was in The Beer Caf, I had some Belgian beer to go along with the food.However, since the caf has a vast wine collection, I think they should tone down their spices so that the food can complement the wine, and vice versa.But the menu is interesting, the place is comfortable and the food, enjoyable. Muy buen, Id say."

Yoga guru Baba Ramdev added to the star power at the event by making the tadka for the dish at the India Gate lawns where the festival is underway.The giant wok in which khichdi had been cooked was weighed at 1,262kg. Out of this, the wok itself was estimated to weigh around 300kg.However, officials from Guinness World Records were yet to ascertain if a record had been made.The night-long preparations to make the dish were supervised by chef Sanjeev Kapoor. Yoga guru Baba Ramdev put the crowning tadka in the dish after it was cooked in a 1000-litre wok before an audience comprising ministers, delegates, ambassadors and foodies.The dish was prepared with nutritious ingredients from diverse parts of the country. Rice, moong dal, bajra, jowar and Indian spices will be steam-cooked for the preparation before it is served to the audience on Saturday.A portion of the khichdi will also be packed and sent to all the heads of foreign missions in India, along with the recipe, said a person involved in the cooking. The mega khichdi preparation is part of the Great Indian Food Street at the festival that features street food from 20 states. The wok, put up on a concrete stand, was the centre of attraction among those who visited the festival on Friday.The humble dish khichdi took the centre stage even before it was cooked at the food fair. The buzz started when it was announced that the dish would be showcased as Brand India food at a November 4 World Food India event. The dish was selected as it symbolised Indias unity in diversity and is eaten by both the rich and poor.Khichdi started trending on social media right after the announcement, with people whipping up a debate. On Thursday, Harsimrat Kaur Badal put an end to the rumours and tweeted, Enough Khichdi cooked up on a fictitious National Dish. It has only been put for a record entry in #WorldFoodIndia.I came to know about khichdi event through social media. I made it a point to visit and see it. I didnt know that the cooking event is on Saturday, said Rajeev Kumar, a private company employee from Noida sector 63.After a series of trials spanning over a month, chef Kapoor, who curated the food street concept, said, The world should know whatever we have been processing. The intent is to promote Indian culinary in front of a global audience and in a way benefit farmers at the grass root level.The 1,000-litre wok, put up on a concrete stand, remained the centre of attraction among those who visited the festival on Friday. (Burhaan Kinu/HT PHOTO)Apart from the khichdi event, the food street also promotes traditional products like daap chingri  a traditional Bengali recipe of prawns cooked in mustard and filled inside a coconut to get a combined flavour of mustard and coconut cream. Besides, it has a stalls displaying ITC products, Ayurvedic foods and South Indian fish cuisines, among others.The underlying message is food processing with a dash of culture, taste and mystery to generate excitement among people who want to invest in India, Kapoor said. Organisers said the event focuses on the globalisation of Indian and heritage foods.The event also comprises cookery demonstrations by chefs such as Ranveer Brar, Saransh Goila, Imtiaz Qureshi and Kavneet Sahni, among others.The food street celebrates food traditions of India which are more than capable of imbibing beautifully with any world cuisines, said Sadhvi Niranjan Jyoti, minister of state for food processing."

For the past three decades, she has been helping foreign tourists acquaint themselves with traditional cuisines of India.And the meals prepared and served at her house in a true Indian manner always leave foreigners satisfied and with everlasting memories. Hema welcomes foreigners with a garland and tilak. Before they depart, she gives them tamboola as a gift. She uses only plantain leaves to serve the meals. She takes every possible care to ensure that foreigners enjoy fresh food and warm hospitality.Hema also teaches foreigners how to eat food without using spoons and chopsticks. She describes in detail various kinds of ingredients used for preparing the meals and their health benefits. A detailed menu card helps foreigners get familiar with the name of traditional South Indian delicacies. Often, she is seen taking the foreigners to markets to introduce them to local vegetables and spices. The right amount of spices is necessary for a healthy food, she always tells her guests.In our country, we do not use so much of spices and flavours. The South Indian food we had here was very delicious and exotic. The flavours blended so well and the taste was just incredible. Mango chitranna, brinjal gojju, tomato bath prepared using dry fruits and rotis were very good. We would love to visit this place again, says Jessica from the US.Carina Maria from Germany adds: I savoured the food with ghee and the colourful palyas. I learnt some of the recipes from Hema and just cannot wait to try them when I am back home.Hema also runs a cooking school Indias Royal Kitchen at her residence in Vontikoppal, where several foreigners have learnt the tricks of the culinary trade. Not just your tongue, but the food should also be able to satiate the eyes and the nose. The aroma and the look of the food trigger the senses in the body, making one feel like trying it. If grinded together, the spices blend well, and the right flavour of the spices leaves one craving for more, explains the 50-year-old avid cook.Over her tryst with cooking, Hema says, I started cooking at the age of eight. Pancakes and South Indian filtered coffee were the two things that I learnt to prepare first. Fascinated by the grinding stone, I soon started spending more time in the kitchen. As a child, I got to eat the best homemade food rich in spices. My grandmother and mother were both passionate about cooking.Her favourite dish: Majjige Huliconsecutive days. When asked to share the recipe for the same, she said: First cut the ash gourd to small cubes and put them to boil in a vessel. Then grind green chillies, cumin, coconut, coriander leaves, chana dal and moong dal. Once the ash gourd is soft, add the masala and boil. Later, add curd and cook for one boil. Oil, mustard and curry leaves could be used for seasoning. The delicious curry will be ready.Indian food in foreign kitchensHema Malini Devi has held several cooking workshops across the globe. I was once invited by Berea University to give presentation on the spices and conduct cooking workshops. I taught them the significance of spices and South Indian delicacies. Everyone enjoyed the sessions and since then, I have cooked Indian food umpteen times in foreign kitchens, says Hema. I have travelled to San Francisco, Taos in New Mexico, Houston, London and several European countries to conduct cooking workshops. I had held a session for students of Andrews University too, adds Hema, who is the granddaughter of Sujaya Kanthamaniavaru, the second sister of Sri Jayachamaraja Wadiyar."
5a53419a9855b770e037e700,From plate to plough: Farm to distant shores,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-farm-to-distant-shores-commerce-and-industry-suresh-prabhu-agri-export-government-policy-4924023/,2017-11-06,"In general, both agri-exports and imports have increased substantially since 2004-05. In general, both agri-exports and imports have increased substantially since 2004-05.The new Commerce and Industry Minister, Suresh Prabhu, has expressed his resolve to expand exports. He has said that increase in agri-exports will not only increase the countrys export basket, but also augment farmers incomes and ameliorate farm distress. His objective is laudable and achievable, provided there is a paradigm shift in policy-making from being obsessively consumer-oriented to according greater priority to farmers interests. But before elaborating on this, let us compare the trends in agri-trade, both exports and imports, in the period when the UPA was in office (2004-05 to 2013-14) with that of the three-years of the current regime (2013-14 to 2016-17). A close look at these trends and their drivers can help Prabhu and his team identify agri-commodities that can help boost the agri-trade surplus.In general, both agri-exports and imports have increased substantially since 2004-05. Agri-trade increased from $14 billion to $59.2 billion between 2004-05 and 2016-17 (Figure 1). As a share of the agri-GDP, the contribution of this trade increased from 11.1 per cent in 2004-05 to 16.7 per cent in 2016-17 after peaking at 19.6 percent in 2012-13, reflecting the increasing integration of Indian agriculture with global markets.It is interesting to observe that during UPAs tenure in office, agri-trade surplus surged seven fold, from $3.6 billion in 2004-05 to $25.4 billion in 2013-14. But then fell dramatically by two-thirds after the NDA assumed office, touching $8.2 billion by 2016-17 (Figure 1). The tumbling agri-trade surplus was the result of falling exports and rising imports. Agri-exports, after peaking at $42.9 billion in 2013-14 fell to $33.7 billion in 2016-17, while imports kept rising  from $17.5 billion in 2013-14 to $25.5 billion by 2016-17. Agri-exports suffered primarily due to the significant fall in exports of cereals (especially wheat and maize), cotton, oilseeds and, to some extent, bovine meat (Figure 2). This, in turn, was largely due to a steep fall in global prices and restrictive export policies. Global prices of wheat, maize, soybean, and cotton, for example, fell by 47, 39, 25 and 18 per cent, respectively, during 2013-2016. The FAO food price index fell from 209.8 in 2013 to 161.5 in 2016. Export policies for pulses, oilseeds/edible oils and several vegetables were restrictive. Nevertheless, exports of fish-seafood, and fruits-nuts-vegetables (mainly guavas/mangoes, grapes, cashew nuts, onions) have been growing steadily. They touched $5.8 and $3 billion, respectively, in 2016-17 (Figure 2).Agricultural imports have been rising since 2004-05. Edible oils ($11.3 billion), pulses ($4.3 billion), and fruits, nuts, vegetables ($3.1 billion) accounted for $18.7 billion of the total agri-imports of $25.4 billion in 2016-17 (Figure 3).What do these trends mean for policy? First, if India has to promote agri-exports, the countrys policymakers must build global value-chains for some important agri-commodities in which the country has a comparative advantage. Estimates show that India is export competitive in almost 70 per cent of agricultural commodities, non-tradable (that is our prices are between import parity and export parity prices) in about 10-15 per cent commodities, and import competitive in the remaining 15-20 per cent commodities. On the exports front, India is relatively competitive in cereals, especially rice and wheat and maize, and, at times, oilseeds, especially groundnuts and oil meals. The country can also be competitive in groundnut and mustard oil, provided there is an open and stable export policy. India has also been the worlds second largest exporter of cotton.The country has a great potential to export fish and seafood, bovine meat, and fruits, nuts and vegetables. These are the commodities to focus on in order to stimulate agri-exports. This would require infrastructure and institutional support  connecting export houses directly to farmer producer organisations (FPOs), sidestepping the APMC-regulated mandis, removing stocking limits and trading restrictions.Stimulating such exports would also require structural reforms in agriculture. When global prices dip suddenly by 25-30 per cent  for example, between 2013-16  domestic exporters face problems. Export-oriented value-chains may need support in such times. A special package to support value-chains through infrastructural investments (in assaying, grading, packaging and storing facilities), which will also create jobs in rural areas, or assistance in adhering to sanitary and phytosanitary standards would make them more resilient to future price shocks.Second, India needs to adopt an open, stable and reliable export policy. Abrupt export bans, high minimum export prices to restrict exports, or other quantitative restrictions on pulses, edible oils  even on vegetables and cereals at times  must give way to a policy that does not put any fetters on exports.Third, on the imports front, India loses out most in the edible oils sector, especially palm and soybean oil. Palm oil is used to adulterate several other oils for the domestic market. Similarly, among pulses, primarily yellow pea is used as an adulterant in besan (chickpea flour). The import policy must, therefore, be designed such that the landed price of palm oil and yellow pea never goes much below the domestic prices of their nearest rivals, say, soybean oil and chickpea, respectively.Last, liberalisation of factor markets, especially land-lease markets, would also help in building more efficient and reliable export value-chains. Over-regulated land-lease markets have kept landholdings small and forced informal tenancies to flourish rendering them incapable of mobilising large-scale capital. Long land-lease arrangements can facilitate private investments in building export-oriented global value-chains, generating rural non-farm employment and enhancing farmers incomes.It is time for the commerce and industry minister to steer a farm-to-foreign strategy, improve agri-trade surpluses by promoting agri-exports, and most importantly create more jobs and bring prosperity to rural areas.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"
5a1588e29855b76bf13eea63,The quiet charms of Khichdi,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Citycitybangbang/the-quiet-charms-of-khichdi/,2017-11-06,"It now appears that there is no proposal to anoint Khichdi as the national dish of India, but regardless of whether khichdi deserves that title or not and glossing over the question of whether in a country like ours, any one dish can or should be classified as such, it certainly gives us an occasion to talk about something that has been a significant part of most of our lives.The sniffy comments about this simple dish made by assorted food snobs tell one part of the story. The experts on health and culinary tradition have other stories to tell. As someone who has grown up relishing khichdi, what follows is a very personal tribute to this humble dish.The simplest possible combination of the two major food groups, khichdi is food at its comforting best. A hot meal of khichdi shushes the senses, evens out temperamental stomachs, and satiates without leaving any residue behind; khichdi burps taste of nothing.My memories of khichdi are many. In our Gujarati household that lived outside the state most of the time, khichdi was most commonly our Sunday lunch. It was a meal that was looked forward to with quiet pleasure; it had a wholesome quality that made for hearty satisfaction.The consistency that was most preferred was wet without becoming runny, with grains just a little bit squished up. Ghee was poured in generous quantities; as children it was fun to make a mound of the khichdi dig a little hole in the centre and fill it up with ghee. Into this mixture went some spiced potatoes, a special jeera-clad onion salad, chaas, papad and some mango pickle. Together, this unfussy confluence of simple tastes came together week after week in a very precise way.The masterful simplicity of each ingredient in the meal bears reflection. Rice, dal with almost no spices, cooked without ceremony. Unlike the idea of khichdi as mish-mash (kya khichdi paka rahe ho?), an ungainly dumping together of disparate ingredients, the reality about it was the wordless harmony that existed between the two major food sects.Khichdi blended rice and dal together as if they belonged. Ghee, which makes the world feel plumper, adding a rich emulsion of pleasure to anything it is poured on, accentuated the bland fullness of the taste. Potatoes, that staple filler of blank spaces with several kinds of awesomeness, cooked with mustard seeds and left dry. Papad, the provider of crunchy service on demand, the attendant always ready to confer its crackle on a meal. Pickle, the little bite sized compression of a universe of very expressive flavours, seething naughtily in its own juices. Onion, the simple slice of a food that served as spice, an ingredient that turned any dish slightly sideways, a dash of knowing worldly wisdom added to things bland.In our house, with khichdi, and only with it, the onion was slathered in oil with jeera and salt sprinkled on it, and set off the potatoes particularly well. And to top it off, Chaas, gentle and kind, making ones stomach, and by extension the world, a calmer place.In some parts of the country, khichdi is looked down upon as the diet for those convalescing. This makes it the poor cousin of food, the stuff we make do with when our bodies are not quite ready for the real thing. I have never quite understood this view of khichdi, for it passes up on the pleasures of simplicity and confuses it with ordinariness.The idea that food must always perform, that it must necessarily transport us somewhere else, is a rigid view of its role in our lives. There is a time and place for that, indeed there must be for food is travel, and food is music, but food is also home.And the thing is, getting simple meals right is not easy. A cup of tea, scrambled eggs, nimbu-paani, coconut chutney- these everyday foods are very elusive when it comes to getting proportions just right. Khichdi is no exception, and getting the balance of the ingredients right was both very easy and extremely rare.With some people, notably mothers, getting khichdi right was effortless while in other cases, something always seemed a little off. With simple foods, it all comes down to proportion, timing, touch, restraint, love- there is no particular technique or skill involved, nothing dramatic by way of ingredients or presentation. The person cooking works with very little, and do so with instinct, as a habit. Perhaps, simple staple foods are nothing but an organic overflow of the person cooking.Khichdi derives its power from what it is not. It chooses to sidestep the flashy culinary razzle dazzle, choosing instead to let the taste come to the food, rather than the other way around. There might well be other ways of defending this noble food, perhaps from the perspective of health, perhaps even from the standpoint of culinary heritage, but personally, the truth that khichdi spoke had nothing to do with these. It held things together, it sat in the middle of everything, right at the centre with no interest in anything that lies at the edges. Khichdi is home, comfort without any reason, taste without any credentials.The stomach full with a hot meal sleeps easy. We regain an alignment with the world, things slip back into place, afternoon heat settles on us, and our eyes find it no longer useful to stay open. Slipping into khichdi-induced sleep on a hot summer Sunday, under a reluctant fan, the distant buzz of some insect, life takes on a timeless drone of inevitability. The complex, the layered and the textured can be great, but only the simple can be perfect."

Jeyapragasam said that while formulating the GST, genuine stakeholders were not called for discussion. It had been formulated by ministers and officials without understanding the ground reality of the industry.In a bid to boost revenue, the government had neglected the interests of small traders and micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). The Tamil Nadu government used to invite stakeholders for pre-budget meetings to elicit their views. The practice was in vogue since 1996. The Union government should have convened such a meeting so that the features of GST could have been discussed and fine-tuned.The Association had sought total tax exemption for coriander, chilli, dried ginger, mustard, fenugreek, turmeric, and five % for pickles, biscuits, ghee and butter (unregistered brand). Under the GST regime, palm jaggery was exempt from tax, whereas palmyrah sugar, the method of production of which was the same as that of palmyrah jaggery, was levied five %. Palmyrah sugar should also be exempt from tax.Sugar candy (kalkandu) which was mainly used in temples as prasadam and also for medicinal purpose in country drugs was exempted earlier, but it was levied five % now.The Association had asked 100 % exemption for many products, mostly unregistered brands/commodities used in houses from time immemorial. Some of them included batter for idly and dosa, a common household item in southern States, that attracted 18 % when GST was launched. Though it had been reduced to 12 %, it should be brought down further to five %."

Patel, deputy director of agriculture in Aravalli, said.The cultivation of GM crops - whether for field trials or on commercial farms - needs to be approved by a government panel called the Genetic Engineering Advisory Committee (GEAC) under the Union environment and forests ministry.India has so far approved only GM cotton for commercial cultivation although a few other plants, including brinjal and mustard, have been assessed in experimental conditions. The GEAC has not approved any edible GM crop yet.The illegal GM soy cultivation in Gujarat has angered activists campaigning against GM crops.""The regulatory system is clearly in tatters.... The government has to think of a serious overhaul of the entire set-up and significant improvements in inter-agency coordination is required to ensure that no illegal GM cultivation or sales take place in the country,"" the Coalition for a GM Free India said in a statement released on Tuesday."

The surface of the lakesteel-grey in the morning lightwas marked with perfect circles. Some were just rings, while others were filled out and larger, with tiny shacks on them. A few days later, I got a chance to see the floating islands in person. Known locally as phumdis, theyre formed by floating vegetation. Traditionally, fishermen would shape the vegetation into rings to help them fish. Today, they dont need to, so the vegetation has been allowed to grow wild and often has to be dredged. Great piles of it lie drying in the sun by the lakeside. The guide told me it makes for great manure, especially for growing the vibrant mustard greens he buys from the town near the lake.On a boat ride through the lake, we rowed past phumdis of varying sizes, finally stopping near a substantial one. When I stepped on it at the guides urging, the spongy surface sank a little to let in some water around my feet. I started worrying, until the young man rowing the boat reassured me that it was normal. He is one of the around 4,000 people who live on the islands and phumdis on the lake. Instead of fishing, some of them now make their living ferrying tourists. Some work at the government-run water sports centre at one end of the lake, near Takmu.One of the biggest islands on the lake is Indiasand perhaps the worldsonly floating national park. Spread over 40 sq. km, the Keibul Lamjao National Park is rather like an iceberg, with 80% of it submerged under water. The tall grasses on it hide an elusive animal, the sangai, or brow-antlered deer, that is endemic to the area. Standing under the gazebo built at a viewpoint at the edge of the island, I scoured the landscape for a glimpse of it. The sangai is said to be so shy that the slightest sound or smell can frighten it away. The midday sun played tricks, making me believe I had spotted it each time the grass rustled in the languid breeze. I am still not sure whether the brown smudge I saw in the distance was a sangai or not, but it was a pleasant way to spend the day.Photo: ShutterstockOn the day I visited, the park boatman was on leaveif he is around, visitors can take a boat ride on the narrow channel running through the phumdis. I imagine it would be quite an experience.The national park and Loktak Lake are 60km south of the capital, Imphal. Taxi rentals for the day cost Rs3,500.Neha DaraKakkathuruthu, Kerala. Photo: Susan PaulSundownerIn Kakkathuruthu, on the Vembanad Lake near Kochi in Kerala, visitors can experience nature at its best. Calming waters, an iridescent sunset, and after a quiet night lulled by gentle waves, waking up to a glorious sunrise bursting with promise. The island, in fact, is now world famous, after National Geographic listed it as the place to be at 6pm, in its photographic tour, Around The World In 24 Hours.It is so beautiful, with everything so still, that it sometimes feels as if time has stopped. You can ride the lake in a vanji (row boat), get a taste of village life or soak in the natural beauty. It is Gods own island and the perfect place to unwind.To get there, take a taxi from Cochin International Airport to Eramalloor Junction (45km away), or a taxi from the Ernakulam Junction railway station in Kochi to Eramalloor Junction (20km away). Near the Aroor toll on National Highway 47, turn left and drive for 1km till you reach the Kodumpuram Ferry. Hop on to a vanji to the Kakkathuruthu Island (a 10-minute ride). You can stay at the Kayal Island Retreat, an ecology-friendly resort, the only place to stay on the island.Savera JohnKalijai Island, Odisha. Photo: Neha DaraThe lake goddessAs the boat leaves the small man-made harbour, two small birds skim over the water. The boatman navigates between the nets set by local fishermen, setting a straight course towards Kalijai Island, barely visible on the horizon as a thin green line.The surface of Chilika Lake, a large brackish waterbody that sprawls across three districts in Odisha, ripples gently in the morning breeze. The lake is so large that it has multiple access points. I take a boat from Barkul, the one closest to Bhubaneswar. The boatman suggests I keep an eye out for the Irrawaddy dolphin. I do, tempering my expectations. The dolphins are shy mammals, and with only about 134 of them in the lake, according to a 2017 census, the chances of spotting one are low. Theyre usually seen around Satpada. Come winter, this lake is a wonderland for bird-spotting, especially around Mangalajodi, where an eco-tourism initiative organizes regular tours.I am here at the tail end of the monsoon, but there are still plenty of birds about. It isnt long before the island comes into focus, the bright yellow of the Kalijai Temple visible from afar. The temple and the island are both named after the goddess Kalijai, believed to be a local who died in a storm on the lake soon after her wedding, while on her way to meet her husband. It is believed that she sacrificed herself to save her father and the boatman, thereby becoming the patron goddess of all those who travel on the lake. Tying some bright red bangles, bought from an adjoining stall, with a cloth strip to a post near the temple in honour of this legend, I set off on a quick stroll around the island.Photo: Neha DaraThe path begins behind the temple, where I spot a foot-long chameleon in the midst of changing colour. I find several more hidden in plain sight during my walk, hugging a tree bark or resting among neon-green leaves. With the monsoon not yet over, the vegetation on the island is exuberant, with something green growing under, over and around every rock, and even between the blocks that pave the path. Scores of white butterflies flutter about, and occasionally the path turns to reveal a glimpse of the lake crashing against the rocks at the edge of the island. The roots of a hardy banyan cling to the rocky outcrop it stands on, somehow finding purchase in that inimical spot. Its sturdy branches are covered with initials carved by previous visitors.In just 20 minutes, during which I didnt spot another soul, Im back where I started, at the jetty near the temple. Few wander beyond this point, but Im glad I did. The short walk was a reminder of one of the things I love about islandsthe sheer variety they hold in their small land mass.Neha DaraUmananda, Assam. Photo: Yasaswini SampathkumarOn high groundThe tout muttered Umananda, Umananda, Umananda as he walked past, almost hypnotizing me into taking his ferry to the small mushroom-shaped island in the middle of the Brahmaputra. I walked on. My grocery bags demanded I go home undistracted by mid-river detours.But the image of this tiny rocky outcrop in the middle of a swirling, angry river remained. I thought about the island during the monsoon, when the river gobbled up factories, villages and forests. I thought about it when the ferries disappeared from the waters and friends and family called to ask if I was safewasnt all of Assam flooded? I wanted to say that there was at least one spot resisting the river; one island that allowed its plants and animals to stay safe and relatively dry.Umananda derives its name from Uma (another name for the goddess Parvati) and ananda (happiness). According to local legend, the island was created for Parvatis pleasure, though, ironically, other tales associate the island with Shivas penance and the incineration of Kamadeva. History, however, dates the islands temple to the 17th century, attributing its construction to an Ahom king. Two hundred years later, when the Assam earthquake of 1897 flattened the region, emptied lakes, created 7ft waves in the Brahmaputra and raised the neighbouring plateau of Shillong by 11m, the island remained strangely unaffected. Only the temple needed some reconstruction. Therefore, when a friend suggested a trip to Umananda with our families, I decided to go because I wanted a slice of that islands spirit, to stay steady during the quakes and aftershocks of a parents life.The river was full, the monsoon was a fresh memory and the water had the strong grey-brown colour of silt. We stayed under the ferrys makeshift metallic roof, trying to hide from a resurgent sun. The island came into view, with rocks and sand forming a collar around the green curly mop of the trees canopy. Instinctively, my hands reached out to stroke the baby curls on my sons head and adjust the collar of his shirt.The bamboo dock looked fragile but proved safe, standing near an archway that marked the steps leading up to the temple. We began to hike, flanked on either side by huge fragrant flowers.Then came the langurs. I looked at the black faces of these golden langurs, and the yellow-orange fur that seemed to burst like flames from their bodies. What made these animals live in this isolated habitat, hundreds of kilometres from their natural range? Did they travel along with the carpenters and sculptors who worked on the temple centuries ago? Did someone leave a breeding pair on the island? Are they evidence of more recent mischief?I clutched the bag with our lunch closer. After a lunge and quick sniff, though, the langurs abandoned my idli and poha boxes for the packets of chips carried by the travellers ahead.Over the next hour, many of us puffed and panted to a stop. Open shrines along the stairway were good excuses to rest. We reached the dark, cavernous main sanctum after negotiating the long queue. Then we slouched our way back to the ghats. As we waited, some of the vendors joined usthey were making their way back to Guwahati. Only a clutch of people live on the island all year long. It can be surreal when the river growls and expands, and the murderous current leaves them marooned, even as Guwahatis lights twinkle in the distance.Just then a friend interrupted my reverie, announcing that the trader who rebuilt the temple in the 20th century ensured that there were verses to Vishnu inscribed in the Shiva temple. I laughed a little at this microscopic act of subversion.The ferry arrived and we slowly slipped into silence. It had been a tiring journey, but when the families parted, the goodbyes were warm and spontaneous, as if we had been blessed by the spirit of Umananda Island.Yasaswini SampathkumarSrirangapatna, Karnataka. Photo: Saritha Rao RayachotiPilgrim islandAs a child, on train journeys crisscrossing south India, I was fond of throwing coins from my compartment window into the rivers that we passed over. It was considered good luck. The train from Mysuru to Bengaluru passed over two stretches of the Kaveri river, halting between them at the Srirangapatna railway station, but I dont remember ever having thrown a second coin, or even harbouring the idea that Srirangapatna could be an island.Now the Bengaluru-Mysuru highway runs through part of Srirangapatna, and I have to use the satellite imagery on my mobile phone to prove to incredulous friends that Srirangapatna is indeed an island; the Kaveri diverges close to the point that a commemorative obelisk stands on the land mass, and converges towards the south-eastern edge, at the Triveni Sangama.Islands are often regarded as exotic, insular and mysterious, but Srirangapatna has always been accessible to the outside world, even with the fortification guarding the kingdom of Tipu Sultan and enclosing the Ranganathaswamy Temple.Today, not much remains of Tipus Lal Mahal palace, but on a previous visit to the exquisitely frescoed Daria Daulat Bagh, I listened to a security guards impassioned narration of how Tipu surrendered two of his sons as hostages of war to the British, under a painting depicting the scene. Later, an inebriated tour guide at Colonel Baileys dungeon described in graphic detail how Tipu tortured and held his prisoners captive below ground level, in cells that would be flooded with the waters of the nearby river.On my most recent visit, I went to the Ranganathaswamy Temple, one of the points in the Tri-Ranga Darshanam, the pilgrimage of the three Ranganatha temples that are located on islands in the Kaveri. The devout in my family have attempted worshipping at all three temples in the span of a single day, between sunrise and sunset. This temple complex is perhaps the oldest structure on the island. The town that evolved around it came to be known as Srirangapatna (Sri Rangas town). Even the bird sanctuary upstream, Ranganathittu, is named after the deity here.I am an unlikely pilgrim, yet my hackles rose as I entered the temple precincts through the gopuram (gatehouse tower) on a late October morning. The stone doorway has been narrowed with cement columns, with scant regard for the way this mars the ancient dwarapalakas, the doorkeeper statues, that stand on either side.A tourist guide in the inner courtyard of lathe-turned pillars narrated the story of the temple to a bunch of schoolchildren. While the original garbha griha, or sanctum sanctorum, was built in 817 AD, reportedly by a dancer, all those who came subsequently, from Ganga dynasty chieftain Thirumalaraya to Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana, and even Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, added to it. The sanctum sanctorum was surprisingly quiet. I paused in a corner, awed by the Ranganatha, who is depicted on a massive scale, reclining with a hand propped under his head.Ranganayaki, a manifestation of goddess Lakshmi, has her own shrine, where a young priest narrated her story. In the early 1600s, the representative of the Vijayanagara kingdom, Sriranganatha, died of a mysterious ailment. His wife, Alamelamma, continued the weekly tradition of sending jewellery to adorn the deity. When Raja Wadiyar, who had taken over the kingdom, heard, he insisted that she surrender the jewels. Uttering a curse, Alamelamma drowned herself in the Kaveri. Ever since, it is said, Alamelammas pearl ring, which is still used to adorn the goddess, diminishes in size each year.I passed rose farms en route to the Nimishambha temple in the islands north-eastern corner, the roads lined with vendors in makeshift stalls selling gulkand. The temple is on the river bank, close to where the Lokapavani tributary joins the Kaveri. Two elderly men on the banks sound gongs for a fee. The enclosures extending from the ghat are strewn with the detritus of ritual dips, but the river is wide here and flows steadily.The Paschima Vahini ghat is located in a disorienting spot between the island and the mainland, just off the highway. Its hard to say where the island ends and the mainland begins because one loses track of the very things that define a riverine islandthe waters that sometimes gush within sight, and sometimes flow along unobtrusively, and the many bridges, some spanning an immense width and some that one passes over distractedly, so lost in the gathered stories that one forgets to toss a second coin over the edge.Saritha Rao RayachotiHope Island, Andhra Pradesh. Photo: Chitra RamaswamyHope floatsSunlight danced through mist and cloud, and there was a nip in the February air as we made our way to Kakinada Port, less than 2km from where we were stayingHaritha Beach Resort, an Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation hotel. The harbour bustled with fishermen wheeling carts full of tawda. Cargo ships carrying rice, palm oil, spices and granite lined the cerulean waters of Kakinada Bay, which merges with the Bay of Bengal.From the port, we took the tourism departments 30-seater boat to Hope Island, a 45-minute journey. A kilometre away from the jetty at Kakinada was a 500m-long and 60ft-deep barricade of boulders that keep ocean waves from entering the shipyard. Our boat made an arch around the barrier, heading towards Hope Island.Famous for its natural and hybrid mangroves, and formed 200 years ago from the sediment outflow of the Koringa River, a tributary of the Godavari, the island gets its name, Hope, from the protection it provides Kakinada. It acts as a natural barrier against tsunamis and cyclones, making Kakinada one of the safest natural harbours on Indias east coast. The islands two hamlets, Putrayya Pakalu and Sorlagondu Pakalu, are inhabited by 400 families of fisherfolk. The villages run on solar power, and there is a government school.Alighting at the islands jetty, we wove our way through sandy paths before coming upon the mangroves. Tourism is nascent, with not many facilities to talk of, but the beaches and the neighbouring Coringa Wildlife Sanctuary are a breeding ground for Olive Ridley turtles. A few hundred come to these shores each year, during the mating season in October-November. Six weeks later, as if on cue, the hatchlings wend their way back to the Indian Ocean.In February, there were no turtles, but we did see beautiful orange crabs emerging from their coiled shells. We walked through endless clusters of brilliant green, catching stunning views of the backwaters, before reaching the sanctuary.Named after the river winding through it, the sanctuary has the largest mangroves in India after the Sundarbans. These hold an amazing variety that includes several turtle species, the Indian smooth-coated otter and the saltwater crocodile. Walking through the trees, we spotted a bushy tail here, a quick scamper there. On the journey back at dusk, the sky was alive with avian drama.Chitra RamaswamyThinnakara, Lakshadweep. Photo: Sindhu MurthyPhoto: AlamyBeyond the coral dustAs our ferry approaches the pristine beach of the Thinnakara atoll in Lakshadweep, I cannot help but marvel at the colour of the sea, turning from azure to turquoise before turning pale blue as its waves caress the coral dust of the shore. A pair of turtles swim nonchalantly amid the flamboyant corals. It is late afternoon. The tide in the lagoon has gradually ebbed, exposing the tips of some of the corals. The water is pristine here. As our boat carefully navigates the shallow lagoon, avoiding contact with the corals, the vibrant creatures of the seabed spring to life.Thinnakara looks near deserted save for a few tourists and the resort staff. Accommodation on the island is basic: just nine Swiss cottage tents with attached baths. But you forget all that soon enough. The rustle of the swaying coconut palms and the soft roar of the waves in the lagoon form a symphony with the plaintive cries of the seagulls. The pristine white sand of the beach, formed by the erosion of coral skeletons, sparkles like silver in the afternoon sun. As twilight swaddles the island, spreading its amber hues, I set out to explore. The tide has receded further, exposing a vast expanse of the white seabed. A new world seems to have emerged from the water. Walking barefoot on the wavy patterns of the coral sand left behind by the receding tide, I discover numerous sea cucumbers, starfish, shells and corals. The exposed seabed is just as beautiful. It only takes an hour to go around the island, which has a total surface area of 0.42 sq. m.Unlike Lakshadweeps tourist islands, there is no solar-power plant in Thinnakara, so a diesel generator is the only source of electricity. No network connectivity, nothing but a sense of endless time as you luxuriate in nature. While dropping off to sleep on the soft sand, I can see just about every constellation in the clear night skythere isnt a single puff of cloud. I drift into a gentle slumber, pampered by the cool breeze, and am only woken when waves touch my feet as the tide begins to rise.Lakshadweep has two uninhabited islands that tourists are allowed to visit. Thinnakara and Bangaram. The coral islands of Lakshadweep are extremely fragile and ecologically sensitive, so the government restricts entry. While youre there, you can scuba dive, snorkel, or take a glass-bottom boat ride.Take a flight from Kochi to Agatti Island. From there, it takes about an hour and a half by speedboat to Bangaram Island, followed by a ferry ride of about 30 minutes to Thinnakara.Sindhu Murthy"

It has a small bench, a shelf filled with bandage and cotton rolls, and a signboard on the wall listing the services on offer.He does not have to wait long.A woman writhing in pain arrives with her husband. She says she hurt her leg a few days ago, and the pain is unbearable. Pahalwan, a plump man in his early fifties, examines the painful part and delivers the diagnosis in a minute flat. Its infection, not injury, he says, his face beatific. The couple seems impressedthough they do not quite ask Midda how he arrived at the diagnosis.Midda, a boner-setter, soaks a bandage in dark brown oil and wraps it around the affected part of the leg. Do not worry, you will be fine in a couple of days, he says. Come and show it to me next Monday.The fee? Rs 200. It is the cost of the material, Midda says.The womans husband Anil Kumar says Midda has a Midas touch. I have been coming to him for nine years and he has cured all my bone-related problems, says Kumar, as Midda makes an effort to look self-effacing.Midda says his clients include top politicians, including a former prime minister. I can cure all bone-related problems except broken backbone, he says as he puts the money in his pocket. I am getting more patients than ever before.Midda is not the only one. There are any number of Pahalwans (a generic title for bone-setters in north India) running flourishing ortho clinics across the city, where they claim to provide traditional and natural treatment for everything from fractures to all kinds of muscle spasm, sprains and strains. And, like Midda, who has studied up to class six only, they all claim to have learned the art of bone-setting -- a manipulation therapy for dislocated and fractured bones -- from their forefathers.Theirs is a world where home-made secret oils, salves and lotions in various shades of brown serve as medicines and bamboo sticks and cardboard as splints.No X-ray machines, no casts, no forceps. Most work with bare hands with a pair of scissors being the only the equipment. Curiously, their clinics  there are many of them in places such as Mahipalpur near the airport, Shahdara in east Delhi, Uttam Nagar in west Delhi  flaunt large flex signboards with photographs of WWF wrestlers with bandaged hands and legs.Many feel these Pahalwans are quacks but there are others who swear by their expertise. In fact, at some clinics, such as Ghuggi Pahalwans in Shahadra, the waiting time can be up to four hours.Almost all of them have had no formal training and claim to rely on wisdom and experience from their forefathers. And they all call themselves Pahalwans  though most have never been a wrestler.Our medicines and techniques originated in Akharas. Our forefathers were wrestlers who made their own herbal medicines to treat injuries sustained during wrestling, says Mohammad Ikran, who runs a clinic called Chaudhury Pahalwan in west Delhis Uttam Nagar.No one understands the human body better than wrestlers; they know all the bones, joints and muscles, he adds, as he rubs his secret oil on the hand and wrist of a patient. Every Pahalwan has his own herbal preparation. Each of those oils is meant for a different bone ailment, he says, pointing to a dozen bottles neatly placed on a shelf above his desk.Mohammad Ikran, who runs a clinic called Chaudhury Pahalwan, in west Delhis Uttam Nagar. (Vipin Kumar/HT)The patient he is attending to is Mohammad Naved. An exporter, he has come from Gurgaon to treat an injury. Naved is all praise for Ikran as the latter administers an elaborate treatment: He pours oil on the affected part, foments it with a device whose exact name he does not know, applies white paste, bandages it, places a piece of cardboard as a splint, and puts another bandage.My father has been coming to him for the past 10 years, and he always got cured. I did not want X-ray or other allopathic medicines, so I came here, says Naved. The bone-setter is happy with the way his patient has acknowledged his expertise.When people cannot get cured there, they come here, says Ikran, pointing to a multi-specialty hospital just across the road. You see, there are a few families like ours who have the knowledge and expertise, the rest are all frauds.There is tough competition among the Pahalwans of Delhi.Take for example the Chaudhury Pahlwans of Mahipalpur, which is mini-hub of Pahalwan clinics  or rather Chaudhury Pahalwan clinics. Mohammad Irshad, who runs one of them, warns you to be beware of copycatsbut it is not quite clear who is the original one.We are the original Chaudhury Pahalwans; the rest are all dodgy, says Irshad.Signboards outside and inside his shop say, People with sexual problems must also consult, but he is not willing to dwell on that line of his work.I make an oil for those types of problems, but the bone-setting is my specialisation, so lets focus on that only for now, says bespectacled Irshad dressed in a white shirt and grey trousers. Behind him is a wooden shelf filled with dark-brown oils in designer glass bottles, boxes of powders, and bandage rolls. On the right is a poster of a wrestler with a bandaged arm.I only deal with dislocation and muscle-related issues, I refer other cases to doctors, says Irshad, who has studied up to class nine. But unlike others, Irshad admits he is not a doctor of bones. My clients are mostly poor people who cannot afford doctors. They get cheap treatment here and I manage to eke out a living.While not every Pahalwan provides treatment for sexual diseases, all of them boast about their family legacy, and their secret formulation. But no one takes more pride in his family legacy and his secret salve than Shafiq Mannan. His father Hazi Abdul Mannan Pahalwan was one of the most famous bone-setters of the Walled City. Their clinic is at the end of a narrow, winding lane, but almost everyone has heard of Mannan sahib and they easily guide you to the place.Inside the clinic with tiled walls and green curtains, there are about five men and a young woman sitting on steel boxes that double up as benches. There is wooden plank where the Pahalwan sits. Next to it is an old, rusting iron box with bandages, a pair of scissors and a bowl of yellow paste the secret salve of the family. One has to take off shoes to get in.Its 1 pm and Pahalwan has gone for his namaz. When he returns around 2 pm, everyone stands up and greets him. He prefers to talk to us at nearby shop run by his brother. Our family belongs to the Iran-Afghanistan border and we shifted to Delhi in the 1920s. We have practising bone-setting for the past 300 years, says Shafiq. The salve we use has been passed down to us though generations.The short, stout man dressed in impeccable white, Shafiq, looks more like a businessman. Only my brothers and I know the ingredients of this salve, he says. Shafiq claims that 50 patients visit him every day from all over the country.Shafiq talks about how bone and joint problems are increasing like never before. These days, I get a lot of patients, including youngsters, with knee pain. Increased use of refined oil is responsible for it. We should take a decent amount of mustard oil or desi ghee every day, which is very necessary for healthy bones, he says. Ask him why his clinic is so popular, and pat comes the reply: Our expertise, and low-cost of treatment.Orthopedicians are not amused. Mention Pahalwan and Dr Atul Vaish, vice-president, Delhi Orthopedic Association, says. They are just quacks and do more harm than good. There are no ifs and buts about it. For them every bone-related problem is a case of dislocation. Their methods are unscientific and highly questionable, he says. You need to understand the anatomy of a person to carry out any manipulation. And for that you need formal training."

Photo: APTehran: A powerful 7.3 magnitude earthquake near the Iraq-Iran border killed over 400 people across both countries, sent residents fleeing their homes into the night and was felt as far away as the Mediterranean coast, authorities said Monday.Irans western Kermanshah province bore the brunt of the temblor Sunday night, with authorities saying the quake killed 407 people in the country and injured 6,700. Kermanshah is a rural, mountainous region where residents rely mainly on farming.In Iraq, the earthquake killed at least seven people and injured 535, all in the countrys northern Kurdish region, according to Iraqs Interior Ministry.The quake was centered 19 miles (31km) outside the eastern Iraqi city of Halabja, according to the most recent measurements from the US Geological Survey. It struck at 9:48 p.m. Iran time, just as people began retiring for the night.It could be felt on the Mediterranean coast, some 660 miles (1,000km) away.The earthquake struck 23.2km (14.4 miles) below the surface, a shallow depth that can amplify damage. Magnitude 7 earthquakes can be highly destructive.Iranian social media and news agencies showed images and videos of people fleeing their homes. More than 100 aftershocks followed.The quakes worst damage appeared to be in the town of Sarpol-e-Zahab in Kermanshah province, which sits in the Zagros Mountains that divide Iran and Iraq.Kokab Fard, a 49-year-old housewife in Sarpol-e-Zahab, said she fled empty-handed when her apartment complex collapsed. Immediately after I managed to get out, the building collapsed, Fard said. I have no access to my belongings.Reza Mohammadi, 51, said he and his family ran out into the alley after the first shock. I tried to get back to pick up some stuff but it totally collapsed in the second wave, Mohammadi said.Sarpol-e-Zahab residents said the power and water were out and telephone and cellphone lines were spotty.Irans Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei offered his condolences on Monday morning and urged rescuers and government agencies to do all they could to help those affected, state media reported. President Hassan Rouhani is scheduled to tour earthquake-damaged areas Tuesday.The semi-official ILNA news agency said at least 14 provinces in Iran had been affected by the earthquake. Behnam Saeedi, a spokesman for the countrys crisis management headquarters, told two semi-official news agencies that casualty figures stood at 407 killed and 6,700 injured.In Iraq, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi issued a directive for the countrys civil defence teams and related institutions to respond to the natural disaster. Brig. Gen. Saad Maan, an Interior Ministry spokesman, gave the casualty figures for Iraq.The quake could be felt across Iraq, shaking buildings and homes from Irbil to Baghdad, where people fled into the streets of the capital.Amina Mohammed, who survived the quake in Darbandikhan, Iraq, said she and her sons escaped their home as it collapsed around them.I think it was only God that saved us, she said. I screamed to God and it must have been him who stopped the stairs from entirely collapsing on us.The Iraqi city of Halabja, closest to the epicenter, was the target of a 1988 chemical attack in which Saddam Husseins troops killed some 5,000 people with mustard gas  the deadliest chemical weapons attack ever against civilians.Iraqi seismologist Abdul-Karim Abdullah Taqi, who runs the earthquake monitoring group at the state-run Meteorological Department, said the main reason for the lower casualty figure in Iraq was the angle and the direction of the fault line. He said the Iraqi geological formations were better able to absorb the shocks.However, the temblor caused visible damage to the dam at Darbandikhan, which holds back the Diyala River.There are horizontal and vertical cracks on the road and in the body of the dam, and parts of the dam sank lower, said Rahman Hani, the director of the dam.Turkey dispatched emergency aid to northern Iraq as officials expressed their deep sadness at the tragedy. Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said his country took immediate action to provide medical and food aid to northern Iraq.Kerem Kinik, the Turkish Red Crescents vice president, told The Associated Press from Habur border crossing that 33 aid trucks were en route to the northern Iraqi city of Sulaimaniyah, carrying 3,000 tents and heaters, 10,000 beds and blankets as well as food.A Turkish military cargo plane arrived in Iraq as the official Anadolu news agency reported multiple dispatches by Turkeys disaster agency. Ankara also said it would help Iran if Tehran requests assistance.Relations between Iraqs semi-autonomous Kurdish region and Turkey were strained following the Iraqi Kurds September independence referendum.Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country stands with the region in difficult times and wished the Iraqi and Iranian people a speedy recovery. Speaking en route to Sochi, Russia, Erdogan said a convoy of 50 aid trucks has crossed the border into Iraq. Pakistan also extended its condolences for the loss of life and injuries suffered by our Iranian and Iraqi brethren.Iran sits on many major fault lines and is prone to near-daily quakes. In 2003, a magnitude 6.6 earthquake flattened the historic city of Bam, killing 26,000 people. The last major casualty earthquake in Iran struck in East Azerbaijan province in August 2012, killing over 300 people.Jon Gambrell in Dubai, Susannah George in Irbil; Balint Szlanko in Darbandikhan; Zeynep Bilginsoy in Istanbul; Zarar Khan in Islamabad and Sinan Salaheddin in Baghdad contributed to this report"

There are any number of Pahalwans (a generic title for bone-setters in north India) running flourishing ortho clinics across the city, where they claim to provide traditional and natural treatment for everything from fractures to all kinds of muscle spasm, sprains and strains. And, like Midda, who has studied up to class six only, they all claim to have learned the art of bone-setting -- a manipulation therapy for dislocated and fractured bones -- from their forefathers.Theirs is a world where home-made secret oils, salves and lotions in various shades of brown serve as medicines and bamboo sticks and cardboard as splints.Mohammad Irshad, who runs a Chaudhury Pahalwan clinic, warns you to be beware of copycatsbut it is not quite clear who is the original one. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)No X-ray machines, no casts, no forceps. Most work with bare hands with a pair of scissors being the only the equipment. Curiously, their clinics  there are many of them in places such as Mahipalpur near the airport, Shahdara in east Delhi, Uttam Nagar in west Delhi  flaunt large flex signboards with photographs of WWF wrestlers with bandaged hands and legs. Many feel these Pahalwans are quacks but there are others who swear by their expertise. In fact, at some clinics, such as Ghuggi Pahalwans in Shahadra, the waiting time can be up to four hours.Almost all of them have had no formal training and claim to rely on wisdom and experience received from their forefathers. And they all call themselves Pahalwans  though most have never been a wrestler.Our medicines and techniques originated in Akharas. Our forefathers were wrestlers who made their own herbal medicines to treat injuries sustained during wrestling, says Mohammad Ikran, who runs a clinic called Chaudhury Pahalwan in west Delhis Uttam Nagar. No one understands the human body better than wrestlers; they know all the bones, joints and muscles, he adds, as he rubs his secret oil on the hand and wrist of a patient. Every Pahalwan has his own herbal preparation. Each of those oils is meant for a different bone ailment, he says, pointing to a dozen bottles neatly placed on a shelf above his desk.The patient he is attending to is Mohammad Naved, a tall, dapper man in red T-shirt and blue jeans. An exporter, he has come all the way from Gurgaon to get treatment for an injury he sustained in the gym. Naved is all praise for Ikran as the latter administers an elaborate treatment: He first pours oil on the affected part, then foments it with a device whose exact name he does not know, applies some white paste, bandages it, places a piece of cardboard as a splint, and then puts another layer of bandage.My father has been coming to him for the past 10 years, and he always got cured. I did not want X-ray or other allopathic medicines, so I came here, says Naved.The bone-setter is happy with the way his patient has acknowledged his expertise.When people cannot get cured there, they come here, says Ikran, pointing to a multi-specialty hospital just across the road. You see, there are a few families like ours who have the knowledge and expertise, the rest are all frauds. Our business runs on word of mouth.There is tough competition among the Pahalwans of Delhi. Take for example the Chaudhury Pahlwans of Mahipalpur, which is mini-hub of Pahalwan clinics -- or rather Chaudhury Pahalwan clinics. Mohammad Irshad, who runs one of them, warns you to be beware of copycatsbut it is not quite clear who is the original one.We are the original Chaudhury Pahalwans; the rest are all dodgy, says Irshad. A large signboard both outside and inside his shop says, People with sexual problems must also consult, but he is not willing to dwell on that line of his work. I make an oil for those types of problems, but the bone-setting is my specialization, so lets focus on that only for now, says bespectacled Irshad dressed in a white shirt and grey trousers. Behind him is a wooden shelf filled with dark-brown oils in designer glass bottles, boxes of powders, and bandage rolls. On the right is larger-than-life poster of a wrestler with a bandaged arm.I only deal with dislocation and muscle-related issues, I refer other cases to doctors, says Irshad, who has studied up to class nine. But unlike others, Irshad admits he is not a doctor of bones. My clients are mostly poor people who cannot afford doctors. They get cheap treatment here and I manage to eke out a living. It benefits both.While not every Pahalwan provides treatment for sexual diseases, all of them boast about their family legacy, and their secret formulation. But no one takes more pride in his family legacy and his secret salve than Shafiq Mannan. His father Hazi Abdul Mannan Pahalwan was one of the most famous bone-setters of the Walled City. Their clinic is at the end of a narrow, winding lane, but almost everyone has heard of Mannan sahib and they easily guide you to the place.Inside the clinic with tiled walls and green curtains, there are about five men and a young woman sitting on steel boxes that double up as benches. There is wooden plank where the Pahalwan sits. Next to it is an old, rusting iron box with bandages, a pair of scissors and a bowl of yellow pasteyes, the secret salve of the family. One has to take off shoes to get into the clinic.Satish Kumar Midda, better known as Hari Pahalwan, at his clinic in Old Delhi. (Vipin Kumar/HT PHOTO)Its 1 pm and Pahalwan has gone for his namaz. When he returns around 2 pm, everyone stands up and greets him. He prefers to talk to us at nearby shop run by his brother. Our family belongs to the Iran-Afghanistan border and we shifted to Delhi in the 1920s. We have practising bone-setting for the past 300 years, says Shafiq. The salve we use has huge healing properties and it has been passed down to us though generations.The short, stout man dressed in impeccable white, Shafiq, looks more like a businessman. Only my brothers and I know the ingredients of this salve, he says. Shafiq claims that 50 patients visit him every day from all over the country. Apart from patients, I get a lot of researchers and foreign journalists from countries such as Germany and England..Keen to show his knowledge, Shafiq talks about how bone and joint problems are increasing like never before in the country. These days, I get a lot of patients, including youngsters, with knee pain. Increased use of refined oil is responsible for it. We should take a decent amount of mustard oil or desi ghee every day, which is very necessary for healthy bones, he says. Ask him why his clinic is so popular, and pat comes the reply: Our expertise, and low-cost of treatment.But orthopedicians are not quite amused. Mention Pahalwan and Dr Atul Vaish, vice-president, Delhi Orthopedic Association, says. They are just quacks and do more harm than good. There are no ifs and buts about it. For them every bone-related problem is a case of dislocation. Their methods are unscientific and highly questionable, he says. You need to understand the anatomy of a person to carry out any manipulation. And for that you need formal training."

(Express photo: Tashi Tobgyal) While they have their own crop stubble burners, they allege we are sending the smog over to Lahore. (Express photo: Tashi Tobgyal)Who hasnt heard that old clich about how Indians and Pakistanis have so much in common  food, language, music. Drive down from Lahore to Amritsar and the transition is seamless  yes there are more women visible on our side, but the people look the same; even the fields are the same, just replace the mosques with the gurudwaras. They grow mustard, we grow mustard; they grow wheat, we grow wheat; they grow kinos, we grow kinos. We grow paddy, they also grow paddy. And this is where the clich is no longer cute.In October and November, we have smog, they have smog; they have accidents, we have accidents; they have respiratory diseases, we also have respiratory diseases. And while they have their own crop stubble burners, they allege we are sending the smog over to Lahore. Only a meteorologist would know if wind systems in the region for this time of the year take smoke from our side to the west, or east to Delhi, or in both directions.But there is no getting away from the fact that there are more paddy fires in Punjab and Haryana, than in Pakistans Punjab. Check the satellite images captured by NASA in the first 10 days of November, and the red thermal dots on the Indian side of the border are like a large splotch of blood, compared to the tiny dots here and there on the other side.Pakistani media reports have pointed to other sources of pollution in Pakistans Punjab province  their own incidents of crop burning, vehicular traffic, industry, and a coal-fired thermal plant in Sahiwal. But that does not quite explain the thickness of the smog in Lahore at this time of the year.Whatever the sources, the shared misery of a thick blanket of suspended particulate matter tinier than 2.5 microns over cities, towns and villages on both sides has rightly prompted the question if Pakistan and India shouldnt be talking urgently about how to tackle this.The Punjab government in Pakistan  or at least someone who administers its Twitter handle  took the lead on this and tweeted to Punjab chief Minister Amarinder Singh in India: Environmental hazards threaten our people and habitat. Let us act fast to counter it.So far, Amarinder has not responded to that tweet. Very simply, the two countries are still far from the point where they understand the gravity of the ecological and environmental challenges that they jointly face.There have been situations in the past in which advanced concerns over environment and climate have been advanced as a possible meeting ground for the two countries, with potential to erode all hostilities. But it has always remained in the realm of wishful thinking.The first time that the two countries contemplated co-operation on this front was in the opening decade of this century, when environmentalists and strategic thinkers from both sides bounced off a proposal to turn Siachen into a peace park, that would help to protect and conserve the glacier. Climate change is thought to be melting glaciers around the world, and the movement of men and material on the highest battlefield, which also happens to the only non-polar glacier in the world, can only be aggravating this.The idea for the peace park gained traction, and for a while, there was a real possibility that Siachen would become a symbol of co-operation between two hostile neighbours, for the sake of the greater good. But mutual distrust and suspicion ensured that the matter did not move forward. All that was left was to joke about how India and Pakistan had secretly decided that the Siachen glacier should melt away so that there was one less thing to fight over.In Kashmir, environment activists on either side of the Line of Control have voiced concern at the rapid environmental degradation and the threats this poses to water and food security of the people in the region. There is a felt need for the two sides to join hands in a co-operative effort to conserve the Indus water basin, and the Himalayan eco-system for cross-border good.Shakil A. Romshoo of Kashmir University, a climatologist and ecological engineer, has written extensively on the ecological threats India and Pakistan can no longer afford to ignore, especially in the Kashmir region.In a report for the think tank Centre for Dialogue and Reconciliation, Romshoo has detailed the many ecological challenges the two countries face, and the strategies to meet them. He wrote about climate change and its impact on water resources, including water scarcity, flooding, excessive dependence on ground water, the cumulative impact of hydropower projects in the upper Indus basin. He made a passionate call for data sharing and more co-operation between academica and the scientific communities on both sides for better management of resources and avoidance of environmental disasters, both man-made and natural.But joint action of the kind Romshoo and others have spoken about first demands an acknowledgement of the problem, and not just in speeches at the UN. The smog crisis in north India has highlighted that there is a reluctance to accept there is a problem and the causes for it, possibly for fear that this immediately implies accepting blame.The last few days have seen the chief ministers of Delhi, Haryana and Punjab squabble about who caused the bad air over Delhi, while people choke on the smoke, and get killed in zero visibility on the highways.Amarinders silence to the tweet sent out to him by the Pakistan Punjab government last Wednesday is thus not surprising. Our leaderships make pious statements about co-operating to resolve the real issues that face the people of the two countries, but in reality, are more comfortable wearing the armour of old hostilities.The irony is that challenges to food, water and clean air security are not as intractable as, for instance, those over territory. So while it is uncontestable that the two countries should be talking about how to deal with it and how to prevent it, the toxic smog from Lahore to Delhi is in fact quite an apt metaphor for all our enmities, and our combined failure to overcome our differences of the last seven decades, to the extent that it is clouding our vision of the future.Had Saadat Hasan Manto been alive, there would have been a short story by now on how India and Pakistan had agreed to exchange smog as a confidence-building measure.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

The wife. And then there was a little boy, may be just four years old. A grandson.The man driving the motorised van rickshaw was a strapping youth of about 35.Meet the Mondol family of Malancha Kanimari, Police Station Sandeshkhali in North 24 Parganas, 100 kms from Kolkata.Nitai Mondal, 65 or so, is a fisherman who has tuberculosis of the lung and multiple other ailments and has not been able to work for years.His wife, Gita, 56, is in despair. They had taken him to a premier government-run Kolkata hospital, RG Kar, back in August. His malady was diagnosed, he was given medicine and asked to come back a month later for a check up.Nitai Mondal did not have the wherewithal to do that; nor his four sons and two daughters. But the family could not just sit back and watch him die. So, when friends told him to take Nitai babu to a goonin, or witch doctor, seen as a local healer, at Deganga thakurbari, he jumped to the idea.Or rather cycled to it. Nitai's 35-year-old son Dilip is a van-rickshaw driver. On Tuesday morning at 4 am, he put his father on the back of his motor-driven cycle can along with his mother and young son and headed to their destination, a 50-km ride that he accomplished in a record six hours.The audience with the goonin was brief. Nitai was given jol-tel (water and oil) and an amulet to help him recover. And then the family set off back home. 6 hours, 50 kilometres, with a catheter bag hanging out of Nitai's private parts.""We don't have anymore money to go to Calcutta for treatment,"" said Gita. ""We are already about Rs1 lakh in debt from friends and family. To go to RG Kar Hospital in Kolkata, we will have to hire a taxi, which is impossible. Going in a bus with my husband in his condition is impossible.""""We want my father to live but there is just so much we can do. Only the goonin can help us now,"" said Dilip, the son, resignation in his voice. His son sat listening and staring at his father.The situation couldn't be allowed. So the NDTV team called the police, went to the Deganga police station, organised an ambulance with police help to drop the family to Malancha.Dilip refused to go. He did not want to leave his van rickshaw - his only source of an uncertain income - behind. So Nitai, Gita and the little boy got on the ambulance and left with two civic volunteers that the police were kind enough to send along to ensure they reached safely.Dana Majhi's wife was dead when he carried her body on his back from a hospital in Odisha towards to his home to perform the last rites last year.Besides abject poverty, he is completely removed from all government programs on containing tuberculosis, an issue that the Centre has promised to focus on as well as increase spending, resources and manpower.The state government is a party to the TB eradication programs. There should be a district TB officer to contact Nitai Mondal and ensure his recovery. But that has clearly not happened.The quack's jol-tel, amulet and his belief in them will help Nitai Mondal survive.But both the state and the Centre appear to have failed this frail old man."

It bought British flight search app Skyscanner for $1.7 billion last year.After the video of the abuse went viral, subsequent clips emerged showing irate parents trying to take revenge by forcing what appeared to be spicy mustard into the mouth of one of the accused female staff members, as police sought to hold them back.Another clip showed the same woman on her knees, bowing and apologising profusely for her ""errors"".Ctrip had outsourced daily operations of the daycare centre to Shanghai Women, part of a nationwide organisation that aims to protect women's rights in China.""It is hard to imagine that we are coding upstairs and you are abusing our babies downstairs,"" wrote one man on Weibo, China's equivalent of Twitter, claiming to be the father of a child that attended the daycare.He added that it had been very hard to get his child admitted to the daycare, which has a waiting list. About 100 children, all aged below three, attended the daycare centre in the past three months, Ctrip said."

It blamed Islamic State for using mustard gas.Russian UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said the inquiry could only be extended if fundamental flaws in its work were fixed. He said investigators had for the past two years rubber-stamped baseless accusations against Syria. Russia vetoed on Thursday and on Oct. 24 U.S.-drafted resolutions to renew the inquiry. The council also voted on a rival Russian-drafted resolution on Thursday to renew the inquiry, but it failed after only garnering four votes in favor.Russia is wasting our time, U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley told the council on Friday. Russias actions today and in recent weeks have been designed to delay, to distract and ultimately to defeat the effort to secure accountability for chemical weapons attacks in Syria, Haley said. After the meeting the council moved to closed-door discussions at the request of Swedens UN Ambassador Olof Skoog to ensure we are absolutely convinced we have exhausted every avenue, every effort before the mandate expired.While Russia agreed to the creation of the JIM, it has consistently questioned its findings and working methods. The April 4 sarin attack on Khan Sheikhoun that killed dozens of people prompted the United States to launch missiles on a Syrian air base. Syria agreed to destroy its chemical weapons in 2013 under a deal brokered by Russia and the United States.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

(File Photo) According to the JIM, the Syrian government used chlorine gas in at least two attacks in 2014 and 2015 and used the nerve agent sarin in an aerial attack on Khan Sheikhoun. (File Photo)Russias UN ambassador said Wednesday the expert body that has determined responsibility for chemical weapons attacks in Syria is dead  but Moscow is ready to discuss a new mechanism.Vassily Nebenzia told reporters after a closed Security Council discussion that the Joint Investigative Mechanism, or JIM, has discredited itself completely.But we are ready to talk about establishing a new mechanism that would replace the JIM and do the work in  a truly professional and objective way, he said.Russia vetoed two council resolutions last week to keep the JIM in operation, and this week it rejected a Swedish-Uruguayan draft resolution before it went to a vote to revive the joint investigative body of the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.At the heart of the dispute is Russias demand for major changes in the way the JIM operates, and the insistence of the US and about 10 other council members that its independence and operation remain unchanged.Russia has been highly critical of the JIMs findings that the Syrian government, its close ally, used chlorine gas in at least two attacks in 2014 and 2015 and used the nerve agent sarin in an aerial attack on Khan Sheikhoun last April 4 that killed about 100 people and affected about 200 others who survived.The JIM also accused the Islamic State extremist group of using mustard gas in 2015 and again in September 2016 in Um Hosh in Aleppo.Syria has denied any use of chemical weapons, while Russia has accused the JIM of using faulty methods to determine that President Bashar Assads government was to blame for the attacks, including not visiting Khan Sheikhoun. Nebenzia called the JIMs Khan Sheikhoun probe a fictitious investigation.US Ambassador Nikki Haley said after Nebenzias second veto Friday that Russia will not agree to any mechanism that might shine a spotlight on the use of chemical weapons by its ally, the Syrian regime.The OPCW, the international chemical weapons watchdog, has the job of determining whether chemical weapons were used in Syria, and it is currently assessing and investigating numerous allegations. But it is not mandated to determine who was responsible for chemical attacks, which is why the US and Russia jointly sponsored the resolution in 2015 that established the JIM.British Ambassador Matthew Rycroft told reporters Tuesday that even if we dont have a JIM, we require something whose job it is to look at those reports from the OPCW and to determine which of the parties in Syria is responsible for each use of chemical weapons.That is a crucial building block towards accountability, towards making sure that there is justice for the victims and for the survivors and for their families, he told reporters. And we are not going to give up, even if there is no more JIM.Rycroft said supporters of the JIM are looking into what other international justice mechanism could replace it.It will be possible to do something, he said, and we are determined to make sure that this gap is closed. We are not going to allow the JIM just to be killed off like this with nothing to replace it.Uruguays UN ambassador, Elbio Rosselli, said he expects a slow period now.There are mechanisms to look into these situations of chemical weapons everywhere, not only in Syria, he said. Well have to see what can be done. This requires a lot of doing.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

The owners of agricultural fields at present get irrigation waters for a continuous period of seven days, followed by a halt in supply for 17 days.New supply cycleThe Irrigation Departments water regulation committee has now decided to change the cycle and reduce the period of stopping water supply from 17 days to seven days till December 21.The situation will be reviewed in the next meeting on January 10, when the supply can be increased depending on the availability of water in Pong dam and Ranjit Sagar dam, which are the main sources of supply to the region.Suratgarh MLA and committee member Rajendra Singh Bhadu said the water supply could be increased and the gap reduced if it rains during the winter and inflow of water increases. The farmers, who gathered in large numbers at Gharsana and Suratgarh with the demand for more water for rabi crops, have asked for unhindered water supply till March next year.Addressing the rally of farmers from the canal-irrigated areas on Tuesday, Mr. Pilot had said that the farmers were not getting water, seeds and fertiliser at the right time.The [State] government is neglecting the interests of farmers and creating a situation in which they are compelled to commit suicide, he had said.The Congress leader had also alleged that the State government failed to ensure proper maintenance of distributaries of the Indira Gandhi Canal, which had caused water seepage and damaged the soil."

As Mumbai welcomes its mild cold season, I discovered my nihari fix at the new BKC restaurant  Taftoon. I ate this delicate Gosht Nihari (Rs. 489) for dinner, digging into the creamy gravy and enjoying the slow-cooked meat and bone marrow. This was mopped with taftan, an oven-baked flatbread made with flour, milk and eggs. It was soft, flaky and crisp on the edges, well worthy of lending its name to the restaurant.Taftoon, from the people  Pankaj Gupta and Abhir Dhawan  that gave us Indian restaurants Oye Kake and Caf Haqq Se, brings a different concept of food to the table. We wanted to capture food from the northern belt and came up with the idea of doing food from the Grand Trunk Road, extending from Kabul to eastern part of Bangladesh. This diverse cuisine covers Persian, Afghani, Pakistani, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Awadhi, Lucknowi and Bengali food. One of the things connected these places was the taftan. The oldest name for this bread was taftoon, hence the name of the restaurant, said chef Milan Gupta.In a bid to stay true to form, Gupta is using traditional pots and pans  wide brass langdis , degchis and Lucknowi lagans . He is sticking to authentic recipes and cooking styles. The meat thats the star of the mixed platter, Taftoon pe Harissa (Rs. 529) is beaten for hours with a mallet till it achieves the required texture. The chicken or mutton (and mushrooms for vegetarians) is then spiced with cardamom and saffron, slow-cooked, and drizzled with truffle oil. A scoop of this is served on a mini taftan, making for morsels of meaty deliciousness.The kitchen has a Robatayaki grill and tavas that send out delicate kebabs and tandooris. Theres the slow-cooked Galauti Kabab (Rs. 369), the creamy Malai Broccoli and Gobi (Rs. 309) and the crunchy Lipta Jheenga (Rs. 569)  barbecued prawns wrapped in chicken salami brushed with mustard. Its the Mirza Hasnu Tikka (Rs. 389) that steals the show. An old Lucknowi recipe, the dish has boneless chicken marinated in tandoori spices, cashew and onion and slow-cooked. The result is meat thats tender, creamy and smoky with just a hint of spice.The drinks have been made using ingredients commonly used in these cuisines. Dried spice adds a sweet smokiness to the Silk Route (Rs. 489), a whiskey drink with apricot brandy, plum juice, bitters, egg white and sour mix.

A dish from the streets of Srinagar, it consists of minced lamb kebabs tossed in a stock of red chillies, mixed with garlic, onion and garam masala, and finally topped with crushed walnut. Similarly the Bharwaan Kadhai (Rs. 389) is a rich but spicy dish of bhindi, brinjal, and chillies stuffed with grated onion, ginger, and khatta masala.The Railway Khosha Chops is a dry dish of succulent mutton coated with spicy, bhunao masala. This dish was invented during the British era especially for service on long journeys. Since they didnt have refrigeration, they would roast the masalas to create a drier dish and add tamarind and lime to preserve it, shared Gupta, who dropped by after every course to explain the origins of the dishes.Taftoon is a spacious place, all pale yellow lighting, wooden flooring and blue upholstery. An open kitchen gives a view into the making of the dishes, especially the breads. Theres the Zafrani Taftoon (Rs. 109) flavoured with saffron and cardamom; Baquerkhani (Rs. 99)  thick, poppy crusted and spiced leavened bread commonly found across Kashmir; Lal Naan (Rs. 139)  Amritsari bread laced with chilli oil giving it a fiery red colour, and sesame seeds, and the Raampuri Parathy Paratha (Rs. 99)  a tandoor baked layered bread with cashew.To end the meal, theres chewy and rich Shufta (Rs. 339), a Kashmiri compote of apricot, cashews, dried coconut, pistachios and sultanas toasted in ghee and stewed with whole spices in honey. It is served with a light mango ice cream that manages to cut through some of the richness. Theres a Bengali tasting platter, a Chena Plate (Rs. 349) with bite-sized chenna sweets, from gulab jamun, sandesh, rasmalai and kheer kodom.Although the meal was heavy on Indian food, Gupta promised other dishes in the future, including a Pakistani version of haleem, and Afghani mantou.Taftoon Bar and Kitchen, Naman Centre, opposite Dena Bank, Bandra Kurla Complex, 11 a.m. to 12.30 a.m.; 65656100/26530255"

The train runs on a 2-ft narrow-gauge line, laid between 1895 and 1909 during the rule of the Scindias, and is the longest such operational route in the world. Now run by North Central Railway, the Gwalior Light Railway remains a lifeline. Each of its seven coaches can seat 35, but every inch of space is taken up. Even the roof is full of passengers. There are no lights or toilets. The fans dont work. The fare is just Rs. 45, much lower than the Rs. 200 on private buses connecting the two cities.This is a bullock cart running on a railway track, says a roof-top traveller unmindful of the threat of a Rs. 500 fine or three-year imprisonment for the risky ride.The coaches start filling up from Gosipura, the second station from Gwalior. Till the penultimate stop at Datarda Kalan, the crowd seldom eases. During festive seasons, examinations or any other event that sees big crowds, the train shoulders a heavier burden. At times, passengers too lazy to go to a station place large stones on the tracks to slow down the train near their houses and board it, a testing time for the motorman as there is no support staff at hand in case of a derailment.For the sightseer, the travel offers an unbroken canvas of lush mustard fields and peacocks and occasional glimpses of foxes as the train chugs through the Chambal heartland. The narrow-gauge line will be phased out in five years as work to convert it into broad gauge gets under way. With this, the train will be reduced to a footnote in history."

It remained the capital of Gujarat until 1411, when Ahmedabad was founded by Ahmed Shah. Patan was ruled by the Chavda, Solanki and Vaghela dynasties. The city boasts of monuments like the Sahastraling lake and Ran ki Vav.Late K M Munshi set his famous trilogy of novels in the Patan court, 'Patan ni Prabhuta', 'Gujarat no Nath' and 'Rajadhiraj'. Prime Minister Narendra Modi , an admirer of Munshi, borrowed the concept of 'Gujarati pride' from him.Patan district has four seats  Siddhpur, Patan, Chanasma and Radhanpur. Siddhpur was with the Congress, but with Balwantsinh Rajput's defection, the district can be considered a BJP bastion.The Patan has 1,91,000 voters. There are 60,000 Thakors, 45,000 Patidars, 35,000 Dalits, 15,000 Muslims and smaller castes. In 2012, BJP's Ranchhod Desai defeated Congress's Gabhaji Thakor by 5,871 votes. ""I told our workers we have to work hard to go from the old capital to the new one, Gandhinagar,"" says Desai, BJP candidate. ""The government flood relief work here has been very good, so we are likely to benefit from that,"" Desai says.Not everyone buys Desai's version. Kirit Patel, Patan convenor of the Patidar Anamat Andolan Samiti (PAAS) and Congress candidate, says, ""Patidars want to teach the government a lesson."" Patel teaches at Patan Law College.Patan's economy is mainly agricultural. The main crops are carrots, castor and mustard. No major industry has come up and villagers have to migrate for work. Work on the Kansa-Bhiladi railway line has been halted for a while. If the line comes, it will give people some employment. Ex-CM Anandiben Patel represented Patan in 2002 and 2007. Now, the only minister from Patan is Dilip Thakor from Chanasma, the labour minister.SiddhpurSiddhpur is a holy site for Hindu rituals. It is called Matru-Gaya, the only place where 'shradhh' is performed for women after their death. The town, named after Solanki king Sidhraj Jaisinh, is the seat from which Balwantsinh Rajput entered the Vidhan Sabha as a Congress MLA. In August, Rajput, the Congress chief whip, defected to the BJP and stood as a candidate against his one-time mentor Ahmed Patel. The move seems to have backfired. Patel eked out a dramatic win which has given the Congress a shot in the arm. Siddhpur has 2,38,120 voters. According to Rajput, the largest groups are 55,000 Muslim voters, 60,000 Thakors, 25,000 Patidars and 28,000 Dalits. In 2012, Rajput had defeated BJP's Jaynarayan Vyas by 25,824 votes. Vyas won this seat for the BJP in 1990, 1995, 1998 and 2007.The Siddhpur nagarpalika and taluka panchayat, which were with the Congress, are controlled by the BJP since Rajput's defection. Despite Thakors making up the single largest caste in the constituency, neither party has ever fielded a Thakor candidate. Locals say this is due to the rivalry between Muslims and Thakors, the two largest groups. If a candidate from either group is put up, the other group will vote to defeat them. This year, Congress has broken this trend and nominated Chandansinh Thakor.Ashok Patel, a businessman in Siddhpur who was angling for the Congress ticket, said Siddhpur has been an important business town, so GST and notebandi are going to be big issues. Apart from that, Patidar anger towards the BJP in the rural areas will be a decisive factor.There have been dental, nursing and homeopathy colleges set up here and equipment worth crores has been procured, but there is hardly any staff. In 2007, the BJP pumped Narmada water into the Saraswati and promised to make the river flow through the year. Today, the river is still dry, though a grand ghat has been built.Ahmed Nandoliya, a Muslim leader who has unsuccessfully contested this seat twice, says ""Balwantsinh has betrayed us. He began with a fair price shop, now he has an industrial empire. Big businessmen often have to make compromises. Now, however, there is anger among the people.""Chanasmahe Chanasma constituency has 2,59,326 voters. Of these, 65,000 are Thakors, 44,000 Patidars, 12,000 Muslims, 12,000 Darbars and 17,000 Dalits. BJP's labour and employment minister Dilip Thakor won the seat in 2012 by 16,824 votes. BJP has won this seat in 2007 and 2012. Congress has won it in 2002 and 1985 while an independent candidate won it 1990. Interestingly, no candidate has won this seat twice but the BJP is looking to arrest that trend, as it has re-nominated Thakor. The Congress has fielded Raghu Desai.Radhanpurn Radhanpur, the battle promises to be a high-profile one as OBC leader Alpesh Thakor is in fray for the Congress. He will be pitted against Lavingji Thakor, a former Congressman and Shankersinh Vaghela loyalist. He had once vacated the Radhanpur seat for Vaghela for a violent by-election after Vaghela became the chief minister in mid-90s. The constituency has 2,58,949 voters, including 72,000 Thakors, 30,000 Chaudharis, 21,000 Muslims, 22,000 Dalits along with 35,000 Rabaris and Bharwads. In 2012, BJP's Nagarji Thakor defeated Congress's Bhavsinh Rathod by 3,834 votes.Bhavsinh recently left the Congress, in protest against the ticket going to Alpesh. BJP's minister of state for health, Shankar Chaudhary, won this seat in 2007, 2002 and 1998. Lavingji Thakor had won it in 1995 as an independent candidate. He had lost to Chaudhary in 2002 when contesting of a Congress ticket and in 1998, when contesting for Vaghela's Rashtriya Janta Party."

The district received 883.96 mm rainfall against the normal of 1199.8 mm which is 26.32 per cent less.As per reports, the Agriculture department has planned to grow different crops including cereal, pulses, oilseeds, vegetable, condiments and sugarcane over 1,22,720 hectares (ha) of land with a production target of 8,42,011 tonne in the district during the rabi season of 2017-2018. The production was 8,67,067 tonne in 1,22,720 ha during the last rabi season.Paddy will be cultivated in 51,300 ha with production target of 3, 22,677 tonne. Similarly, oilseeds including groundnut, sesame, mustard and sunflower will be cultivated over 13,620 ha with production target of about 19,650 tonne.Condiments including chili, garlic and coriander will be cultivated over 4,800 ha with a production target of 36,142 tonne. Besides, gram, mung, biri, field pea and other pulses will be cultivated over 22,340 ha with production target of about 12,557 tonne.This apart, cultivation of potato, sweet potato, onion and other vegetables has been planned over 29,490 ha with a target to produce 4,05,695 tonne this season. Last year, vegetables were cultivated over 28,890 ha with production of 3,96,995 tonne.On the other hand, area of sugarcane cultivation will be cut down this season compared to the last year. Sugarcane will be cultivated over 750 ha with production target of 42,750 tonne this season, Last year, the production was 76,950 tonne from 1350 ha.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Bargarh, Naba Kishore Das admitted that deficit rainfall during monsoon this year has impacted residual moisture status of soil in the district and said moisture stress will affect production of crops in the rabi season. We are pessimistic about achieving the production target of various crops including paddy, he added."

This comes a couple of days after police averted a mishap on the same route after being tipped off by railway officials.The Barkakana-Dehri-on-Sone passenger train was heading towards its destination when the train driver received a warning signal on the engine's monitor. Though drivers often receive such signals for minor obstructions on the tracks and are usually ignored, but this time he chose to slow down.He stopped the train after seeing a trackman waving a red flag a few metres away. The driver was told that the tracks were damaged half-a-kilometre away. Senior rail officials were immediately informed over walkie-talkie.""The fault was repaired within an hour. No long-distance trains were affected. But a major accident might have taken place had the driver ignored the warning or the trackman failed to perform his duties,"" said divisional officer Sanjay Kumar.Replying to another question, Kumar said track patrolling was mandatory whenever trains pass over it.The Barwadih - Barkakana section of Dhanbad rail division has also often been a soft target for rebel outfits. It crosses through dense forests and the tracks are not approachable by road in most places. This in turn often delays relief work after an accident.On Friday night, railway officials spotted items used for making an improvised explosive device (IED) underneath railway tracks between Chhipadohar and Barwadih stations. A CRPF team soon rushed to the spot and recovered cans, gelatin sticks, detonators and wires and foiled a Maoist bid to blow up the tracks.""But, Sunday's incident could not be linked to the Maoists. Yes, alert rail employees played commendable roles in both the cases,"" Kumar said.Tractors torchedThree tractors and an earthmover belonging to one Sanchu Mahto were torched at Gutjora village on the outskirts of Khunti in the small hours on Sunday. SP A.K. Sinha said victim's nephew Raj Kumar Kachchhap is one of the accused in this case. He ruled out involvement of any rebel outfit.Oil factory raidPolice on Sunday raided a mustard oil factory at Sahebganj and seized over 250 sealed containers of spurious oil.

The oval-shaped kilns produce smoke and fumes in huge quantity as well as high flames caused by melting of glass.Bharatpur-based Lupin Foundation has taken an initiative for modernisation of conventional kilns with the assistance of the Rural Technology Action Group (RuTAG) at Indian Institute of Technology, New Delhi.The modified kiln does not allow emission of fumes and toxic gases and its firebricks protect workers despite the kilns temperature touching as high as 1,400 degree Celsius.Poisonous elements emitted by the conventional kilns, on the other hand, directly enter into the bodies of labourers and cause diseases like asthma and tuberculosis, besides reducing their average age to less than 45 years.Less fuel consumptionLupin Foundation's Executive Director Sita Ram Gupta said on Monday that the modified kilns, with a high chimney for releasing fumes, would consume only 50% of the fuel used earlier and increase the bangle production twofold. With a comfortable seating arrangement for workers, their efficiency will also improve.An earlier initiative for fabrication of modern bangle kilns with white clay in collaboration with the State governments Science and Technology Department did not completely resolve the issue of emission of fumes. Scientists from RuTAG visited the district recently and suggested modifications in kilns after studying their operations.The fabrication of modified kilns is likely to be taken up in a dozen other villages in the nearby tehsils. Mr. Gupta said it would have a favourable impact on the region's environment and promote the green bangles business in Unch village worth Rs. 2 crore every year, besides giving employment to more workers."
5b2e848d9855b72640116098,Culture shocks and cucumbers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/651710/culture-shocks-cucumbers.html,2017-12-12,"Last month, the research group I joined recently, got together for the annual Christmas meal or 'Julefrokost' as they call it in Danish. As per tradition, the newest member of the group (me) was in-charge of the cooking. Of course, I decided to cook traditional South Indian food. I had already stirred their curiosity with the food I took for lunch.A month after eating raw vegetables and boiled potatoes everyday (yes, I am a vegetarian, and no, I don't consider fish as vegetarian unlike my Danish colleagues nor fried bacon a spice), I decided to wake up 30 minutes earlier than usual to prepare a tastebud tickling South Indian lunch. This led to another exercise. I had to explain to my colleagues what it is that I was eating every single day. ""Sambhar is a lentil-based vegetable curry cooked with a tamarind broth and a 'secret' spice mix,'' I told them after thinking all morning about it.I took rice and sorekai thovve or lauki dal one day. ""Bottle gourd and split lentils cooked with whole and powdered spices with a tempering of cumin seeds, mustard seeds, asafoetida, and curry leaves,'' I told them confidently. They looked at me baffled. Bottle gourd! Asafoetida! Curry leaves! It took me the rest of the lunch break to explain to them what these were. Thereafter, I was careful what I made for lunch. It is one thing making rava idli (from the ready-mix that I made sure I packed while leaving home) and another thing explaining it to someone who has never seen or tasted anything like it before.On the day of the Julefrokost, I expected them to be surprised by the okra, snake gourd, spluttering mustard seeds or at least when I mentioned that they had to eat with their right hand only. But the culture shockwaves swept through the room when I asked the person in-charge of the cucumbers why he wasn't milking it first. He was aghast ""Milk the cucumber?!"" There was silence in the room as everyone wondered if they had heard it right. In a matter-of-fact way, I repeated the question and then realised that this concept wasn't as universal as I thought. I then demonstrated it only to have a few people laughing uncontrollably, few others taking videos and the rest thinking that I was playing a prank.An Italian colleague entered just as I was defending the process of milking the cucumber to get rid of the bitterness and was trying to use some kind of logical reasoning for it. He casually added that in Italy, even zucchinis are 'milked' and I heaved a sigh of relief that it wasn't just me. He, too, was asked to demonstrate it and obviously he did it the same way you or I would. Then, two bowls were passed around - one with slices of a 'milked' cucumber and the other with an 'unmilked' one - and everyone was asked to identify which one was milked. But how can you tell the difference if the cucumbers are not bitter? I learned one thing that day - there are no bitter cucumbers in Denmark."

Picture by Anirban ChoudhuryAlipurduar: A project funded by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR) to boost collective farming systems for marginal and tenant cultivators by focusing on improved water management and irrigation practices has started yielding results.The project, started by the Uttar Bongo Krishi Vishwavidyalaya in 2014 and covering women among the marginal farmers, identified two villages in north Bengal - Dhaolaguri in Cooch Behar and Uttar Chakoakheti in Alipurduar district.Another highlight of the scheme was to minimise crop damage from elephants. The researchers suggested the cultivation of mustard, something the jumbos do not like, and now large numbers of farmers have taken to the crop.Each village is divided into three sites under the project to promote collective farming and mutual benefit-sharing. As part of the scheme, social mobilisation is also fostered through a series of community meets, group discussions and gender-awareness sessions held from time to time.An annual review meeting of the project was held on Tuesday in Alipurduar. Twenty delegates from four countries, including scientists from Uttar Bango Krishi Visya Vidyalaya, were present at the review.Addressing a news conference, Rupak Sarkar, a professor of the Krishi Vishwavidyalaya, said: ""The ACIAR provided (Australian) $82,000 for the five-year project. The project was started in 2014 and we identified these two villages (Dhaolaguri and Chakoakheti). In the eastern Gangetic plains (which covers Bengal), marginal and tenant farmers play a crucial role in ensuring food security and socio-economic uplift,"" Sarkar said.""A big challenge is to empower such marginal and tenant farmers by improving water-use efficiency. The project mainly helps farmers to produce crops during the dry season and teach them how to use water scientifically for cultivation,"" Sarkar added.According to the professor, the project also promotes ""protected cultivation"" and last year, farmers cultivated vegetables in polyhouse - enclosures made of transparent hardened polythene sheets - successfully and profitably. Crops under the project include summer paddy, wheat, maize, mustard, winter vegetables like potato, cabbage, cauliflower, garlic, chilli, and tomatoes.""We are creating awareness among villagers regarding the benefits they could enjoy from government schemes. We have given shallow tube-wells with pumpsets and polyhouses. More important, in three sites, we have set up pumpsets run by solar energy. They are cost-effective. Otherwise, the villagers have to carry diesel over 7km (from the nearest fuel outlet),"" Sarkar said.Mustard crops have helped too. ""Last year, we saw that elephants do not eat mustard and this year many farmers are cultivating it. At the same time, we will intimate forest officials (about crop damage) as elephant depredation is on the increase.""Erik Schmidj, the project in-charge from Australia, visited the area on Monday. ""We are initiating similar projects in Bihar (Madhubani district), Nepal and Bangladesh. We are satisfied with the progress of the project (in the two north Bengal areas) and we have another two years to go (for the five-year pl;an). Our plan is to motivate the villagers to get the benefits,"" Schmidj said.""Famers are innovative and it is a community-based project. Our plan is to spread the benefits from the two villages (Dhaolaguri and Chakoakheti) to other areas. Now the villagers can cultivate three to four crops in a year instead of only one in a year earlier,"" Schmidj added.Suren Chikbaraik, a farmer of Uttar Chakoakheti, said he and others "" earlier cultivated only rice"". ""But from last year, we are cultivating at least four crops in a year.""Chikbaraik added: Elephant depredation was a daily phenomena in the village and they used to damage crops. Last year, we cultivated mustard. We saw that the elephant damage wheat plants but do not touch the mustard in the adjacent field. Now we cultivate vegetables in polyhouse and even in winter also."""

The court had sent the executive, Vikas Sachdeva , to two days police custody a day after his arrest on Sunday.The actor, travelling with her mother in the business class of a Vistara flight on Saturday, was allegedly harassed by a frequent flyer when the cabin lights were dimmed in preparation for landing. The accused, seated right behind her on a window seat, was accused of placing his foot on her arm rest and rubbing a foot on her shoulder, back and neck.Mumbai police swung into action after the actor narrated her experience on social media. On Sunday, it registered a case of sexual harassment under Section 354 of Indian Penal Code and sexual assault under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, an offence defined under Section 7 and punishable under Section 8, with three to five years in jail.Around 4.20pm on Wednesday, after the police team produced the accused, barefoot and wearing a mustard T-shirt that read Silence is Luxurious, the prosecutor sought extension of his custody. Munna Inamdar, the prosector, arguing before a special Pocso woman Judge A D Deo in Dindoshi sessions court, said while police have recorded statements of five airline crew, those of other co-passengers statements were to be recorded before a magistrate. Inamdar requested that since the minors witness statement was to be recorded and further probe was required, his custody be extended by at least seven days. The court sent him to judicial custody, which means cops have no access to him. He was taken to Taloja jail.Harminder Anand, Sachdevas lawyer, submitted a bail plea. The court posted the matter for December 15. Anand had argued against extending police custody. He said the police firstly showed undue haste in arresting him, without issuing a mandatory notice first to allow him a chance to explain himself as is required when the offence is punishable with less than seven years jail.The statement by the DGCA also said he had slept He had told the cabin crew not to disturb him as he was returning to Mumbai the same night, after having flown to Delhi in the morning for a ceremony following his uncles death. He was tired and a sleeping person is a like a dead person. Where is the question of sexual intent? Anand argued.The prosecutor said the notice was served as well as sufficient time given before his arrest at 9.30pm on December 10. She said the girl was 17 years old and could sense the touch. Anand, though, said on December 11, that no such mention was made in court by the investigating officer. Anand showed the court photos from the CCTV footage of cops visiting his home to arrest him around 12.46pm on Sunday. He was not at home...His wife had to call him. He was arrested around 1pm but the police remand shows his arrest as 9.30pm. This is nothing but illegal detention."

Rabi sowing area this year is all set to go down, thereby affecting the wheat production. This may also put a spanner in the states ambition to bag yet another Krishi Karman award.Talking to TOI, minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen said the dams in Madhya Pradesh were not adequately filled even after monsoon this year. Irrigated land yields more than that which is not irrigated, Bisen said.Last year, wheat was sown on about 64 lakh hectares in Madhya Pradesh. This may go down to about 52 lakh hectares this year, Bisen said. Wheat may be replaced by gram, he added.The minister said that about 90 per cent of sowing has been done in the state. The farmers have almost finished sowing. Now, it all depends on the availability of water in the coming months. I have no hesitation in admitting that there is water scarcity because of monsoon deficit, he said adding that the government was monitoring the situation and will ensure the optimum use of available water.Rabi crops this year are likely to be affected the most in northern MPs Gwalior and Chambal divisions and the districts under the Rewa division owing to scanty rainfall in these regions.The government is promoting cultivation of wheat variety and pulses which require less water. Gram is being sown largely this time. Many farmers may sow chana instead of wheat this year, he added.In the Rabi season 2016, sowing was done on 118 lakh hectares in the state and by the time it finishes this year, it may touch about 105 lakh hectares, sources said.Many farmers in Gwalior and Rewa divisions have not gone ahead with sowing where wheat and mustard are the main crops.With 18 per cent of total wheat production of India, the state last year, had already moved ahead of Punjab and Haryana- leading the production of wheat. Gradually, the government wanted to take it up to 25 per cent in the coming years, government sources claimed."

This has caused anger in the community. It will not be surprising if a backlash for this manifests itself in the elections. Dilip Patel, the trusts secretary, says, The Patidar stir has sent out a message about the strength of Patidars and their organization at the national level. Till now, Babubhai Jasbhai Patel, Chimanbhai Patel, Keshubhai Patel and Anandiben Patel have been Patidar CMs. It is not possible to stay power if you ignore the Patels.Narayan Patel (79) is the Unjha MLA and former chairman of Unjha APMC. He was fielded again as a known quantity despite him being past the 75-year-mark, which the BJP cited as the reason for Anandibens stepping down. Narayan Patel has won five elections from 1995 onwards.Narayan Patel said, In this area, the trade of cumin, fennel, sesame, isabgol, ajwain, mustard is very big. There are one lakh sacks traded at the Unjha APMC every day. The Patidar factor will surely play a role as Patidars have always greatly influenced politics here, but I am looking for my sixth term and I will make it. The Unjha nagarpalika and taluka panchayat are both held by the Congress . When the local elections were held in 2015, the Patidar agitation was at its peak and the BJP made the unprecedented decision to not contest those elections on its symbol.The Congresss 2017 candidate is Asha Patel, who had lost to Narayan Patel in 2012 by 24,201 votes. At a campaign meeting in Vadnagar, Asha Patel said, This time we will put an end to Narayan Patels winning streak."

It has been approved by the US FDA. The study associated the consumption of canola oil in the diet with worsened memory, worsened learning ability and weight gain in mice which model Alzheimers disease  the most common form of dementia.However, the Canola Council of India (CCI), a committee of the Forum of Indian Food Importers (FIFI), said that the paper in the journal did not show any causal link to disease in humans. Consumers (should) disregard and pay no heed to this study, the predispositions and conclusions of which appear to be motivated by interests that compete with canola oil, a statement from CCI said.The Canola Council of Canada too refuted the claims of the Temple University study. (The) mouse model is a huge stretch from what you may see in humans, Peter Jones of University of Manitoba in Canada was quoted as saying by the council in the statement. It also quoted Richard Bazinet, Associate Professor at University of Torontos Department of Nutritional Science , who, it said, had reviewed the study. Animal models of Alzheimers lack predictive validity. We have a series of major phase III clinical trials with drugs in Alzheimers disease.

Not just because of the weather, and the festivity, and all the hope that comes with the New Year. I like these last days of the year also because it gives me an opportunity to go back and relive some of my happy food moments.Food-wise, 2017 was a happy year, indeed. Just a few days ago, I had Ghalibs tender tikkas, and kicked myself for not having gone there for long years. Ghalib Kabab Corner (Ph no: 9810786479) is situated opposite the Markazi mosque in Nizamuddin. The buffalo meat tikkas and seekh kababs are so deliciously juicy that the taste stays with you long after you have polished off a whole plate. In these days of high prices, when an egg costs more than a bun-omelette did a few years ago, the rates are incredibly reasonable, too. A plate of 16 tikkas is for Rs. 50, as is a plate of four, big-sized seekh kebabs.When it comes to fine dining, my happiest meal was at Guppy, a restaurant in the Lodhi Colony main market (Ph no: 011-24690005) which serves Japanese food. I went with some friends, who asked for its signature pork belly and tenderloin cube steaks  and both dishes were superb. The slow braised pork was soft, thick with fat, glazed with soy honey and redolent with the strong flavour of mustard. The pan-seared tenderloin cubes came coated in a mildly sweet sesame seed-flavoured sauce that gave it a delightful punch.Another memorable Asian meal was at a tiny restaurant called Little Saigon in Hauz Khas Market (Ph nos: 9650260408 and 9599450879). I loved the pancakes prepared with rice powder and beaten egg, served with lettuce leaves and smeared with a light fish sauce. I enjoyed the fresh summer roll with shrimp and meat and the fragrant yet light entres of sticky rice and braised pork and yellow chicken curry.During a visit to Kolkata this autumn, I went to an old favourite  called How Hua  which had reopened after remaining shut for many years. The place was known for its chimney soups, and its still the hot favourite in the reopened restaurant, on Prince Anwar Shah Road (Ph no: 0-7595999413). The soup came in a big vessel  large enough for a small family  and the broth was full of pieces of chicken, prawn, fish, vegetables, crab, tofu and vermicelli, as well and meat and fish balls. What I missed was their French pork chop. But I shall leave that for another day.One place that I hope to see a lot of in the coming year is a little caf called The Tea Lounge in Bikaner House in Pandara Road. The Tea Lounge serves an English high tea and an Indian high tea.The former comes with your choice of tea or coffee, three kinds of sandwiches (chicken, mint and cheese), walnut tart, lemon tart, mushroom khari, almond cookies and ginger biscuits, while the latter comprises kachoris and samosas.Discerning palateRun by Old World Hospitality, it offers savouries such as keema samosas, chicken patties and cheese and chilli patties. The keema samosa I ate was spilling over with the keema it had been stuffed with. On the sandwich menu are chicken sandwiches, ham and cheese roll, coleslaw roll, cheese and mint sandwiches.For fish loversIf you enjoy your fish, then you should not miss Sana-di-ge (Ph nos: 011-40507777 and 7042794546) in the Malcha Marg market. Beautifully done up, the restaurant offers various kinds of coastal cuisines  and I had a superb tawa fried seer fish, chicken ghee roast, where chicken chunks marinated with freshly ground spices and garlic had been roasted in ghee. I enjoyed the mamsa pepper fry, boneless lamb cooked with oodles of pepper and curry leaves, and ended the meal with a lovely and creamy sweet dish called eleneer payasum  sweetened coconut cream with the pulp of tender coconut.Another little place that gave me a lot of joy this year was Anmol, known far and wide for its butter chicken. This is not the regular butter chicken that you get in restaurants, but a juicy tandoori chicken in hot, melted butter. The chicken is grilled on a coal fire and then tossed with chillies, dried mango powder, chaat masala and chutney. Butter is melted till it is golden yellow, and then poured over the chicken.It was, as you can see, a good year. And now heres to 2018. Let there be good food, and no ones stomach ever empty."
