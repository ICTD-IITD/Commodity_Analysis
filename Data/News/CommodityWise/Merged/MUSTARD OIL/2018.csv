5b15f3c69855b7624638905f,"From birds to bees, Bharatpur ushering in a ‘sweet revolution’",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/jaipur/from-birds-to-bees-bharatpur-ushering-in-a-sweet-revolution/articleshow/62321958.cms,2018-01-01,"JAIPUR: Known for birds, Bharatpur is now buzzing with bees as honey-making has taken wing in a big way. From 28 metric tonnes of honey in 1997-98, Rajasthan today accounts for 4,100 metric tonnes, thanks to the contribution of Bharatpur that alone produces close to 1,800 tonnes.While states like Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh still remain the strong traditional geographies contributing much of the 80,000 metric tonne that India produces annually, the vast expanses of mustard fields in Bharatpur are now drawing large colonies of the stripped honey-makers making it the number one district in the country in terms of quantity of production.A state that is still slotted by Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIV) as having least potential for apiculture, the sweet revolution was not without an intervention. In the early 1990s, Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation ( LHWRF ) sensed an opportunity in the pasturage of Bharatpur.We conducted surveys, which indicated good possibilities for beekeeping. In 1992-93, two entrepreneurs of village Aghapur and one of our employees were sent to Hissar Agriculture University for practical training. When they came back, they were given 20 boxes of bee colonies which were stationed at Aghapur in the close vicinity of Keoladeo National Park (KNP). The experiment failed due to an attack of wild bees of KNP over the domesticated bees, recalls Sita Ram Gupta , executive director of LHWRF.But the failure led to more experiments taking assistance from and working with Central Bee Research & Training Institute in Pune, KVIC and other agencies. The activities gained momentum again. SIDBI and mirco-finance institutions were roped in to provide finance. Wherever difficulties arose, Lupin chipped in with funding.Experimenting constantly, documenting and developing scientific practices, and empowering entrepreneurship skills has been the cornerstone of LHWRFs efforts for promoting beekeeping activity in the district. Providing training, exposure visits and access to finance were also key components of our strategy to popularize the activity, added Gupta.The success in Bharatpur intrigued chief minister Vasundhara Raje . In 2007, she appointed LHWRF as a nodal agency for a honey cluster development project to expand and organize the activity in the eastern districts of Rajasthan covering Hadauti region and Kota division. Keen to promote the low-cost and high returns economic activity, National Bee Board made LHWRF its member.Economically, bee-keeping is highly rewarding. A colony of 50 boxes is the ideal size for a person to start the activity which costs around Rs 3 lakh. The government provides subsidies up to 40%. But in the first year of the activity, the entrepreneur earns about Rs 2.40 lakh from selling honey. Raw honey is sold at Rs 100-125 per kg. Each box produces about 50 kg honey annually. So the entrepreneur gets back his entire investment in the first year of operation, said Bhim Singh , additional chief project coordinator, Lupin, Bharatpur.Gupta said LHWRF has supported about 3,000 bee-keeping entrepreneurs in Bharatpur who are mostly jobless youth and marginal farmers and the foundation has set a target to create 15,000 bee-keeping entrepreneurs. With activities rising and volume increasing, a couple of entrepreneurs have also set up a honey refining unit in Bharatpur.About 8,000 metric tonnes are processed annually in the unit and a large chunk of it is exported. People from neighbouring states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Bihar bring their raw honey to process here, added Gupta.Initially, farmers were apprehensive about bees damaging crops. But that notion changed completely when they realized that bees actually help the pollination of crops and increase the yield of oilseeds, pulses, fruits, etc by at least 15%. It is an important agriinput. Beekeeping deserves to be recognized as an organic technology in raising farm production, said Gupta said."

According to the agriculture department, against the target of 26 lakh hectares, mustard has been sown only on 20.49 lakh hectares.An agriculture department official, on the condition of anonymity, said that there are three reasons for sowing less mustard this season. First, the state did not receive rain in September and October and there was no moisture in the soil, so farmers could not sow mustard. Second, the temperature was high in October which the affected sowing and third, the rate of mustard in the market was not attractive.Last year, the minimum support price for mustard was Rs 3,700 per quintal and the market rate was between Rs 3,000 and Rs 3,300 per quintal. In previous years, mustard was being purchased for Rs 3,800-4,500 per quintal. Farmers lost interest in mustard as it was fetching poor prices in the market.The official also said that the average production of mustard has been 1.4 tonne per hectare. This rabi season, the production will be around 10 lakh tonne short.Less sowing will also affect the availability of edible oil in the country. India is the third largest producer of mustard after Canada and China. In India, Rajasthan stands in the first position producing about 48% of the countrys mustard.Its true that mustard has been sown on 20.49 lakh hectares, which means there is a shortfall of 5.50 lakh hectares, said agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini.At present, the department is focusing on meeting the challenges such as moisture, ground frost and pest management. As of now the condition of the crop is good. However, during January and February, the mustard crop needs moisture. Hopefully, it rains during these two months. In January and February, there is also the problem of ground frost. The best minimum temperature for mustard is 4-10 degrees and if the temperature dips below 4 degree Celsius crop gets damaged, Saini said.The minister said that from February onwards there is the problem of aphid attack, also known as plant lice. The department is alert and farmers have been advised about what to use to avoid the attack."

Photo: BloombergPlanting of wheat, the main winter crop, is lower by about 1.4 million hectares or 4.8% compared to last year, showed data released by the agriculture ministry on Friday.According to the ministry, about 28.3 million hectares have been planted under wheat so far compared to 29.7 million hectares sown by this time last year.Usually about 30.2 million hectares are planted with wheat and a lower area this year is on account of Madhya Pradesh, where close to a million hectares has not seen wheat being sown.However, the data shows that overall an area of 58.6 million hectares have been planted under different winter or Rabi crops, only marginally lower than last years 58.8 million hectares. While planting of pulses is about 8% higher year-on-year (2017-18 over 2016-17), that of oilseeds is 5% lower than last year.Normally 62 million hectares are sown during the rabi season. Planting begins by October and the crops are harvested March onwards.The data showed that so far 15.5 million hectares have been planted under different pulses, higher than the five-year average area of 13.9 million hectares. Area under chickpea or gram, the main winter pulse, is 13% higher year-on-year.However, area under oilseeds is lower this year at 7.6 million hectares, compared to 8 million hectares planted by this time last year. This is primarily due to lower planting of mustard in Rajasthan--by about 0.7 million hectares--compared to last year.A robust winter crop is crucial to revive Indias plummeting agriculture growth. Following an unevenly spread monsoon last year, Indias rain-fed kharif harvest of foodgrains fell by 2.8% in 2017-18, compared to the year before. First advance estimates of GDP released by the government on Friday estimated agriculture growth rate at 2.1% in 2017-18, compared to 4.9% in 2016-17."

5b1616619855b762ecece3e0,In search of the Kipling connection,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/in-search-of-the-kipling-connection/article22389367.ece,2018-01-07,"In the days before liberalisation, if you lived in or near Bombay, as the city was called then, Crawford Market was where you would find people from the new upwardly mobile middle class. Continental cuisine was becoming popular back then and this was where Colmans mustard and exotic vegetables and sauces could be found. I remember making many trips to Crawford Market in the 1990s. I would always hire a porter as I would end up buying much more than I anticipated. The highlight of my visits was to sit in Badshahs to enjoy their kulfi and falooda.Crawford Market was later renamed as Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Mandai, after the great Marathi reformer and educationist. But since I am talking of a time when it was still called Crawford Market, I will stick to that name in this column.The making of a marketCrawford Market was named after Arthur Crawford, the first Municipal Commissioner of Bombay, and was designed by William Emerson, a British architect. It was completed and opened to the public in 1869.It was only on a rather recent visit to Mumbai that I learnt from R. Venkatesh, a heritage enthusiast and member of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage, that a quaint Victorian-age fountain lies in Crawford Market which has a connection to Rudyard Kipling, one of Indias most beloved writers.Rudyard Kipling was born in the Deans house in Sir JJ School of Art, Mumbai, to Alice and John Lockwood Kipling. The fountain, which Venkatesh spoke of, was constructed in 1874 in what was an open courtyard for merchants to gather together and chat. Emerson designed the market, and Lockwood Kipling, an art teacher, illustrator and curator, designed all the friezes in the market and the fountain. Lockwood Kipling is also famous for his work on the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, among other projects.I entered Crawford Market from the main entrance which has a beautiful buff and brown arch. The inscription on it read: The Arthur Crawford Municipal Market, erected 1868 on the initiative of Arthur Travers Crawford, CMG, ICS, Municipal Commissioner of the city of Bombay, 1865-1871.In February last year, when I visited it, the market was under repair and areas of it were covered. I enquired about the fountain and was told that I was in the wrong place. What you really want to see is the Flora Fountain, people told me. But having spoken to Venkatesh, I knew I was in the right place and kept asking around. Finally, a shopkeeper told me that the fountain I was looking for was near the bird market.Once I came out into what used to be the open courtyard and saw the Kipling fountain, I wasnt surprised that not many knew about it. The fountain was hidden beneath piles of fruit boxes in front of which sat fruit vendors who characterise the market. The famous friezes of the river goddesses and rural life, which were designed by Lockwood Kipling, were covered by pineapples, oranges and grapes. The top of the fountain was damaged as galvanised iron sheets had been added as a roofing.Two fruit vendors seemed to be in control there. When I said I wanted to take photographs of the fountain, they were cooperative and removed a few of their boxes. But I realised that there was not much to capture  what was once a piece of art looked too neglected and shabby to be photographed.The Kipling fountain was inspired by a design that the English architect, William Burges, had drawn for the Sabrina Fountain in Gloucester in the U.K., which was never executed.I kept turning my neck to admire the once-beautiful friezes of the river goddesses, birds, animals, and gargoyles. It is a little hard to see them unless you seek them out and sweet talk the vendors into removing their belongings. Such is the state of our heritage.A forgotten fountainA postcard that I later found on the Internet that was dated November 27, 1874 had a sketch of the fountain with water spouting from it. A few Indians sat near it, with pots of water on their heads. Sadly today, there is no garden. The courtyard is covered with galvanised iron sheets. The market is loud with the sound of animals, birds, and vendors, and the fountain lies in the middle forgotten. The water, which once flowed from it, dried up long back. Venkatesh had described to me an elegant blending of artistic motifs of rivers, flora and fauna on a Gothic structure, all of which had fired my imagination. To see this intricate work in this sorry state was a pity."

It was promised that central and state government schemes will be implemented in the village.Nearly one and a half years after the adoption, district officials reached the village for the first time to prepare a progress report at a co-ordination committee meeting held on Saturday.A state-level celebration of the 69th Republic Day will be held at Lohagarh stadium in Bharatpur, and governor Kalyan Singh will stay here for two days. The officials went to Barso, anticipating that the governor might visit the village, located on Jaipur-Agra highway and nearly 5km away from the district headquarters.Additional district magistrate OP Jain held the committee meeting at the government Adarsh middle school in Barso. Additional superintendent of police (rural) Dharmendra Singh, Bharatpur sub-divisional magistrate Pushkar Mittal and officials from all departments participated in the meeting.A meeting was held to ensure development at the smart village. We have directed officials to provide all facilities to the village, said OP Jain.The villagers have a different take. Lakhmi Chand, a villager, said, After the village was adopted, officials held a meeting for the first time over development.The Adarsh middle school has no furniture for students. The RO plant has been closed for the last three months and students bring water from their houses, the villagers said.With 441 households, the village under Bachhamadi panchayat has 2034 residents; it records 79.94% literacy rate.We do not get water supply; we have been using saline groundwater for the past five years, said Tej Singh, a villager. Sher Singh said, Villagers are forced to buy water with Rs 300 for a tanker. Each household needs to pay for three water tankers in a month. Hari Singh said, The district administration has constructed an overhead water tank to supply Chambal water from Mallah, but water does not come.All 33 gram panchayats under Sewar panchayat samiti have been declared open defecation free, but villagers alleged that half of the households have not got payments for toilets under the Swachch Bharat Abhiyan.Hari Singh said, Nearly 200 households have been waiting for payments for toilets constructed under SBM. Tej Singh said, Villagers go to agriculture fields for open defecation as there is no enough water to use toilets.Around 400 saplings were planted on pasture land and a worker was deployed to take care of the plants. Villagers said the plants were not to be seen as the land was illegally possessed to grow mustard crops.Villagers alleged that they get power for only five to six hours a day. Farmers are worried as they find it difficult to irrigate rabi crops due to power cuts.Villagers demand construction of a boundary wall around a crematorium built by Lupin Human Welfare and Research Foundation at Rs 2.31 lakh."

Then an ink-dipped brush in red, orange, mustard yellow and blue is touched to the water. The result is beautiful imagery of traditional with modern art toned in a series of colourful textile effects. New Delhi-based artist Deepshika has used this technique to create art which has been exhibited at the ongoing exhibition at M R Butler Business Centre, Panampilly Nagar.Brought up in a family of art lovers and painters, Deepshika found herself always dabbling with colours. I was introduced to colours at the age of two as my mother and her two sisters are artists. I have no formal training in art. I initially learnt art from my mother Renu D Singh, she said.Deepshika is an artist who enjoys minimalistic art. The medium she usually works with is acrylic on canvas. One of the highlights of her work is that her art revolves around the effect of textiles. My art Emrald is based on shibori which is the tie and dye effect on saris. Jamuni reflects a kanjivaram sari.Other themes that the artist explores is an altogether different style of art which is called mother of pearl. The art reflects the name of the series on the canvas. She has continued to work with mother of pearl and textiles for a while along with two more different styles. I intend to carry on producing the same style till I am completely associated with them, she says.Though she has worked on different mediums, she is presently working on acrylic. She has exhibited her work in different parts of the country but her first solo exhibition was held at Gallery G in Bangalore in October, 2016. This is the second solo exhibition she is conducting. My art is sold via word of mouth. I am a very private person.I am working on a different kind of art work now which is unlike those that have been exhibited so far, said Deepshika.Talking about the space that artists get, she opined there are artists whose works speak volumes and who have been welcomed in the art world, in peoples homes and on different platforms. There are others who have made a way for themselves with sheer hard work. However, I feel that the real art and hard work is in the villages. This art is dying slowly, said the artist. The exhibition will continue till January 12."

What heightens the terror in these parts is that forest officials are clueless about the identity of the wild animal targeting humans.It is the third killing of a child in the same range in three days. This time, only the feet of the child were left behind. The distraught parents of the 10-year-old took the remains home to cremate. The third killing triggered panic in villages on the forest fringes. Foresters are also worried because the range has good prey base so they cant understand why a tiger or leopard would target kids.Local administration and forest officials have launched a frantic hunt for the animal, pressing around 200 officials in combing operations, besides setting up 50 camera traps and six trap cages in the area.The fresh killing was in Chhindis Jhirpani Dhana area on Tuesday evening where 10-year-old Savnasa Invati was with his mother, who was working in their mustard farm. Around 6pm, the mother returned home, believing Sanvasa had gone ahead. The alarm was sounded when the family realized the boy was missing. The predator had attacked so swiftly that the mother didnt have an inkling though she was just a few feet away.The pitiful remains were found in a culvert inside the forest on Wednesday morning. The mother identified the boy from his feet.In the previous two cases, villagers recovered the bodies intact, but this time the animal had consumed its kill. Only the legs were left. Its very tragic. We have been warning villagers to stay inside after dusk, U K Subuddhi, CCF Chhindwara told TOI.He said there was a distance of 15km between the first killing (Mohlimata) and the third. And the distance between first and second killings (Bijoripathar) was a mere 5km, he said adding the same animal is suspected to be targeting children.We are not sure if the children are being killed by a leopard or tiger. Experts have joined us from two national parks and we are trying to capture the animal, said the officer. Chhindi range is about 60km from the district headquarters. To its west is Satpura Tiger Reserve while Pench National Park is on the east.The forest department has announced a compensation of Rs 4 lakh each to the families of all three children. The first victim was six-year-old Kalpana. She was killed while collecting firewood in the forest with her mother and sister. Her body was recovered around 100m from where she was attacked. Later that evening, a 10-year-old boy, Harses Tekam, was killed when he was sitting outside his house. His body was found in the bushes at a distance."

Surrounded by agricultural fields, the water levels fluctuate every season, making the wet meadows home to a variety of fish, frogs, turtles, and other insects and aquatic life forms. Most importantly, however, the wetland is a rich oasis for avian lifeattracting and hosting thousands of migratory guests from as far as Europe and Siberia. Migratory eagles, harriers, cranes, songbirds, ducks and geese, waders like sandpipers, godwits, stints, snipes and plovers mingle with local birds like herons, storks, egrets, flamingos, ibises and spoonbills.Birds of different sizes, colours and plumes in the Basai wetland have been drawing birdwatchers from the Capital and its surrounding areas for almost two decades. Some rare birds like the water rail, spotted crake, grey-headed lapwing, red-throated pipit, water pipit, bimaculated lark and smoky warbler make this place their home while escaping the harsh season of their native land.Throughout the year, especially on weekend mornings, you can spot people waiting patiently for a glimpse of rare species, or just gazing at the avian biodiversity.The Basai wetland was discovered as a birdwatching destination in 2001 when ornithologist and author Bill Harvey made a pit stop by the Basai railway track, en route to the Sultanpur National Park for a morning round of birdwatching. Harveys tale of this excellent damp and flooded grassland full of bar-headed geese, ibises, spoonbills, herons, egrets, lots of ducks and waders, eagles spread and bands of birders soon began landing at this spot. This nondescript village with rice and mustard fields transformed into a rich birding spot and a green getaway for fatigued city dwellers. A 2001 field report of the Delhi Bird Club mentions that the Basai wetland covered an area bigger than Sultanpur jheel, a landmark bird sanctuary a few kilometres further down the Gurugram-Sultanpur road.In 2004, the Basai wetland was marked as an Important Bird Area by Birdlife International, a global conservation non-governmental organization, giving it the status of important habitat for conservation of bird population.Current statistics record 284 bird species in the wetland (which is equal to around 23% of bird species recorded in India and 60% of species seen in the National Capital Region), according to Ebird.org.State authorities, however, seem to be oblivious to the importance of the Basai wetland. In May, the municipal corporation of Gurugram started the construction of a waste-processing plant on these wetlands. This was met with outrage from bird lovers. The move was seen as a death knell for the birding ecosystem, especially given that the Dadri wetland in Greater Noida, near Delhi, had already been taken over for the development of townships.Even the Supreme Court questioned the Central government about whether if it was at all serious in conserving wetland ecosystems across the country.Wetlands are primarily a mix of government, private and community land, so their status when it comes to protection and preservation is rarely clear. In the case of Basai, the village has already seen the ugly side of developmentthe rural charm of paddy, wheat, millet and mustard fields replaced by intimidating housing plots, water bodies reduced by drainage, the Dwarka Expressway and a flyover over the railway crossing.Die-hard birders approached the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in June to salvage what little is left of the watershed. Calling it short-sightedness of the municipal corporation, the petition says, though we are not against the recycling plant, its sad that the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram has chosen a wetland for this project. The MCG claims that it is just a piece of barren land where few birds occasionally come and there would be no loss of flora or fauna by setting up the recycling plant there. The NGT heard the case on 10 January and lifted the stay on construction.It is common knowledge that urbanization is taking a toll on wetlands. But why are they so vulnerable? To some, a wetland is still a wet damp place, a breeding ground for mosquitoes and other insects, a veritable swamp for vector-borne diseases.Further, as demand for land takes precedence, all scientific knowledge, the goods and services provided by wetland ecosystems, is brushed aside. Its estimated that India has already lost a third of its wetlands, and otherslike Basaiare under severe stress.Experts say the new set of Wetlands (Conservation and Management) Rules, notified in September, are a watered-down version of the 2010 rules. The 2017 rules were introduced after the Supreme Court reprimanded the Central government for not doing enough to protect or conserve ecologically important wetlands.A part of the blame also goes to scientists for failure to disseminate information on the specificity of wetland ecology. In the case of Basai, the birdwatchers could have drawn public and policy attention to the wetland when it was declared an important bird area in 2004. In 2012, when the master plan for development around Basai was drawn up by the government, these same birders could have intervened to protect the area from aggressive expansion.Today, the rain- and sewage-fed Basai wetland is still a magnet for numerous bird species. Construction work on the waste plant has been stopped since July, when the NGTs stay order was passed.A few hours of birding can still notch up to 70-100 species. On a winter morning, the cackle of migratory greylag goose is a reminder of the transience of the wetland, where construction will have commenced before the next migratory season. The fog blinds us as we trudge through the narrow path by the wetland; the birdsong boosts our morale.Where will Delhi birders go now that this too is lost?Out In The Wild is a column on the good, bad and ugly of nature conservation."

Well, in that case you may want to head to Park Hyatt for their Goan Food Festival which begins from today. If you are thinking whats so special about this food promotion then think about the blend of Portuguese and Konkani flavours. Chef Tanuja from Park Hyatt, Goa presented an eclectic feast of Goan delights that are available both for lunch and dinner for a price of `1,500+ taxes.The reason why most of the dishes by Tanuja seemed much like the way you prepare at home is that she learned the recipes from her mother. Thats how Goan Dal Fry prepared with coconut, red lentils, onions, curry leaves and mustard seeds which tasted really well with steamed rice and succulent pieces of Mutton Vindaloo cooked in a red tangy curry.The Chicken Cafreal won our hearts with its green marination of coriander and mint cooked with other spices. The condiments had seeped into the chicken pieces making them succulent-juicy. We recommend Caldo Verde: the potato soup with baby spinach in which the addition of green olives is very Portuguese. Cap your meal with Mangane: lentil and sago pudding prepared in milk with jaggery and coconut. The festival is on at The Dining Room till January 21."

This is contrary to the retail price index-based inflation, which touched a 17-month high of 5.21 per cent in December, up from 4.88 per cent in the previous month.While vegetable prices continued to soar 56.46 per cent, food inflation eased to 4.72 per cent in December against 6.06 per cent in November on the back of fall in prices of cereals and potatoes. Overall, prices of primary articles eased to 3.86 per cent in December from 5.28 per cent in November.Fuel and power inflation rose to 9.16 per cent in December, up from 8.82 per cent in the previous month suggesting that the industry may likely witness a compression in margins.The dip in the inflation for primary food articles in the WPI for December 2017 may signal some correction in the CPI inflation for food items in the ongoing month, said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at ICRA.Wholesale inflation of manufactured products remained at the same level as before (2.6 percent). The category has a weight of 64.23 per cent in the index.However, the fact that metals rose by 10.03 per and semi-finished steel went up by 6.19 per cent in December continue to remain a matter of concern for India Inc.Lowering of the repo rate in the upcoming monetary policy is critical to boosting investments and building the growth momentum at this juncture, said Ficci president Rashesh Shah.Despite the sharp rise in crude oil prices in the current month, we expect WPI inflation to print in the range of 3.2 per cent to 3.6 per cent in Q4 of FY18, benefiting from the base effect. Therefore, the wedge between the CPI and WPI inflation is expected to remain wide in the ongoing quarter, said Nayar.Despite industry demanding a rate cut, experts feel that going forward, CPI inflation will be crucial in assessing the next move of RBI. Upward pressure on price could ensue in case rabi production falls short, especially for wheat and mustard and the nearly three per cent decline in kharif crop output. In addition, the sustained rise in global commodity prices could further aggravate prices, said Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, CARE Ratings."
5aeb04cb9855b73f522c5f26,The Beatles’ magical mystery tour of India,http://www.livemint.com/Leisure/ShOyoU6g0Rs5TPKxfOgwxK/The-Beatles-magical-mystery-tour-of-India.html,2018-01-19,"The narrow path leading to the main hall of the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi Ashramor the Chaurasi Kutia Ashram as the locals refer to itin Rishikesh is slippery even when not wet. What was once a paved thoroughfare, used by hundreds of disciples of the globe-trotting Indian ascetic, is today covered with moss that requires visitors to mind every step.Even as the impressive architecture of the buildings along the main walkway is hidden with foliage of plants splitting through the concrete, the giant hall inside, where the Maharishi gave his sermons, is a burst of colour. The hall is airy and spacious with a large platform at one end. Graffiti in all sizes adorn the walls, lending a colourful character to what fans have christened the Beatles Cathedral. While not much signage or information is provided at the ashram, the graffiti has been painted over the years by those who managed to sneak in with cans of spray paint and their love and loyalty for the British band from the small city of Liverpool who won over the world.A black and white hand-painted portrait of the Maharishi dominates the centre of the platform; from here he would address his disciples. Alongside the small flight of three steps leading to the platform, a line is scribbled in red ink: With every mistake we must surely be learning. It is a throwback to While My Guitar Gently Weeps, a song that Beatle George Harrison had written and composed in 1968 as a comment on the tensions and discord gripping the rock band. The scribbled line could well encapsulate a 50-year-old tale.Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and participants of a meditation course pose for a photograph, in February 1968. Photo: Paul SaltzmanA passage to IndiaOn a crispy cool wintry afternoon in February 1968, film-maker and photographer Paul Saltzman sat near John Lennon and Paul McCartney as The Beatles practised two lines they had just composed of a song. Saltzman happened to be present at the ashram in Rishikesh during the bands visit.McCartney, in a white kurta-pyjama, looked at ease in the surroundings. Drummer Ringo Starr hung around in a Nehru jacket and provided rhythm by snapping his fingers while Lennon and McCartney sang and strummed on Martin D-28 acoustic guitars. Sitting near them, Saltzmans eyes followed McCartneys reading from a piece of paper on which was scribbled the refrain: Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, life goes on, brah, La la, how the life goes on.McCartney told me that those were the only two lines they had so far. The two of them kept singing the chorus and played around with it. But what shone through was the joy infused in their music at that moment, says Saltzman over the phone from Ontario, Canada. John and Paul were working as equals and the four of them (including George Harrison) were like a family of brothers out there in Rishikesh when I met them.Fifty years on, the Rishikesh stint of the Fab Four, as The Beatles were often referred to, stands apart as a cultural signpost, as it marked the entry of Indian music and spirituality in Western mainstream pop culture. The seven-week-long stay at the ashram resulted in The Beatles composing the bulk of the songs for their ninth studio album, The Beatles (more famous as White Album); a phase when, as Lennon described in The Beatles Anthology (2000), he wrote some of his best songs. Over 30 songs were written during their ashram stay, including Back In The USSR, Dear Prudence, Ob-la-di, Ob-la-da, The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill, While My Guitar Gently Weeps and Im So Tired. The quiet of the ashram, the daily meditation, healthy lifestyle and vegetarian food allowed their creativity to blossom and it was possibly the most artistic phase of their career, says Saltzman.US-based music critic and author of The Unreleased Beatles: Music And Film (2006) Richie Unterberger considers the Rishikesh trip to be very important to the career of The Beatles. First, because they were away from Beatlemania for the first time in five years and away from a hectic work schedule for the first time since 1960, they had less distractions from songwriting, he says on email. Second, because they only had acoustic instruments with them, many of the songs they wrote in Rishikesh had an acoustic, folky flavour, as you can hear on the White Album tracks like Julia, Dear Prudence, Blackbird and Mother Natures Son. Because they spent a lot of time practising meditation, they might have allowed thoughts buried in their subconscious to surface. As a result, their time in Rishikesh might have been the most prolific in their songwriting career, yielding such an abundance of material that their next album, the White Album, became a double LP and not a single one.Before their 1968 visit to Rishikesh, The Beatles were in India twice. The first, on 8 June 1964, was during a stopover at the Calcutta (now Kolkata) airport en route to Hong Kong. That visit, Beatles fansites remark, passed off uneventfully, with a crowd of girls waiting for them when the plane touched downa phenomenon of screaming fans that they encountered during refuelling stoppages in Beirut, Karachi, Kolkata and Bangkok.The quiet of the ashram, the daily meditation, healthy lifestyle and vegetarian food allowed their creativity to blossom and it was possibly the most artistic phase of their career.- Paul Saltzman, PhotographerAround the time of their second visit, this time a one-day layover in Delhi on 6 July 1966, enormous fame and furious controversies had caught up with the band. Before arriving in Delhi, the band had been troubled by rightwing elements in Japan and roughly booted out of the Philippines for not having attended a breakfast meeting with the then first lady Imelda Marcos at the presidential palace. The band found hordes of fans waiting at the Delhi airport and along the route; fans on scooters gave chase, shouting Hi Beatles, Beatles. The fansite Beatlesbible.com quotes George Harrison as saying, Oh no! Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but Beatles have nowhere to lay their heads. Harrison, nevertheless, found time during the brief stopover to indulge in a passion that had gripped him by thenthe sitar. The band went looking for these at Rikhi Ram and Sons musical instruments shop in Connaught Place. Later, some were sent over to their hotel room for them to try out. The previous year, when The Beatles released their album Rubber Soul, with Harrison playing sitar over the deeply introspective Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown), a sore point was the cheap sitar going slightly off-key. This one bought from India had to be perfect.George Harrison and wife Pattie Boyd in Rishikesh. Photo: Paul SaltzmanThe dark horseIf anybody was steering the band towards India and all that the country possessed, musically and spiritually, it was Harrison. The Quiet One could also have been the one with the most inherently seeking nature. In the mid-1960s, when rock music in the West was seeking new musical frontiers and challenges, a 20-something Harrison discovered the sitar and his guru, sitar maestro Pandit Ravi Shankar, in June 1966 in London. They remained friends till Harrisons death at age 58 in 2001. For some critics, the sitar and his Indian classical music-influenced compositions gave Harrison his own niche in a band where Lennon-McCartney held the creative reins. For others, it was an essential component of Harrisons search for meaning in life.The sitar was part of Harrisons journey and with it he wanted to understand sadhana (meditation) through the highest Indian guru-shishya traditions, says Kolkata-based tabla player and composer Bickram Ghosh, who toured with Ravi Shankar for many years and played on Shankars album Chants Of India (1997), which was produced by Harrison. In 1999, Ghosh got a call from Harrison, asking him to play on the title track of his forthcoming album Brainwashed (released posthumously in 2002). Ghosh spent a week recording with Harrison at his mansion in the UKs Henley-on-Thames. The song turned out to be an apt summary of Harrisons music: a balanced blend of Western rock and Indian music.Norwegian Wood is often considered to be the opening salvo of raga-rock, a musical fusion that flourished in the 1960s and 1970s. Harrisons Indian compositionsWithin You Without You, Love You To with The Beatlesand his single The Inner Light continued the trend. Early in his solo career, Harrison wrote songs like the folky Dehra Dun and the passionate Bangla Desh, which recounts his friend Ravi Shankar approaching Harrison to help the victims of the 1970 cyclone in West Bengal and East Pakistan and the 1971 Bangladesh Liberation War. Harrison was moved enough to singlehandedly organize rock musics first charity show on a massive scale. The Concert for Bangladesh at New Yorks Madison Square Garden in 1971 was a huge hit, helping Harrison raise millions for Unicef. His experience with India was immersive. To that effect, it might not be entirely surprising that the final strains of music ever recorded by Harrison was an over 2-minute section to end the album and song, Brainwashed, where Harrison and his son, Dhani, chant the bhajan Nama Parvathi Pathaye Hara Hara to Ghoshs tabla. Till the day I die, Harrison is known to have told Rolling Stone magazine in 1968, I still believe (Indian music) is the greatest music ever on our level of existence.Indian classical music led Harrison towards Eastern spirituality and religion. He became a life-long adherent of the teachings of Swami Vivekananda and Paramahansa Yogananda. He helped Londons Radha Krishna Temple financially and also produced the single Hare Krishna Mantra. One can say that of The Beatles it appears that only George got India, says Sally Grossman, wife of the late Albert Grossman who managed the likes of Bob Dylan and Janis Joplin, on email from her home in Woodstock, US. Other than vigorously pursuing a five-decade-old interest in the baul music of Bengal, as is documented on Baularchive.com, a scholarly repository of her work and association with India, Sally once hosted George Harrison and his wife Pattie Boyd at their home. They came to stay at our house so as to visit Bob Dylan. We bonded immediately over India. We all knew India had seduced us, entranced us, educated us and broadened our horizons, writes Grossman. It was Boyd who introduced her husband and The Beatles to the Maharishi in 1967, which initiated the Fab Four into the Spiritual Regeneration Movement at Bangor in the UK.The main hall of the ashram, also called the Beatles Cathedral. Photo: Wikimedia CommonsThe global yogiBy the time The Beatles came to Rishikesh in 1968, they were worn out by the strains and stress of fandom. It was already a couple of years since the Beatles had renounced touring, tired and stretched as they were by thousands of screaming teenaged fans at concerts, which often interrupted the actual performance. In director Martin Scorseses documentary film George Harrison: Living In The Material World (2011), there is a dramatic moment when Lennon stops an arena concert to look up at the shrieking girls interrupting the bands performance. Shut up, he says firmly in the footage, Ill kill you. Wild car chases by fans, stalking and the occasional threat of bodily harm were already part of the Beatles experienceclearly the band was at the end of their tether. India, and meditation, possibly, came as an escape hatch to the other side of celebrity.Just prior to their arrival in Rishikesh, Brian Epstein, the bands longtime manager, died. The Beatles were consoled by the Maharishi, who they had met just days before Epsteins death, but were devastated nonetheless.Then there was the issue of drugs. A couple of years back, the band had its first taste of the notorious wonder drug LSD, as Harrison put it the Scorsese film. Widening the minds perception and altering ones consciousness through LSD was a key goal of the 1960s counterculture. It was no different for The Beatles. Even as he dropped acid near the door of a nightclub and took off on an incredible trip across time and space, Harrison was, by then, a student of Ravi Shankar. I had this lingering thought that just stayed with me after that, he says in the movie. And this thought was the yogis of the Himalayas. I had never thought about them...but suddenly this thought was in the back of my consciousness. It was like somebody was whispering to me, you know. The yogis of the Himalayas.It was the Maharishi who impressed upon The Beatles to publicly renounce drugs at a press conference. It was an experience we went through, McCartney is quoted as saying at the press conference in Philip Normans biography, Shout!: The True Story Of The Beatles (2004). Now its over. We dont need it any more. We think were finding new ways of getting there. At that juncture, it would have seemed that all roads, literally, spiritually and metaphorically, converged to get The Beatles down to Rishikesh.The global media followed the band till the barred ashram gate for it ticked the boxes of exoticism, Indian spiritualism, Ganges, Himalayas and the worlds most famous band, says Saltzman. While the Beatles trip triggered the arrival of Indian spirituality and yogic practices in Western consciousness with the sprouting of street corner yoga and meditation studios, the personality of the Maharishi, who had harped on the need for Transcendental Meditation to the Beatles, saw McCartney penning a ditty like The Fool On The Hill in 1967 for the bands Magical Mystery Tour album. On the other hand, Lennon went on to write the wry Sexy Sadie, an acerbic comment on the Maharishi (Sexy Sadie, what have you done/ You made a fool of everyone) and how ignominiously the Rishikesh visit ended for the band when there were allegations of sexual misdemeanour against the Maharishi.Though the allegations were never really proved, the infamy stuck, says Anand Shrivastava, nephew of the Maharishi. Shrivastava is also the vice-president of the New Delhi-headquartered Spiritual Regeneration Movement (SRM) Foundation of India. I dont know what led John Lennon to make the allegation, for the Maharishi was a bal brahmachari who led a pure life. Maybe Lennon was frustrated at something, says Shrivastava, on the phone from the Netherlands, where the Maharishi died in 2008, aged 90.Murals and graffiti on the Beatles ashram walls. Photo: Shamik Bag/MintThe cultural momentThe Maharishis Uttarakhand ashram was closed down by the states forest department in 1990 after its lease expired. It remained shut for 15 years and was opened to public only in 2015.Seekers from the West continue to throng Rishikesh and the ashram, drawn by the prospect of attaining spiritual salvation and helped by The Beatles lore. Take, for instance, Tejasvi Giri who was earlier Deja Cross. An entrepreneur from the US who also helmed multimillion dollar businesses, she renounced everything and came to Rishikesh. She was an eight-year-old growing up in California when she heard about The Beatles tryst with the Maharishi and Indian mysticism, another way of living that was difficult to fathom in a country where, back then, there was no culture of meditation, she says.Today, Giri, 58, is the founder-director of the Rishikesh International Film Festival, which in its second year is organizing a two-day event at the ashram to commemorate the 50th year of The Beatles visit. Beginning 16 March, the commemoration will see displays of photographs, presentations with slide shows, playing of songs and videos, Transcendental Meditation practice by schoolchildren, a ticketed tour of the ashram and a panel discussion centred around consciousness and creativity, among other events. Giri, who has been based in a village outside the touristy zones of Rishikesh, living close to the people, says, Ill be here only to be with the people.Ever since he first visited India and sought the curative powers of meditation at the ashram to overcome an estranged relationship, Saltzman, by his own reckoning, has been to India over 50 times. It wasnt easy for him to gain access to the ashram, where the Beatles along with other musicians like Donovan and Mike Love of the Beach Boys were staying.For the one week he was there, Saltzman slept in a tent pitched outside the ashrams tall periphery wall but was permitted to participate in the ashrams activities during the day. The meditation exercises gave Saltzman an insight into his own mind and soul; his intimate and candid photos of The Beatles gave the world a sneak peek into the bare and unvarnished side of celebrity lives. The 50th anniversary is culturally significant because it marks one of the few times famous celebrities, who were artistically and commercially successful, put their careers on pause to study and investigate a spiritual discipline for their personal enlightenment, explains Unterberger. They did this even knowing they would be ridiculed by much of the media. If their fans were unlikely to ridicule, many were puzzled. It also marked one of the first times that Western pop stars committed to spending time experiencing a non-Western practice and culture that was very different from what they had grown up with and that made their superstardom possible.This year, coinciding with the India release of the special 50th anniversary edition of his photobook, The Beatles In India, by Simon & Schuster, Saltzman will be back in India to complete the filming of his Beatles film, one which will bring in the elements of creativity, meditation, spirituality and love pivoted around Saltzmans stories from 1968.The 50th anniversary is culturally significant because it marks one of the few times famous celebrities, who were artistically and commercially successful, put their careers on pause to study and investigate a spiritual discipline for their personal enlightenment.- Richie Unterberger, Music critic and authorAnd in the endThe Rishikesh stint was possibly the first time in many years that Lennon and McCartney were staying next door to each other. This lead to an burst of creative camaraderie, says Miti Adhikari, who used to be the chief sound engineer at the BBCs Maida Vale Studios in London.Yet, despite the bonhomie, described by Norman as the group mind, Rishikesh, it can be argued, could well have widened the already-existing cracks of disagreement between the band members.An indication to that effect can be found in Lennons song India, India, one of two India-specific songs that he wrote in 1980, about his 1968 sojourn. In it, he sings: Im waiting by the river, but somewhere in my mind, I left my heart in England, with the girl I left behind. This was Yoko Ono, the Japanese avant-garde performance artist he had befriended in 1966. Lennon had travelled with his wife Cynthia to Rishikesh but would sneak out every once in a while to the local post office to collect the postcards that Ono would send him. These would usually consist of one word, Breathe, Norman mentioned to an amused audience at a session on The Beatles in India held at the Jaipur Literature Festival in 2017.Within a year of returning from Rishikesh, Lennon would divorce Cynthia and get together with Yoko Ono. Ono became a fixture at the studio sessions when The Beatles started recording the songs they had composed in Rishikesh for the White Album.Lennons Rishikesh songs cropped up again on The Beatles final record, Abbey Road, in 1969. Mean Mr. Mustard and Polythene Pam were fragments which he later disparaged as a bit of crap I wrote in India. The Beatles would disband in 1970.Whichever way you look at it, the ashram in Rishikesh remains a cultural signpost. Fifty years later, the weather-beaten, moss-covered and mouldy walls stand as mute witness to one of the most iconic moments in popular culture.Also Read:Beatles in India: A new life for John LennonA (far from) comprehensive list of Beatles coversMy sweet lords50 years of Beatles in India: How George Harrison brought Indian classical music to Western popIf you are a Beatles fan, heres the book for you"

I wonder how many people across the subcontinent, including those across post-colonial borders, will wear a touch of sunny yellow, eat a yellow laddoo or rasmalai or fly a kite on their roof with friends and family.Thats the fun cultural part once shared by communities. For Hindus, it remains the pleasant calendar opportunity to offer bright yellow flowers to the Jagadamba or mother goddess in her aspect as Sarasvati, the patron deity of knowledge and the arts. It is also the Hindu custom in many regions to recite the Yakundendu, a short and charming Sanskrit prayer of praise to Sarasvati.Why is yellow the colour of Vasant Panchami? Different regions have different theories. Some say it represents the colour of the mustard flower, others, the golden warmth of the Sun. Celebrating communities across the region appear to agree on the happy palette for the festival  tones of haldi-kumkum or turmeric-vermilion, offset by whites and greens.Beyond the frolic, Basant, as Vasant Panchami is known in West Bengal and parts of the north, is held to be spiritually significant. Just as the Earth awakes again to Spring, the human soul or consciousness is supposed to start shedding its accumulated baggage of negativity.Tradition is quite understanding of and realistic about human nature. It does not expect one to go cold turkey and banish worry, dislike and resentment on the spot. But the festival does seriously ask us to begin the process of renewing self-awareness, so that by the time Holi rolls around, about six weeks later (on March 1 and 2 this year), were ready to symbolically burn the junk inside our heads along with the household junk burnt in the traditional Holi bonfire.If you look closely at the Indian calendar, you will see that under the busy timetable of holy days, theres actually a plan to bond society through many opportunities to interact positively and pleasantly. Like any plan, it can and occasionally will go wrong. But its intentions are good.The biggest and best punya or merit gained on a holy day is when we are friendly and affectionate to all, and dont shortchange those to whom we owe money and manners. So the punya is of two kinds  one gained by doing the good things that build a cordial society and one gained by not doing the bad things that vitiate the atmosphere.Im sure there are many ways to become self-aware and shed negativity, and heres one that I am partial to. When one wakes, think of your chosen deity of whichever creed for two minutes. Be religious about the daily bath and clean, fresh clothes, kind deeds. Think over your day for five minutes at bedtime; say a prayer before sleep. Small steps towards a big result  a happier you.shebaba09@gmail.comThe views expressed are personal"

Speaking to The Hindu about diabetes and its management, Dr. Misra says his new book is an educative guide that teaches readers about how diabetes can affect mental, emotional and physical well being but can be prevented or managed through some simple, methodical stepsWhat is the magnitude of diabetes problem in India, more specifically in Delhi?Currently, 82 million people in India are affected due to diabetes and the number is expected to rise to 151 million by 2045. In a 2015 study, it was estimated that around a quarter of Delhis population suffers from some form of diabetes and around 48% from pre-diabetes (impaired glucose tolerance).What does your book talk about?Before this book, patients obtained knowledge and education about diabetes from physicians and the Internet. Physicians do not have enough time to educate patients and the Internet often provides confusing and wrong information.Further, most of this information is derived from sources in the United States and the United Kingdom, which is often not applicable to Indian patients. An India-specific information source for management of diabetes was needed and is provided by this book. Diet, exercise and management techniques in the book are tailored towards Indian patients, based on research done by our and other groups in India.How is it helpful for the common man?Besides giving comprehensive information about diabetes, the book also informs readers about solutions to common problems that patients face. For example, what to do in case a patient develops nausea, vomiting or fever? What drugs to take when travelling to the hills? What if a diabetic person plays competitive sports? This book answers scores of questions on diabetes and has a list of frequently asked questions for quick reference. The book has photographs and diagrams to better explain exercises or insulin-injection techniques. This book also gives healthy food recipes and a sustainable diet plan. Knowledge about these issues can empower patients and their relatives to manage diabetes. The book is also apt for nutritionists, lifestyle coaches and physicians.Are there ways to prevent diabetes?With modest weight loss (around 7-10% of ideal body weight), physical activity (at least 60 minutes a day) and proper diet, onset of diabetes can be prevented or delayed.For those who are morbidly obese, massive weight loss can reverse diabetes, as has been shown with application of bariatric surgery. Type-2 diabetes is often preventable by simple lifestyle changes. Keep your weight in its ideal range, exercising regularly and eat a balanced diet in small meals with intermittent snacks, which should include whole grains. Avoid sugary drinks and over refined grains.Choose good fats instead of bad fats. Polyunsaturated fats and monounsaturated fats in olive, canola and mustard oils can help ward off Type-2 diabetes.Limit intake of red meat and avoid processed meat. Nuts, seeds, beans, masoor dal, lobia, sprouts, tofu, or poultry are much more healthy sources of protein. Also add two servings each of green leafy vegetables and fruits.What are the rules to help prevent diabetes in children?Prevention of obesity and Type-2 diabetes in children requires systematic and focused approach involving not only the child, but also the parents and peers. You need individualised dietary counselling for balanced diets and must maintain normal body weight from early age. It is important that children/adolescents be encouraged to include at least 60 minutes of moderate intensity outdoor physical activity/sports daily. Discourage time spent watching TV or playing computer games. Parents should try to set an example by themselves exercising regularly. They should share at least one meal with the children and should accompany them to parks and play with them. Group/community must encourage participation in physical activity. Fitness centres, courts for basketball and badminton, playgrounds for hockey and skating, and parks for jogging and walking should be made more accessible. Regular health check-ups should also be done at least once a year. During this visit, the doctor should calculate the childs Body Mass Index and counsel parents if it is above the normal range.What is the proportion of women affected by diabetes?The prevalence of diabetes for women 20-79 years is estimated to be 8.4%, which is slightly lower than among men (9.1%). There are about 17.1 million more men than women with diabetes (221.0 million men against 203.9 million women). Going by the current trend, they will outnumber men in diabetes soon. There are a number of factors responsible for this. Many studies show that girls in India are getting obese and show more metabolic syndrome  clustering of risk factors such as high sugar, blood pressure, deranged lipids  as compared to males. Other factors include weight gain after pregnancy, post-menopausal hormonal changes, as well as social and security issues that prevent them from engaging in outdoor activities and exercises.What are the essential tips to manage diabetes?Making patients understand the importance of correct diet and exercise throughout their life. Enhancing awareness about the importance of scientific treatment and its compliance, which can prevent complications, disability and death. Providing good education to prevent long-term diabetes complications. Regular physical examination and check ups to detect early damage. Maintain positive outlook even if disease is complicated. Maintain disciplined lifestyle.The diet, exercise and management techniques in the book are tailored towards Indian patients, based on research done by our, and other, groups in IndiaAnoop MisraFortis C-Doc chairman"

It says 1,429 people were killed, including 426 children.A UN report says later there is clear evidence sarin gas was used.The following month the United States and regime-backer Russia reach a deal to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons by 2014, averting punitive US strikes.Chlorine, mustard gasIn September 2014 the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) says chlorine was used as a weapon ""systematically and repeatedly"" on villages in the central province of Hama and northwestern Idlib province.(File | AFP)A joint UN-OPCW commission finds in 2016 that helicopters from regime-controlled air bases dropped chlorine barrel bombs on villages in Idlib in 2014 and 2015.The commission accuses the jihadist Islamic State group of using mustard gas in August 2015 in the rebel stronghold of Marea in northern Aleppo.In October the commission says that the Syrian army carried out a chlorine attack in Idlib province in March 2015.New sarin attackWarplanes strike the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun in Idlib in April 2017 with a chemical agent. More than 80 were killed, according to the UN and Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitor.The OPCW later says sarin gas was used but does not assign blame.UN war crimes investigators say later they have evidence that Syrian government forces were responsible, allegations rejected by Moscow.In November 2017 Western governments say a presumed chemical attack which just preceded that in Khan Sheikhun ""bears the hallmarks of the Syrian regime"".Russian vetoIn November 2017 Russia twice casts its veto at the UN Security Council to block the extension of the UN-led investigation to determine who is behind chemical weapons attacks in Syria.(File | AFP)Damascus accused againOn January 22, 2018 the Observatory says at least 21 people, including children, suffered breathing difficulties in a suspected Syrian regime chemical attack in a besieged rebel enclave near Damascus.A similar attack had targeted the outskirts of the same city, Douma, in the opposition-held Eastern Ghouta region on January 13, according to the monitor, which says seven people suffered breathing problems."
5b2d7e8f9855b723c6f46900,A festival to celebrate Hindu-Muslim unity,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/hyderabad/a-festival-to-celebrate-hindu-muslim-unity/articleshow/62628132.cms,2018-01-24,"HYDERABAD: Admirers of Sufism were at their ecstatic high on Monday night as the sacred environs of the Dargah of Hazrat Shaik Ji Hali in Old City reverberated with the devotional songs of the 13th century saint-poet Amir Khusro to mark the festival of Basant.The Sufi Basant festival, a symbol of Hindu-Muslim unity, is celebrated at all major dargahs of Sufi saints on Basant Panchami, which heralds the spring . It is also dedicated to Saraswati, the goddess of learning and knowledge.As Sufi singers recited the famous Khusro poem (a mix of Persian and proto-Hindi), Zehaal-e-miskeen makun taghaful, duraye naina banaye batiyan(Do not overlook my misery, by blandishing your eyes and weaving tales), the Dargah and the nearby Charkaman and Gulzar Houz were transformed into a realm of spiritualism and love.Incidentally, the Dargah of Hazrat Shaik Ji Hali is located where once the palaces of the Qutub Shahi rulers stood. The Qutub Shahis introduced the Muslim participation in Basant, essentially a Hindu festival, about five centuries ago.Mohammad Quli, the founder of Hyderabad, wrote many poems in Telugu and Urdu on Basant Panchami. He also wrote on Mrugashira that heralds monsoon. Though none of his Telugu poems are available, nine Basant songs in Urdu were compiled eight decades ago. The anthology, Kuliyat-Muhammad Quli Qutub Shah , was published in 1940.The idea behind holding Basant as a royal festival during Qutub Shahi period was to promote communal harmony. The Basant tradition was introduced in India by Amir Khusro, a follower of Hazrat Nizamuddin. It was revived in Hyderabad by Moulana Muzaffar Ali Soofi Chisti, custodian of Shaik Ji Hali Dargah The story goes that Khusro wanted to bring back the smile on the face of his teacher, Hazrat Nizamuddin, who had withdrawn from the world after the death of his nephew. Khusro dressed himself in yellow and sang carrying mustard flowers, bringing a smile on his teachers face. In fact, Khusro was inspired by a group of Hindu women who were out to worship Saraswati on Basant Panchami.The Sufi Basant festival on Monday saw the participation of many dignitaries, including consul-general of Turkey Adnan Altay Altinors, deputy high commissioner of UK Andrew Fleming, Nalsar University VC Prof Faizan Mustafa and Intach Telangana co-convener P Anuradha Reddy."

Closer home, however, youd hear quite the opposite from your mom (grandparents, neighbours, relatives, and sometimes even the so-called well wishers): Why you wearing black to the wedding? And we dare you dare to ask them why!Subhiksha Venkat in the sari that inspiredthe campaignThe colour considered as ultimate classic in fashion worldwide, is considered inauspicious and vile in most regions in India. Why? Nobody really knows, and it is only more confounding to notice the auspicious black Chandrakala sari, worn from Makarasankranthi in Maharashtra, the black mangalsutra beads worn in Northern parts of India and even Sabarimala devotees all wear black veshtis!Facing mean stares and passive-aggressive chiding all through a wedding ceremony, a Chennai-based fashion blogger decided to question this long-standing and seemingly unreasonable cultural taboo against black, by taking to social media. A gorgeous black, mustard and red silk sari caught my eye at a store, and my dad loved it too so we got it. But when I wore it to a wedding few weeks later, it was mayhem! Some said I looked like a political party flag, and some even shouted at me because I was wearing a black sari on an auspicious day, recalls Subhiksha Venkat.When she posted this on her Instagram blog, many of her followers posted back in solidarity, thus creating a campaign #teamblacksari. I saw over a hundred posts with the hashtag! Didnt expect that kind of a response, she laughs.While some women hunted their wardrobes to find that hidden-away black sari, others actually went out and purchased a black sari for the occasion, using it as an excuse to add one more black sari to their wardrobe. Subhikshas hashtag campaign is a remarkable initiative. Despite living in a society where we all are well-educated independent women, we still succumb to certain superstitions and restrictionsthough we wouldnt have an iota of personal belief in them, says Varsha Arvind, who took part in the online campaign.Draped in black cotton, silk, chiffon and lace, several women posted their stories of black saris and the Indian obsession to oppress the colour. Nivedha Parthipan, a business analyst at Zoho Corporation, related to Subhikshas experience of wedding fiascos. Black is inauspicious, Black isnt for the good girls, Wearing black is a crime - I was tired of these slew of restrictions. My first ever pattu sari was black, my favourite, and I could never wear it to my friends wedding or anywhere else! But when I saw a brides sister flaunt black drape at a wedding, it inspired me! she quips.And its not just weddings, but also other social gatherings like music concerts that black is shunned from, we learn. As someone who learns and has performed Carnatic music on stage, Ive always been told not to wear black for concerts - at least, not in large doses. My family has also always discouraged me from doing so, saying that it is not appropriate for a young girl to wear black, says Lavanya Narayanan, a model and journalist.Though on the surface it seemed like this campaign was all about the black sari, it was really in fact addressing a much larger issue, that of freedom of fashion choices. This movement was a way to talk about all the pressures society puts on us. I realised a lot of women face so much judgement for wearing shorts, T-shirts, ripped jeans etc, she adds.Talking about this on public platforms can also strengthen feminine solidarity. I respect norms that have scientific reasons to it  but I also believe that if you love wearing black sari, letting your hair loose and flaunting red pattak lipstick, you should be able to do so! she asserts."

The show began with a dance performance on In Aankhon Ki Masti Ke by Shivani Verma and what set the mood of the show were more ghazals like 'Zindagi Jab Bhi Teri Bazm Mein Laati Hai Hamein' playing in the background. From anarkalis paired with farshi pyjamas to lehengas in Banarasi brocade, velvet, everything that was put on the ramp had a touch of Meera and Muzaffar Alis signature style. ""We have been working on this for a long time since it takes a lot of time to put together so many looks and each one of them had its own story, its own detailing. We used a lot of brocades which we specially got woven in Banaras. Each piece was one of its kind. These are not the designs you would find two people wearing in any party or a wedding,"" said Meera.

Hand-painted patterns and embroidery were the highlight on fabrics like Banarasi, net, organza and chiffon. For men, there were front open long jackets paired with dhoti. My collection is mostly Indo-Western and I have used my traditional hand painting on the garments. There is a range of ethnic fabrics used in the collection along with textiles and fabrics from Odisha. My traditional hand painting is inspired from pattachitra and the handloom fabric used is pochampalli ikat,said Nikita, who showcased on the ramp for the first time.

I am glad I got this experience of showcasing at Delhi Times Fashion Week,"" said the designer.Sonalika SahayDesigner Sulakshana Monga has been working on a bridal wear that suits the choices of modern brides.

The show began with the presentation of pastle shades like pale pink and shades of mustard and the final part of the show had models walking in traditional red lehenga with embroidered motifs inspired from Mughal India. The designer said that the idea of the collection was ""to present the new India.""Hemangi ParteSucheta SharmaShe added, ""There was heritage, tradition and art in this collection, but we did experiment with drapes to present the traditional in a new look.

This is a strange coincidence,"" Nebenzia added.During the Security Council meeting, Nebenzia called again for establishing a ""new international investigative body which, on the basis of irrefutable information, would be able to establish evidence to identify perpetrators in the use of chemical weapons.""His plan would replace a chemical weapons panel known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism, whose mandate could not be renewed due to Russian vetoes.Moscow is also circulating a draft resolution that would establish the new investigative body that would be ""truly impartial, independent, professional and credible."" Russia has repeatedly contested the JIM's legitimacy.US envoy Nikki Haley quickly indicated the Russian proposal had no chance of being adopted. The United States also holds veto power at the Security Council.""We're not going to accept any Russian proposal that undermines our ability to get to the truth or that politicizes what must be an independent and impartial investigation,"" she said.""If they want to work in good faith toward that goal, we are ready to re-establish the JIM, with its original independent and impartial mandate, right now. But anything less is unacceptable.""She argued that Moscow had supported the JIM as long as its investigators pointed the finger at the so-called Islamic State group, but challenged their conclusions when they blamed the Syrian regime.""That is not how independent investigations work. You don't get to question the findings when they dont go your way,"" Haley said.Damascus has been repeatedly accused of using chemical weapons, with the United Nations among those blaming government forces for an April 2017 sarin gas attack on the opposition-held village of Khan Sheikhun that left scores dead.There have been at least 130 separate chemical weapons attacks in Syria since 2012, according to French estimates, with the Islamic State group also accused of using mustard gas in Syria and Iraq.A new round of peace talks is due to take place in Vienna on Thursday and Friday, while Moscow has organized negotiations in the Russian city of Sochi next week aimed at ending Syria's civil war."

I did bump into Chef Alex Moser at some food do, but we never got to speak with him. Then, when a persistent young publicist invited me to try out the chefs fare, I agreed.The chef is at a restaurant called Hong Kong at Hotel Andaz Delhi  a concept by Hyatt, as it says  in Aerocity. I met the chef, discussed food, had a great Chinese meal and came home happily sated.Glitzy placeHong Kong is truly a glitzy place. The restaurant is huge, with a ground floor that seems specially designed for the young, and a first-floor area which is more suited to families and those who like to eat their food in peace. There is a king-sized bar, around which the young sat, drinks in hand, and not the least bit troubled by the loud music that was being played. I sat on the ground level, but wished it was better lit. I like to see what I eat.But what I ate was excellent. The food is essentially Cantonese which is not very hot, like, say Sichuan food. The dishes are light and flavoured with fresh herbs. And chef Moser tells me that his focus is always on fresh ingredients. He makes the most of what is seasonal, substituting some Chinese vegetables with Indian cousins freshly plucked from organic farms.We started with a warm roasted duck salad, with pomelo, pine nuts and shallots, which was very nice, indeed. Then there was some crunchy pickled radish with chilli and soya, and a dumpling with chicken  that was all right.Melt in the mouthWhat I loved was the crispy pork belly with a kasundi mustard sauce. The thick cubes of pork were crisp on the top, and incredibly soft below. I actually didnt have to chew it at all  it just vanished once I popped a piece into my mouth. And, of course, it went deliciously well with the mustard-kasundi sauce, the latter giving a somewhat bitter-and-sour flavour to it.Another dish that I really enjoyed was the Hong Kong style duck, served with a homemade barbecue sauce and mini baos. I took a bao, filled it with some of the roasted duck pieces, added the sauce and some greens, folded it, and took a nice juicy bite. It was delicious  the greens were crunchy, the duck was tender, and the sauce, piquant.The main meal consisted of a delightful wok-fried rice dish, and some free-range chicken, cooked with black bean, bell pepper and scallions. The rice was a mix of textures and flavours, for it had been cooked with three kinds of rice  red rice, bamboo rice and jasmine rice. The rice had been flavoured with preserved olive leaves, which gave it a tart flavour. Together, they did a neat number.The dessert consisted of an almond tapioca pudding (okay), passion fruit jelly (good) and bitter chocolate tart (very good).The chef likes to give a tweak to traditional Cantonese cuisine keeping regional produce in mind. And he adds a spice like onion seeds to his stir fried vegetables, to give it a little twist that is familiar  yet inspiring. And a lot of the taste in the dishes is linked to the fact that he doesnt use powders in his kitchen.It was a great meal, and I was happy to be able to catch up with the chef. I hope Ill get to see more of him this year."
5b27ec709855b720524c26e6,High on the Sly,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/high-on-the-sly-204051?ref=india-new-stry,2018-01-28,"Sankarshan ThakurRepresentative imageThe most secure places to uncork the spirits and have a tipple in Bihar are, well, the most secure places. The kind of places that have daintily painted perimeter walls. The kind of places that are islanded in the sprawl of lawns and shaded groves and, very often, vegetable gardens.The kind of places you may not enter without passing a sentry-post ridden always with a languid sentry or two. They keep such places safe. Secure. If you're familiar with the lay of imperial-era west Patna, you'd have got the drift; it's where Bihar's magisterial authority resides - ministers, incumbent or bygone or awaiting, political daddies and their menageries, judges, bureaucrats, policemen. Together, this lot constitutes what might be called the authority of the law. You don't get to tell them what the law is. They are the law.And so it is that the most regular and facile violation of what is arguable the strictest law in Bihar comes to be enacted on the precincts of some of those that make, maintain and and manifest the law. There's an old Bihari adage that, roughly paraphrased, goes: if thieve you must, keep the daroga for company.It's criminal to imbibe alcohol in Bihar, an offence punishable, since April 2016, by up to a 10-year prison sentence, in some cases even life. But an offence becomes a crime only when you're caught. In secure places, you can quite securely drink - "" Peejiye, peejiye, yahaan kaun poochhnewala hai?"" (Drink up, who's here to ask a question?)JEERS: RJD leader and Nitishs former deputy, Tejashwi Yadav, mocked Prohibition in Bihar posting this picture as metaphor  a padlocked gate with no walls to flank itBihar drinks. You could say, in light of the sweeping Prohibition provisions chief minister Nitish Kumar imposed two years ago, Bihar is criminally - and quite happily - complicit. Crime isn't a new, much less surprising, reference to Bihar; Prohibition merely sent crime where it had never been before - your living-room sideboard became a scene of crime, your wine glasses witnesses one two and three for the prosecution. It made felonious drunkards out of people who merely liked their drink, it turned as convivial a call as ""cheers"" into a foreword for criminality. You drink in Bihar, you become a criminal. You could safely say, now more than ever before, Bihar is the most crime-infested state of our union.At the first drop of the guillotine on alcohol, Bihar ran about headless trying to find ways to feed a habit that had been suddenly proscribed and had scary punishments attached to it. It drove to Jhumritilaiya, the first township across the border in Jharkhand to find a vend. It jumped on a train headed west to UP and jumped off it at the first site of a shack that offered the spirits. It ran east into Bengal to look for watering holes. It crossed the international border and found places in Nepal. What it consumed in small measures over a leisurely week, it glugged down over a hurried afternoon's or weekend's outing. It went out thirsty; it returned sloshed. Nitish had nailed the bottle; Bihar hammered itself. ""There was nothing to be done but run helter-skelter, find whatever was available and gulp it down,"" recalls a Patna businessman, ""some of us would drive all the way down to Jharkhand on Saturdays, drink up, drink up, drink up all Sunday. We were like errant boys revelling in a dirty weekend. At first it felt like fun, but it became a terrible thing to have to do again and again, it was not sustainable.""He found a way round it. Bihar found ways round it. Barely anybody that feels like a drink in the state isn't able to find it. The drink comes dearer, and must be had furtively - afraid they might be reported, drinking friends do not admit to drinking friends they drink - but it is there to be had. It comes easier in the countryside, delivered home by dark and had in the backyard. The alert is higher in towns and cities but it isn't tough to get, enough care taken. It is, in fact, so plentifully available, the smuggler-premium has gone down and illicit supplies have begun to be innovatively stored. One home in Patna orders bulk and decants it all into a mustard oil tin which is then stowed away at the back of the kitchen shelves. Another squirrels the stuff into empty cough syrup bottles that are kept scattered about the house. ""We do not believe we do anything criminal by drinking, it is just that this government makes us feel so,"" says a university teacher not averse to the occasional sit-down-and-sip herself, ""But this whole thing of having to go out of the way to procure liquor and steal it away does make you feel as if there is something criminal about it. I mean, you cannot sit with friends in your own home and have a drink because you have to be so careful about who knows. It is all furtive, almost makes you feel criminal. That has nothing to do with us, it is a sense the government has imposed.""Over the past two years, more than one lakh people have been arrested on charges of violating Prohibition regulations; many of them were let off on bail, but thousands remain locked in Bihar's choked jailhouses.Those arrests came off nearly six lakh police and excise raids which resulted in 91,000 FIRs. So many Prohibition-related matters have now floated up and flooded the courts that a judge of the Patna High Court caustically remarked the judiciary had been left practically disabled.So some say about the state of policing in Bihar as well. So much of the Nitish government's attention is on enforcing Prohibition that it has taken its eyes off quotidian maintenance of law and order. Loot, dacoity, kidnapping for ransom and murder are in spurt in Bihar but there is a pervasive sense Nitish's priorities and attentions remain riveted elsewhere. He recently instituted a special Prohibition wing in the Bihar Police and put an inspector-general at the head of a 240-strong force currently being raised to be stationed in Patna.""Good normal policing should have been enough to enforce Prohibition,"" confesses a senior Bihar policeman, ""At a time when crime is again on the up, going out of the way to create a separate unit to impose Prohibition should give you some idea of Nitish Kumar's priorities. Please understand this is his favourite baby, he is indulging it at the expense of other, probably more pressing, requirements.""On paper, Nitish's bar on alcohol has served up heady numbers - more than 20 lakh litres of what is now contraband seized - beer, country liquor, Indian made foreign liquor, mahua, hadia, toddy, narangi, whatever not. But the truth would likely bring that feat a few pegs down. And the truth is this: for every litre of alcohol seized five, probably even ten, slip through, or are allowed to slip through.Alcohol is big money in today's Bihar and it has found its Al Capones. There's a market, and there's an organised machinery to feed it and feed off it. Liquor-running is quickest way to get rich; if you are willing to take the risk, profit per bottle can go as high at 120 per cent. A driver jumped job last year. This year, he is imagining a house on the plot of land he has since bought. ""I have a few hired girls,"" he reveals to me, ""Smart girls. They wear jeans and carry bags, and in those bags they carry bottles from alcohol dumps. I pay them per sortie, it still leaves me a huge profit."" Isn't he afraid? ""But I pay the police too,"" he laughs, ""They're on the team. They seize some to make up their numbers, they let most of it go for a price.""Where the best of the impounded stuff goes is another story, and quite a story it is. A while ago, substantive quantities of alcohol confiscated and kept in police holds in Patna was found to be suddenly missing, as if it had evaporated off the bottles. Special delivery to those secure west Patna homes with sentry posts? Questions were raised and an answer was duly furnished: rats, the police officer in charge offered blithely, had partied on it. Patna rats have good taste, they polished off the cream of the prize catch.Say cheers to that."

The vertical gardens set up by the I-T department at its Rishi Nagar office and Gurdwara Dukh Niwaran Sahib, are not only getting replicated in schools but also at the homes of city residents. Thats not all. These vertical gardens, which help to curb pollution levels in the city, are also being installed in other government buildings in cities like Amritsar. At present, close to 100 vertical gardens are under progress at government and private school in the district, a majority of which are likely to be completed by January 30. There is good news for the I-T officials. Some corporates have also given their go-ahead to install these green gardens in their factories.Binay K Jha, chief commissioner of income tax (CCIT), said, This is nothing less than a big achievement for us. If we are able to inspire others around us to take up this green cause and set up these vertical gardens we will be successful in our mission to tackle the problem of air pollution to a large extent. Air pollution poses threat to cities like Ludhiana.Jha sounded happy with the way the green campaign has managed to find its place in the district. I was pleasantly surprised when I saw how people are trying to devise innovative techniques to suit their requirements to install the green gardens. A businessman, who was not able to get waste bottles of green colour, got the normal bottles painted. In another case, a person got the saplings planted in waste mustard oil bottles.SS Rai, a city businessman, who has installed a vertical garden at his home in Parkash Nagar , is thankful to the I-T department for its green plastic initiative.This is a wonderful project and the cost isnt much when compared to the other methods available in the market to make the lawns green and beautiful. This technique, also, helps to make use of the waste plastic bottles, which otherwise we throw away only to add to the environmental problems, he said."

This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul) With farm incomes for crops like paddy coming down, farmers are going for cash crops like mustard and potato in West Bengal Howrah district. This year overproduction of paddy also led to a crisis among cultivators. (Express photo by Partha Paul)A drop in potato production from last years 110 lakh tonne to 80-100 lakh tonne this year is anticipated, but is unlikely to impact the staple crops prices, officials said.Speaking at the 53rd Annual General Meeting of West Bengal Cold Storage Association (WBCSA) in Kolkata on Monday, state Agricultural Marketing Minister Tapan Dasgupta and WBCSA president Patit Paban De shared the view that potato prices would not be hit due to an excess stock of about 9 lakh tonne from last year.Production of potatoes will be lesser in comparison to last year, but it will still be far more than the average consumption of the state. Also, last years stock will help in keeping the price of potatoes in check, said De.The area of cultivation for potatoes has been reduced by five per cent in the state this year. As per sources, the average land allocated for potato cultivation is around 4.6 lakh hectares, but this will be reduced to 4.4 lakh hectares this season.At present, out of 575 cold storage units in the state, 460 are dedicated to storage of potatoes. With a capacity of 70 lakh MT (metric tonne) and enhanced efficiency, these units have adequate space to store the states entire production. However, high crop production across the country severely impacted the market, and despite efforts from all parties involved, the stock of potatoes kept in cold storage could not be fully sold. This despite extending the normal period of storage till December, officials said.Pointing out that the annual consumption of potatoes in the state is around 65 lakh tons, including seeds, De appealed to the state government to encouraging marketing of the crop in neighbouring states and abroad right after the start of the season.We request government authorities to make timely plans for marketing of excess produce to avoid distress sales. Most of the old cold storage units operate with bank loans for various purposes. However, due to insufficient rent recovery, many are unable to repay the loans. We submit a rent revision prayer to the government every year. The current rate is Rs 152 per quintal for North Bengal and Rs 148 per quintal for South Bengal. We will try to bring it to Rs 180 per quintal, he said.When asked about this, Dasgupta told The Indian Express, They havent applied to us yet. However, rent revision depends on the instructions given by Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee We will ensure farmers get their dues. Last year, there was excessive stock, hence they didnt get good money.The minister also said the government is encouraging cold storage owners to turn to solar power.In order to maintain an eco-friendly environment, we are encouraging them to install solar power Solar units will reduce the operating cost. So far, this has been initiated in 10 cold storage units in Midnapore, Bankura, Hooghly, etc he said.However, De pointed out that investing in solar power units was a costly endeavour.To run a cold storage 200 kWh solar unit, Rs 1 crore is necessary. However, in absence of any subsidy for such a huge investment, there is a remote possibility of installing such units using ones own funds.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"
5aeae53a9855b73f522c47fd,Was the Singur Stir for Nothing? Farmers Still Cold to Nano Plot,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-singur-protest-for-nothing-farmers-still-cold-to-nano-plot/story-3cHpNuRnbOAuUGlJUmWlPK.html,2018-01-31,"More than a year after West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee gave back to farmers the land on which Tatas Nano car plant was built, a major chunk of the 997.11-acre plot remains uncultivated.Cattle graze on large swathes as weeds run wild. Crops barely cover about 250 acres of the reclaimed land, Hindustan Times found during a recent visit to Singur. My plot of land is unfit for farming, said Amar Santra, a resident of Khaserbheri village that was the epicenter of the two-year-long land agitation that saw the Tata group abandon the plant in 2008. Last year, the monsoon washed away most of the topsoil, baring the remains of a concrete structure several feet below, Santra said. Other farmers, too, had similar complaints.Most of the plot was fit for cultivation, Pradip Majumdar, the chief ministers principal adviser on agriculture, countered.Farming resumed on more than 500 acres within months of the buildings being razed, he said. We have proven it beyond doubt that the land can still yield gold. If there still are some patches with construction remains, well get things right, Majumdar said.Banerjee, who was at the forefront of the stir against land acquisition for the car plant, had in October 2016 sowed potato seeds during the handover in perhaps the first instance of an industrial land being reconverted to farm land in India.But farming is yet to catch up.Of the 56 mini-deep tubewells installed by the state government, only 20 are operational.In November 2017, the Hooghly district magistrate issued a fresh notice, inviting farmers to work in the fields. Only 50 of the 630 applicants turned up till January 8. In Khaserbheri, fields are a favourite hunting ground for scrap-dealers, as iron rods jut out of the ground. In Bajemelia and Gopalnagar villages, acres are still submerged under the water after last years monsoon.According to Beraberi panchayat chief Dipankar Ghosh, nearly a third of the land needed to be worked on. His views were echoed by KGD gram panchayat chief Tapan Bag. Some of those who had sown potato, lentils and mustard during October-November 2016 also farmed the monsoon paddy in 2017. However, after monsoon wrecked havoc, many of them refrained from sowing the winter crop, said Uttam Das, the agriculture coordinator of Gopalnagar gram panchayat.Singur MLA Rabindranath Bhattacharya said he had informed the authorities about the need to redevelop parts of the land. When asked why bulk of the plot had not been cultivated, Majumdar said, There could be other reasons, refusing to elaborate on them.Some locals, though, had the answer. Many farmers turned plumbers, bricklayers, carpenters and mechanics in the 10 years  the land was acquired in 2006 and returned in 2016  they were away from their fields.People like Dipankar Das, who is now a carpenter, are earning a lot more. He would continue with both  farming in the morning and carpentry noon onwards  once his plot was ready, Das said.None will admit this because it will raise questions on why were all so keen to get their land back if they were switching professions anyway, said a 57-year-old resident of Gopalnagar Ghoshpara, whose sons now work in a garment factory in Howrah. He didnt wish to be identified, fearing a backlash.Local politicians and a section of the administration are hopeful that more people will return to till the land when sowing season begins in March and the monthly compensation of Rs 2,000 will wind down. The dole was started by the Banerjee government in 2011 for farmers who refused the compensation in 2006."

Emerging victorious at the International Woolmark Menswear Prize, his unique sense of dressing and the amount of patience and perseverance he puts into each garment, makes him different. His shirts, jackets are literally for keeps as the designer is meticulous about everything  right from the detailing on the button to the lining of the shirt.Every designer of distinction has a signature cut. For Suket, it is double seam with jaalis on the side of a shirt.Interestingly, it was an accidental evolution rather than a calculated move on his part as one discovers when we meet for a luncheon meeting at Tamra restaurant of Shangri-Las-Eros Hotel. Accompanied by his wife Svetlana, he is sporting enough to fulfil his commitment despite an injury on his right leg.Coming to the magic of double side with jaali on shirts , the designer, who believes in straight talk, says: I like to try my creations on myself. It just happened that 15 days before my first presentation to Anita Lal, founder of Good Earth, I had put on weight. So I told my Masterji to put an extra gusset using jaali. Since then this has become my signature line for the past seven years. Ms. Lal, a craft specialist, was not only my first buyer but even mentored me at a time when I needed a platform to showcase my creativity before the world. Ever since then, our clothes have been a permanent fixture at her stores. So my first presentation turned out to be lucky for me.As he tucks in sesame seed roll, Suket says, I dont like putting labels outside the clothes. To reinforce his point, he gets up to show the jaali on his shirt. Side seeing is a subtle way of branding. Showing the inside of his jacket, he says: To make sure the wearer does not see thread from inside, we put an extra button. We make all our outfits with lots of love.Focus on menswearAs one admires his striking bowler, which too has become a part of his personality, he says a friend gifted one to him from New York. It suited me so much that ever since then I started wearing it everyday. All those childhood memories keep rushing back whenever I see a hat. It brings back days when my grandfather made a fashion statement by wearing a range of hats. He ran a shop at Banga which had Raymond and Digjam suitings and Banarasi saris. When Punjab was going through the insurgency phase, my dad moved to Delhi. On landing here, I was immediately sent packing to Dehradun for studying at boarding at Col. Brown Cambridge where Raj Kapoor and former Prime Minister V.P. Singh studied.After studying fashion at NIFT, Suket, surprisingly, ventured towards creating only menswear. It came naturally to me. I dont have to think very hard. If I have to be in somebody elses shoes, then I have to see things from their perspective. I do understand what men will need with passage of time. I have experienced parched deserts of Rajasthan as well as the breezy weather of New York. So I design clothes suitable to what men can wear in their cities. My own human existence has been expressed through my design. What I have grown up with and what I aspire is all reflected through clothes.Indian soulFor horizontally challenged guys, he says: I also know when you put on weight at wrong places, clothes need to be made in a way that an individual does not feel embarrassed. We add an extra layer or play with the cut of a shirt. If the waist is generous, then we refuse Nehru jacket and suggest blazer. Womenswear is a tricky business from that perspective. So we are doing menswear which will fit women as well.Barring his imported hat, he stresses the fact that he is wearing clothes made at home  a shirt and jacket made in linen and trousers made with 100 % Merino wool. It is certainly not Indian clothing but it has an unmistakable Indian imprint. People can see that it is handwoven fabric.And for his inspiration, he travels across the country and abroad. In Rajasthan, I have seen people using blankets stuffed with wool. They act as insulators. The versatility of wool can be seen through this. Similarly, I make light weight trans-seasonal textiles using Merino and natural fibres which are suitable for the European summers as there is nip in the air towards evening.According to him, Merino handmade shirts are breathable. Foreigners certainly appreciate more but Indians who are sensitive towards beauty and aesthetics are also our clientle, he says before eating pineapple sushi roll.He stresses that the soul of his line is Indian. It comes from within me as I was fortunate to have been born in a family at Banga town in Punjab where nature and clothes intertwined.While he derives inspiration from his home town in North, he has also worked on resuscitating kasuti hand embroidery down South. We were working on ikat and I saw some kasuti work online. So I wanted to see it myself at Dharwad in Karnataka. Immediately, it stuck me that this is what I want on my clothes. Its aesthetics is so simple, subtle and I did it in an unobtrusive way on menswear. We have done it on pocket square, blazers on chest. Its my menswear mindset; I dont like doing over the top embroidery.He makes clothes for grooms who dont like over the top attire. On his wedding, he wore white silk dhoti with white kurta and velvet bandhgala. I was a rare dulha without embroidered clothes.As he shares a dish with his better half, Suket says, he likes to make his products versatile. If a groom is wearing a garment like a plain sherwani, then we plan it in such a way that he can wear it even the next day. We play a lot with accessories - khadi wale buttons, polki diamond buttons.... Traditional buttons are much in demand. Many clients say they have their dadas buttons. On the wedding day, they wear gold buttons and next day replace them with wooden ones.For Suket, the longevity and functional aspect of his creations is crucial. He doesnt like hours of weaving, conceptualising, designing getting wasted. It should last with you for years on end.Flora and faunaPunjabs agrarian belt with its mustard fields and bird life reflect on the clothes that he stitches. His quirky silhouettes capture the flora and fauna of the place, particularly the parrots. In our mango orchard, sparrows were everywhere but it was mithoo which I have fond memories of. Whether it was perched on a guava tree or on terraces or at masis home, where parrots were fed green chillies, I have shown them through block printing. Mango orchard is seen through mango trees on my prints and kasuti embroidery.On his salt and pepper beard, he says, he does not have a special grooming technique. Once Svetlana and I visited Punjab, we saw four oldies, all Jatts, riding Enfield bikes. They looked larger than life and magnanimous. Once I grew the beard, it grew up on me and her also.As for food, he sticks to a vegetarian palette unless it is raw fish. Sushi is my weakness. Once Svetlana and I had a hearty laughter that I lived my whole life as a vegetarian but when I started it was with raw fish.For Suket exciting times are ahead as he will be launching his womenswear line this year. They would epitomise classic everyday elegance. Thoughtful designs for all occasions, he relates.As he gingerly eats walnut crumble, Suket says he is keen to enter the luxury furnishing market. I want to design everything sofa, dinning table, even cars.... Well, everything under the hat!"

The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana led by Raju Shetti had parted ways with the BJP on demand of MSP. MSP was also the main plank at Opposition rallies  as also Maratha protests for reservation and farmers unrest  in the state.The decision to extend the MSP to all kharif cropsis truly historic. It would be a step towards economic empowerment of farmers and higher growth in rural economy, which would have a positive impact on the overall Gross State Domestic Product, Fadnavis said while talking to the media. The state had earlier said legislation would be brought in to make non-complaince to MSP a punishable offence.At present, MSP is confined to select farm produce such as paddy (Rs 1,470), jowar (Rs 1,625), wheat (Rs 1,625), maize (Rs 1,365), bajra (Rs 1,330), gram (Rs 4,000), tur (Rs 5,050), moong (Rs 5,225), sunflower (Rs 3,950), soybean (Rs 2,775), groundnut (Rs 4,220), cotton (Rs 4,160), masoor (Rs 3,900), ragi (Rs 1,725), sesame (Rs 5,000), niger seed (Rs 3,825) and mustard (Rs 3,700).The state government has already implemented the reforms in the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) to facilitate farmers to sell their goods in the open market. But it was confronted with two major challenges related to MSP and higher institutional credit.Leader of Opposition in the Legislative Assembly Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil said: MSP was our long-standing demand. But unless it is implemented and brings benefits to farmers, it would prove futile.Raju Shetti said: The government must ensure that MSP is not misused by traders at the cost of farmers.

Patanjali Ayurved had in July last year accused Karamveer 's trust of trademark and copyright violations, including copying Patanjali Ayurved's logo, use of the Patanjali name and launching products that are ""deceptively similar to Patanjali Ayurveds.A few days ago, on January 23, Kalpamrit, the brand under which Patanjali Parivar makes its products like toothpaste, shampoo, honey, mustard oil, spices, etc, was restrained by the Delhi high court from ""using the word 'Patanjali' or logo/artwork similar to those used by Patanjali till further order.""When contacted about the matter, Sudesh Kumar, manager of the Haridwar-based Kaplamrit Ayurved, told TOI on Thursday, ""After receiving the notice from Patanjali Ayurved, we had replied to it almost instantly. We came to know of the high court stay order in the case only through media a few days ago.""Kalpamrit had been started by Karamveer in 2016. After leaving Ramdevs Divya Yog Mandir Trust, he first set up the Maharishi Patanjali Yoga Foundation at Lonavala in Mumbai in 2005 and thereafter the Maharishi Patanjali International Yoga Vidyapeeth at Purkazi in UP. He established the Maharishi Patanjali Parivar Trust in 2015. According to Kumar, Kalpamrit has dozens of outlets in several parts of the country although sale of the products manufactured by us has been temporarily halted after the court order.While both Ramdev and Acharya Balkrishna, his deputy, remained unavailable for comment on the matter despite repeated attempts, Ramdevs Delhi-based spokesperson SK Tijarawala had told ET a few days ago when the court order restraining Kalpamrit was issued that Kalpamrit is using 'Maharishi Patanjali Parivar' on all its packaging of products and they are copying us. We have objected to Kalpamrit's green and saffron stroke logo, which is similar to Patanjali, and also prayed for the cancellation of Maharishi Patanjali Parivar's trademark applications.Pointing out that Ramdev had registered the Patanjali name 25 years ago, Tijarawala said, We were established in 2006 and they were established only in 2015-16. The ET report cited court documents in which Kalpamrit had replied to the notice by stating that ""Patanjali is a proper Indian name and an ancient exponent of Raja Yog and the author of Yoga Sutras, a series of the verses about the eight steps needed to attain self-realisation and, therefore, the plaintiff has no exclusive right upon the trademark in the name Patanjali.""The next hearing of the case is in May."

But she miraculously cured her blindness. When Kishori was born, everyone here felt she was special and got positive vibes around her, Sunil Nimana, the chairman of the gaushala.Her features are most beautiful due to which she has won several beauty contests. She acknowledges our prayers and gives us blessings with her gestures, Nimana added.Nimana said people from across north India visit their gaushala to offer prayers to Kishori and she fulfills all their desires.She is invited for religious functions as she gives gaumutra every five minutes which is used for sprinkling during yagnas and kathas, Nimana added.The gaushala said it was for the first time that they were going to celebrate the birthday of the cow at this scale.A yagna will be performed in the morning following which the massive cake prepared with mustard and semolina will be cut by Kishori. The cake will then be distributed among all the gaushalas of the district as prasad."

(Express Photo/Avinash Nair) Desraji Thakor at his house in Khariya village. (Express Photo/Avinash Nair)Last July, a flash flood had swept away his life, killing 17 members of his family and destroying his cotton crop in Khariya village of Banaskantha district of north Gujarat. This year, 70-year-old Desraji Thakor is battling for survival. Water, the abundance of which had played havoc in his life six months ago, the same water  now its scarcity  has made Thakors life miserable again.Struggling to reap his first crop after the devastating flood of last year, a desperate Thakor family has to draw water from the adjacent Narmada Main Canal using a diesel pump, an act outlawed by the government. Last month, farmers were warned by the Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Limited (SSNNL) against illegal lifting of water from the canal, and some of them were even issued notices.Read | As Gujarat gets NCA nod, CM says crisis avertedWe have sown wheat and castor on six bighas. This is our very first crop after the last years flood. Last year, we had sown cotton at the beginning of the Kharif season, but the flood washed it away. We could not sow anything later in the year as our land was full of mud and slush, says Thakor, resting on his cot under the shade of a neem tree in his backyard and surrounded by the remains of his houses that were swept away by the flood.Banaskantha, the potato capital of the country, reaps harvest round the year  kharif, rabi and summer crops  because of its fertile land, and has the highest harvest of summer crops. This rabi season, farmers in the district have sown crop in over 5.71 lakh hectares, the highest among all the 33 districts of the state. Most of the farmers in the district have sown mustard in over 1.57 lakh hectares, followed by wheat in 74,000 hectares with canal irrigation facilities and cumin in 70,500 hectares. But at the beginning of this year, the BJP government said that it will not be able to provide Narmada waters for irrigation after March 15, citing very low rainfall in the catchment area of the Sardar Sarovar Dam, and warned farmers against sowing summer crops.Read | Gujarat in fix as Sardar Sarovar water level at alarming lowWe spent at least three months cleaning our farmland and making it cultivable. Now, when we are in the middle of the Rabi season, we hear that the government has disallowed lifting of water from the Narmada Main Canal. How will our crops survive, asks Desrajis nephew Pradhan as he joins him on the cot.We spend at least Rs 1,000 on diesel, every time we irrigate our fields. This is the only way, we can irrigate our fields as our borewells were damaged in the floods, adds Pradhan who is hopeful that the state government will not act harshly against the farmers of the village, which was one of the worst-affected areas during last years monsoon.The political allegiance of the Khariya village can be gauged by the BJP flags fluttering on most of the rooftops. In the recently concluded Assembly elections, distribution of Rs 1,500 crore of flood relief had become a major political issue in the district as parties pitched for votes.In the adjoining farmland, 33-year-old Mehraj Desai has just finished watering his mustard crop that he has sown in two of the three bighas he owns. My one bigha of land is not yet suitable for cultivation. You can see, nothing grows in this patch of land, says Desai pointing to an area where the rich loamy soil has been swept away.For farmers like Desai, who are still in the process of rebuilding their homes destroyed in the flood, the Narmada Main Canal, which cuts through the Khariya village, carrying water to Rajasthan is the only source of irrigation.Our families cannot survive by reaping just one crop in a year. We will have to go for the summer crop as well, says Desai who plans to sow bajra in an adjoining piece of land once the rabi crop is harvested.According to the the agriculture department figures, over 8.3 lakh hectares of land was sown under summer crop in May 2017, which largely included crops like Bajra, groundnut, sesame, sugarcane and vegetables. Last year, most of the summer crops were sown in Banaskantha, Patan and Mehsana districts.The situation of the families living on western side of the Narmada Main canal  that breached at several places last year, compounding the flood-situation - is even worse.Shravan Vaghela and two of his brothers, whose 22 bighas of land was completely inundated after the canal got breached, live in tents on a piece of land that resembles a dried-up riverbed. Six months after the floods, the damaged wall of the canal has been rebuilt, but the Vaghela family has managed to rebuild only one of the three houses that once stood at a corner of their farm.We cannot starve to death, and so we have sown wheat in one bigha of land that we have managed to cultivate using water from the canal. The rest is full of sand and gravel. It will take several months to restore them, says Vaghela as children play cricket in an empty plot of land behind the rebuilt house.Not a single government official came to inquire about our condition after the floods, but now officials from the Narmada Nigam (Sardar Sarovar Narmada Nigam Ltd) come in droves to tell us to remove our diesel pumps which we use to irrigate a small portion of our land. Isnt this unfair? asks Vaghela whose borewell still lies buried in two-feet of sand. Nearby, the work of repairing the damaged canal is still underway.Read more from The Indian Express series, Narmada Rationing the Lifeline, here.For all the latest Ahmedabad News, download Indian Express App"
5b176eaa9855b7604256bacd,I don’t fit into female oriented saas-bahu shows: Siddharth Arora,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/varanasi/i-dont-fit-into-female-oriented-saas-bahu-shows-siddharth-arora/articleshow/62851210.cms,2018-02-10,"Shooting on home turf for the first time, Banarasi actor Siddharth Arora , seen in TV shows 'Mukti Bandhan', ' Krishna Kanhaiya ', is more than just happy. Home is always special and getting the opportunity to work from there is just amazing, says the actor who plays the protagonist, in Mandira Kashyap's show which is written by Dr Chandraprakash Dwivedi. Enjoying every minute of the shoot in Varanasi, the actor says, I never realised that such a beautiful location exists on the outskirts of Banaras. To reach Narayanpur, where we are shooting, and which is nearly 20 kms from Banaras, we crossed through an area that is rich in scenic beauty. Blooming mustard fields, the vast expanse of river Ganga made everything appear so pristine and beautiful. In fact, Ganga appeared so inviting, as the water was very clean, that I took time out to swim in the river. When I told the boatman to take me into the mainstream of the river, he appeared apprehensive but I told him main Banaras ka hoon aur maine tairna Ganga mein hi seekha hai. I enjoyed a good swim in the river taking everyone by surprise. What also adds to the pleasure of shooting at home is that one returns to the family after work, feeling more energised and ready to go for the next day. Talking about the show, the actor reveals that it is a finite series where governance during a different era of history will be depicted. Getting the opportunity to work with Dr Chandraprakash Dwivedi, who is an institution in himself, was an amazing experience. He gave insight in lot of things, which will be very helpful for me as an actor, he says.Siddharth Arora shooting for the TV serial in Varanasi (BCCL)Siddharth, who has also earlier appeared in period shows like Singhasan Battisi , says, I always wanted to do something meaningful on television and did not want to be part of saas-bahu saga. The irony is, there is nothing much left for male actors except to do period, historical and mythological shows, if they want to do something meaningful. As an actor, such shows not only add to our insight but also give the opportunity to perform. On the contrary, I dont fit into female-oriented saasbahu shows as I dont feel connected to it. As an actor if I dont have conviction for something, then I cannot perform. Those shows, which are backed by facts and based on our culture, I feel more convinced about, so I can act better in them. Even to the makers of such shows, I appear more historical to them, so they choose me for such shows, he says with a laugh.On a serious note Siddharth believes that such period and mythological shows have a responsibility towards their audience. Youngsters today get to know about our Indian culture through such TV shows rather than through books. Personally, even I gained a lot of information about Ramayan and Mahabharat through the popular shows that were aired on TV, which is still imprinted on my mind. So such period and mythological shows should not be diluted for the sake of TRPs, rather their authenticity should be maintained, he says.On the personal front, the actor says, Staying for longer periods at home certainly mounts the pressure of getting married. Parents tend to talk about marriage when you are around, especially when your peers are getting married. But when they see me work hard and focus on my career, they support me in all my decisions. Personally, I believe that there is never a right time to get married, what matters is to find the right partner. So when you find one, then only one should get married. I am waiting for the right person as I am not in a hurry to get married."

Chief agriculture officer (CAO), Bathinda, Gurditta Singh said rain was beneficial to all the crops including wheat, mustard and gram.Though the region experienced high-velocity winds as well, these are not yet harmful for the crop, he added. The weather forecast has predicted rain till February 13, which will also be beneficial for the crop, the chief agricultural officer said.Moderate rain in DoabaModerate rainfall coupled with strong winds and thunderstorm across the Doaba region on Monday early morning will help to bring down temperature, giving a boost to the wheat crop and other vegetable crops for healthy growth, agriculture experts said.Jalandhar and adjoining districts including Kapurthala and Nawanshahr recorded rainfall ranging from 8mm to 10mm during the early hours on Monday.Farmers need not to worry. In fact these moderate showers are healthy for all crops, especially wheat, which is a temperature-sensitive crop and needs cold conditions to flourish, Dr Jaswinder Singh, Jalandhar agriculture development officer said.The wheat crop, which has to be harvested in April mid to mid-May, does not need water before three months of harvesting for good growth. He said rainfall will help to bring down the chilling effect on the crops and stabilize the temperature.Dip in temperature will help to save the crop from the moisture, which usually results in damaging the crop. If atmospheric conditions remain favourable in the coming days, we can expect bumper production this year, Singh said.A man runs for shelter amid pouring rain in Patiala on Monday. (Bharat Bhushan/HT)Potato harvesting could be delayed if rainfall continuesAgriculture experts in Kapurthala said that though rainfall was good for all the crops, it could delay harvest of potatoes.If rainfall continues for more time, it will lead to a delay in harvesting the potato crop. The crop will not be damaged, though, said Resham Singh, a Kapurthala-based agriculture expert.Rain lashes AmritsarRainfall witnessed across the northern region provided respite to wheat growers in and around Amritsar.Wheat growers in the region had been worried over increasing temperature, which impacts rabi crops negatively.In Amritsar, rainfall started at 12.30 am on Monday. It continued intermittently throughout the night till morning. Similar condition prevailed in the Majha region.Rainfall pushed the temperature down, thereby creating favourable climate for rabi crops. It was light rain, which is good for the health of wheat. It has a positive impact on the quality of grain and yield. Wheat crop needs low temperature, but for the past few days the temperature had not gone down much. The rain has made the weather favourable for vegetables too, said Dalbir Singh Chhina, chief agriculture officer of Amritsar.Tajinderpal Singh, a farmer, said the increasing temperature had been a cause of worry for them but light rainfall has brightened their spirits.Senior medical officer (SMO) Dr Rajinder Arora said rain has settled pollutants and dust particles causing allergic diseases and infections. Rain has settled them down. Increased moisture in the air also helps fight diseases, he added."

This adage fits perfectly on Madhya Pradesh government, that is staring at assembly general elections later this year and mounting anger from the farmers.Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhans sops on Monday for the farmers announced at a Kisan Mahasammelan has burdened the cash-strapped state, further.If sources from the MP finance department are to be believed, the government would need at least Rs 10,000 crore to meet its commitment made to the farmers.To give a boost to the income of farmers, the state would need about Rs 10,000 crore. And around Rs 5,000 crore in the next two months for effective implementation of the scheme, state finance department sources said.Sources further said that Rs 1,340 crore would be required to pay Rs 200 bonus per quintal on the MSP of 67 lakh metric tonne wheat procured from the farmers in 2016-17 while another Rs 340 crore would go to paddy farmers for 17 lakh metric tonnes of produce as bonus. Another Rs 1,700 core for chana, masoor and mustard farmers and Rs 500 crore for onion.Besides, there are the other announcements like making Chambal ravines suitable for farming and expenses on storing produce in ware houses, said the sources.And where would the money come from for government? The CM too did not divulge the details?The government has done all its calculations. Chouhan may earmark some funds in the budget to be presented later this month. The money may also be arranged after slashing down budgetary provisions of different departments. If the CMs plan is executed, MP might not see any new development works in 2018-19, top sources said seeking anonymity.After having made the announcement, the chief minister was elated, mainly due to the positive response from the farmers, who have been expecting fair deal from him on their produce. The chief minister was seen returning to the dais thrice to repeat his announcements, and extending the Shivratri greeting to the eagerly waiting farmers.Sources said the governments main concern is small and marginal farmers, who often tend to work as agricultural labourers and have not seen a significant rise in their incomes, despite an impressive agriculture growth in agriculture reported by the state over the years. Though MPs farm performance look impressive, the distribution of gains are not reflected in their income. For the rabi 2018, the MSP and bonus announcements will be done after the produce is procured, sources said.Minister for agriculture Gaurishankar Bisen said, For farmers, there is no dearth of funds with the government. The government is committed to fulfil its promises.However, the farmers leaders are still not happy.National president of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji said, This is another stunt in an election year.

Her partner, a two-wheeler mechanic in Punjab, proposed her on the social networking site and by July 2016 the duo tied the knot. Twenty nine-year-old Atasi Karmakars unusual love story is now being portrayed in a documentary that will be screened on February 20 at Jadavpur University as part of the Love in the Time of Madness package.Atasi completed her schooling from Sealdahs St Pauls Missions school before pursing English honours at Bangabasi Morning College. The relationship with her family turned sour in 2009 after the death of her father, an ex-employee of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. In 2014, Atasis family got her admitted to the hospital because of alleged violent behaviour  a trait that Atasi refutes.She speaks fluent English and describes love as her elixir of life. Though I did nothing special on Valentines Day, I know I wouldnt have existed today had I not found love, she said from her Bhogpur residence in Punjab.According to Rishita Mukherjee, advocacy officer of Anjali Mental Health Rights Organisation that helped in rehabilitating Atasi, She spent a year at the Calcutta Pavlov Hospital. Irrespective of her clinical diagnosis, her mental health condition was severely affected by her familial turbulence even after her recovery. Love healed her.The story of Atasi finding her love has all the ingredients of a Yashraj romance, down to the last detail. Incidentally, Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge is her favourite film. Strangely, she did fall for a Punjabi and now lives in the vicinity of mustard fields near Jalandhar. According to director Putul Mahmood, It seemed to me that nobody really believed in love stories anymore. When I met Atasi and heard the story of her love with Sandesh Kumar, I was amazed. Here was love in the time of madness; love with all its magic and the power to transform. It had given her the wings to fly out of the prison of mental illness and family oppression. Atasis love was a fairy tale and I realised that this tale needed to be told.After being discharged from the hospital, Atasi found a job as a distributor of health product. During that time, she met someone who went by the name Deep Harry on Facebook. One thing led to the other and soon the duo was talking to each other regularly. Thats when Atasi learnt that Deeps real name was Sandesh Kumar Nanglu. A Punjabi from Jalandhars Bhogpur village, Sandesh had migrated to Saudi Arabia to work as a car mechanic there."

One quintal is required for one hectare of wheat. The crops procurement starts from April 1.The agriculture department gave clearance for release of Rs 7.5 crore, and the next is release from the finance department. But the major chunk  Rs 17.5 crore  still remains pending for clearance with the agriculture department.We are to get Rs 7.5 crore very soon, said JS Bains, the states agriculture director, adding merely, Once we get the money, it will reach farmers in a week.The Centre provides 60% of the subsidy under the National Food Security Mission (NFSM) and Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY), and has already transferred funds into the states accounts, said officials who did not want to be named as they are not authorised to speak to the media.This non-payment exposes the seriousness of the state government towards welfare of farmers, said Harmeet Singh, president of a faction of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU), The basic thing for a crop is seed. And the subsidy in proportion to the wheat grown in Punjab is negligible anyway.He added that the directorate does not give seed subsidy for mustard and maize, which means government is not interested in diversification of crops."

Such was the extent of the injuries that bodies of three firemen were never found.(Action taken: Following the incident, Amarinder Singh visited the spot and Navjot Sidhu announced that proper safety equipment will be provided to fire fighters and that a fire audit will be conducted in Ludhiana to keep a tab on fire safety arrangements in the industrial units. But nothing has been done at ground level. Also, the compensation announced by the government have still not been disbursed completely.

It is now making efforts to woo farmers.Reeling off a host of statistics, Shekhawat said the BJP government has also waived off cooperative crop loans worth 50,000 for farmers.The Rajasthan government will establish warehouses with capacity of 5 lakh metric tons at a cost of 350 crore, he said.He further said that the government has disbursed interest-free loans worth 80,000 crore to farmers and has also issued grants worth 38,000 crore.The government will provide interest-free loans to the RAJFED for purchase of mustard and chickpea from farmers at the minimum support price, the minister said, adding that the government will provide 2 lakh electricity connections to farmers."

So, if not a miracle, how do you explain this? asks Randheer Singh with pious indignation. The 63-year-old retired municipal corporation employee looks reverently at the bronze-coloured reptile that others are regarding with both curiosity and devotion. Nem Chand Tyagi, a wizened old farmer , who has been taking care of the makeshift shrine, claims that attempts were made to release the snake in the woods, but it returns to its chosen land each time. There are gasps as people take this information in.Rewla Khanpur, a well-off village of cemented streets, SUVs and farmhouses on the Delhi-Haryana border near Dwarka , has suddenly become an unlikely pilgrimage spot . Every day, people cross the mustard fields and congregate at a sand heap, in front of which are a dozen concrete bricks stacked to form a small hidey hole. A red cloth lies before it, strewn with marigold flowers. The other objects there  a framed picture of Lord Shiva and a small stone Shivling  indicate that the villagers think the four-foot-long snake is a godsend, a naag devta, no less.We have been offering milk to naag devta. It doesnt eat anything else, says the 75-year-old Tyagi. Three days ago, Randheer Singh even organised a bhandara (community meal) in the snakes honour. It was attended by 700 devotees from 15 villages, including Rewla, Chhawla, Shikarpur, and Kanganhedi. These days, even mahants and politicians have been coming for a darshan, says Singh.Indeed, Mahant Sitaram Maharaj, who presides over the neighbouring Dharampur Shiva Mandir, paid a visit on Friday and termed the appearance of the snake a miracle, upon hearing which the crowd deliriously raised chants of Har Har Mahadev!The more sceptical of the people, among them wildlife experts, see no miracle in the snakes appearance. It has been identified as a venomous spectacled cobra specimen (Naja naja). Faiyaz Khudsar, scientist in-charge at the Yamuna Biodiversity Park, said the reptile appeared to be a juvenile, pale and malnourished, and possibly in need of urgent help. Prima facie, the snakes paleness and its behaviour of returning to the spot indicate it was probably kept in captivity and thinks the place is its home. It has possibly also been defanged, said Khudsar. He warned that milk should not be fed to the cobra, which cannot digest it and can actually cause it to die.But unmindful of this possibility, devotees offer sweets and bowls of milk. And as the blue smoke of incense sticks rise and fill the air with a cloying sweetness, some of the more daring stretch out their hands to touch the cobra. It hisses and retreats into its hole among the grey bricks. The devotees content themselves by joining their palms in obeisance and leaving behind offerings of 10-50-100 rupee notes.The snake made its appearance a month ago, according to villagers, and has now made this spot near a broken concrete wall its own. There are the unbelieving who speculate that this is all a ploy to grab the plot, which belongs to the department of floods and irrigation. But the majority are certain that something divine has occurred and want a temple to be built there. Mandir to yahi banaenge jo bhi ho (whatever happens, a temple has to be built here), asserts Moorti Devi, 60, who has brought her grandkids to receive the snakes blessings.A meeting of surrounding villages was recently called to discuss the matter of a temple. The unanimous decision was that the government has to give us permission to build a temple, said the youthful Dipak Tyagi, who helps maintain the temporary shrine. We will approach the mayor of South Delhi Municipal Corporation on Saturday."

This will be done to show political leaders that if ordinary farmers cannot gather in the state capital, then they too cannot enter villages easily. Amra Ram said when Prime Minister Narendra Modi visits Jhunjhunu on March 8, farmers from Sikar, Churu and Jhunjhunu will meet him to remind him of promises made ahead of the 2014 Lok Sabha polls and tell him how the BJP government in the state has reneged on promises made to agitating farmers in September last year.Amra Ram said permission is being sought from the PMO for the farmers meeting with the prime minister. Earlier, on February 22, farmers had decided to gather in Jaipur from across the state. However, the government clamped down on the protest and arrested over 2,000 farmers. The farmers are demanding that the state implement loan waiver, grant Rs2000 pension to aged farmers and take care to see that stray cattle do not destroy standing crops.Chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced waiver of loans up to Rs50,000 in the state budget earlier this month but it was restricted to loans availed from cooperative banks.Amra Ram said farmers will be busy harvesting crops in the next few days. After that, if the promises are still not kept, we will prevent all district collectorates from working on May 1. We will come out in strength to protest the anti-farmer and anti-worker stances of the Centre and state. If the Centre, in the last three years, could waive over Rs17 lakh crore in taxes to industry, why cannot it take care of the Rs12 lakh crore that it would lose if it granted loan waiver to farmers? Whether wheat, mustard or chickpea, farmers are being forced to sell all crops at less than minimum support price. Dairy farmers are incurring losses of up to Rs15 per litre on milk, when those buying milk are not getting it at a lesser price.Asked if the Congress was serving as an effective opposition, Amra Ram said, At a time when farmers are suffering, all that the political leadership of this state can discuss are ghosts in the assembly! When the farmers were in agitation mode in September last year, we did not receive any support at all from Congress. The farmers are coming together, though. It is clear the government can no longer ignore farmers. Last year, we announced our protest against the electricity tariff hike and the government immediately rolled back the hike.The CPI-M leadership said it would ally with all those seeking a government that did not follow the economic policies of the BJP and the Congress. The Congress is just Team B of the BJP. We will see if we can contest all 200 seats in the state assembly in the polls later this year by gathering together like-minded people, he said."

The victim Afrazul (inset) was hacked and burnt alive in Rajasthan allegedly over an affair.We began this New Year with a journey of the Karwan e Mohabbat into Bengal. Few parts of India are untouched by the swirling tides of hate, therefore we had resolved to take our Karwan to at least one state every month, visiting the homes of families hit by acts of hate violence. There, as we did in our travels to eight states in September 2017, we would assure the bereaved families that they are not alone, that there are many in the country who care and who suffer with them. We would continue to tell their stories to the rest of the country, for not just solidarity, but to appeal to our conscience. A score of senior and young journalists and writers, lawyers, a photographer, a trade unionist, an amateur film-maker, researchers, students and rights and peace workers joined the Karwan in Kolkata.For me it was fitting but emotionally wrenching to start this years Karwan with a visit to the home of Afrazul Khan, the migrant worker whose life had ended last year in a particularly brutal hate killing. I had gone days after he was bludgeoned, hacked and then burnt alive, assiduously filmed by a teenager on December 6 2017, to Rajsamand. We learnt there that Rajsamand district, like many parts of Rajasthan, is served by thousands of migrants from Malda, mostly Bengali Muslim workers skilled in construction and road-building. They live lonely lives of hard labour some 10 months every year far away from their families and homes, to feed and educate their families. Just four days after the killing, most of the workers had fled home in terror. We had met in Rajsamand Afrazuls son-in-law, who the police had asked to stay to assist with the investigations. I had resolved then that the Karwan must visit Afrazuls family in Malda.In our journey in Malda, we passed mustard fields in flower and freshly transplanted paddy fields, before we wound our way through narrow lanes to Afrazuls home in Saiyadpur village. The fruit of his long years of hard labour was that his family lived in a pucca brick home. Led inside, we met his widow Gulbahar Bibi, and his three daughters. He had no sons.We explained to his family who we were. Her elder son-in-law, Musharraf, who we had met in Rajsamand after the murder, recognised us. Afrazuls widow Bibi was composed, but her face was strained, breaking down occasionally. She said they wanted nothing now except the hanging of the man who killed her husband so cruelly, for no reason except his religion. Her daughters fondly recalled their father, who had devoted his entire life to their care. He had educated all his daughters, and married off the elder two. The youngest, Habiba Khatoon, 16 years old, was in Class 10, and wanted to study further. A private residential school had given her admission after her fathers cruel death.Afrazul had come to them last during Eid ul Zuha. But even the morning he died, he had called his wife according to his custom, at 8.30 in the morning. He had asked after his beloved youngest daughter  had she gone to school? His wife asked him if he had eaten. He said he would come to see them at the village at the end of that week. This was the last time that they spoke.His eldest daughter, Jyotsnara Begum, wept as she repeated, My father was a good man. We have no brothers. There is no one to take care of us now. I want that his killer should be hung. I tried to tell them that I agreed that he deserved severe punishment (although I believe no one should be given the death penalty). But I said I felt that even far more than him, the people, the organisations, and the leaders  up to those who hold high offices  are those who are even guiltier than him, because they have fostered the frenzied and irrational hate that blinds and drives men like their fathers killer. I told them a little about what I had learned about the man who had killed their father. (We had visited his family as well when in Rajsamand).Outside Afrazuls home, a large number of men had gathered. Most said that they were circular migrant workers. We have little or no land here. There is very little work to be had in agriculture. There are no factories. We can stay alive if we travel to far corners of India in search of work. They managed to save six or seven thousand rupees a month which they sent home.Many had returned in droves from Rajasthan after Afrazuls killing, and were still too frightened to go back there to work. They said they had never faced violence in Rajasthan before this. But after all the killings of Muslims that we see all over India these days, we have started living with fear. We never know who will attack us, and where. But they know they will have to set out one day soon again, otherwise their families will starve, and they would not be able to educate and marry off their children. If not Rajasthan, we will have to find another part of India to travel to in search of work.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee recently made a welcome and important announcement for such workers, that her government would ensure 200 days of work each year for them near their villages if they chose to stay back. If she ensures this, it could be a model for the entire country for all circular migrants, estimated at 100 million workers forced to leave their homes in search of work each year.It is hard enough to be forced to spend most of your adult life toiling at low and uncertain wages without a decent room or food or the company of your loved ones in faraway lands. If now you also have to live with the fear that you might be killed just because of your religion, just trying to survive for those you love is an enterprise so dangerous that it becomes too hard to bear.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The rainfall led to decline in temperature, with a dip of 4 degrees Celsius in the minimum and maximum temperatures, while cloudy conditions prevailed in Jaipur and elsewhere.The unseasonal rainfall has caused losses to the farmers in the Shekhawati region, who have been protesting against discrepancies in the State governments offer for loan waiver announced in the 2018-19 budget. Farmers have rejected the one-time relief restricted to those who obtained loans from cooperative banks and have demanded a blanket farm debt waiver.Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje has expressed concern over the situation and ordered a survey of crops at the earliest in order to assess the extent of damage. The District Collectors and Disaster Management Department will shortly submit a report to the State government in this regard.Congress walkoutThe Congress MLAs staged a walkout in the State Assembly on Monday, while accusing the government of ignoring the plight of farmers whose standing crops have been damaged."

While the latter gave his life for Indias freedom from the British, Prof Gurdev Singh Khush, as one of the pioneers of rice revolution, has played a stellar role in the worlds freedom from hunger.Having spent much of professional life on developing high-yielding varieties at International Rice Research Institute at Manila where his portrait adorns the main airport, Khush has won all top research awards, save the Nobel Prize.Currently, he is an adjunct professor at University of California, Davis, but his heart still beats for Punjab. On his annual outing to his home state, the 84-year-old spoke to Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak and Senior Assistant Editor Manraj Grewal Sharma on challenges facing Punjabs agriculture, and the way forward. Excerpts:How do you define the crisis in Punjabs agriculture?Misuse of our resources is the root of the crisis. We have depleting water aquifers; the soil is no longer productive. We have taken out all the organic matter from the soil, its down to 0.4% when it should be above 3%. Our nitrogen use efficiency has also gone down. Salinisation is affecting southern Punjab. Our farmers are using free electricity to pump more water than required. I spoke to Parkash Singh Badal when he was chief minister, about the need to stop free power (to farm tubewells), but he said he couldnt roll it back. Somebody has to bite the bullet and stop free electricity. Punjab farmers can afford to pay their electricity bills. In the long term, climate change will also affect Punjab adversely. The Himalayas are heating up at double the rate of the rest of India. When the glaciers start retreating, we will start losing our water resources.Why is farming no longer profitable?Our productivity is stagnating due to the improper use of water and fertilisers, while the cost of production is going up every year. Punjabs farmers are in a bind. The crop production here is comparable with other countries, but, nationally, our productivity is much lower. Even Bangladesh has better rice productivity than us.In a rather blunt message to the state, Niti Ayog has said it does not need Punjabs foodgrains for national food security, and that farmers should be encouraged to sell their crops in the open market. What are your views?This means the productivity of grains in eastern India and Madhya Pradesh is going up. The production of wheat in MP, for instance, is quite high. The demand for foodgrains is bound to fall after people reach a certain level of prosperity. People will then demand more vegetables, milk, and meat. We should start thinking of alternative crops right now, even though the switch may take several years. And we have to start reducing the area under wheat and paddy (rice).The state government incurs a bill of Rs 7,700 crore (a year) for free power. The state should not foot this bill.Can farmers be convinced to switch to other crops without an accompanying minimum support price?The solution is to grow alternative crops. If you can provide MSP for other crops, it will be good. Wheat can be replaced with mustard. We import oil worth billions. Mustard is one crop that can reduce our imports.You led international research that revolutionised the rice productivity the world over. But, ironically,rice is seen today as a villain of the piece in Punjab. Why?Yes, I have heard rice being blamed for all kinds of problems, including cancer, which is an exaggeration. But rice has caused the depletion of aquifers. We must reduce the area under rice from 3 million acres to 1.5 million acres in the next few years. North China faced the same problem, and the government finally put an end to rice production there. Soybean can be a good alternative to rice. Its an oil and protein crop, which is very productive and can yield an average of 4 tonnes an acre. I have been urging Punjab Agricultural University to breed a soybean variety that can be grown successfully in Punjab. Hybrid maize is also a good alternative as it is great feed for poultry and animals.There is an indication that the central government may completely do away with MSP. What do you think about that?If that happens, farmers will no longer be that determined to grow wheat and rice. Scrapping MSP may do some good.Why has much-talked about diversification failed to take off in Punjab?We have been hearing about diversification for several years but nothing has changed on the ground. Farmers continue to grow wheat and rice because of the MSP and high profitability. Punjabs agriculture owes its profitability to rice, and the state government gave free electricity; why would a farmer not grow rice!Prime Minister Narendra Modi has promised to double farm income by 2022. Is that possible?No, I dont think that will happen, because there are too many people dependent on agriculture and the farm sizes are too small to be profitable. The only way you can double farm income is by moving a lot of people from farms. China did that by moving farmers with 1-acre landholding to construction industry and other fields. Major investments in livestock industry can make a difference but unfortunately we cant export meat.What do you think of farm suicides?I understand these are due to farm indebtedness, and that itself is due to two reasons. One, every farmers wants to buy a tractor even if his landholding doesnt justify it. I wonder why banks give loans to such small farmers knowing that they dont need a tractor and wouldnt be able to repay the loan. Also, there is the problem of unproductive loans due to the practice of ostentatious marriages, et al.Capt Amarinder Singhs Congress government came to power on the promise of farm debt waiver. Is that a solution?They are doing this to get more votes. But where are they going to get the money for paying off this debt? I think it is not a solution but a political promise.The Centre wants Punjab to club all the subsidies and pay them directly to the bank account of individual farmer. Will that work?I dont know about other subsidies but, if this can stop free power, it will be a very important step. The state government incurs a bill of Rs 7,700 crore (a year) for free power. The state should not foot this bill. Its an unnecessary burden. No economist will agree to this. Where will be funds for any development if the government spends so much on free power? There should be meters on motors (tubewells).Coming to tech generation, public investment in agriculture research was 0.8% at the end of the 12th Plan, but it was slashed to 0.4% in 2016-2017. Whats your take?How can you double farm income without investing in research on new varieties? Then there is the national policy on not using GMO (genetically modified organism) crops even though these can improve farm productivity. But someone in the government cant make up his mind. Very senior professors in the US have written to both former PM Manmohan Singh and the present PM Modi, but to no avail. GM mustard is excellent, but the government of India has not approved it even though it imports GM canola oil from Canada.Our schools cant produce any scientists, but the government can bring about a change if it has the political will.What do you think of the role of Punjab Agricultural University in the present scenario?PAU was one of the top universities of India with very good research; but it has declined. That is very unfortunate. Two-three years ago, the V-C did not even have funds to pay the salary or pension of his employees.The share of agriculture in rural employment stands at 64%. Most farmers would like to quit given a choice. Why do Punjab youngsters want to go abroad instead of tilling the fields?Our farms are so small that our youngsters dont want to work on them. Also, there is no industry left in Punjab. Be it Jalandhar, Batala or Goraya, industry has died because the government paid no attention to it. There is a problem of quality of governance.What would be your advice to the Punjab government?I think the Punjab government has to pay proper attention to PAU and ensure better research for diversification. If you cant stop free electricity at once, do it step by step. It is very important for the future of Punjabs agriculture. The state government is doing a great disservice to Punjab farmers by giving them free power. I hope Capt Amarinder will do away with it. The government must also improve the state of schools in villages. It is pitiable. Our schools cant produce any scientists, but the government can bring about a change if it has the political will. There are two big examples of what one good leader can do. Former chief minister Partap Singh Kairon introduced murabbabandi (land consolidation), while Lachhman Singh Gill built a network of link roads. We need another Kairon or Gill to improve the state of our agriculture and schools.Why did you not join PAU as a vice-chancellor even though successive state governments approached you?I didnt think I would be able to work with the politicians here. I dont think I could work under the conditions here. Also, I enjoyed my research so much that there was no reason for me to change my course."
5b16f9ae9855b72ada089017,A date with contemporary India in Houston,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-date-with-contemporary-india-in-houston/article23019256.ece,2018-03-10,"Stories have a universal appeal in making the mundane intriguing. Its no wonder then, that storytelling happens to be one of the oldest tools of passing on information in the world. Traditions, customs, laws of the land and events might differ amongst cultures, but as soon as theyre transformed into stories, they become accessible experiences for one and all. One does not however arrive at a story empty handed. We come to new stories with our bags full of old ones and so, it is but natural that we also walk away with both  the newer additions making space within the already existing contents. The emptying of or the piling in of more stuff into our bags happens with our interaction with these new encounters, that vary with context. One that can be geographical, socio-economic or cultural, gender-based or historical. What separates us as people also unites us as citizens of a shared world.In fact, it is often our most personal and most subjectively narrated experiences that strike a chord with complete strangers. UK-based photographer Mohini Chandra who uses family photographs in her work to evoke memory and provide a way for people from different communities to tell stories about their own experiences couldnt agree more. Chandra is one amongst 48 photographic and new media artists of Indian origin, from across the globe, to be showing work at the FotoFest 2018 Biennial in Houston, that commences today in Texas. Being the first and longest running photographic arts festival in the United States started in 1983 with its first ever biennial in 1986, it has been a pioneer in bringing international exposure to the arts from emerging regions. This years focus on South Asia is a first for the festival, which has previously turned its lens on Latin America (1992), Korea (2000), China (2008), Russia (2012) and the Arab World (2014).Spotlighting the unknownIts very important for the medium to stop limiting its history and understanding to Europe and America, it needs to accept difference from other cultures and continents, explains Sunil Gupta, artist and lead curator for the biennial. For an American audience, work by Indians both from India and the diaspora is virtually unknown. For them modern photography is a white American idea and that which is outside their knowledge framework does not exist, he adds. Gupta along with FotoFest executive director and biennial co-curator Steven Evans travelled extensively, both across India and abroad, personally meeting artists and reviewing work that best portrays the various facets that constitute contemporary India.Partition to presentThe work chosen for the fest falls within the time frame of the last 20 years, though viewers familiar with Indias socio-economic and political history would be able to trace these roots back to seeds sown further back when the country went through huge economic and political transformations. Starting from Independence and post-Partition struggles of the 1950s to the more recent liberalisation of the economy in 1991 or insurgency of 1989 in Kashmir, impacts of these events are something which the nation is still grappling with. In addition to these, todays India also struggles with caste and gender based violence, environmental issues, internal and external terrorism, amongst a host of other things. So if art reflects the society it emerges from, then the country today offers an endless spectrum of subjects to work with.Personal projects like Chandras Kikau Street , where she revisits her fathers childhood house in Suva, Fiji, explores themes like migration, cross-cultural identity through personal history and memory. On a similar note stands Punjab born, Toronto based multi-media artist Sarindar Dhaliwals first film/video project Olive, Almond & Mustard , where she draws on her bitter sweet memories from childhood as a migrant to Southall, London in the 1950s-60s, trying to cope and fit into an alien new world. My mothers insistence on this grooming ritual (oiling and plaiting hair with almond oil and yoghurt), common in the country of her birth (India), was at odds with my desire to assimilate into the culture of my adopted homeland, she shares. Her film, records this alienating experience, exacerbated by the political and journalistic diatribes against immigrants in England at that time.Change is the constantCloser home, Mumbai-based photographer Apoorva Guptay through his work, Bombay Memorial tries to hold onto the fast fading Bombay that he grew up in. His images, which he hopes to soon publish as a book, are a result of numerous walks through the streets and bylanes of the city over the years. Shot on film, Guptays Bombay resides in between whats left of the older order of things and the transformation, as it unfolds. If at all photography has something to lose, its the craft, he states, referring to the second transformation that he is speculative about  that of the medium itself. With phone photography and Instagram, change is inevitable, but often comes at the consumerist and technological cost of damage to the craft, where ease of shooting and the need to share, throws technique, reasoning and responsibility out of the window.The biennial also provides a platform to engage with both established and well-known names like Jitish Kallat, Pushpamala N., Shilpa Gupta and Pablo Bartholomew, as well as artists like Guptay, who are showcasing their work internationally for the very first time. To audiences who have perhaps missed out on some important works shown elsewhere at another point, this is a great opportunity to interact with the art over the six weeks of the biennial. To Evans, the biennial is as diverse a mix as the country it represents, where studio-based conceptual methodologies meet contemporary photo documentary and journalistic approaches, while poetic strategies dialogue with direct calls to activism and resistance. Only fair, he reasons for a society as heterogeneous as India.FotoFest 2018 Biennial will be held in Houston, Texas between March 10-April 22; f or more details see www.fotofest.orgMy mothers insistence on this grooming ritual (oiling and plaiting hair with almond oil and yoghurt), common in the country of her birth (India), was at odds with my desire to assimilate into the culture of my adopted homelandSarindar DhaliwalMulti-media artist"
5b16fc5a9855b75cf6a8f687,An enduring rista,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/an-enduring-rista/article23018327.ece,2018-03-10,"A wonderful aroma that wafts in from a floor above our flat every now and then stops me in my tracks. I can smell mustard oil and asafoetida, and know that some delicious Kashmiri dish is being cooked by our Kashmiri neighbours.Its a cuisine thats always been close to my heart. I like both Kashmiri Muslim and Hindu food, but I think I enjoy the latter even more than the former. The two kinds of regional food are similar  but also vastly different.I remember how thrilled I was when Chor Bizarre first opened up in Delhi in Asaf Ali Road eons ago. Since then, of course, several Kashmiri outlets  many of them catering units  have sprung up in the city. And Dilliwallahs are getting to know their gushtaba from their rista, and their nadru from their knol-knol.And, increasingly, we are discovering the differences between Pandit and Muslim food, too. What gives Kashmiri food its distinctive taste is the tempering in mustard oil of asafoetida and dried ginger, and the use of yoghurt and turmeric. Unlike the Muslim food, there is no garlic in the dishes.I had a great Kashmir Pandit meal some evenings ago at The Holiday Inn in Mayur Vihar. The coffee shop there  called Caf on 3  had a special Kashmiri food festival, organised by Rajni Jinsi, who I discovered is a great cook. The festival is over, but Jinsi runs her own outfit called Rajnis Kitchen (Ph Nos: 9899008238 and 9911469649).It was a stupendous meal  and I tried out many of the special dishes of the region, from kabargah (double-cooked lamb rack), fried fish, fried lotus stem patties to roganjosh, gosht yakhni and veth chaman, which is a dish of cottage cheese cooked with Kashmiri red chillies.What I really loved about the food was that they were all mildly spiced, yet each dish had its own characteristic taste.Contrary to popular belief, Kashmir food is not always rich. The moong dal that I had, for instance, was delightfully light and delicious. The dal had been cooked in some milk with pieces of radish, which added their own sharp taste to it.The yakhni, in yoghurt gravy, was smooth, and the Kashmiri chilli-red roganjosh was as pleasing to the eye, as to the palate. I use a lot of Kashmiri red chillies, for they add colour and a certain taste to a dish, but are not red hot. The KP roganjosh relies heavily on hing and does not use garlic, onions or tomatoes. Jinsis roganjosh was cooked with some yoghurt, dried ginger powder, fennel powder and some garam masala.I had thought I would stay away from the vegetables, but my young friend, Chef Suprabhath Roy Chowdhury (F&B director of the hotel), urged me to try out the schochal wangan  eggplant and Kashmiri haak  and I am happy he did. Tempered with dried ginger, some cloves and with the taste of tamarind in it, it was simply out of this world. What was equally delicious was the sweet rice  modur polav  which surprisingly really went well with the meat dishes.Another great aspect of Kashmiri food is the array of chutneys that come with it. There is a sharp radish chutney, a crunchy walnut one and fragrant one prepared with mint leaves.Rajnis Kitchen can cater for 15 people or so. I think she is one of the best cooks I have met in a while, and I hope the Kitchen does roaring business. Let the fires keep burning!"

5aeab8c09855b73f522c2831,Private Grounds Fuel Love of Cricket in Gurgaon,https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurgaon/private-grounds-fuel-love-of-cricket-in-gurgaon/story-ENYyuVXUKGu9J3DICo5xCL.html,2018-03-11,"With Gurgaons real estate prices skyrocketing during the boom years, neither the developers nor the government gave much thought to where the citys burgeoning population will find the space for sports.More so, the citys corporate executives, who remain ensconced in tall glass buildings throughout the week and on weekends, make a beeline to their new colonies to give into their love of cricket.Gurgaon has enough gyms and private clubs but when it comes to a dedicated piece of real estate to set up a playground, there was none.That was until the landowners along the Golf Course Road and Gurgaon-Faridabad Road spotted the great opportunity. Eyeing the corporate clientele, they started creating private cricket grounds. As a result, dedicated cricket grounds have come up in Ullahwas, Kadarpur, Badshahpur, Bairampur, Wazirabad, Baliyawas, Palam Vihar, Sector 23 and one in the midst of the Maruti car yard on Carterpuri Road in old Gurgaon.As per a rough estimate, there are around 12 to 15 well-equipped cricket grounds in the city  the number could be close to 50 if one includes those with just basic facilities.These grounds are available at a cost of Rs 5,000 to Rs 6,000 per team for a match and the grounds come with a well-prepared pitch, a green outfield and washrooms for players, a majority of whom are corporates from Gurgaons manufacturing and IT hubs.A single such ground hosts three matches a day and five if there are floodlights. The rate for cricket under the lights is about Rs 6,000 to Rs 8,000 per match for each team.Deepak Dahiya, a businessman, who manages a cricket team and also ran a cricket ground earlier, said it takes around Rs 6 lakh to Rs 7 lakh to convert a four-acre plot into a cricket ground.There is a great demand for cricket grounds and other sports, particularly on weekends, as corporates have taken to sports in a big way. Some of these companies have 10 to 12 teams as everyone wants to play. The idea is more about playing and enjoying the game than winning, Dahiya said.It is not just for the money that landowners are promoting the game. The villagers simply love cricket and body building. That prompted them to build grounds, rope in experts to manage the green turf and install floodlights in order to hold T-20 tournaments on the lines of the much popular Indian Premier League.Also, the land in these villages is not fertile and, owing to a lack of water, only mustard and wheat grow in these fields, thus making farming uneconomical.In comparison, the cricket greens watered by sprinklers and managed by ground boys are helping them rake in the moolah. Most of the workers and support staff, including the umpires, come from the villages and the whole enterprise is giving rise to employment as well.Ravinder Rajput, who manages the Shyam Cricket Ground in Ullahwas village since 2014, said a majority of the teams booking their ground has a corporate background. The teams have money to spend and want good facilities. This prompts owners to invest more in facilities and the local youth end up with jobs and a regular income, he said.Another side benefit is that youth from these cash-rich villages spend more time on the ground rather than going to pubs and restaurants.Pankaj Tomar, a cricketer and real estate dealer, said these areas were urbanised after 2009 and as the rates skyrocketed in sectors 60 to 71, an acre went for as high as Rs 15 crore in some instances.It is good that these villagers have taken to cricket, body-building and promoting sports as these channelise their energy in the right direction. Sports lovers of the city have also greatly benefited as government facilities are negligible, he said.The success of farmers has motivated even corporates and realtors to offer sports facilities they created in their residential hubs to cricket-crazed residents, who are ready to spend good money for a good experience.Puru Singh, along with his two partners, carved out the Sports Maidan, a corporate venture in Sector 58, which has a cricket ground, a football ground, tennis courts, and a facility for cage football.This space is built for sports mixed with entertainment and has club-like facilities for players. The rates are not high and we have high-quality floodlights, video recording facility and provisions to provide live commentary, Singh, who also organises cricket tournaments, said.Sports Maidan also has a restaurant and it organises cricket-themed parties for children, apart from a training school for children.Sports lovers too are happy as they only have to shell out around Rs 1,000 per weekend for a two-match stint. The company does not pay for these matches. We chip in Rs 500 each for ground fee and spend a bit more on food, but the experience is worth it, Manish Jain, a corporate executive, who plays regularly at a ground in Bijwasan, said.Most players say playing cricket under the sun in winters and under the floodlights during the summer help them de-stress and also breaks the monotony of being cooped up at work. It helps in team building, forming bonds and making friends, which often lead to more parties, Nand Sharma, a senior executive, said."

A total of 178 centres for mustard and 127 centres for gram have been opened in the first phase.State Cooperative Minister Ajay Singh Kilak said here on Tuesday that the new centres would be established in all Kraya Vikraya Sahakari Samitis across the State. Farmers in all divisions would be able to get themselves registered online for procurement from Wednesday, he added.We will also do away with the traditional practice of surveyors assessing the crops. New committees comprising the Krishi Mandi secretaries and cooperative inspectors will examine the crops as per the fair average quality (FAQ) norms to ensure correct assessment of the produce, Mr. Kilak said.The farmers, who have been agitating for crop loan waiver and remunerative prices for their produce, are likely to get relief with the State government offering to give them MSP at new centres. Mr. Kilak affirmed that the procurement would not stop even if the handling and storage facilities were lacking at the centres.While a maximum of 25 quintals of produce would be procured from each farmer, the Cooperative Department would pay incentives to the officers and employees engaged in the procurement work, said the Minister."

Watching his fingers move deftly over the strings, listeners were enthralled with melody of the chaturangui slide guitar, an instrument he invented. Attributing the magic to his gurus and parents, he modestly remarks, It is all their blessings.We meet for a quick bite before Debashishs concert amidst the green environs of Triveni Terrace Caf. With a quick glance at the menu, he asks for aloo tikki and tea. Nothing like chai to make conversation, riyaz and performance enjoyable, he remarks.A geography graduate from the Calcutta University, Debashish chose an unusual instrument  slide guitar  to master and play Hindustani classical music. The genesis lies in the Hawaiian guitar my father presented me in 1966 when I was three. Plucking it, I was enamoured by its shape and sound, falling in love instantly, he says, sipping tea. The guitar is still with him. You cant ditch your first love, can you, he jests.Coming from a family steeped in musical tradition, Debashish must have been tempted to play other instruments. Yes, I have been attracted to several instruments. I like the melodious sound of sitar and sarod, veenas lower base sound, santoors staccato harmonic natural sound and sarangis pathos-filled soundscape. This enchantment made him learn sitar and sarod from Haradhan Roy Chowdhury and Gokul Nag, a well known sitar player. From them, I picked the technique of plucking with two fingers and manipulation of fingers to produce varied sounds.The vocal training under his mother, Manjushree Bhattacharya of Gwalior gharana and Sunil Kumar Bhattacharya trained in Patiala, helped Debashish hone his skills. He credits his parents for more. They laid the foundation of my life and music. My mother would sing even while cooking and my father would always be with the tanpura during his spare time. All this created a musical ambience at home. Being strict teachers, they wouldnt tolerate half-hearted attempts. On missing a note during practice, my mother hit me with the cooking spud. My father would encourage whenever there was a setback but ensured that awards never got to my head. He would make me rehearse a taan several hours till I got it perfect.Impressing the guruAll this was not in vain as it prepared him for a gruelling 10-year stay with Brij Bhushan Kabra, a slide-guitar pioneer. To be Kabrajis shishya was super tough. During those 10 years I gave no public performance. He did not allow me to write or record during the training sessions, ensuring that everything taught was committed to memory. Further, with him being busy, I could practice with him only from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. Never satisfied, he would constantly goad me to do better.With praise and accolade coming rarely, Debashish tried harder and harder. All this made me adept at playing, mentally and emotionally strong. Since, his commendation was rare, I distinctly remember such occasions which were few and far. Once after practising throughout the night, he asked me to play raga Lalit early in the morning. Listening to it intently, he started crying. Waking up my Guru Ma, he asked her to fetch his purse. He fished out Rs. 100 and gave me saying Tune mera dil khush kar diya . That gift is absolutely invaluable.The gurus confidence in him was such that once in a packed auditorium, he asked Debashish to play. Unprepared, I was stumped. But when guru commands, you have to bleed for him. So I played raga Bhimplasi followed by Shree. He didnt say anything to me but told his friends how happy he was.Debashish feels varied arts came naturally to him because he never strained but enjoyed what he did. Believing in variety being essence of life, he was game to try everything which pleased him. Academics apart, he played cricket, badminton and football in school and college, learnt different instruments, watched movies and painted too. Never wanting to be slotted in a mould, I follow my hearts calling. So I painted for three days continuously till I finished the artwork; read voraciously missing my meals; watched four movies in a row; and practised guitar from dusk to dawn.Pointing at the tikki, he adds, The same holds true for my choice of food too. Never stuck on a particular cuisine, I like to taste local food and relish varied dishes  from pongal, idli and medu vada to dal bhatti churma, chingri malai curry and bhapa ilish. Unlike many, he is not averse to street food. How can anyone resist gol gappe, egg chicken roll, fish and chicken tikkas and jhal muri. I never miss eating on the roadside, bread toast with eggs and chai, he reveals with a twinkle in his eyes.So is he excessively fond of varied Indian cuisine? I wouldnt say that. As a musician, I like to listen to Hindustani and Carnatic music as well as Western music. Debashish has collaborated with John McLaughlin, Martin Simpson, Jerry Douglas and Jeff Sipe and several others. Likewise, I am fond of foreign cuisine too. I am partial to French sole with white sauce, Italian pasta with shrimps, cilantro and pesto, Spanish tapas, Mexican burrito and horchata and Chinese sea bass.Quick learningThe hot tikis are laid out on the table. The aroma is alluring. Tasting a slice with a touch of freshly made pudina chutney, Debashish nods his appreciation. The aroma is great and so is the blending of spices. It is neither hot nor bland but perfect in taste. Realising his liking for food, one wondered if he learnt cooking too. My first brush with cooking was in New York when being hungry and unable to find something I like, I called up my mother. Those days ISD charges were Rs. 90 per minute and in three minutes I noted the recipe for fish and egg curry. Rushing down to the 24x7 grocery shop I bought cod fish, coriander leaves, cumin seeds, turmeric powder, eggs, onion, potato, aubergine, and mustard oil. I made rice and egg curry and my friend on return was intrigued by the aroma. We enjoyed each and every bit of that meal. So did this passion continue? Yes, I kept learning from my mother and later my wife. For me, my taste buds are my teacher in cooking just like my aural senses are in creating music. I keep experimenting with food and can make delicious sea bass, a mix of dal and vegetables and sauteed fish and vegetables.Debashishs desire to innovate is not limited to food alone. He is credited with invention of three instruments. Called the Trinity of Guitars these are 24-string Chaturangui, 14-string Gandharvi and four-string Anandi. I was haunted by sounds of sarod, sitar, santoor, veena and vocal rendition of greats like Bade Ghulam Ali Khan and Vishnu Digambar Paluskar among others. Trying to replicate them on my 16-string slide guitar was not satisfactory. So, I created these three instruments with special wood and string, sound board and by adjusting the height of the bridge and nut.With a life-long commitment to popularise slide-guitar, Debashish has gone beyond inventing. He has established the Universal School of Music in Kolkata, set up a recording company and guitar workshop for research in slide guitars. I have done this with a vision to ensure continuity of slide-guitar.The School teaches a 16-part syllabus designed by him for five years. When I started learning, there was no reference point for me in the sense there were no slide-guitar recordings or performances to guide me. This syllabus helps in overcoming this obstacle, while the recording company and workshop provides avenues for those who want to do pioneering work in the field. His efforts are not limited to training youngsters in Hindustani music alone. I want my students to evolve and develop their own styles in Hindustani, Carnatic, Jazz, Blues and other genres. Being blessed with fine training and upbringing, I want to pass on the legacy.For me, my taste buds are my teacher in cooking just like my aural senses are in creating music"

In other divisions, the purchase will start from April 2, Kilak said.The state government had sought the Centres permission for early purchase of gram and mustard at MSP following farmers demands, he said.Ahead of assembly elections due later this year, chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced last month a one-time farm loan waiver of up to Rs 50,000 for small and marginal farmers in the stateThe farmers, who launched an agitation, also demanded purchase of crops at MSP and implementation of the Swaminathan commission recommendations, among others.The Centre has permitted purchase of 4 lakh metric tonne gram and 6 lakh MT mustard. Online registration of farmers in Kota division started from March 12, and in other divisions from Wednesday, Kilak said. Till now more than 10,000 farmers have registered online.The minister said 216 centres have been set up in the state for purchasing mustard and 168 for gram. Efforts are being made to ensure purchase at all cooperative societies, so that farmers need not have to go very far to sell their produce.Cooperative department principal secretary Abhay Kumar said directions have been given to employees and officers for the purchase. Training has been imparted to officers division wise. Mustard will be purchased at Rs 4000 per quintal, and gram at Rs 4400 per quintal, Kumar said.Rajfed managing director Veena Pradhan said control rooms have been set up at sub-registrar offices at district levels and at Rajfed office at the state level, so that farmers do not face any problem.The farmers can call on Kisan toll-free number 18001806001 or on 181 if they face any problem. In Kota division, 22 purchase centres have been set up for the convenience of farmers, she said."

But the euphoria wore thin rather quickly.A year into his second term at the helm of the border state, the erstwhile Patiala royal has been in a firefighting mode. The implementation of a raft of promises  debt waiver, unemployment allowance, free smart phones, hiked social pensions and what not  made in the election manifesto has become a daunting challenge for his fund-crunched government. A watered-down scheme for farm loan waiver has already led to dissatisfaction. As a number of states head for polls this year, his role becomes all the more significant as the Congress needs to showcase its performance in states where it is in power. And there arent many.In a wide-ranging interview with Executive Editor Ramesh Vinayak and Senior Assistant Editor Navneet Sharma in Chandigarh, Amarinder acknowledged the tough challenges that he faces while exuding a sense of optimism on stabilizing the states ever-shakier finances. Excerpts:How do you look back at your first year?Its been a tough one because we took over a sinking ship. There was no money and the debt was overflowing. Salaries got delayed. The treasury only had bills. Recovering from a debt of Rs 2.08 lakh crore is not easy. Look at the interest on that.What is the way forward?We are raising revenue and cutting costs. In my last tenure (2002-07), there was surplus. After giving each MLA Rs 100 crore for their constituencies before the assembly elections in 2007, we left a surplus of Rs 1,600 crore in the state treasury.You were upbeat about GST. Has it helped?No, it hasnt to the extent we expected though there has been an increase in collection. That is because of the lacunae in implementation. The situation has been aggravated by delays in the release of the states share. I still maintain that the idea of GST, originally mooted by former prime minister Manmohan Singh, is sound. Its execution needs a relook.Do you feel burdened by expectations and promises that you made?We are trying to fulfil the promises. Today, I released Rs 160-odd crore for debt waiver to 30,000 farmers. We started with Mansa. We will give the waiver to 50,000 farmers in Gurdaspur next week. We have another problem. Farmers are passing on the debt. If someone has 40 acres, he will give two acres to his son and claim the debt in his name. Thats what SDMs are checking. This fraud cant go on. That is why we are going slow. We have Rs 4,000 crore for this.You are committed to farmers. Is debt waiver the solution?No, it is not. It is only assistance. The only solution is to raise income. We have been feeding the country for 50 years. Today, India hopes to grow at 7.4%. Our growth is 5.6%. Agriculture is not the solution. We make efforts to bring industry. We are now giving power at Rs 5 a unit. We have to change the cropping pattern. Ive been talking about diversification since 1985.People in the House are sadly only interested in getting their names published in newspapers, says Amarinder. (Sanjeev Sharma/HT)How come nothing has changed?These fellows (the Akalis) dont do it. The moment they come to power, they halt it. Cases are slapped. No officer has the courage to take it up. Last time, we had the farm-to-fork project with Reliance Group. It was stopped. They later went back to Mukesh (Ambani) to ask him to return but he refused.Is diversification possible without the Centres assistance or logistical support?The private sector has grown strong. When I met Mukesh recently, I talked to him to look at it again. He promised a second look. We hope to rope in others too. We are counting on private investment. There is no other way.Will you bite the bullet on free power?No, it is difficult. It will become a political crisis. The farmers have been suffering. Of 17 lakh farming families, 10.25 lakh are small farmers. There is already one suicide a day. If free power is cut, they will be in a worse situation. I am trying to do something else. There are 13.5 lakh tubewells. We have chosen 900 in six villages where we are installing meters to gauge consumption. The Akalis have started creating a ruckus. The object is not to save power, but water. We are heading for a crisis. If this continues, Punjab will become a desert. Sub-soil water has gone down to 1,200 feet in Sangrur, Patiala and Bathinda, where it used to be available at 80 feet.What do you make of Niti Aayogs plainspeak when they told Punjab to forget about food security?They werent so blunt. They talked about diversification. Weve been saying the same thing. I told them to support us. They asked for a proposal. They give support to wheat and paddy. I sought price support for potatoes and mustard seeds. There was nothing negative at that meeting. We had similar thoughts on diversification.You appealed to big farmers but not many came forward. Why shouldnt your party leaders show the way?Its just selfishness. Why cant farmers who have income coming from other sources give up power subsidy? What is their problem? Manpreet Singh Badal, Navjot Singh Sidhu and Sunil Jakhar have given it up.There has been a controversy over illegal mining and goonda tax. Has this dented your governments image?I admit these controversies have hurt the governments image to an extent. But we have tightened screws. I flew down to Nakodar on Wednesday and checked if there was any illegal mining there. There was not a single machine.Now, there are allegations being levelled against (minister) Charanjit Singh Channi.If an uncle or nephew is doing something, you cant blame the minister. I have only read the allegations in newspapers.Was Rana Gurjits resignation a setback?I dont think so. He chose to go on his own. I didnt ask him to. There are two aspects. If somebody sets up a company and there are some friends who invest 10% in it, this has been happening in the industry since long. But the thing that he should not have done was to take Rs 5 crore from the contractor because of his portfolio. I think he realised and sent in his resignation.You promised to bring a law on conflict of interest. What is holding it back?Nothing. But you have to appreciate that this is going to be the first of its kind, so naturally its taking us time to thrash out the details. All MLAs declare their assets on January 1, which is a step towards ensuring there is no misuse of position.The budget session starts on March 20. We have a double-barreled opposition. How do we ensure the smooth functioning of the House?People in the House are sadly only interested in getting their names published in newspapers. They shout and jump up and down. Their names are printed. (AAP leader Sukhpal) Khaira keeps talking and his picture appears daily in print.In one of your interviews with HT, you said you would like to groom your political successor.The final decision will be of the Congress leadership. I have one or two names in mind that I will share with the Congress president (Rahul Gandhi) when I meet him.How will you rate the performance of Manpreet Badal, Navjot Sidhu and Sunil Jakhar?Jakhar is a good president. He is liked. He is fair-minded. Manpreet is good too. He is serious and hardly ever talks. People think Navjot is vocal but he quietly does his homework. He knows all about his ministries. Channi also does his homework well.What about the cabinet expansion?The cabinet expansion was to be done around this time but the Congress president and I could not coordinate our meeting. He had to go abroad to see his grandmother. The moment the budget session is over I will go to Delhi for the discussion. I have 40 portfolios and cant sleep at night. I have to read all the files.The Theresa May government has said it will raise the issue of British national Jagtar Johal with PM Narendra Modi during his visit to London for the Commonwealth meeting. What do you have to say?This man is an outright gangster. Pakistan is using a clever ploy. The borders are sealed. Pakistan is looking at sympathisers, chaps in Germany or Canada. They watch their activities on social media. They pick them up and send them with money. They use them to supply weapons. No one in intelligence knows who these guys are initially. Johal was also a part of this gang. Now, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) has him.The Congress is having its plenary session. What is your recipe for its revival?Look where we are in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh today. These are ups and downs. Those in the government today had just one seat at one point of time. I dont think we need to worry. We are an old party with an established base. We are winning Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Who knows what will happen in 2019? The trend is changing.The Modi government has been criticised for snubbing Canadian PM Justin Trudeau. What is your view?That is for the (Narendra) Modi government to say. I cant be expected to comment on their behalf. In Punjab, Trudeau was accorded due welcome, as per protocol, and I personally had a useful meeting with him. The Canadian prime minister came out with a categorical assurance that no pro-Khalistani elements or sympathisers were being encouraged, in any way, by his government.You have maintained that the Congress needs to strengthen its regional leaders.There is no interference from Delhi. The Congress president has given me a free hand to function. When I have to induct any minister, I consult the leadership. The last time I made my cabinet, no one interfered.What is your equation with Modi?There are two aspects. As a politician, we are different parties. We have our own stands on issues. When (Atal Bihari) Vajpayee ji was were there, I had no trouble with the government. We got their full support. The same thing was done by Manmohan Singh. If you recall once in the assembly, Mrs (Rajinder Kaur) Bhattal told (Parkash Singh) Badal saab, If you have any problem with Delhi, tells us. He said, Bibi ji tussi dur hi raho, sannu twadi lod nahin hai, we are managing fine. Now also, whether it is Mr Modi, Gadkari, Jaitley, Uma Bharti or whoever I have met, I havent had any problem.Anything you expect from the Modi government?They have to function within the framework. Whatever we have gone for or asked them to expedite, they have helped. For instance, they went out of their way on CCL (cash credit limit).There have been rumblings of dissent from Congress MP Partap Singh Bajwa and some others. What do you have to say?It is not fair on Partaps part to speak against his own government. This is a petty-minded approach. You belong to the Congress, you support your government. If you dont want to support your government, then what are you in the Congress for?He said the government is being run by bureaucrats and there is very little political input.He can say that because I have 40 departments. Does he know that I sit up till midnight or 2am reading files? I cleared 5,500 files and held 362 departmental meetings in a year.Can you tell us three things you would like to do in your second year?State finance is number one priority and then, of course, jobs, industry and agriculture. These job melas we are doing, hopefully we will finish the year with about three lakh jobs. The third thing is to keep peace. I am going to be tough on all gangster, drugs business. You can see the change already.Leader of opposition Sukhpal Khaira and some Congress MLAs have been raising the accessibility issue.This is incorrect. There is no day I dont have MLAs sitting here with me. I had a meeting of all Congress MLAs for two days last week. I met all secretaries, too. We discussed issues related to their constituencies. Before that, I called MLAs of different districts once a month for lunch and discussion. Thats collectively. Privately, they come for something or the other.In one year, you will be facing Lok Sabha elections? Which party will be your main opponent in Punjab?There are three parties  the Congress, AAP and Akalis. The AAP is on the verge of collapse because there is no support left for them. The Akalis are trying to put their act together, but they wont gel. If we play our cards right, we will be fine. We have to focus on development. Last time, we didnt do it. In 2002, we won only three of the 13 seats. My understanding with (then finance secretary KR) Lakhanpal was that as finances were bad, dont take any finances for one or two years and after that whatever you want. We stuck to it. In that one year, we could not build a road. The backlash came in the parliamentary polls. This time, we are not doing that. I have just announced projects worth Rs 123 crore for Shahkot.Your party MLAs expect you to act against the previous Badal government, but you have refrained.Thats a primary sort of demand. I have told them there is a law in this land. I cant just catch hold and shove them behind bars. Give me facts and we will look into them. We are looking into their transport business. But they are clever. They have gone off to Himachal. We have to have facts. Im not going to do what they did to me. After 13 years, both cases against me are still in court. People dont seem to know that."

Kalyan was replying to media questions regarding fear of farmers due to the roster system, in Chandigarh on Friday.He said the deputy commissioners would prepare the roster in such a way that a separate day or time was kept for the left-out farmers, who, due to any reason, were not able to bring their produce on the designated day. Farmers would be informed about the days in advance through munadi (beating of drums) in villages and newspapers, he added.Kalyan said with a view to avoid distress sale of mustard seeds by the state farmers and protect their economic interest, the Haryana government had started the procurement of mustard seeds conforming to the fair average quality (FAQ) specifications at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 4,000 per quintal, including bonus of Rs 100 per quintal, from March 15."

With many known faces in attendance, we also spotted actor Aparshakti Khurana at Aneeth Aroras show.Aekatri by Charu Vij showcased its collection Sanjha Phool, which was an ode to the women who bloom despite adversities. This collection comprised easy dresses in autumnal tones like charcoal, rosewood and mustard in addition to dexterously-tailored oversized jackets. The collection also featured thread-based embroideries on luxe fabrics like chanderi, cotton silk slub, wool and woven chanderi.The collection was an embodiment of indigenously fabric crafted by merging Eri Silk yarn and Mulberry Silk yarn . The hand-woven patterns were distinct reminiscence of the French Art Deco. The looks comprised comfortably fitted silhouettes such as trench coats, capes, jackets and dresses with a hint of layering and overlapping. There was a distinct appeal to the collection with a bold usage of eclipse blue and vivid hues of violet grey and white.The collection celebrated the coexistence of the organic with the industrial.The collecetion showcased the use of fine needlepoint embroideries on handloom linens contrasting the rugged, hand distressed scrap denim and scrap denim patch work; while languid drapes complemented structured tailoring.It also had scrap denim patchwork cape, and denim skirt with paper bag belt.There was an unrestrained use of strong colour with typography in the collection to break the rigidity and allow for a universal interpretation of a private language. It was provocative and used humour as a form of escapism. The collection retained their signature of panelling and colour blocking but explored more mix media techniques for a powerful expression.The collection visualised fusion of Indian Folk Work, silhouettes with traditional motifs, cut works and crafts of the middle east. The synergy of these combination blended with contemporary aesthetics had resulted in a collection which is resplendent, timeless and distinctive. Flowly silhouettes intricately designed prints are majorly documented in this collection. It was an extension of their spring summer 18, inspired by the clown naser-el-din.Designer Shruti Sancheti, who showcased her collection on Day 3, showcased her collection Aanastasia on Day 4 as well. This time, her collection was a mix of contemporary and ethnic wears - checkered dresses, cape jackets, velvet boots were a few things that stood out in the collection.Sahil Kochhars collection featured semi-sheer shirts and asymmetric cape jackets, trousers and semi-sheer kurtas. The designer paired floral motifs with geometrical patterns.The collection has a wide range of styles and silhouettes from a quirky saris with frills and tassels to elaborate gowns and skirts. Intricately embroidered draped saris and dhoti pants in shades of ivory and pastels were a few highlights of the show. Variations of capes and silhouettes were added a dose of drama.Drawing inspiration from the 80s era and Japanese rockstar warriors, Siddhartha Tytlers collection, F.U.S.S was an amalgamation of prt and couture, street style and high street, comfort and luxury. It was a playful mix of womenswear and menswear pieces. Engineered fabrics like jerseys, velvets, parachute, cottons, neoprene and mesh were used to give a fun younger vibe to the collection.With trench coats, classic well-fit jackets in cheques and narrow pants, designer Dhruv Vaishs autumn winter line for men was perfect as formal wear. The designer said that he worked with handwoven wool and a lot of technique went into creating fabrics with textured surface. Lot of layering was a part of the look that was presented on the ramp Designer Abhishek Paatni imagined a future world and created garments keeping in mind the extreme of climatic condition we would likely be facing in the future. The show began with an all-white look with oversized jackets, gloves, caps and track pants. The use of colour was minimal in the line and the use of many pockets in jackets and hoodies in the show didnt go unnoticed. The designer said that it is tough to design a garment for the future without adding the functionality and comfort factors in the outfits.With a good mix of casual and formal wear, designer Sahil Anejas show had quite a variety for men. While most designers tend to stick to shades like brown, black and grey for men in their autumn-winter collections, Sahil did add a hint of brightness to his collection. Red was the prominent colour used in the collection. Cheques, in both shirts and jackets, were also an important part of the collection.With everything painted pink, Aneeth Aroras show was a fresh take on winter palette. The designer moved from monochromes to shades like pink, coral and indigo. Hand embroidery, appliqu, laces, ribbon embroidery were used in the collection. The designer gave a strong message on upcycling through her line. The designs seemed to be inspired by the 70s era with maxi dresses, flared frock dresses. Oversized jackets and huge handbags in the shades of pink were used to create a chic look on the ramp. Live music and a candy stall in the show area was something exciting for guests who attended Aneeths show. Models had fun too, as they shook a leg on the ramp while taking a final walk.Namrata Joshipura presented a collection that used a lot of velvet, sequins, frills and surface texturing. Namrata has created collections inspired by the New York high street fashion in the past and this time too her show had a reflection of that, but the designer said that her idea was to create a line with an emphasis on technology. Sharp and structured cuts and silhouettes in jumpsuits, gowns and dresses with dropping necklines were impressive. It wasnt just sequins that were added to designs to add some shimmer, crystal lining was used in dresses with an innovative use of technology. The colour tones ranged from black to bold colours like pink and marine blue.---With inputs from Divya Kaushik"

Rajasthan is the third largest chana producer in the country; the production this rabi season is expected to be 15.86 lakh tonnes, officials said.After chief minister Vasundhara Raje announced last month one-time crop loan waiver of up to Rs 50,000 for small and marginal farmers, land revenue exemption, and a slew of sops, the state government has taken some follow-up steps.State cooperative minister Ajay Singh Kilak has said sharecroppers will also be allowed to sell mustard and chana at MSP at mandis. A non-judicial contract will have to be made between farm land owner and the tenant farmer to avail of this facility.The land owner will have to furnish relevant documents and the tenant farmer will have to fill a form before he would be able to sell the crop on MSP. The payment will be credited directly to the account.Sources said chief minister has asked the officials concerned to give priority to issues related to agriculture sector and brief her daily about the situation. With the procurement season starting from April, the government does not want a repeat of farmers protests following non-procurement of the produce on MSP.We will be tracking the procurement of the main crops, such as chana, mustard, bajra, and soybean, to ensure that farmers get fair price this season, an official said.While wheat is mostly procured by the Food Corporation of India (FCI), bajra is consumed locally. Farmers generally get good prices for other rabi crops. Last season, crash in prices of moong and groundnut were a major reason for discontent.Farmers unrest has been simmering across the state for the past one year and a recent march to state assembly by farmers affiliated to All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) was foiled by the police. While opposition parties have tried to corner the government over the issue in the assembly, the government has come out with a slew of measures, including partial farm loan waiver.The state agriculture department is also gearing up to organise Rajasthan global agri meet in Jodhpur division in April. The event is scheduled for April 20-22."

He said dill seeds help in digestion, useful in curing diarrhoea, cures menstrual disorders, useful in respiratory disorders, diabetes, treating cancers, boosting the immune system, treating high blood pressure, improves bone health, insomnia etc.Saini said that at present dill seeds are sold for Rs 70 per kilogram, but with increasing demand in the international market, more farmers are growing dill and the price will go up.He said that the state government had implemented the Rajasthan Spice Export Promotion Scheme 2015 in July the same year. Under this scheme, exporters can purchase spices grown in the state cumin seed (jeera), coriander (dhania), fennel (saunf), fenugreek (methi), carom seed (ajwain), red chilly (lal mirch), dry ginger (adhrak), turmeric (haldi), mustard (rai), garlic (lehsun) and nigella seeds (kalonji)  from farmers or krishi upaj mandi samitis and can export directly from any port. The Rajasthan Rajya Krishi Vipanan Board (Rajasthan State Agriculture Marketing Board) gives a maximum subsidy of up to Rs 10 lakh per exporter per year for three years for surface and sea freight.A total of 302 metric tonnes of spices were exported from Rajasthan in 2016-17 and the board gave Rs 2.04 lakh as subsidy. In 2017-18, till February the exports of spices were 4109 metric tonnes and subsidy of Rs 13.89 lakh was given to exporters.Saini said that dill seeds have been included in the list of spices that are exported from March this year along with Rajasthan Spice Export Promotion Scheme-2015, which was to end on March 31, 2018, has been extended till March 31, 2019."

But the price being offered by the commission agent is around Rs. 700-Rs. 800 per quintal less than the MSP. It effectively means a loss of Rs. 14,000-16,000 for me. It is a huge amount for a small farmer like me, said Mr. Singh.Commission agent Sunder Singh Yadav said that the mustard was bought at Rs. 3,000-Rs. 3,500 per quintal, depending upon the moisture percentage.Storage problemCompared to just 2,763 quintals of mustard reaching Farrukhnagar mandi in March (from March 1-20) last year, a total of 11,989 quintals of the crop has already reached the grains market this year in the same period.More than 50% of the mustard crop in the area will be sold by the time the government starts procurement. The MSP fixed by the government is adequate, but the question remains as to how many farmers will actually benefit from it, said Prahlad, a resident of Sultanpur village.Pramod Yadav, another farmer from Sultanpur, explained that farmers could not afford to store the produce due to space crunch and needed immediate cash.If I sell at the price being offered by the commission agents, I will end up making just Rs. 15,000 this year. I can afford to sow only one crop a year due to saline ground water. There is no alternate source of irrigation, the 34-year-old said.Though the villages in the Farrukhnagar block along with several neighbouring districts such as Nuh, Rewari and Mahendragarh are among the leading producers of mustard, the purchase centre at Farrukhnagar has been set up after a span of 14 years.Virender Yadav, chairman of the market committee at Farrukhnagar, said that he had written to the authorities demanding a purchase centre in January, but the sanction came just a day ago.This market caters to 48 villages, we have already got girdawari [record of land cultivation] done for 29 villages and the rest will be covered by this month-end. A warehouse has been hired and the procurement is expected to start next week, said Mr. Yadav.Earlier the farmers in this region had to travel to Najafgarh in Delhi and Hailey Mandi (in Patuadi) to sell their produce.Though mustard is grown in Nuh and Sohna as well, there are no purchase centres in there.Naresh Kumar, a resident of Dhorka village, however, said that farmers would have benefited the most had the procurement started earlier.He added that the maximum limit of 25 quintals fixed for procurement was not pragmatic.While the produce per acre is more than 1,000 kg per acre this year, the government has fixed the limit of 660 kg per acre. Besides, there is a maximum limit of 25 quintals for procurement. How many times are farmers expected to come to the market to sell their produce?, asked the 27-year-old.Need cash to pay debtsIt rained in the morning today. It is overcast still. The farmers cannot afford to store the produce for long in these conditions and are forced to sell it off, said Jagdish, a resident of Nahapur.He added that farmers needed urgent cash to pay off debts and could not afford to wait for the government to start procurement.Suresh Chauhan, from Sultanpur, cited the delay in payment by HAFED as another reason why the farmers were not enthusiastic about government procurement.Mr. Chauhan pointed out that the commission agents made the payments promptly, but HAFED took several weeks. The 55-year-old claimed that he had never sold his produce to government agencies.Let alone the MSP, we didnt even get fertiliser this time around. The fertiliser was not available even in the black market, said Rakesh, another farmer.A senior market committee official, not willing to be identified, conceded the delay in the procurement process. He said that the harvesting of mustard started as early as mid-February in Nuh and Sohna, but the farmers did not get benefit of procurement by government due to delay.Ideally, the girdawari should be completed by January-end and the procurement started by March 1, he added.I had written to the authorities demanding a purchase centre in January, but the sanction came just a day agoVirender YadavChairman of the market committeeat Farrukhnagar"
5b147b889855b762ecec5286,Araku Valley’s dark secret,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/araku-valleys-dark-secret/article23338081.ece,2018-03-24,"With the rise in trafficking, certain locations, espcially villages, are proving treacherous for Adivasi girls. Villages that are close to main roads, railway stations and bus stations, and the weekly markets are most vulnerable.K.R. DeepakLocated deep in the Eastern Ghats, Anantagiri, home to the Valmiki tribe, is one among the 11 mandals of the Visakhapatnam agency. Not far from it is a famed tourist spot, the Araku Valley mandal. This time of the year, the landscape is awash in green with Deodar trees towering over coffee and pepper plantations. But the scenic beauty conceals an ugly reality that the authorities are still struggling to address: the trafficking of Adivasi women and girls.The homecomingSitting on the steps of her thatched mud house in a village in Anantagiri mandal, Rajini looks downcast. She was 15 years old when she was tricked into a prostitution ring and rescued in June last year by Nature, an NGO that works on rehabilitating trafficked women. She is 27 now.Rajini recalls her childhood. She would run free in the  pasupu  (turmeric) fields during the day, tend to the paddy field with her grandfather and help him cut the jackfruits that grow in abundance in the region, she says. She would also play hide-and-seek with her grandmother in the mustard plantations. Rajinis carefree days came to an abrupt end when she turned 15. The villagers looked at her differently, and some treated her with contempt. She was too young to understand why.Two developments in 2005 changed her life forever: she attained puberty and she lost her mother. My mother became very ill. The ailment was a mystery to us, Rajini says. She would later discover that her mother had contracted AIDS.Life was harsh for the young girl and her grandparents. It seemed as though money had dried up following her mothers death. Rajini and her grandparents did not have enough to eat. During the winter months, with no winter clothing, she would lie in the kitchen to keep herself warm. Then, one day, she was approached by a woman from the plains who promised to get Rajini a job in Hyderabad. I never had any formal education and I knew nothing about Hyderabad, she says. I had never set foot beyond the hills. Getting picked up in a car from my village was a dream for me.Descent into hellOnce in Hyderabad, Rajini was lodged in a cage-like building that her handlers referred to as a hostel. They got her registered to work in the packaging unit of a food processing company. But that was only a cover. Within a week, Rajini was pushed into sex work. I was raped by at least 15 different men in four days, she says. I realised then that I had been tricked. It was there that I met another, slightly older Adivasi girl from a neighbouring village. She told me that there were more than 300 Adivasi girls from different mandals of the Visakhapatnam agency in hellholes across the country.From 2005 to 2010, Rajini was moved from one place to another, including New Delhi, Aurangabad and Mumbai. We were kept on a diet of rice, starch and one curry, three meals a day. We were given a monthly ration of cosmetics, beaten if we did not oblige customers who did not want to use a condom, and taken to a doctor when we fell ill with venereal disease. During this period I came in contact with an older girl from my village who had also been trafficked. She told me that my mother was a commercial sex worker who had died of HIV/AIDS, and that was why I was not accepted in my village, says Rajini.In 2010, when Rajini was kept in a brothel in Hyderabad, she eloped with a driver with the help of another trafficked Adivasi girl and landed in V.Madugula, a suburb of Visakhapatnam. Her travails did not end with the elopement. The driver was already married, and he forced her back into prostitution. In 2012, she gave birth to a child who is now five. The driver abandoned her in 2015 when she was six months pregnant with her second child.There was no food for me and my child. As I was pregnant, I could not even go back to the profession that I hated the most. With great difficulty I gave birth to a second child. But in 2016, I was forced to sell the infant for Rs. 25,000. A hospital nurse helped me do it. I wanted to see him grow up, but I was not even given the address of the buyer, she recalls.The promise of employmentAccording to the 12 police stations spread across the 11 mandals, about 220 cases of missing girls have been recorded in the last five years. But other estimates, as per the records of the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights (SCPCR) and NGOs such as Nature, suggest that 1,500 women may have gone missing in the past 10 years. In 2017, the police recorded 18 cases of missing girls. The Superintendent of Police of Visakhapatnam (Rural), Rahul Dev Sharma, says that the number could be more as many of these cases go unreported. The girls and women come from various parts of the agency areas such as Paderu, GK Veedhi, Chintapalli, G. Madugula, Anantagiri, Koyyuru, and Araku mandals in Visakhapatnam district, Gummalaxmipuram in Vizianagaram district, Seethammapeta in Srikakulam, and Rampachodavaram in East Godavari, says S.B. Balaraju, former Chairperson of the SCPCR and the founder of Nature.Subbalakshmi from Araku mandal, Padma from Gummalaxmipuram, and Krishnaveni from Chodavaram have similar harrowing stories to recount. All of them were rescued last year and are being rehabilitated.In 2014, Subbalakshmi was a Class 9 student when she eloped with a mason  a married man and 10 years older than her. Now she is back at home after having been forced to work as a sex worker in Bengaluru and Rajahmundry. She was abandoned when she got pregnant at 18. Due to her poor health, her twins were stillborn. She is now terminally ill with AIDS. Many cases such as Subbalakshmis go unreported due to social stigma.There have been instances when the young girls have found their way back to their hamlets from brothels in Goa, New Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and Kolkata. Many have contracted AIDS. According to Balaraju, about 500 such women have returned in the last 10 years and around 200 have tested HIV positive in the Visakhapatnam agency area alone.From sex slavery to traffickingAccording to P.D. Satyapal, head of the Department of Anthropology at Andhra Pradesh University, who has done considerable research on the tribals of the Eastern Ghats, the trafficking of young girls from the region goes back all the way to the British era, when there was widespread sex slavery. After the British left, trafficking picked up as the Telugu film industry grew, based in what was then known as Madras. The picturesque landscape and cool climate provided an ideal setting for outdoor shoots, and in the early 1980s filmmakers flocked to the Araku Valley. This ended up bringing the industry in contact with the Adivasis.The first such case of trafficking that came to light involved a young woman, Madhu, who in 1982 was offered a job in the film industry. Madhu returned after about three years and took 10 girls with her from the Araku mandal. Three of them later returned, infected with HIV, says Satyapal.The movie merchants were followed by moneylenders from Nellore in the late 1980s. But the major blow came from gemstone miners. According to Satyapal, the number of trafficking cases of tribal girls from the agency areas of Visakhapatnam and Vizianagaram shot up two decades ago, between 1990 and 2000, when gemstone miners from the plain areas forayed into the forests.The gemstone miners and businessmen hailed from different parts of the country, from as far as Rajasthan and Gujarat. It was they who first exposed the tribals to big money and technology such as mobile phones, he says.Charu Sinha, a senior Indian Police Service officer who had earlier served as the Superintendent of Police of East Godavari and is currently posted in Telangana, says: There are two angles to trafficking in the tribal belt. First, the young Adivasi girls from Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, Srikakulam, and East Godavari are taken to other towns and cities mainly by women who were victims themselves and are from the same area. These older women are paid by the kingpins to bring more girls, and the teenagers fall for the supposedly rich lifestyle displayed by the older women. The second is the attraction of city life and the film industry. The Integrated Tribal Development Authority and social welfare department hostels are ironically the places from where the girls are taken. The girls are tempted with promises of a great city life or the promise of a career in the film industry. Typically, the middlemen are young men. The girls, once caught in the vicious circle of money, deception, exploitation and social stigma, rarely turn back. They, in turn, get others from the same villages.The elopement routeWith the rise in trafficking, certain locations are proving treacherous for Adivasi girls. Villages that are close to main roads, railway stations and bus stations, and the weekly markets in the agency areas are places where the girls are most vulnerable. It is here that they come in contact with a world that is very different from their village life. It is here that middlemen, whose network extends all over India, come and look for young and particularly poor Adivasi girls and try to entice them with flashy clothes and baubles.Most of these cases of girls going missing are treated as elopement cases by their family members, says the DIG of Visakhapatnam (Rural), Ch. Srikanth. So, it is is difficult for these girls to file a complaint as most of these cases go unreported, he says.As for the middlemen, the promise of marriage has become the most common way for them to get girls, Balaraju says. In 80% of the cases, as the families object to the marriage, the couple elopes, he says.How is the increase in trafficking cases being dealt with? The Chairperson of the Andhra Pradesh State Mahila Commission, Nannapaneni Rajakumari, says, We are planning to set up a helpline and counselling teams at the district and mandal levels to counsel young girls and women about trafficking. Apart from this, district collectors, especially those covering tribal areas such as Visakhapatnam, Vizianagaram, and Srikakulam, have been told to identify and map the vulnerable pockets and collect data. We are also working on a project of employment-centric skill development for tribal women.However, Sunita Krishnan of Prajwala, an NGO that rescues and rehabilitates victims of trafficking, feels that the trafficking issue is not being addressed in an appropriate manner. Most of the trafficking cases come to light after the police conduct a raid at a brothel. But things do not progress from there. Typically, after a raid, the victims are sent to correction homes and the brothel managers are booked under the Immoral Trafficking (Prevention) Act, 1956, and sent to remand. The investigation closes with that, she says.She adds that the punishment is insufficient under the Act. The police needs to use stringent Sections of the Indian Penal Code such as Sections 370 (buying or disposing of any person as a slave), 370A (exploitation of a trafficked person), and other relevant ones concerning illegal confinement, sexual exploitation, and kidnapping, she says.The most crucial way of solving the problem is by reaching the kingpins and middlemen, says the legal advisor to the Visakhapatnam City Police Commissionerate, K. Ramakrishna. The issue is not being viewed holistically by the State government and the police, he says.While officials think of ways to tackle the problem, the women try to put their traumatic past behind them and think of the future. Rajini says she wants to educate her son. I have requested the headmaster to admit him next year. I want him to have a proper home and a decent life, she says, as she gets up from the steps and walks towards the village school. I am now learning tailoring to support my family. I have also joined the NGO that rescued me. I hope to be a part of their team. I have decided to tour the tribal hamlets to educate young girls, and tell them not to get tricked by strangers who promise them jobs in cities.Names of the trafficked women have been changedThere are two angles to trafficking in the tribal belt.

Madhya Pradesh has recorded bumper production of gram, lentil and mustard and farmers will get justified price of their produce under MSP, the CM said.Chouhan did not clarify why the government took this decision at time when the Centre has welcomed Bhavantar and has formed a group of ministers to study the scheme in the interest of farm community across the country.Chouhan simply said that the central committee has not taken a stand, hencethedecision by thestate. Bhavantar scheme has got very positive response, and a group of ministers under the chairmanship of home minister Rajnath Singh is studying it, but a decision in the regard is yetto arrive, theCMsaid, assuring that the MP government will help farmers during all adversities.After the announcement, the state government has asked farmers register for MSP. Those who have registered for Bhavantar will get the benefit, too.Officials said the decision to exclude these three crops from Bhavantar was taken after the Centre announced benefits under the scheme for Kharif crops. The Centre is yet to decide whether to include Rabi crops, barring wheat and paddy, under Bhavantar. As per the formula, the Centre will have to bear expensesof Rs12,000crore under Bhavantar and after thorough discussion, Delhi will take the decision to include gram, lentil and mustard under Bhavantar, said Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary of agriculture department.Chouhan is hopeful that Bhavantar will get countrywide acceptance after the Centres approval. On Sunday, I will address farmers of MP and inform them about government welfare schemes. Niti Ayog is also working on Bhavantar and we are hopeful that farmers will soon get an appropriate plan to help them financially, said Chouhan."

The farmers held a protest at Rohtaks grain market claiming that the rabi oilseed was being purchased at Rs 3,200-3,500 per quintal.Farmer leaders alleged that the state government should have been proactive in resolving the ongoing crisis to revive the ailing farming community, but it chose to brag over its dubious farm policies with the upcoming elections in mind.BKUs Rohtak unit president Pratap Singh said one of the major problems being faced by farmers was that the government had introduced roster system under which farmers of specified villages were eligible to sell their produce on a certain date. This is causing difficulties and confusion among farmers as the roster was announced only a day before the procurement began, he added.Pratap said it was ironic on the part of the state government to hold a three-day mega event in the name of farmers by arranging paraphernalia but the ground reality claimed by the incumbent regime did not hold any water and needed proper implementation of its claims.Talking to TOI, Bhumi Bachao Andolan chief Hansraj Rana said against the MSP of Rs 4,000 per quintal, farmers were getting spot prices as observed by their team in Rewari and Nuh, which ranged between Rs 3,300 and Rs 3,500 quintal.The governments response has so far been very tardy. In Haryana, the government has set up 11 procurement centres for mustard, but the process suffers from several flaws, including that the centres are not located in the mandis, causing inconvenience and increasing transportation costs for farmers, Rana said, adding that the state government had placed unreasonable quantitative limits (6.6 quintals per acre subject to an overall cap of 25 acres). This limit is lower than the average production this year and, thus, forces the farmers to sell part of their crop in the open market, he alleged.Cooperation of states needed for doubling farm incomeUnion minister of state for agriculture and farmer welfare Parshottam Rupala appreciated the Haryana government for taking effective steps to realize the vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to double the income of farmers by 2022. Rupala was addressing the gathering on the first day of the three-day Agri Leadership Summit-2018 in Rohtak on Saturday. Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar was also present on the occasion.The Union minister said since agriculture was a state subject, the vision to double farmers income could only be achieved with the cooperation of states. Referring to the issue of minimum support price (MSP), Rupala said the Union government under PMs leadership was the first government to announce that MSP of all notified crops would be at least 1.5 times the cost of production. He added that to ensure that farmers at grassroots got the benefit of MSP, a policy would be prepared in consultation with the NITI Aayog."

Some went to the extent of saying the government is not delivering on its promise.Highly placed sources said the CM was banking on the Centre thinking the latter was set to bring BBY for states as one of the three schemes to procure farmers produce. The other two being Market Assurance Scheme (MAS) and a subsidy scheme for corporate houses (they would procure directly from farmers and government would provide subsidy to corporates).We were sure of these schemes for long. Even two NITI Aayog meetings over three schemes were held on March 1 and 9, but it could not happen at the last moment, highly-placed government sources said.The BBY was launched in kharif 2017 as a pilot project and the government wanted to replicate it as a full-fledged scheme in rabi this year, which is why the CM had announced it in a major farmers rally in Bhopal at Jamboree maidan in Bhopal on February 12 this year, they said.It was beyond the means of the state to bear Centres share of around Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 1,500 crore, sources said.And the last, but an equally significant reason, sources explained, was disenchantment of farmers with Bhawantar at many places . A large number of farmers were not able to sell their produce under BBY under the criteria of FAQ (fair average quality) of grains. Lower price for the produce if grains were inferior than FAQ triggered resentment, sources said.The government was panicky as three rabi crops  lentil (masoor), gram (chana ) and mustard (sarson)  arrived in markets and the Centre was not issuing notification, the chief minister visited Delhi on March 23 only to be told that the three schemes would not be rolled out, sources claimed.After a delayed cabinet meeting the same day late in evening, the CM announced his decision in a hurriedly-convened press conference.But he insisted garlic and onion would continue to be in BBY. Besides, the government has already declared to procure poppy husk from farmers. It would require about Rs 40 to Rs 50 crore and the husk would be burnt to destroy it.By adding garlic in BBY and announcement of poppy husk, the government would be targeting farmers especially the powerful Patidars of Mandsaur, Neemuch, Ratlam, Ujjain and other parts of western MP, sources said.Farmers associations criticised the government for withdrawing the BBY. Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, said, This is 16th amendment in BBY by the government. It should stop befooling farmers. It should also compensate farmers for losses incurred in BBY in last kharif season.Anil Yadav of Bhartiya Kisan Sangh , said, We always demanded to withdraw the scheme, which was against the interest of the farmers.Bhopal: When chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced withdrawal of three Rabi crops from Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana on Friday evening, it took many by surprise.Highly placed sources said the CM was banking on the Centre for funds, hoping Delhi would roll out Bhavantar as one of the three nationwide schemes to procure farm produce. The other two being Market Assurance Scheme (MAS) and a subsidy scheme for corporate houses (they would procure directly from farmers and government would provide subsidy to corporates).We were sure of these schemes for a long time.

Besides, the government has already declared to procure poppy husk from farmers and destroy it.

Rajasthan farmers are facing financial difficulties as they are not getting fair price for their produce  gram, mustard, wheat and garlic.In the last four years, the BJP government in Rajasthan stopped additional bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat, started by the previous Congress government, Gehlot said. Our government in 2012-13 for the first time gave Rs 100 per quintal bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat; for this, a grant of Rs 200 crore was given. In 2013-14, additional bonus of Rs 150 per quintal was given on wheat purchase.There has been a bumper production of gram in Kota division, which the farmers want to sell on support price, Gehlot said. In the absence of adequate arrangements to purchase gram on support price, farmers have to sell gram at Rs 3500 per quintal and mustard at Rs 3600 per quintal. The support price of gram is Rs 4400 and of mustard is Rs 4000.Farmers who sold moong (green gram) on support price are waiting for payment and making rounds of the Rajasthan state cooperative federation and banks, Gehlot alleged.After Maharashtra, Rajasthan produces maximum onion. Farmers are already in debt and fall in prices of onion and garlic has added to their worry. In view of farmers interest, the state government should purchase onion on fair price, Gehlot said."

And thats what Easter is all about for our celebs as well. Bangalore Times spoke to some of them to find out what Easter means to them, the traditions they follow on this particular day and what the lavish feast consists ofFor actress Sharmiela Mandre , Easter brings back a lot of childhood memories. Since my mothers side of the family is Catholic, we begin the day by going to church. After that, we visit family members and usually end up at my grandmothers house for a traditional Easter lunch, which is a mix of dishes like Roast Chicken and Turkey , and desserts made by my grandmother. My favourite is the Banofee Pie, says Sharmiela.* 250g digestive biscuits, crushed* 100g butter, melted* 4 small bananas* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* Grated chocolate to garnish* Caramel (can be made from scratch or bought from the store)* 2 tablespoon of brown sugar for the cream* Put the crushed biscuit into a bowl with melted butter. Mix it together thoroughly. Press the mixture into the base and sides of the tin. Chill for 10 minutes. This will form the base of the pie.* Now, spread the caramel over the base with the help of a spoon.* Slice the bananas and scatter them on top. Now, put the cream on top (beaten previously for about 15 minutes with brown sugar) and decorate with grated chocolate.* Store it in the refrigerator until youre ready to eat it.Easter is all about getting together with the family. There arent any traditions that we follow in particular but its a big get-together and we eat till we drop. There are a lot of traditional Kerala dishes that are prepared on Easter by my wife, that I love to eat, says Bruce. His favourite- appam and chicken stew.* 1 kg chicken pieces* 20 cardamon pods* 6 inch cinnamon stick* 7 cloves* 2 large onions* 4 inch ginger piece finely chopped* 10 medium size green chillies (or less if you prefer a milder stew)* 1/4 teaspoon pepper* 1 tablespoon coriander powder* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder* 2 large potatoes  diced* 1 cup thick coconut milk* 5 tablespoon oil* Curry leaves* Salt* Heat oil, then add the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds crackle, add cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and mix well.* Add ginger, chopped onions, green chilli and curry leaves. Saute until the onion is soft.* Add pepper, coriander, garam masala and turmeric powders and mix to let the spices roast for a minute.* Add the chicken pieces, sprinkle salt and stir to coat with the masala.* Add 1 and 1/2 cup of water, cover and boil for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.* Add potato cubes and cook for another 15-20 minutes till the potatoes are cooked.* Add coconut milk and take it off the flame as soon as it starts to boil.* Serve with hot pallappam or iddiappam. (If using fresh coconut, add its thick extract first and then the thinner extract of coconut milk. If using processed coconut milk, add some water or milk to thin it and bring to the desired consistency.)On Easter, there is one tradition that we have been following for years and thats an Easter egg hunt. Its mostly for the kids but we have been doing it every year. In addition to this, there is a lavish lunch that the family feasts on. Personally, I look forward to the desserts the most, prepared by my sister- in-law, says Rohit.* 200 grams of semi-sweet chocolate (you can use cooking chocolate as well)* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter* 1 teaspoon of instant coffee ( in 1 teaspoon of hot water)* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* 500 grams of whipping cream or thick cream*  teaspoon of vanilla extract* Chop the chocolate into small pieces and save a small piece for the garnish.* Place chocolate and butter into a microwave safe bowl, and heat for 30 seconds at a time until the chocolate has melted.* Remove from microwave and add the coffee syrup.* Whisk for a few minutes until totally combined and slightly cool. Add the cream a little at a times and whisk until you get a smooth, even coloured consistency.* Add the vanilla extract and whisk for a few minutes.* Pour into a container and place in the refrigerator for 2-4 hours.* Before serving, grate the last bit of chocolate and sprinkle over.* You can also garnish with mini Easter eggs if you have any."

5b2719049855b77f2f843977,IITian who picked journalism,https://www.telegraphindia.com/india/iitian-who-picked-journalism-220815?ref=india-new-stry,2018-04-04,"Parthasarathi SwamiParthasarathi Swami was the sort of maverick who chose to trade in the polynomial for prose when it wasn't fashionable to do so.Purely on a whim, he had dropped in for a chat with Business Standard's then legendary news editor C.P. Kuruvilla at the ABP Group's headquarters at Prafulla Sarkar Street in the summer of 1979. He took a test for desk journalists purely as a lark that left everyone goggle-eyed over the brilliance of his wordplay - and quietly disappeared into his bolthole at IIT Kharagpur where he had already started to grapple with the soullessness of the slide rule in his final year as a mechanical engineering student.Legend went that Kuru (a mentor to a swarm of journalists who emerged from the ABP stable) grew frantic when he found he couldn't get in touch with Partho, eventually landing up at his parent's flat near Southern Avenue in an effort to persuade him to join the Desk that he was determined to build with newfound talent.Partho didn't need too much convincing - and a business journalist of exquisite genius was born.The afternoons at BS were slow: between turgid copy and the cacophony of bilingual epithets in a smoke-filled, boys-only newsroom, Partho would hunch over a Statesman crossword and skirt his way through a minefield of cryptic clues that carried quaint literary allusions and devilish acrostics to solve the puzzle in 45 minutes flat. His love for words and their etymology sprang from that happy pastime on the Desk - a love that he easily transmitted to anyone who was brave enough to seek help while trying to work his way through the vileness of 1 Down.""The anagram is one of the most popular types of cryptic clues,"" he later wrote in a column in The Telegraph in 1997 - and proceeded to illustrate that by explaining why ""a routine bed cry"" could just as easily morph into an ""Aerobic nude try."" It was redolent of Wystan Hugh Auden's famous crack at T.S Eliot. ""I will always be more interesting,"" Auden once told Stephen Spender because the anagram of his name could spell out as either ""Hug A Shady White Nun"" or ""Why Shun a Nude Tag"". But poor old Eliot's name could only be transcribed as litotes, which is the figure of speech for understatement.Partho had the serenity of a Buddha and the brilliance of a 100-watt bulb - and it rippled through the short, pithy articles that he wrote often for the paper or the double entrendre headlines that BS was famous for, long before it sank into prosaic sobriety. A Don Bosco Calcutta boy, he relished the opportunity to write a sarky piece titled Cops on Campus, when policemen turned up at a rival school in the city in the early eighties.Amid convivial cups in the neighbourhood bars that ring Bentinck Street that have since sadly sunk into dens of iniquity - and which were once the haunts of scribes of every stripe - Partho voiced his ambition to finish his bachelor's degree in history from Osmania University before snucking down to the Indian Institute of Management, Calcutta (Class of '85), possibly to affirm to himself more than anyone else that he could cut the mustard with the best minds in the country.But journalism gnawed at his heart and it wasn't long before he passed up the opportunity to become a buttoned-up business suit in some soul-sapping corporate fiefdom. He briefly returned to BS before moving on to India Today and thence to BusinessWorld which was part of the ABP Group at that time, rising to become its managing editor. After a short stint with the Sunday Observer, he pulled in at Business India where he remained as managing editor till the end. He also edited India Knowledge@Wharton, the India-focused online publication of The Wharton School.The national-level bridge player was also the master of trivia and tidbit, often forsaking management twaddle for goofy speak. He could throw crazy factoids at the reader: ""The Indian smoker uses 1.6 match sticks to light each cigarette and the average American puts 3.2 ice cubes in a glass of Coca Cola,"" he wrote in a column in BS in 1985.He loved the quirky and found it - where else? - on the Net. ""The rhombus is not getting a square deal,"" he said in a column in The Telegraph and went on to explain why The International Society of Rhombi and Thesauri (ISRT) insisted that all Latin words ending with the letters -us must carry the suffix- i when used in the plural. ""It hasn't got down to the likes of platypi (should two minibuses be minibi?), but one day it sure will,"" he wrote with his tongue firmly in his cheek.He was more fascinated by the skulduggery of a Harshad Mehta than the gentility of the Tatas - and his more memorable pieces are those that talk about the rogue stockbroker who went on to become a personal friend.He would go on to write one book, Boar in Boots, that seeks to capture the derring-do of the nabobs of Horniman circle with as much aplomb as the slumdog millionaires of Dharavi.Late on Monday night, the man who had ""fork'd so much lightning"" in the world of business journalism was silenced forever in Mumbai after a long illness bravely borne. He was 61. He leaves behind his wife Alka, daughter Nisha and son Nikhil."

Science can bring evidence but the policy decision is a more complex process.However Indias science academies needed to speak more and play a greater role especially in its advice to government on matters of science.Indian science needs to get out from being intellectually not vibrant and exploring a vast space, into one which does. And Indias science academies need to play a special role, said Mr. VijayRaghavan, a biologist and member of Indias prominent academies.While the Economic Survey in February said that India didnt spend enough on science relative to its GDP, Mr. VijayRaghavan said resources would increase but the fact that there werent significant budgetary cuts to science showed that the Prime Minister was seeing value in science and directly intervening in matters of science.Our process of delivery of funds does need improvement, he emphasised.Last month, 150 scientists signed a petition demanding that Indian science establishments take more stringent measures to punish scientists and senior researchers proved guilty of sexual harassment.Gender parityGovernment intervention on its own wasnt enough to address problems of sexual harassment and gender parity in Indias research institutions. Rather, scientists should be talking about addressing them in their institutions and emulate organisations that have better policies and administrative practices in place, he added.Mr. VijayRaghavan, whos the first PSA not connected to Indias atomic energy or space programmes, said improved battery technology and applying them for increased mobility and power would be transformative to the Indian economy and to this end solar and nuclear energy were critical to Indias fuel mix, he argued.Among his priorities, he said, would be to closely work with the National Institution for Transforming India (NITI) Aayog as well as the other scientific ministries.One must keep in mind the mandate and roles each Ministry has. There needs to be synergy between different groups. This is primarily about defining what each ones goals are and about how to achieve them."

Raje arrived in Sikar Firday on a four-day visit.The farmers in Rajasthan are up in arms against the government over its failure to procure Rabi crops at minimum support price (MSP). While the state government has made arrangements to procure major crops, including wheat, at MSP, farmers union have alleged that the designated centers for wheat were too less and it was not possible for those living in remote villages to access them.Apart from wheat, farmers are also being forced to sell other crops such as mustard and chana (gram/ chick pea) at below MSP, according to the union leaders.As against MSP of 4,000 per quintal, farmers are selling mustard at Rs 3,500. The situation is worse for chana. It is being sold at Rs 3,000-Rs 3,500 per quintal while the MSP was set at Rs 4,400. The MSP for wheat is Rs 1,735 per quintal, but at most mandis farmers are selling it for Rs 1,500, Kisan Mahapanchayat leader Rampal Jat said. We plan to gherao the chief minister during her visit to Sri Madhopur on April 9, he added.On April 3, police had detained Jat along with about 50 other farmers when they were trying to march to chief ministers residence in Civil Lines area.The farmers affiliated to All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) are holding demonstrations at mandis in Kota district to protest steep fall in the prices of garlic. In Sikar, farmers are holding protest against steep fall in onion prices.Wheat is being purchased at MSP by Food Corporation of India (FCI) at 207 designated centers in Rajasthan. It is up to the farmers to sell the wheat at designated centers, a state agriculture department official said requesting anonymity.Jat, however, said that FCI procures crops during a 90-day period and it was not possible for farmers from more than 45,000 villages across Rajasthan to access 207 centers. So they are forced to sell their produce below the MSP at nearby mandis. In addition, farmers are getting only Rs 1,200 for jowar against the MSP of 1,425, he said.Other farmer unions are also unhappy. In February, AIKS leader Amra Ram had spent four days in jail after he attempted to lead a farmers protest march to the Rajasthan assembly. On February 22, Rajasthan Police had arrested 179 farmers from different locations and detained around another 2,000 who were marching to Jaipur to stage a sit-in outside the assembly that was in session."

Its a safeguard to prevent exploitation of farmers at the hands of private players.The case will be filed under Rajasthan Krishi Mandi Upaj Act 1963 that states that no designated crop can be sold or purchased below minimum support price.

Also, it damaged this years wheat and mustard produce stacked in bags at wholesale markets.The rain damaged our crop lying in the open as there are not enough sheds to store the entire produce at the Karnal grain market, said Gurdeep Singh, a farmer. The farmers are worried that their wet wheat will not be procured until it dries in the next few days. The rain has delayed harvesting by nearly a week. We will have to pay more for harvesting the flattened crop, said Ajay Kumar, a farmer in Indri.Karnal, Kurukshetra, Kaithal, Yamunanagar, Hisar and Sirsa were the worst-hit, reports said. Weather officials said the highest rainfall of about 30mm was recorded at Nilokheri in Karnal.Raj Singh, who heads the states meteorological and agriculture department, said farmers have been warned about the storm approaching the region. We suggested that farmers harvest their crop and store it in a dry area as there was a good chance of rain from April 9 to April 11. We have sent SMS alerts. The forecast is for more rain in the next 48 hours. Western disturbances are present over areas bordering Pakistan, which have attracted clouds over northern India, said JP Gupta, director of the meteorological department in Lucknow.Punjab reported a similar scenario as rain and strong wind flattened crops in Kapurthala, Jalandhar, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar, Patiala, and Mohali districts. The state agriculture department said theres no need to panic as the rain fell in isolated areas. The loss to crop will be less than 1%, state agriculture director Navdeep Bains said.Shamsher Singh, a farmer in Patiala, said most of his crop on two acres was down. Such weather will reduce the yield by two to three quintals per acre. The crop was ready for harvest and the loss will be huge, he lamented. Farmers and officials of procurement agencies reportedly covered harvested crops with tarpaulins in several places.The freak storm also damaged crops in eastern UP, while the administration asked sub-divisional magistrates to inspect rain-hit areas and assess the loss.In Bareilly and Moradabad regions, ripe wheat crop on an estimated 90 acres was flattened or submerged in water following spells of rain from Sunday evening till Monday afternoon. Hailstorm in some areas of Bareilly and Rampur affected crops.We were expecting a bumper mango crop because the trees flowered well. But the rain battered the buds  We will suffer a bigger loss if the rains continue, said Sukhwinder Singh, an orchard owner in Pilibhit."

A market full of grains got drenched in Sohna, destroying at least 400-500 quintals of foodgrain and oilseeds stored in the open, waiting to be transported to the corporations warehouse. With more rain predicted over the next few days, the problem could only get worse.Currently, the government acquires wheat at Rs 1,535 per quintal. Theres no upper limit for acquisition. Mustard is acquired at Rs 4,000 per quintal, with a limit of 25 quintals per farmer. While wheat is acquired by Haryana warehouse corporation, mustard is bought by Haryana state cooperative supply and marketing Federation limited (Hafed) to press for oil sold under their eponymous brand.Mondays loss accrued to the corporation, as it had already bought the crop from farmers. We were able to contain damage during Fridays rains , by placing tarpaulin sheets on the stock. But on Monday, it rained early and took us by surprise, said SDM (Sohna) Satish Yadav, whose office is next to the mandi.For buying mustard, we prepare a roster according to which farmers come here with their crop on different days, he continued. After the rains, uncertainty loomed among mustard farmers on the roster for Monday, who had already arrived with their produce. Were waiting here since 8am. We were earlier told they wont buy mustard today as theres no place to store it after the rains. But weve already paid for transport, and are now incurring more losses for every hour we keep the tractors waiting, said Karan Singh Raghav of Badshapur Tether village.District food and supply controller Ram Avtar said Sohna mandis capacity is just 5,000 tonnes as Gurugram is not counted as an agricultural district, compared to the likes of Karnal, Sirsa and Fathehabad, where mandi capacity runs into lakhs of tonnes. Warehouse corporation has been asked to transport the grain to their storage as soon as possible. If it remains clear on Tuesday, they can even get it dried before storing it, he said.Officials maintained there has been no loss in the fields due to the rains. Unlike northern Haryana districts, rice is not sown here, so sowing and harvesting happens earlier here, he said, adding northern Haryana could face bigger problems due to the rains.Farmers, though, disagreed. At the mandi, Narender from Tether, who has two acres of wheat ready for harvest, said he expects to lose 30% of his crop (around 6 quintals or Rs 10,000). If rains continue, we could lose more. And if we bring it over here, well be asked to get it dried first, he says.Later in the day, SDM Yadav announced that mustard acquisition will go on as scheduled, but wheat farmers will have to dry their produce before its acquired.There would have been no problem if they had built a shed here, said Sohna farmer Suryavir Chaudhary. Officials said the proposal to build a larger warehouse nearby has been on the anvil for a while."

The process of procurement will continue till June 9. All registered farmers are eligible to sell their produce at procurement centres, said Indore agriculture departments deputy director Vijay Chourasia.Around 48 procurement centres will be opened in Indore district.Prices of pulses fell below MSP this season due to higher output in the country and increased imports from Australia and Canada. All India Dal Mill Association has been demanding to immediately ban imports and allow export of at least 25 lakh MT of pulses to check the price fall.Pulses farmers are suffering from huge losses this season because prices have gone below MSP. Government purchase will help in limiting the losses, said association president Suresh Agrawal.MSP of chana is Rs 4,400 per quintal, masur is Rs 4,250 per quintal and mustard is Rs 4,000 per quintal.Chourasia said, Retaining the quality of the produce is the main task. These procured items will be stored in warehouses and godowns.Industry experts said poor prices of pulses may discourage sowing in the next season hitting availability for domestic consumption.We require about 30 lakh MT pulses every year to meet local demand if production takes a hit then imports will go up to meet the local demand, Chourasia said."

The Rajasthan government, however, is purchasing wheat at MSP of 1,735 for every quintal fixed by the Centre.Madhya Pradesh has announced a special incentive of 100 every quintal for chana, masoor and mustard in the 2018 rabi marketing season.According to an official order issued by the Madhya Pradesh government, wheat and other crops, including chana, mustard and masoor, will be eligible for the cash incentive irrespective of the rate at which it is sold in the market.The state hasnt termed the scheme as a bonus to circumvent a central order that curbs state governments from declaring a bonus over the MSP.Upset at lower prices prevailing in Rajasthan, farmers in Kota division are planning a jail bharo andolan on April 12, to protest against what they call lower MSP and inadequate arrangements for purchase of wheat and other rabi crops at the mandis.At most mandis, farmers are being forced to sell wheat at 1,500 every quintal. Farmers are also getting lower prices for chana, which is being sold at about 1,000 every quintal lesser than the MSP, said Akhil Bharatiya Kisan Sangarhsh Samiti convener Fatehchand Bagla.We will stage protest at the Kota collectorate on Thursday and also court arrest, he said.Kisan Mahapanchayat president Rampal Jat said since Madhya Pradesh was a neighbouring state it was natural that farmers in Rajasthan will expect similar prices. When MP government can purchase wheat at 2,000 per quintal, there is no reason why the Rajasthan government cannot do the same, he said.State agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini said MSP was fixed by the Centre and the new norms prohibit declaring a bonus over and above the MSP.In Rajasthan, the Food Corporation of India is purchasing wheat at 207 designated centres at 1,735 every quintal. Rajasthan is the fifth largest wheat producer in the country.Rajasthan, which goes to the polls in the next few months, has faced a series of farmers agitations in the past one year due to crash in prices and crop damage.Chief minister Vasundhara Raje in her last budget before the elections announced a farm loan waiver of up to 50,000 for small and marginal farmers that will cost the state exchequer more than 8,000 crore.Besides, the farm loan waiver, the state government has constituted a permanent farm commission and has allocated 5,000 crore interest-free loans to the Rajasthan State Co-operative Marketing Federation for procuring mustard and gram."

The farmers will be provided right price in time for their produce, said Ajay Singh Kilak, the cooperative minister on Friday.The MSP is the rate of a crop at which the government buys the crop from farmers. Its a safeguard to prevent exploitation of farmers at the hands of private players.Under the Sehkar Fasal Kharid Mitr Yojna, the Gram Seva Sehkari Samitis (GSSS), Large Agriculture Multipurpose Cooperative Societies (LAMP) and Oilseed Producing Cooperative Societies (OPCS) can purchase crops from farmers for Kray-Vikray Cooperative Societies as Sehkar Mitra (cooperative friend), said Kilak.He said chief minister Vaundhara Raje during her visit to Ganganagar had directed for providing relief to farmers by setting up the crop purchase centres near them. The GSSS, LAMP and OPSC have been made Sehkar Mitra. Now, farmers can sell their produce at gram panchayat level, he added. The Sehkar Mitra will be disbursed with an incentive of 14 per 50kg bag of produce. This will be in addition to the handling and transport charges.Keeping in view the crop production, this year the number of purchase centres has been increased to 401, said Kilak, adding that the government intends to provide maximum benefit to the farmers.Cooperative department principal secretary Abhay Kumar said it will be mandatory for the Sehkar Mitra to register themselves as a member of the Kray-Vikray Sekhari Samiti. There will be an agreement between the two parties on a 100 stamp paper. The Sehkar Mitra will purchase produce in the tenure and limit announced by the Rajasthan State Cooperative Marketing Federation Limited (Rajfed), he added.Kumar said the Sehkar Mitra will get gunny bags, mustard and gram stock insured from water, fire and theft. However, Sehkar Mitra will have to give a 10-lakh bank guarantee to the Kray-Vikray Sekhari Samiti.Rajfed managing director Veena Pradhan said farmers can get themselves registered at E-mitra and purchase centres by paying Rs 10 as the registration fee. A farmer has to carry Bhamashah card and Aadhaar for the registration."

Its not just the all-out traditional attires they now prefer but something with a twist. We caught up with a few designers from the State to know whats in this season:Saris featuring Krishna and murals have fallen out of favour to be replaced by floral print this year. Its hardly surprising that the designers have added a dash of flowery motifs for Vishu, the festival that marks the beginning of spring.Vinitha Mahesh, a designer from Kochi, has brought out a collection named Medapoo, which has floral patterns, and comes in handloom, jute and banarasi silks. Vishu creates an image of flowers, not just the Kanikonna but also green leaves and those like lotus. The festival marks the arrival of spring which is filled with bright hues, she says. We are also doing hand prints of the kanikonna in coloured saris of various fabrics including cotton and silk. I also include the leaves along with the flowers in the designs, be it saris or set-mundu.The designs have more takers among the youth, she says. The young girls love them as it gives a graceful look keeping with the traditions. As they prefer pleat-less saris, they like the patterns on the top as well as the pallu portions. Lotus prints too are a hit among women, adds Vinitha.Neethu Krishna, a designer from Thiruvananthapuram, has taken inspiration from Vishu elements such as thechipoo, Vishupakshi and Kanivellari for her collections titled Vishu Kani Thechipoo is offered to lord Krishna for puja, and hence I decided to include the flower along with Kanikonna for set-mundus. Vishupakshi and Kani Vellari are hand printed on fabrics including tissue silk and cotton. For Kani Vellari, I have taken the green creepy strings of the plant as design, she says, admitting that the process is time consuming.While unni kannan and mayilpeeli designs were in vogue last year, this season the designers have decided to experiment with vibrant hues. Thats why I have been tinkering with designs featuring blue lotus and vines, she says.Meanwhile, designer Reshma Binu opines that the trend of floral designs was bound to happen sooner than later. The colour yellow and konnapoo comes to my mind every time I think about Vishu. So personally, I would pick something in mustard colour, especially a kurthi. The festival falls in spring so handwork of floral patterns and embellishments are always good to go, she says.Meanwhile, Kochi-based designer Sreejith Jeevan attributes urbanisation for the change in dressing styles even during a traditional festival. People now opt for a dress that can suit multiple occasions. They prefer dresses that will reflect their character and also goes well with every occasion, he says.For his designs, the shades used extensively are ivory white, off-white and generic flower colours. Everyone is multi-tasking nowadays, so they look for simple yet versatile pieces. Women now prefer trying different layering combinations. This makes it easier to change their looks especially if they have two or more celebrations. They can attend their office Vishu celebrations and add a different layer for their club festivities. Customers also opt for tunics that give a stylish appeal, he says.One aspect, Sreejith says he has observed is that Malayalis festival dressing style has changed and they now prefer a sophisticated, minimal look. Apart from women, I find that men are also ready to experiment. Instead of teaming up a mundu with a silk shirt, they can always opt for contemporary shirts, he says."

On August 1, 2015, over 14,000 people in 37 enclaves got new identities and the promise of a better future after India and Bangladesh agreed on an enclave exchange. In Kokoyabari, most residents, including Burman, have had to construct makeshift toilets while they wait to get proper ones under the Swachh Bharat scheme. Without a school in the area, most children must trek to the nearest primary school, which is is two-and-a-half km away, or the nearest higher secondary school, which is 5 km away, Burman said.Everyone seems to have forgotten us. Just before the polls, some government people come and measure the land. Then they disappear. There are no proper roads. Aanganwadi centres are yet to open. People are yet to get papers for their lands. Here, people have small plots of one or two bighas each, said 66-year-old Bijendranath Burman, a resident of Falanpur, speaking to The Indian Express over phone. Burman was the president of the erstwhile Chit Nagarik Suraksha Committee, which fought for the cause of enclaves until an agreement with India was reached.According to Burman, small agricultural holdings in Falanpur add up to 506 acres, while in Nalgram they stand at a total of 1,393 acres. None of the residents in these areas have received the required papers yet. All we have are only a few tubewells and some solar-powered pump sets for irrigation. Even the voter ID cards given to us have a lot of anomalies and dont contain proper addresses. So many political parties are knocking on our doors now. But we have all decided not to vote in the panchayat polls. We feel cheated. In the newspapers, we read money has been sanctioned, but we see little on ground, said Burman.Official sources said Falanpur has a total population of 2,700, of which over 500 are voters. The ruling Trinamool Congress has blamed BJP for inciting the former enclave dwellers and hatching a conspiracy. All-round development has happenedBut it takes some time. BJP is going to these areas and inciting, misleading people Roads are being built, Aanganwadi centres are being set up, electrification in the areas where they live is complete. The government is building apartments for those who do not have land and have come from the Bangladesh enclaves. Their children are going to nearby schools. The government is also giving rations. We are talking to them and we are confident we will be able to convince them to vote, said North Bengal Development Minister Rabindranath Ghosh, MLA and the Trinamool Congress district president of Cooch Behar.The anger of former enclave dwellers is justified. Little has happened. Only some roads and some tubewells. Their land rights are a major issue. Most of them do not have land rights papers for their own fields. The government is planning to give them small apartments whereas they want the land to build a home. Schools, jobs promised are yet to be delivered. This, even though the central government has sanctioned money. We have highlighted the matter with the Centre, said Nikhil Ranjan Dey, BJP district president of Cooch Behar.Sarkar and his three brothers stay in a makeshift shelter in Haldibari, where six to seven family members stay in a single room. The brothers take turns to run two totos. Roy claimed the family receives 30 kg rice, 5 litres mustard oil, 5 kg kerosene, 5 kg masur dal, 2 kg of salt and 2 litres of milk monthly from the government. There are no schools here. There is no proper drainage system and no proper road. The government promised us employment and skill development through various projects, including animal husbandry and pisciculture. They promised to give us land too. Nothing happened. Many here are working as labourers to fend for their families. I left a job in a medicine company, and my wife, that of a nurse. So many times we have approached the BDO and SDO, nothing happened, said Sarkar, claiming that his community had recently held a meeting and decided to abstain from voting.Roy and his family hail from an enclave in Bangladeshs Debigunj under Panchagarh. They had come to the Haldibari camp on November 27, 2015. There are 530 people (105 families) in the camp, of which 362 are voters, sources said. Roys wife, Kanika, said the low-cost apartments promised to them are still under construction. Each apartment has only one room for families with six or seven members, she added.Our surname is Roy, but somehow, after we got our voter IDs, it was written Sarkar there, she further claimed. At Nalgram, another former enclave, there are 969 voters in a population of 1,800, official sources said. Residents contacted by The Indian Express said they are yet to get papers for their lands, which is their prime demand.I have a family of six. I have two-bigha land, but I am yet to get papers from the government even after three years. We also demand a proper road and a health centre. We will not vote this time. We have voted in the 2016 assembly polls, before which voter ID cards were hurriedly issued to us. But this time, we will not, said Debicharan Adhikari (42), a resident of Nalgram near Mathabhanga in Cooch Behar.Burman, whose family has two-and-a-half bighas of land at Kokoyabari, said almost none of the announced government schemes have reached the ground so far. There are so many government schemes, but we are yet to benefit. We were promised toilets under Swacch Bharat. But that never happened. Some of us used our own money and set up toilets. So many government officials came, media took our pictures, but then everyone forgot us. We are fed up with the false promises. We still have no means of drinking water or a proper drainage system, he said.Kokoyabari has 52 voters from 16 families, official sources said.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

Whats more, wrestling enthusiasts from western UP and Haryana flock here every year in August when the dangal season begins.Uphaar Sharma(22) a national level wrestler from Dankaur Gautam Budh Nagar, is eyeing a post in Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) or Railways under sports quota. (Sunil Ghosh/HT Photo)Wrestling is what defines Sarfabad, which has a history of 275 years of having one pahalwan in every household. Here, families boast of khurak (diet) of their in-house wrestlers and matchmaking is done according to the chest size of the men. Predominantly home to the Yadav community, Sarfabad is also infamous for being the native place of former Mafiosi-turned politician DP Yadav, who is currently serving a life sentence in Dehradun jail.Kushti (wrestling) is the glue that has kept the social fabric of this village intact for almost three centuries. The sport thrives here in every household as we train young boys to professional athletes, says Surendra Singh Yadav, a resident and wrestling coach of Sarfabad.However, with the fast-paced urbanisation of Noida, the village is like any other urban village of Delhi-NCR it has accepted the charms of consumerism as is evident from the swanky SUVs parked under cowsheds in pucca houses. As a result, veterans wrestlers fear that youngsters will now be lured away by corporate jobs and higher education opportunities, much to the detriment of the sport.Its a fact that the number of professional and amateur wrestlers has declined in Sarfabad. Hunt for employment has made many men leave the village while others just boast of wrestling as a hobby they inherited from their fathers. I always tell young people that studies are important but so are sports. Kushti gives you discipline, teaches you values and keeps you away from vices, says Sukhbir Singh, an army veteran and former wrestler who runs a akhara in the village.Coach Surendra Singh Yadav, an army veteran, trains young wrestlers in Sarfabad in a bid to sustain the wrestling culture of the village. (Sunil Ghosh/HT Photo)To provide a professional touch to the wrestling culture of Sarfabad, 49-year-old Singh alias Sukhbir Pahalwan has been training young boys for the past 15 years. Employed as a wrestler in the army, Singh took retirement at the age of 34, after a knee injury in 2003.Over 100 young men and boys train in his akhara every day and many have represented Uttar Pradesh in the national games. A few, such as 27-year-old Subodh Yadav, have represented India in the Asian Games.Every day, Singh reaches his akhara by 6am to guide the young wrestlers who train in the loose soil mixed with henna, mustard oil and turmeric to avoid bodily injuries.Checking the soil quality, Singh says, Hundred years ago, we had legendary wrestlers such as Malkhan Pahalwan and Balwant Pahalwan who had trained all their lives under extreme poverty with only mustard oil available to them. Today, our boys have all the facilities, including a proper diet, yet we find it difficult to make them pursue wrestling as a profession.However, lack of interest is not the only hurdle for the young wrestlers of Sarfabad. Diets are expensive and lack of employment opportunities keeps troubling them.A regular diet of any wrestler includes a huge quantity of almonds, 1.5 litre milk, fruits, juice and other protein nutrients. They have to shell out a minimum Rs 1,000 every day on food. Although we train here for free, the cost of the diet makes it even difficult for a few to take up professional wrestling. I know a few wrestlers who had to seek jobs as bouncers to continue their diet, says 22-year-old Gaurav Chaudhary, who had appeared in the national games last year.Wrestlers at Sukhbir Pahalwans akhara prefer army posts over government jobs. However, none of the 50 wrestlers who have been trained here have been employed by any state or central government agency.Since I have participated in national games thrice, I was eligible for a Grade 4 division job but I refused to apply since I am eyeing a post in Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) or the Railways, says 22-year-old Uphaar Sharma, a Dankaur-based wrestler who trains in Sarfabad.Sukhbir Pahalwan believes that it is the duty of society to ensure that a wrestler doesnt have to lose his dignity to seek a livelihood once he his past his prime.The life of a wrestler is not easy when you have to train four to five hours every day amid dust and soil and take care of your body weight with a strict diet. We dont allow our boys to go to the movies or pubs as wrestling requires dedication and focus. A wrestler puts his entire youth at stake and trains hard to bring glory to his state and country. When his prime days are over, it becomes the responsibility of society to take care of him, Sukhbir argues.In such times, the dangal season in August and September is a windfall for wrestlers as organisers place bets on them according to the tournaments they have participated in.For example, a national level wrestler can easily fetch a bet of Rs 30,000 whereas an Asian Games wrestler gets a bet as high as Rs 50,000. Wrestlers from western UP and Haryana also attend the dangals, adding to the charm.Their coach Surendra Singh Yadav believes that excessive exposure to traditional wrestling such as might also act as a hindrance for wrestlers when they go for international tournaments.The typical stance wrestlers use in dangal is the Hanuman stance where one leg protrudes ahead of the other and the body is bent forward. However, according to international wrestling standards, keeping your legs together benefit the wrestler in maintaining balance. It becomes difficult for players to unlearn the tricks of dangal and adapt to international standards, Yadav says.However, for Sukhbir Pahalwan, it is not the professional glory but personal etiquette that matters most.Wrestling teaches perseverance, patience and tolerance. After a knock-out or an unintentional backbreaker move, a wrestler might feel humiliated and angry but he has to learn to control his anger and use it judiciously at the right time. Before learning wrestling, a player must learn humility and compassion. He has to put his ego aside and learn to bend as a token of respect for his elders and colleagues. Without humility, a wrestler is nothing but a street goon, Sukhbir says.As Sukhbir kept explaining the nitty-gritty of wrestling, Gaurav Chaudhary and Uphaar Sharma (both 90kg category wrestlers) are locked in a bout. Chaudhary pounces on Sharma from behind, bends his hand towards his back, puts his knee on his head and makes him taste the soil till he accepts defeat. A few minutes later, both the wrestlers are seen sharing a badam milk and friendly banter."
5b1b76199855b76d57039f20,Problem for the mandis: Farmers have enough foodgrain but warehouses don’t,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/problem-for-the-mandis-farmers-have-enough-foodgrain-but-warehouses-dont/articleshow/63852134.cms,2018-04-21,"GURUGRAM: Wholesale foodgrain marts (mandis) around Gurugram are facing a crunch. Farmers are complaining the grains they bring over to the mandis as per schedule, are either not being accepted, or not getting transported to the warehouse straight away, resulting in exposure to rains , and the possibility of rotting.As TOI had reported from Sohna mandi on April 10, unseasonal rain had left much of this seasons procured grain in the district wet. At Sohna mandi, several farmers, who were waiting to deposit their crop  both wheat and mustard  also reported delays, and of state-run agencies refusing to buy the produce from some farmers. Rains were a problem in Sohna as mandi agencies refused to purchase grains that had seelan (moisture). But the situation has improved in the Sohna since then, said farmer Karan Singh Raghav of Badshapur Tether village.Farmers and officials agree their biggest problem is lack of storage. According to a departmental source, Haryana has 108 mandis and 300 (smaller) purchasing centres, of which 152 are vulnerable to inclement weather as they dont have walls or sheds. Farrukhanagar farmer Rao Maan Singh said, We will sell our crop, but its people down the line who depend on rations, who will suffer when the grain isnt stored quickly.He also hinted at a collusion between mandi officials and truck unions behind the delay in procurement. The delay is deliberate, as was the sudden halt in procurement between April 10 and April 16. Farmers who were scheduled to bring their crop in those days had to turn back, and will have to rehire trucks or tractors to come back with the crop on another day, benefiting truck owners, said Singh.Last week, SDM Pataudi Vivek Kalia, while inspecting the mandis in Jatauli and Farrukhnagar, had recorded a number of complaints, including refusal of agencies to procure grains, delay in payment and of procured grains not being lifted to the warehouse by the transporter.The Farrukhnagar mandi committees report says their mart alone had bought 1,74,059 quintals of wheat between April 1, 2017 and March 31, 2018. In comparison, 1,70,745 quintals have already been received between April 1 and April 15 this year, indicating a rise in foodgrain input at the mandi. However, with shortage of decent quality storage or transport facilities in the district, this could easily rot According to officials, agencies had stopped procurement of foodgrains for six days last week citing either excess moisture or shortage of gunny bags. Agencies, including Hafed  which procures mustard  and Haryana Warehouse Corporation (HWC)  which procures wheat  were also asked to speed up lifting and transportation. Samay Singh Bhati, the Kisan Morcha president from Sohna, pointed out to a dire shortage in agriculture development officers (ADO) for the delays. While there are posts for 2,000 ADOs, there are only 600 of them.During SDM Kalias visit to the mandis, agencies had cited lack of gunny bags  which are procured by the food and supply department from the Jute Corporation in Kolkata  to store wheat, as the reason behind stopping procurement. Though at the time of inspection, procured grains were being lifted for storage, the long lag between procurement and storage was evident from the huge stock lying in the open. Ideally, grains should be lifted and stored on a day-to-day basis, said Kalia. Though procurement began on April 2, lifting started only after April 8 as HWC wanted to reduce labour and other costs, resulting in almost 40% of the stock lying in the open at the mandis.The division-head also met a member of marketing committee and officials of Hafed and HWC on the spot on April 14. He reported HWC was issuing cheques to farmers which had to be signed from HWC district manager in Palwal. Agency officials were also asked not to cite moisture as reason for not lifting grains from the market, because if the stock had been lifted on time, it wouldnt have got wet. Instead, the inspection note by the HWC division head threatened action against officials responsible for procurement delay.Earlier this month, TOI had reported that over 500 quintals of wheat, which was lying in the open at the mandi, had become wet and was at the risk of rotting. While Gurugram is not a prominent agricultural district, unscheduled rains have wreaked havoc with foodgrain procurement."

Four persons in the vehicle, two of them on the loading deck, were injured when they were thrown off. The spilled oil turned the road slippery, forcing traffic to be suspended for more than three hours.The incident happened around 10pm when the truck was heading towards a Kidderpore market from the Burrabazar area.In order to check vehicles from over speeding  especially at night when there are fewer policemen on the road  Kolkata Police places guardrails with wheels next to each other, but not parallel. Vehicles have to slow down and turn cautiously to pass through the gap without hitting the structures.This particular truck, however, was speeding and while attempting to turn through the small gap between the guardrails  about 10m  the driver lost control and the truck fell on its left, said an officer of Maidan police station.Police took the four injured persons  Swapan Chandra Bag , 40, Debasish Pattanaik, 42, Biswanath Betal , 42, and driver Sarman Ram , 50  to SSKM Hospital with injuries on the head, limbs and face.But none was critically hurt and were discharged on Friday, an officer said.When the truck fell, tins carrying mustard oil leaked and spilled over on the road. The oil mixed with diesel and engine oil trickling from the vehicle and turned the area into a mess and many rescuers slipped while trying to help the victims.The area had become so slippery, that it was impossible for vehicles to ply on the road. A crane was brought in, but even that could not operate because of the road surface was too oily, said the officer.The cops then suspended traffic on that portion of the road. They sprayed water on the road and then sprinkled sand on the road surface to reduce the grease. Finally, after over three hours, cops managed to pull up the truck and tow it away. Normal traffic movement along the road started only after the surface was declared fit for vehicular movement."

But when his hotline rings, he has three hours to ready equipment for experts on a dangerous mission to probe if toxic weapons have been unleashed  again.Tucked away in a small industrial zone in the Dutch suburb of Rijswijk, a two-storey building, with about 20 staff, has been key to the two decades of work by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to eliminate the worlds toxic arms stockpiles. It was here that the team, which was on Saturday allowed access to Douma, began their mission.Bringing back samplesAs the clamour grows for answers, any samples they collect will be sealed and brought back here, under a strictly monitored chain of custody, for further analysis and verification. A former soldier, Mr. Barrett has spent 21 years at the OPCW since its first beginnings, training and equipping those who volunteer to travel to the worlds most toxic hotspots. Hes even deployed himself.From carbon-impregnated protection suits to elephant-sized rubber boots to cover shoes, sophisticated detectors, satellite phones and medical kits bristling with vials of antidotes to the worlds deadliest nerve agents, all the equipment has to be checked and double-checked.Amid political claim and counter-claim about chemical weapons use in Syria, where chlorine gas and mustard gas have both been proven to have been used, as well as the unleashing of a rare nerve agent last month in the sleepy British town of Salisbury, the focus here remains on protecting the team and preserving the integrity of science.No detail can be overlooked. Even a pinprick hole in a glove could prove fatal if a deadly nerve agent seeped through the skin to attack a persons nervous system. VX, the deadliest nerve agent ever invented, can kill within 20 minutes.Despite some 7,000 official missions  10,000 if you count training missions  in 21 years, it is a source of pride that no team member has ever been affected by a chemical weapon.This dangerous and methodical work by the OPCW, which has around 400 staff, has succeeded in eliminating some 96% of the worlds toxic arms stockpiles. A feat which won it the Nobel Peace Prize in 2013.Once on site, a team of experts which can vary between two to 25 members, scans the area with flame photometric detectors or ion mobility spectrometers to detect any toxic agents. Paper tests, like litmus tests, can also warn of the presence of nerve or blister agents. Working under tight time constraints, sometimes with less than 20 minutes, they gather samples, such as plants or soil.Speaking to survivorsBiomedical samples like blood and urine from alleged victims are also key, and in some cases tissue from the dead will also be taken. We prefer to take samples from survivors, because those can be interviewed, they can tell their story, which can be fact-checked from others, said Marc-Michael Blum, the head of the OPCW laboratory.Once the samples are brought back to Rijswijk, they are then split and sent to a couple of the 20 or so independent labs certified by the OPCW around the world.Amid strict confidentiality, the labs prepare independent reports, which are then collated by the OPCW. The aim is to ensure that no question marks are raised over the integrity of the evidence or the results."

Fire had destroyed crops on several hundred acres in the state in the last few days during the harvesting season in the state.The state government is working on different alternatives to increase the prescribed limit for procurement of mustard and bajra crops and plans to export mustard oil. Khattar stated this while addressing dealers and farmers after inspecting wheat procurement in the Jhajjar Mandi on Sunday. Minister of state for food, civil supplies and consumer affairs Karan Dev Kamboj was also present. Khattar inspected the weight of wheat sacks on scales before loading, besides the quality of wheat and the pace of procurement. He congratulated farmers for producing a bumper wheat crop in the state.In the previous season, about 74 lakh metric tonnes of wheat was procured while this season 65 lakh metric tonnes of wheat has already been procured and the process would continue for 10 more days, he added. On mustard procurement, he said the central government procured 25% of the total production, but after achieving the target of 2.7 lakh metric tonnes in Haryana , additional one lakh metric tonnes of mustard was procured through Hafed Oil from mustard procured through Hafed would be made available at a cost of Rs 20 per litre for BPL families through PDS. The previous governments never procured mustard at the MSP, but the present government has procured mustard at MSP during the last two seasons.Regarding procurement of crops in other states, the CM said the system in the state was better than the neighbouring states. The procurement work is being constantly monitored and arrangements have been made to procure the produce of farmers, he added."

That works out to Rs 11,571 per farmer. (Express archive) In 2016-17, a total payout of Rs 12,959.10 crore to 1.12 crore farmers was made under PMFBY. That works out to Rs 11,571 per farmer. (Express archive)A well-conceived pro-farmer agricultural crop insurance scheme  the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY)  is faced with the prospect of coming a cropper. The reason: The failure of most states to make timely payments of their premium subsidy share and also conduct the requisite number of crop cutting experiments (CCE) for assessment of yield losses.Under the PMFBYs operational guidelines, state governments are supposed to call bids for the selection of insurance companies in early February, well ahead of the new crop year. This is followed by the issuance of notifications incorporating all relevant details  the crops covered and companies operating in different areas, indemnity levels and average yields against which compensation is calculated, sum insured, actuarial premium rates and subsidy on this, etc  by March in respect of the kharif season and by September for rabi. The cut-off dates for receipt of premium from farmers, making them eligible for insurance, are July 31 (for kharif) and December 31 (rabi).Read | The weakest link in crop insuranceThe states are also expected to release the first instalment of their premium subsidy contribution for kharif in August-September and the balance 50 per cent by November-December, with the corresponding rabi season cut-offs being January-February and April-May respectively. Besides, they are required to carrying out CCEs  a minimum of four in every village/gram panchayat, 16 in every taluka/tehsil/block and 24 in every district  for estimation of yields. The CCE-based yield data is to be submitted to insurance companies within a month after harvesting, which happens during October-December for the kharif and April-June for the rabi crop. The companies, in turn, are to process, approve and make payments of the final claims in three weeks from the receipt of the yield data.If the states provide their full share of premium subsidy along with yield data not later than January for kharif and July for rabi, farmers can receive their claim payments within reasonable time. Insurance companies will obviously not process claims unless they get their full premium payment and also the crop yield data for loss assessment, a top Union Agriculture Ministry official pointed out.Unfortunately, the above seasonality discipline is not being maintained by most states. Rajasthan, for instance, issued the notification of the PMFBY scheme for kharif 2017 only on July 22, when the bulk of sowing was already completed. Even for the rabi season, the notification came on November 3, when farmers would have finished planting their main mustard crop. This would automatically have deprived them from seeking protection against losses due to failed/prevented sowing.We are pushing the states to at least notify the scheme before April 15, to allow adequate time for the implementation agencies (insurance companies) and also for banks to debit the premiums and upload the details of the individual insured farmers, the official said. Even for the coming kharif 2018 season, the states  barring a few such as Maharashtra, Karnataka and Odisha  are yet to issue the necessary notifications.The ultimate sufferer from this is the farmer. In 2016-17, gross premium collections of insurance companies  both charged to farmers as well as subsidy received from the Centre and states  amounted to Rs 22,180 crore. As against this, payment of claims totalled just Rs 12,959 crore. While that can probably be attributed to 2016 being a normal monsoon year and no reports of widespread crop damage or losses, it is striking, nevertheless, that the claims paid out are lower than what has been estimated by state governments or even approved by insurance companies. And these, for crops that were harvested or suffered yield losses at least a year ago.The same story has been repeated in 2017-18, where insurance companies have collected over Rs 24,450 crore worth of premium receipts even after the delays by states in forking out their subsidy contribution. But the fact that payouts to farmers have so far totalled just Rs 402 crore  when more than four months have passed since the kharif crop was harvested  points to undue delays in the furnishing of yield data by states. Further, the CCE-based yields are themselves prone to questioning by insurance companies, which is reflected in the gap between the claims approved by them and the losses estimated by the states (see accompanying table).The weakest link in PMFBY is the CCE. Crop loss assessment has to not only be timely, but also reasonably accurate in order to inspire confidence among insurance companies, admitted the earlier-quoted official.The result: A scheme that looks good on paper is now virtually flattering to deceive. For farmers, a uniform 2 per cent premium rate on the sum insured for all kharif season foodgrains and oilseeds, while 1.5 per cent for rabi crops and 5 per cent for annual and horticultural crops, is the lowest they can hope for. The sum insured being equal to the scale of finance (the loan limit fixed by banks, covering the underlying crops estimated production costs) and coverage extending to losses at every stage (from sowing to post-harvest) makes PMFBY all the more attractive to the farmer.In 2016-17, a total payout of Rs 12,959.10 crore to 1.12 crore farmers was made under PMFBY. That works out to Rs 11,571 per farmer. But more than the amount, it is the timeliness of payment that matters. If the farmer has less or no crop to sell because of rainfall failure, and there is inordinate delay in insurance claim settlement, he is invariably forced to go to the moneylender.This situation can, perhaps, be significantly addressed if PMFBY is made a fully Centrally-funded scheme. Currently, states have to pay 50 per cent of the premium subsidy and also do all the CCE and other groundwork  for a scheme bearing the prime ministers name. Once the Centre starts bearing the entire subsidy cost, the insurance companies can no longer complain about not getting their premium monies upfront and in time. The states, too, would be forced to fall in line, if the release of premium subsidy is linked to their adhering to seasonality discipline that is lacking now.Complete central funding might, of course, go against the grain of competitive cooperative federalism advocated by the Modi government. But if the Centre can pay 100 per cent subsidy on fertilisers, what stops it from taking complete ownership of a scheme more deserving of support than even interest subvention on crop loans?For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

After about ten minutes I poked the handle of a thin spoon into one of the idlies to know if it was ready to eat.What came sticking to the spoon as I raised it was the raw batter itself since it was only partly cooked. The lid of the cooker lying beside the stove was an indication that I had forgotten to close the vessel. Soon covering the cooker with the lid, I turned the gas on. When I returned to the kitchen after about 10 minutes, I found it hard to insert the spoon into the idli, as the stuff had by then turned too hard to be pierced, compelling me to discard the whole stuff. A Maggie snob, I changed over in short order to a packet of Maggie and had it cooked.The next day, for a change of taste I made a bash at preparing rava upma. Even the thought of the dish prepared occasionally by my wife made my mouth water.I poured a tumbler full of water into a skillet, placed it on the stove and turned the knob on. When the water began steaming, I put in it a tumbler of rava, added chopped onions and green chillies to it and left for the main hall to read the daily. Fifteen minutes later I returned to the kitchen, took a big tablespoon, filled it half with refined oil, added a pinch of mustard and heated it on the stove till the contents started sizzling and crackling. Emptying out the spoon tout de suite into the rava, I stirred them well and kept the skillet on the kitchen platform for it to cool.Tongue hanging out to eat upma, I came back to the kitchen after a few minutes and shoved a perforated ladle between the frying pan and the lump of what was supposed to have turned into upma.As I made an unstinting bid to scoop up a bit of the substance with one hand while gripping the pan tight with tongs, up came the frying pan together with the solid stuff  supposed to be upma  contained in it. Digging into the hard substance with a spoon, I picked up a blind bit of it to feel how it tasted. It clung tight to my palates like a stick jaw forcing me to try different means to free my mandible.The skillet landed in the scullery. I had to keep it soaked in water for hours before I could try to separate the clingy stuff from the pan. Slices of bread dunked in coffee substituted my cherished upma for breakfast that day."

The total GE ingredients shall be of top three ingredients in terms of their percentage in the product,"" the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) said in the draft. The labelling shall be as -- ""Contains GMO/Ingredients derived from GMO"", it added.In India, Bt cotton is the only GM crop allowed for commercial cultivation.The government has not permitted GM technology in cultivation of food crops like brinjal and mustard amid safety concerns.The FSSAI draft regulations prescribe the labelling requirements of pre-packaged foods and display of essential information on the premises where food is manufactured, processed, served and stored.On labelling of alcoholic beverages, FSSAI has proposed that the labels should carry a statutory warning -- CONSUMPTION OF ALCOHOL IS INJURIOUS TO HEALTH; BE SAFE - DON'T DRINK AND DRIVE -- in English language.In case, states want the warning to be printed in the local or regional language, it should be allowed, without the need for repeating the English version.FSSAI has also proposed that the country of origin of the food shall be declared on the label of food imported into India.""When a food undergoes processing in a second country which changes its nature, the country in which the processing is performed shall be considered to be the country of origin for the purposes of labelling,"" the draft said."

(Express photo by Karma Sonam Bhutia) A farmer near GTB Nagar station. (Express photo by Karma Sonam Bhutia)By Anushka Jain and Neha KulkarniFOR ALGURAM Kevat, farming alongside railways tracks near Guru Tegh Bahadur railway station on the Central Railways (CR) Harbour line has been a roller coaster ride. Those cultivating the land say the farm produce is meagre, the land is not fertile and they have to deal with water shortage during summers.We do not have enough funds to buy fertilisers. The railways leased out the land to us in 2002. Since then, I have been cultivating crops, including radish or ladies finger, on the fields. Moving out would be dearer for me. Thus I prefer to stay here with my family, says Kevat, who has been cultivating the land for past eight years.To protect its land from encroachment by slums and to put to use the vacant land, the railways started a scheme called Grow More Food in 1975.Officials said lower-ranking railway employees, generally use these lands for cultivation as an additional source of income.While the CR leased 733.83 acres for farming, the Western Railway gave 108.45 acres.Under this scheme, 238 Class III and Class IV railway employees were allotted land on lease to grow crops. This was aimed at enabling them to create additional income and for the railways to generate revenue out of the unused land, a senior railway official said.Farmers usually cultivate vegetables including fenugreek, mustard seeds, radish on the land.I manage to sell maximum of my farm produce to the vendors. However, as we cultivate near the tracks, getting heavy machines or equipment to aid in farming becomes difficult. We also face water issues with me and my son requiring to cycle four kilometres every day to get water, said Kevat.Adhyaprasad Chauhan, who farms between the Elphinstone Road and Parel stations agrees. He claims that living conditions are tough. At night, it is difficult to stay here. We dont have proper electric supply, Chauhan added.His family has been cultivating crops on the land since 30 years.Nuisance makers trespass into our lands at night. They tend to damage our crops or turn violent hurting me or my family. In one of such brawls, my son suffered injuries to his head. I am now familiar with their faces and can fend them off better, Chauhan added.Others claim they plan to move out if the situation remains the same. I plan to move back to my village in Faizabad if I am unable to make more returns, he added.A senior CR official said, The scheme encourage optimum use of the railway land. We have assisted farmers with their requirements and we will continue to look into their needs.Farming along side railway tracks has been carried out between Kurla and Vidyavihar railway stations, near Shahad and Ambivali railway stations, near Guru Tegh Bahadur nagar station on the CR and beyond Bandra station (West) on the WR.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

It was one of those days when there was talk of rain. We thought it called for a nice meal, ordered in, but we were not keen on having Chinese. I felt a Bengali meal would be a good idea, but the local Bengali food takeaway was a bit disappointing when we had last placed an order from there.So I thought I would go looking for Prinsep 21. I had heard about it and had been following it up on the internet. But the place in Noida did not deliver to Mayur Vihar, so I knew that if I had to try the food out, I had to make a visit there. So, that day when the weather  sultry but promising rain  demanded a memorable meal, I went trudging towards Noida in the heat.And I am glad I did  for it turned out to be best Bengali meal Ive had in a very long time. The dhoka  a curried dish of steamed lentil cakes  was so delicious that I made sure some was left over for my breakfast the next morning. That was certainly the first time ever I had dhokar dalna for breakfast!But before I get to the food, let me tell you about the place. Prinsep 21 is in Noida, Sector 51 (Phone numbers: 08010360859and 8470880448). I called one of the numbers up a few times to find the place. The take-away is run from a small room with an attached kitchen in a lane.Wielding a deft karchi is Mrs Biswas. Handling the orders is Mr Biswas. And lending a helping hand is their daughter, Bipasha (and occasionally the son-in-law). The Biswas takeaway offers most of the dishes that Bengalis go gaga over  from mustard rahu to prawn malai curry and from aloo posto to chholar dal.I asked for some rohu jhol, dhokar dalna, chicken rezala and mango chutney. They added aloo bhaja to the food packet.I had a delicious dinner that evening. The potato fries  called jhurjhurey aloo bhaja  were wafer thin and crunchy, and I wished Id ordered some moong dal to go with it. The gravy in the rezala, with plump and juicy pieces of chicken in it, was light, yet full of flavours, with the yoghurt giving it a mildly tart taste. The fish, again large pieces, had been cooked with basic spices  a pinch of cumin seeds, coriander, green chillies and mustard, and was again excellent. But the dhokar dalna took the cake, if you would pardon the pun. The steamed lentil cakes were incredibly soft, full of juices and just lightly spiced. Even the next morning, when I ate them for breakfast, they were as soft as ever.The chutney was sweet and sour, and was a happy end to what was a delightful meal.Mr Biswas told me that their menu depends on whats freshly available. If there is good hilsa or pabda at CR Park, he buys them, and then they are cooked for the day. The menu includes some of the old specialities that are not easily available in Bengali eateries  such as a dish called muri-ghonto, fish head cooked with rice. Some old favourites are also there  such as Kolkata biryani, mutton dak bungalow with eggs and kosha mangsho.The rates are fair. Chicken rezala is for Rs. 240, rui jhol for Rs. 300, dhokar dalna for Rs. 190 and mango chutney for Rs. 70.They have chops, fish fillet fried and pea-filled kachoris, too. There is a whole pomfret on the menu, along with various kinds of fish including mustard pabda.I am happy to have found Prinsep 21  the house of Mr Biswas."

But the controversy at hand is perilously sensitive, conceivably volatile and seriously scrappy. Nevertheless, I am gallantly going to raise the question, so here goes: Is the vada pao (hold your breath), a traditional Maharashtrian food or not?Oh dear me I can hear the faint sounds of utensils clashing, the feel of heat sizzling and a faraway murmur even as I speak these words. Is that the sound of turmoil or is it just the sound of hot oil. Well, like all civilised people do, lets chat about this.The vada pao is Mumbais go-to food, and you dont need me to tell you that. But is the chauvinism slightly misplaced? I can only speak from personal memory. When I was a kid, in the early 70s, there was only batata vada, and no such thing as a vada pao.In fact the pao or bread was taboo in most Hindu homes till as late as the 1950s. Only Christians, Parsis and Muslims ate bread. Rumour has it that Portuguese missionaries in 15th-century Goa would throw bread into Hindu wells at night, and when Hindus drank the water the next morning, the missionaries would proclaim You have now become Christians.This much-loved working-class snack was created in the citys Maharashtrian heartland, Dadar. Or so they say. (HT File Photo)In a traditional Maharashtrian restaurant like Prakash Shakahari Upahar Kendra at Dadar  where the iconic batata vada is a big fat ball of mashed potato spiced with green chilies, turmeric, curry leaves and mustard seeds, doused in batter and deep-fried till its a crispy gold; and where the time-honoured misal is dark and dangerously spiced with garam masala and raw onions  if you dare ask for pao to go with either, the waiter will stare you down with disdain and flatly refuse.So then when did the vada acquire the pao and assume the mantle of Mumbais most identifiable food?The most plausible story traces it back to a batata vada seller outside Dadar station, in the early 70s. The food cart was poised right in the centre of hundreds of hungry commuters rushing about at a pace only Mumbai demands. His snack was in great demand, but the piping hot batata vadas were impossible to eat on the run.As the story goes, this enterprising vendor decided to find a way to make it portable. Right next to him was a street cart selling omelette-pao. He observed how an omelette could quickly be sandwiched between a pao, and taken away.The legend goes that he borrowed some bread from the omelette-pao-walla, threw in some garlic chutney and bunged in a batata vada. And lo and behold, the vada pao was born.Watch out for Maska Maarke by Kunal Vijayakar in Hindustan Times, Mumbai, and on hindustantimes.com/mumbai, every Saturday morning.This working-class snack, created in the citys Maharashtrian heartland, was soon to become a staple food, a political symbol, a favourite in one of Londons most happening eateries and the only Indian dish that I could find at the foot of Mount Titlis in Switzerland. Salut, vada pao."

What about the fact that GM mustard has never been tested as a herbicide tolerant crop, for its environmental and health ramifications a point that has remained unaddressed by the regulators, the Coaltion for a GM-Free India queried in a statement.The clearance for GM mustard has been mired in confusion. On May 12, last year the then GEAC chairperson Amita Prasad said that the crop had been recommended for cultivation. In October, the government did a volte-face and said there was an inadvertent error in the announcement regarding mustard and said that subsequent to receipt of various representations from different stakeholders, matters related to environmental release of transgenic mustard are kept pending for further review.Union Environment Minister, Harsh Vardhan  who had the final say on the matter said that wider consultations on the release of the crop were needed.Dhara Mustard Hybrid (DMH -11), the transgenic mustard in question, had been developed by a team of scientists at Delhi University, led by former Vice-Chancellor Deepak Pental under a government-funded project."

Picture by Sanat Kr SinhaCalcutta: In skintight leathers and metal chains and rings, she is a typical Milwaukee biker raring to ride.But her long tresses and crinkly eyes make her the no-nonsense designer who puts comfort and fit over everything else.Meet Karen Davidson, the creative director of Harley-Davidson's General Merchandise and great granddaughter of William A. Davidson, one of the Davidson brothers who partnered William S. Harley to make the iconic American bike - the Harley-Davidson.In town to inaugurate the Harley-Davidson apparel store in South City mall, Karen rode into the mall in her signature style.""I was nine when I first rode a bike. I trained in an M50 those days. I would ride mostly off-road till I got my licence at 16,"" Karen said as she perched herself on a stool in her new store in the mall.So, what was it like growing up in a motorcycle family? ""Oh, it was riding and taking part in rallies and races. Conversations were mostly around have you seen that bike? Do you think that one's better? We were discussing bikes constantly. I would see the craziest of leathers and the craziest people with all sorts of tattoos and piercings.""Vacations were mostly spent riding and fixing motorcycles while scrambling around the Milwaukee garage from where the Harley history started.While her favourite is the Road King, Karen said women bikers should customise their bikes to suit their individual riding style and comfort. ""I've never seen a single Harley model twice. Every thing is customised.""About 12 per cent of American bikers are women; but in India the number is much less. ""Each woman biker inspires the other to be a biker and that's how the women bike fraternity grows. It builds slowly. We have the Ladies of Harley, a sisterhood of bikers who share the experience and adventure of riding,"" she said.For her, it was only natural to join the family business once she graduated in fashion. She joined Harley-Davidson Motor Company in 1989 and was one of the original co-creators of the branded line of apparel and accessories. ""I started ground up, working in a small office and just doing what I could to make it into something bigger,"" said the designer, who has been sewing leather since a teen and made tough chic a fashion statement.In 1991, Harley-Davidson received an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America for being a major fashion influence. When she was young, Karen was influenced by the biker jackets riders wore at events. ""Each biker jacket was like reading someone's personal history. You could tell where they'd been by what they wore,"" she said as she sported a mustard chic jacket while she rode her Harley to the mall.Her father, Willie G. Davidson, was a major influence. ""He designed stellar bikes and his iconic bikes turned around the company. He talked to customers a lot and valued their feedback. I try to follow that,"" Karen said.About Calcutta, she just loves ""the spirit of riding"" here and is honoured to be a part of the thriving biking culture."
5b14beeb9855b744d638d3cb,"Long queues, soaring heat have Madhya Pradesh mandis on the edge",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/long-queues-soaring-heat-have-madhya-pradesh-mandis-on-the-edge-5190087/,2018-05-25,"Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. (Express file photo) Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. (Express file photo)Frustrated by the long wait to sell his produce of chana, a farmer stormed into the mandi office here last week and threatened: If I am not able to sell my crop on Monday, I will set it afire here. The threat, which came against the backdrop of a farmers death at the mandi as he waited to sell his produce, jolted the officials into action. They had a tough time pacifying the farmer.With hundreds of farmers waiting outside mandis in temperatures above 40 degree Celsius to sell their produce of chana, lentil and mustard to the government, scenes like these are becoming common across Madhya Pradesh. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday asked Collectors to take steps to reduce delays at mandis. The Collectors have been told to ensure that limited number of farmers are called to the mandis so that there are no queues. BJPs Kisan Morcha on Thursday asked its members to reach mandis and offer cold drinking water to the waiting farmers from May 25 to June 15.ALSO READ | High procurement of crop means little to farmers: Yogendra YadavThe BJP governments direction came a day after the Congress asked its workers to reach mandis and procurement centres and interact with farmers. Alleging that farmers are dying in the state due to firing, high debts, farm losses and now waiting to sell their crops, state Congress chief Kamal Nath has said the state government claims to be pro-farmer but they are the ones to suffer the most.The long queues at mandis and procurement centres follow the governments decision to buy wheat, gram, mustard and lentil directly from the farmers. The procurement of wheat began on March 15 and will continue till May 26 while purchase of chana, mustard and lentil began on April 10 and will continue till June 9. As of Thursday, the state government has procured 9.79 lakh MT chana, the highest ever in the country, and 70.58 lakh MT wheat.Wheat growers have been promised Rs 265 over and above the MSP of Rs 1,735 per quintal. The MSPs for chana, mustard and lentil are Rs 4,400, Rs 4,250 and Rs 4,000, respectively. Shortage of weighing machines and porters is aggravating the situation because only a limited number of trolleys can be weighed at the smaller mandis like the one at Lateri.Most mandis are not equipped with a weighbridge that can quickly weigh a loaded and unloaded trolley to determine the produce. The current process involves emptying a trolley on ground, distributing the content in sacks, weighing them and sealing them. It takes up to 80 minutes to weigh a 40-quintal trolley. After the death of the farmer last week, the Lateri Mandi increased the number of weighing scales but they are still proving inadequate to cater to the rush.Lateri, one of the smaller mandis, caters to 10,000 farmers living in a radius of 35 km. Once the farmers reach the mandi, before their turn or after, they dont go back home so that they save on diesel or rent of tractor-trolleys. Also, they have no option but to sell to the government because traders are offering much less. The farmers, however, said that if they sell to traders, they get the money immediately, but the proceeds from selling to the government is deposited after some days.We are angry with the government. We need money on time. No point getting something extra when the need is over, said Babu Khan, a farmer from Lateri, when asked about the extra money he will get by selling his produce to the government. Mandi officials, on the other hand, said the farmers either come before the due date or later and insist on selling their produce immediately. Even when they are told to go home and come at a later scheduled date, they dont go. This makes things unmanageable, said mandi official Vishwanath Dhamde.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
5b1ea0ae9855b74aba67e4d2,High Court asks Haryana if dera violence trials can be held in one place,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/gurgaon/hc-asks-haryana-if-dera-violence-trials-can-be-held-in-one-place/articleshow/64325575.cms,2018-05-26,"CHANDIGARH: The Punjab and Haryana high court on Friday asked the Haryana government if a common venue should be kept for the trial of all criminal cases related to the August 2017 violence which erupted after Dera Sacha Sauda head Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh was convicted of rape.A high court full bench headed by Justice Surya Kant posed the query to the state government during the resumed hearing of a case related to the dera violence. Justice Kant asked if all cases related to dera violence in Haryana could be consolidated for the purpose of trial at a common place to avoid any conflicting orders or confusion. The bench then asked senior advocate Anupam Gupta to address the court if such arrangements were tenable under law. The Haryana government has also been asked to provide details of all FIRs pending in the state regarding the violence.The bench, on Friday, also authorized the civil surgeon of Sirsa district to run the medical institutions of the dera under the supervision of a team headed by him. The court, however, made it clear that permission to run these medical institutions would not legalize the deras hospital building, found illegal by the town and country planning department.The court, however, asked the civil surgeon of Sirsa to verify the details of all medical and para-medical staff working in DSS-run medical institutions and submit a report to the court when the case next comes up for hearing on August 8.These orders were passed by the bench after Gupta objected to the list of medical staff working in DSS-run institutions produced before the bench. Gupta said qualifications and other details of the staff appeared vague. He claimed it was a tendency of private institutions to showcase a list of specialists, but they appeared only during inspections.He requested the bench to get details of the staff, like education qualifications and experience, verified by the health department. On this, the bench ordered civil surgeon of Sirsa to furnish complete details.During the hearing of the case, the court was also informed that an adhoc committee had already been constituted to run educational institutions of the dera. Bank to sell harvest for recovering Rs 9.5cr loanThe Punjab and Haryaan high court on Friday also allowed Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) to recover Rs 9.5 crore by auctioning goods which Dera Sacha Sauda mortgaged for a loan. The court passed the orders after allowing an application filed by the bank, stating that one of the companies of the dera had taken the loan and hypothecated wheat and mustard stock in its favour. The main argument of OBC was that since the goods were perishable, it should be allowed to auction them and recover its money. While allowing banks plea, the court asked it the keep the amount in the form of fixed deposit till the pendency of the case."

The two patients belong to the same family which has already lost four members to the disease.Dropsy is a disease that causes swelling of body parts. The diagnosis of epidemic dropsy is a strong possibility when there is clustering of cases in a single family with on and off gastrointestinal symptoms of vomiting and diarrhea in a mustard oil consuming belt.The patients, Ashok Kumar and Swati, who were admitted on Sunday afternoon, are being attended by Dr D Himanshu who said: ""Though in a state of shock due to back to back deaths in the family, they are stable."" Epidemic dropsy was reported in Lucknow in February 2005 when several died and over 75 had taken ill due to consumption adulterated mustard oil.About the two patients, Dr Himanshu informed that the diagnosis was made by doctors at Institute of Medical Sciences Banaras Hindu University (BHU) and agreed with it. ""Dropsy is determined symptomatically and the patients showed clear symptoms of the disease. What supports the diagnosis is the pattern of deaths in the family,"" he said.Ashok's eldest son Pankaj told TNN that they had been living in Maharashtra's palghar area until december 2017 when they returned to their native village in Jaunpur. In March, when Ashok's health deteroriated, the entire family packed its bags and came to the native village.""While the treatment of my father was underway, my mother complained of diarrhoea and swelling in the legs. She died in the course of treatment on April 26. Thereafter my younger brother's wife Kavita showed similar problem and she passed away on May 3. Few days later, my younger brothers Dheeraj and Neeraj developed the same disease which claimed their lives on May 14 and 24,"" the grief striken kin said.Pankaj added that when his father developed swelling in the feet, he rushed him to BHU. ""We came back from BHU on Saturday. But on Sunday, team from the district health office brought her to KGMU.DROPSY is a disease that causes swelling of body parts.* It is caused by consumption of mustard oil adulterated with oil of prickly poppy  scientifically known as argemone mexicana.* The adulterant contains alkaloids which have physiologically active toxins (sanguinarine and dihydrosanguinarine) which are harmful for health.* It was first noted in 1877. The disease killed around 65 persons in Delhi in 1998. In 2005, several persons were killed and over 75 were affected in Lucknow. Sporadic cases have been reported in many parts of the country. In 2014, a family in Punjab's Fatehgarh district.Sanguinarine causes metabolic disturbance in body and triggers typical symptoms which appears as swelling. The toxin affects the heart, liver and eyes and causes increased permeability of blood vessels. Death is almost certain when swelling reaches the heart or brain. When the toxin attacks the kidenys, renal failure leads to death.Acute nausea, vomiting, loose motions, bloated stomach, erythema, swelling of hands and feet known as oedema especially pedal (feet) oedema.WHO IS AT RISK: Anybody except for babies on breast feeding. Many members of the family are affected simultaneously due to common exposure.- The only preventive measure is to refrain from using oil which has not been tested for quality.- It is wiser to skip use of mustard oil when there is a fear of the epidemic.- Eating pickles or fried eatables from the market should be avoided as adulterated mustard oil may have been used.- The ISI Mark and FPO seals must be checked on the oil containers before buying them. If more than one member of a family complains of swellings accompanied by severe pain, medical help should be sought immediately.* Contamination of mustard oil with argemone oil can be checked in minutes using the nitric acid test. In fact it reveals the presence of any alien substance in the mustard oil. The list includes linseed oil, mahua oil, niger seed oil, safflower seed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, jute seed oil, tamarind oil and radish oil. For this:- Take about 5 ml. oil add an equal amount of pure nitric acid.- Shake for 1 minute so as to mix thoroughly.- Give a few minutes for the layers to separate.- The acid layer showing yellow to orange colour indicates presence of adultrant.* Care may also be taken at the time of buying mustard oil. While pure mustard oil will be golden yellow in colour while the adulterated oil will have an orange tinge.(Source: National Health Portal of India and TOI Archives)."

Government agencies need to keep this in mind if they want to preempt this.KOLKATA: Parents-in-law gearing up to treat their sons-inlaw to a sumptuous spread of mustard Hilsa and other Hilsa recipes for Jamai Sashthi on June 18 may find it heavy on the pocket. The hike in diesel prices is set to push up retail price of the favourite fish of Bengalis by Rs 80 to Rs 100 a kilogram.The peak Hilsa season starts from mid-June, just a few days before jamai sashthi. Thats when fishing trawlers which venture out on trips return to shore with their catch. Each short trip needs 800 litres of diesel, while long trips require 1,600 litres. Around this time last year, say fishermen, diesel cost stood at Rs 58 a litre.Thus, the jump to over Rs 71 alitre has raised the fuel cost for a short trip by Rs 10,400 and twice for a long one. After each trip, trawlers return with a catch of 1.5 quintals to 2 quintals of Hilsa along with other fish. This alone, say fishermen, will push up the wholesale price of Hilsa by at least Rs 52 a kilogram. This Hilsa then has to be transported to Kolkata markets. This cost will rise as well, courtesy the sky-rocketing diesel prices.Those in the Hilsa trade, from fishermen to retailers, say that all this will push up the retail price of Hilsa by at least Rs 80 a kilogram. Fishermen say, around mid-June last year, the wholesale price of the fish weighing between 500 grams to 600 grams ranged from Rs 500 to Rs 600 a kilogram and the larger variety of Hilsa weighing between 800 grams to 900 grams was priced between Rs 800 to Rs 900 a kilogram. The retail prices ranged from Rs 800 to Rs 900 akilogram for the smaller Hilsa weighing 500 grams to 600 grams and Rs 1,100 to Rs 1,200 a kilogram for the larger variety. West Bengal Fishermens Association secretary Bijon Maity said, The hike of Rs 13 per litre of diesel will have a spiralling effect on the retail price of Hilsa."

She comes from a long line of super cooks  her great grandmother, her grandmother and her mother just to mention a few. Her husband and two sons are good cooks, too. Sneha believes that with women going out to work, it is time for men to enter the kitchen. Her husband and sons and she take turns to cook  a fine arrangement. It leaves her a lot of time for other activities.There are many demands on Snehas expertise. Very often, people call and ask for advice. It must be said in her favour that she gives it unstintingly. Chandra is one such person who often seeks Snehas help. She refers to Sneha as SME (subject matter expert) which is apt.Chandra and a group friends congregated at Snehas house for dosas. The aroma of sambar was all-pervasive. Everyone was in raptures over the pan-fresh, paper-thin, crisp dosas, served with onion sambar, coconut chutney and chutney powder. Chandra went home and profusely praised the food she had eaten. Her daughter asked, Why dont you get the recipe from Sneha aunty?Promptly, Chandra phoned Sneha and asked for the recipes. First, the sambar, said the master chef and went on to explain how it is made. Evidently, Chandra was sitting down at her end with notepad and pen. Just to be sure I have all the ingredients I need... And reeled them off. So far, so good, averred Sneha. Be sure to get the special small variety onions as they make the sambar more flavourful, she cautioned. Remember to garnish with coriander last and season with mustard seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, and curry leaves.Now the chutney. Grated coconut, fried gram dal...Is that right? Perfect! was the encouraging reply. Ill let you know how I fare, said Chandra. Blithely, she set off on her dosa expedition.True to her word, she called Sneha a day or two later. How did everything turn out? What about the sambar and chutney? Sneha wanted to know.(She had packed some chutney powder for Chandra earlier.) The sambar and coconut chutney tasted different, said a despondent Chandra. Why? What went wrong? Sneha wanted to know.I dont know! Did you follow my instructions about the onions, garnishing and seasoning? Yes, and I even added ginger and garlic to the sambar.Did I instruct you to add ginger and garlic to the sambar? Sneha sounded aghast. No, you didnt. I thought you forgot to mention it. The expert was rendered speechless. And you said the chutney needed just ginger. But I thought adding garlic would improvethe taste. And did it? Sneha couldnt keep the sarcasm out of her voice.Then she relented and asked, What about the dosas? They were fine. You didnt add ginger-garlic to the batter? Sneha teased. Keep things simple.That is the secret of good cooking, she advised."

Several scientists, farmer organizations, civil society groups have registered their concerns on grounds of insufficient research."

All chef Mithilesh Tembe had to serve his guru, chef Ranveer Brar, was some finger-licking food.Tembe, executive chef at the 1BHK restaurant in Oshiwara, Mumbai, faced his toughest challenge ever when he had to prepare a meal for Brar, who has taught and honed his culinary skills.Memories, laughter and, of course, food filled 1BHK on Sunday evening as Brar arrived to celebrate International Chefs Day.Tembe started out as an expert in French cuisine, but he began trying his hand at Indian food after being trained by Brar. The food he served Brar, though, was not geographically limited. And it was a spread that would make the guru proud.Charred brocolli with rose harissa, Thai style sweet and sour fish, chickpea hummus with green chilli theecha and poi, prawns chil pil with steam bao, Goan fish curry with red boiled rice and chicken dhansak with brown onion pilaf. For dessert, Brar had creme brulee.Brar was well impressed by his student. The food created by Mithilesh was very expressive. The idea of adding a thecha to the hummus was very interesting, as was serving garlic prawns with poi bread. It was boundary-less and bold food, something that I always stand for, he said.In particular I loved how the Goan fish curry came out, nice consistency. The dish that stood out for me the most was the charred broccoli with rose harissa, he added.Recalling the beautiful evening, Tembe thanked Brar for visiting his restaurant. He said Brar had taught him the mantra of being a chef, which is not just making beautiful food ...its about the humility that you carry it with.Theres one thing, though, Tembe need not be so humble about  the creme brulee he made on Sunday night. Brar said it was the best hes had so far.Charred Brocolli with Rose HarissaThinkstockIngredients Broccoli  250gm Processed cheese  50gm Curd  150gm Ginger  10gm Garlic  10gm Cumin powder  3gm Chilli powder  4gm Cream  50gm Cardamom  5gm Garam masala  2gm Mustard Oil  10ml Almond Flakes  25gmRose Harissa Sauce Red bell pepper  60gm Pomace oil  25ml Rose water  15gm Lemon  15gm Dry red chilli  20gm White vinegar  12ml Honey  5gm Raw garlic  6gm Rose flower  1 Extra virgin olive oil  30mlMethod: Cook broccoli in salted hot boiling water till its fork tender and allow it cool down in ice cold water. Toast almonds at 160 degrees C for 9 minutes. Till almonds are getting ready, mix rest of the ingredients in a mixing bowl and prepare the marinade. Marinate broccoli for at least 3 hours and allow it to rest in your fridge. While the broccoli is resting, you can get the harrisa ready. Quickly blanch dry red chillies with water and vinegar making them easy to blend. Put all the ingredients in a blending jar and blitz on medium high speed, quickly stirring in intervals. To serve, heat your grill up and char that marinated broccoli until the marination is nicely charred over the broccoli. Pair it with rose harissa and a generous sprinkle of roasted almond flakes."

The Bangladeshi ones are 50 per cent cheaper.We are having a tough time because of heavy penetration of Bangladeshi diyas in the market. These come to India through Dhubri and have captured the market for the last five years. The Chinese artificial lights have also proliferated, Chandan said.Chandan, who is studying BCom under Veer Kunwar Singh University of Bihar, helps his family during Diwali.Our whole family has been associated with the business because during the festival we have to make diyas according to the demand. Earlier, the business was good but, nowadays, the penetration of cheap Chinese products and diyas from outside poses a challenge to us, he added.Rajbanti Devi, 52, Chandans mother, has been working to give finishing touches to some earthen diyas.We have been in this business for many years but have not received any aid from the government. The ward commissioner assured us that we would be provided an electric wheel through a government scheme but we have got nothing. Our children are educated but they still have to engage in the family business, she said.The rising prices of mustard oil and ghee, which are used to light the earthen diyas, are also adding to their woes.Last year, we did brisk business because people came to us for local diyas. This time we are hoping for good business, she added.Manoj Pandey, a customer, said, Every year, I buy diyas from the Pandits because their diyas are good compared to others. We should decorate our house with traditional diyas instead of cheap Chinese products."

For Mma Farm, spread over 100 acres at the Dalma wildlife sanctuary, carved a niche for itself ever since it reached organic vegetables and milk produced in local villages to urban homes here through its portal www.mmawithlove.com in 2016.With proven expertise in supplying organic milk and vegetables to homes, Mma Farm has the resources to start this unique breakfast venture on a pilot basis, added Singh, who is part of the XLRI team that is collaborating with Mma Farm.Sharma promised an interesting menu that would keep changing so that children dont get bored.After the pilot run people can chose their menu on the portal. There will be a wide range, like, say, idli and vada made from organic batter from rice and dal grown at our farm. We will use power oil, which is light and has Omega 3. It is made from mustard and linseed grown in our farm, he said, adding that the selection will also include sandwiches made of organic vegetables, poha, paratha, dosa, dhokla, fresh juice, dahi vada, curd, corn chat, fruit salad and sprouts.In Jamshedpur, Mma Farm provides pure milk from Dutch cows that munch on fresh organic feed grown in Dalma, and organic vegetables that are grown using cow dung-based vermicompost. One can buy milk and vegetables by emailing order@mmawithlove.com or calling 9031730990.Mma Farm has adopted five villages of the Dalma sanctuary for five years. It has employed over 5,000 villagers in the project. Fifty per cent of its earnings (sale from products) go towards improving the health, education and living standards of local residents.We are planning to employ war widows or other needy women as cooks. They will be trained to work as chefs at our distribution hubs that will be set up at Baridih, Kadma, Sonari, Circuit House (Bistupur) and Adityapur. We hope to roll out the project by mid-November, Sharma said, adding that they would start visiting schools and homes to inform parents about the health benefits of the project."

The film that had its world premiere at the Busan International Film Festival on October 9 also had a screening at the 24th Kolkata International Film Festival on Sunday.This is the first time Im attending a press conference for my moms film. It has been the opposite so far. She always comes for the press conference of my films. Today shes the heroine and Ive come as family! said Alia at a press interaction held before the films screening at Nandan, looking gorgeous in a maroon ethnic outfit.Alia greets mom Soni Razdan at The Oberoi Grand Picture: Rashbehari DasSoni Razdan plays the protagonist Mithi Kumar in Yours Truly; Mahesh Bhatt appears in a cameo that is crucial to the plotline. Based on a story from Annie Zaidis book, Love Story # 1 To 14, Yours Truly is about the inner journey of Mithi, a lonely woman who pines for a man she has never met. This is the first time Soni and Mahesh have come together on screen.Seeing my father and mother on screen together for the first time has been both ajeeb and special for me, said Alia. I was so into the film that by the time my father comes in the film and when I saw him, he seemed like a character to me. It didnt occur to me that hes my father or thats my mother. Then eventually it came like a train and hit me and I was like, Oh my God, thats my parents together on screen! Usually, hes always directed her but now hes acting with her. So I feel like, this is just the beginning. We dont know... maybe theyll be coming together on screen a lot! she laughed, going on to add why Calcutta is her favourite city.Ive already put up a post on Instagram saying that Im in my favourite city. Calcutta is my favourite city. Its a city that gives you so much warmth and so much love.... The moment I entered the hotel, I asked for food! I wanted the mustard fish, vegetables; the hotel said theyre sending me sandesh but I am on a diet. Khane ki main bahut shaukeen hoon. Whenever you eat this food, its like dil ka pet bhar jata hai, woh wali feeling ati hai, said the Raazi actress.Alia greets mom Soni Razdan at The Oberoi Grand Picture: Rashbehari DasWhen Alia was asked if she knew any Bengali, she promptly said, Ami tomake bhalobashi.What Alia said next was music to the ears of the Tollywood industry. Id love to work with a Bengali director, work in Bengali movies. If I can do all kinds of cinema in every kind of language and master every form of art and reach out to all your hearts, thatll be my biggest dream and achievement come true.Soni had worked with Alia in this years critically acclaimed film Raazi, directed by Meghna Gulzar. When Alia was asked how it felt to see her mother in Yours Truly, as an audience member, she said, Ive been watching my mom on screen even before I became an actor, before I even knew what acting was all about in all my fathers films, theatre and all the different films that she has done. Earlier it used to be very heartbreaking for me because my father used to kill my mother in every film  she was either falling from the window or getting stabbed! Something or the other was happening, which always used to break my heart. I was most happy that she was not dying in Yours Truly! she laughed.Alia greets dad Mahesh Bhatt at The Oberoi Grand Picture: Rashbehari DasI want to take this opportunity to thank Sanjoy for making this film with my mum because I think it is very important to tell different stories. Loneliness is a sensitive topic but has been treated in a light way. Its so prevalent in all our lives but to take a journey of a woman and follow it in such an interesting way with audio-visual treatment was amazing, added Alia.This moment in itself is a pure moment for me, said Mahesh.Soni Razdan, Mahesh Bhatt, Alia Bhatt and Sanjoy Nag at the press meet at Nandan on Sunday Picture: Rashbehari DasSanjoy remembered the time he narrated the story to Soni over the phone and had a foot-in-the-mouth moment. I got her number and called her. I narrated the story to her and she said, Fine, when do we sit with the script? and I said, Ill come to Bombay. Then I tried to be very smart and impress her. So I said, I loved your performance in Kapoor & Sons. And then there was pin-drop silence on the phone. That is where I started. There was Alia in that film God knows what I was thinking! he laughed.Shooting the film in real locations like railway stations was challenging but also rewarding for Sanjoy, who had directed Rituparno Ghosh in his film, Memories In March. We shot in the crowded Howrah station for a couple of days. That itself was a challenge for us. How and when do we go and shoot? My cinematographer Stanley Mudda and I would go every day and pick places where people wouldnt look at the camera and decide what camera to use sometimes hed decide to use his mobile phone to shoot. These were all learning experiences, he signed off."

From sowing to harvesting, villagers need to follow strict norms and have to fulfill formalities to do farming.There are 50 villages along the 210-km-long international border in the geo-politically sensitive district. Five villages have BSF posts.Several of our farm lands are close to the fencing and we can go there after taking permission from BSF personnel between 9am and 4pm. We are not allowed to sow crops, like mustard and sugarcane, because the plant height goes more than three feet. So, we sow grams and vegetables, said Yoga Singh who owns 36 bighas at the Hindumalkot village.Chandra Prakash Baweja, from the Kotha village near the international border, said, I have stopped working on my 10 bighas of land due to security restrictions.Many villagers say they are yet to get compensation for their land acquired for fencing in 1982. Neither the BJP nor the Congress government in the state has bothered to raise the issue with the Centre, they claim.Land rates are high here as the region is fertile. However, they are of no use. No political leaders or elected representatives visit us as if we dont matter to them, said 60-year-old Malkeet Singh, who owns 20 bighas.However, the villagers are all praise of BSF personnel. But if there is any suspicious activity or any infiltration takes place, the situation becomes tense, added Malkeet."

We caught up with her on an email chat.What inspired you to write a cookbook, as there are several on Indian cuisine already?This is a very personal book that was inspired by my own experience of trying to fit Indian cooking into a busy family, social and professional life.I use a lot of cookbooks and found myself finding ways to simplify the recipes in them and the recipe instructions being given to me by my family. A lot of Indian recipes are based on nostalgia and age-old traditions, but we dont live the way our parents and grandparents did. Even my mother (theatre veteran Dolly Basu) and her friends use great little shortcuts to make food simpler to cook and more wholesome.I found myself reaching for gadgets, innovative food products/ingredients, and easy cheats that dont compromise on flavour. I saw a gap in the market for an Indian cookbook that reflects the way we live now  for busy people, who dont have much help in the kitchen and want to get wholesome, delicious food on the table for friends and family.The design aesthetic of contemporary India was also important for me to reflect. The Western view of India is all elephants and paisley, despite the beautiful, minimalist Indian design I have been enjoying. We were keen to capture the texture and colours of handloom, architecture and nature in the look and feel of the book.How did you go about curating the dishes?I started with mealtime moments. We Indians love our breakfast, and there is a huge trend of lazy brunches, so that had to be a chapter. I also love entertaining, so feasts needed to feature. Then I included family favourites from my homes in Calcutta and London. A lot of recipes from Delhi feature, where my mum is from and where I worked briefly. Then there are several Bengali recipes. But importantly, we were a cosmopolitan bunch and recipes from other communities featured too. I am very influenced by Gujarati food, for instance, and I travelled extensively in Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even researched Calcutta food. So recipes from there feature too.Masala has many anecdotes from your childhood, involving your grandfather Jyoti Basu. What was your relationship with him like?It was like any other relationship between a doting grandfather and his besotted granddaughter. Dadu called me his crown princess and was keenly interested in my academic and other achievements. When I participated in a beauty contest and came last, it didnt stop him from driving his convoy straight to our home and chanting beauty queen, beauty queen as he came up the stairs to see me. He looked so glum in photos but he sprung to life and smiles when he was around us. When I got married, his one concern was that I would give up my career. So I think hed be proud that I have not one but three full-blown ones, including motherhood!Any food memory from your childhood that comes to mind?Sunday lunch was a big tradition at our home (in Salt Lake). I always remember lazy afternoons with lilting Bollywood tunes, vodka cocktails for the grown-ups, my dad (Chandan Basu) stirring slowly and the kids filling up on chanachur while lunch took ages to cook. I also have not-so-fond memories of driving my mother crazy at mealtimes. I was a very fussy eater and skinny child. My poor mother oversaw the most amazing food, which I would reject without even trying. I did eventually grow out of it though, as is probably evident!An easy version of burgers  Chappli Kebab Picture from Mallikas InstagramIn the book, you mention that you have been influenced by your maternal grandmother a lot...Nani is a proper matriarch with Afghan blood in her. She was actively involved in our parenting and a strong influence on food, culture and others. I used to travel with her to Delhi for my winter holidays and have the best time. She gave up non-vegetarian food when she lost her husband, but still cooked excellent chicken curry. Thanks to her, I enjoyed the best of Delhi home cooking  rajma chawal, kadhi pakora, gajar methi, and parathas stuffed with absolutely everything.I called her when I was writing Masala and we had an awkward conversation, as she is hard of hearing, until I asked her for her recipe of nimbu ka achaar. She sprung to life and after much testing, the recipe has now been perfected for modern kitchens and is in my book.To be honest, I had all manner of busy people in mind. A lot of my followers are young families, professionals without kids and silver surfers who are enjoying their kitchens and cooking in a new way. I live in London, so some of the recipes do need to be adapted for international kitchens but its never complicated and nothing an instinctive regular cook cant manage. I know a lot of Indians who move away from home to study, or to get married or for work. They buy my book because they find the recipes are so doable and always taste right.In the age of quick tutorial videos, do you see a cookbook being relevant?Absolutely. Quick tutorial videos are great, but there is only so much you can cram into a short video. Cookbooks are increasingly being bought for longevity, because they offer something over and beyond just recipes. A video tutorial can never replace that.Is cooking a passion or is it just a hobby or something more?All of the above. I find it very relaxing and often cook after a long day to unwind. But more than that I am passionate about addressing misperceptions about Indian cooking that exist. Its not as complicated, difficult and time consuming as people think. Thats what got me writing about food. All you need is know-how, great recipes and a fantastic cookbook.Channa Dal, Mustard Prawn Curry, and two favourites  Peas Pulao and Saag Aloo Picture from Mallikas InstagramAt home, what kind of cooking would we find in your kitchen?I often use my own cookbook, so thats very much the kind of Indian food you would eat if you came to my home. I love other cuisines, and so Indian dishes take pride of place alongside Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Italian and much more. My family loves variety; the kids especially are gourmet babies, with a very wide-ranging palate and love for food and cooking. So its a mixed bag. The food is always wholesome, well balanced and simply cooked.What kind of influence does your husbands half-Peruvian and half-British heritage have on your cooking?I was quite lucky that Peruvians like flavour and lots of chillies! I never had to tone down our spicier dishes for him... We met at university in London through Gujarati friends and the rest, as they say, is history!How much of Indian culture are your kids exposed to?They call themselves half-Indian and love dressing up in their festive Indian clothes and eating Indian food. I often make dosas and chillas at home for weekend breakfast, which they eat before you can wink. And they love going on holiday to India. Sadly, I havent been great at teaching them Hindi or Bengali. Still they are only small so there is hope!How do you make time for this alongside a career in communications?They say if you want something done, give it to a busy person! But seriously, I have been very blessed with the support of my husband, my family and friends. I also gave up a full-time role in communications in favour of consulting, so I now have a portfolio career that allows me the flexibility of enjoying my day job and indulging my passion. Hopefully, I am living proof of my own unique difference  that I am a busy home cook writing delicious recipes that work for other busy home cooks.What is next in the cooking space for you?I am still busy promoting the book and it is such a labour of love that I am trying to slow down and savour every minute. Watch this space for my next venture!Macchli Curry (Simple Fish Curry) Source: MasalaRecipe for Macchli Curry(Simple Fish Curry) (Serves 2-4)Coated in turmeric and chilli and simmered in a gently spiced curry, this is a very simple way to enjoy fish with the lightest of spices. Fish in India comes from both the fresh waters of its lakes and rivers and from the sea. Although foreign varieties such as basa are gaining popularity in restaurants and supermarkets, the morning trip to the fish market for the catch of the day remains a firm tradition in the fish-loving states. In Bengal, for instance, this is traditionally a job for the man of the house, who prides himself on his masterful bargaining with the sellers.

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityAGRA: Farmers who went out to work in their fields on Monday morning were aghast to see their potato, wheat and mustard crops submerged in water. They claimed that the flooding was a result of overflowing Barara miner (sub irrigation channel).Crops of as many as 50 farmers from Khal, Malpura and Gamri villages in Akola development block of the district were damaged. They alleged that the overflow took place as the sub canal was not cleaned before discharge of water from its terminal at Jodhpur Jhal in Farah Gram pradhan of Gamri Vineet Kumar said, We are making all possible efforts to drain the water out. An excavator has been called. Supply in the sub canal was made all of a sudden. This caused it to overflow.Farmer leader Shyam Singh Chahar, who visited the affected villages, blamed the irrigation department for the crop damage. He alleged, Before water supply, no cleaning of the canal took place. However, on paper everything is shown as done. Officials and contractors pocket a large part of the funds allocated by the state government for cleaning canals and sub canals.Demanding compensation for farmers, Chahar said, The matter of corruption in the irrigation department will be pursued with higher authorities. Throughout the day, farmers were busy in draining out water from their fields but no official came to check the situation.Awadhesh Kumar, executive engineer of the irrigation department, said, Water supply in the Barara miner has been stopped. Standard cleaning of the sub canal was conducted before supply. Overflow could have taken place due to less utilization of water by farmers."

Is there a parallel system running in jails? Do they have special rights in jails? What have you done about it?,"" the bench, also comprising justice Deepak Gupta, asked the Centre's counsel.""These persons are enjoying TV. God knows what all they are enjoying. They are sitting on sofas,"" the bench observed.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi, appearing for the Centre, said that action must be taken in such cases and such instances have to be ""tackled seriously"".When the ASG said the top court was dealing with the issue related to speedy trial for undertrial prisoners, the bench observed, ""We are dealing with something which is shocking"".""What is your government planning to do?,"" the bench asked Lekhi, who said he would get back to the court on this issue.The court also flagged the issue raised in recent media reports about use of mobile phones inside jails in several states, including Bihar.The issue cropped up in the court when it was hearing a matter related to deficiencies in jails as highlighted by two apex court judges (one of them has retired) during their visit to Faridabad jail and an observation home in June this year.Chandra brothers are presently lodged in Tihar jail for allegedly cheating home buyers.The Additional Sessions Judge, who had carried out inspection in Tihar jail, had said in his report submitted to the Delhi High Court that the circumstances indicated ""corruption"" and ""grave misuse of power"" on the part of Director General (DG) Prisons and Tihar Jail officials.The judge has recommended that an FIR be lodged against DG Prisons and officials of Tihar Jail as such activities also pose an ""extra burden on the public exchequer"".He had said in his report that apart from household amenities, including mattresses, mustard oil, foot-mats and stools, in their cell, the Chandra brothers also enjoyed a separate ""office"" room having a computer with internet, a printer as well as eatables and mineral water.The high court has taken suo motu cognisance of the report and the letter written by the inmates and turned it into a public interest litigation.A division bench of the high court has also issued notices to the Delhi government, Director General (DG) Prisons and senior officials of Tihar Jail seeking their response in the matter by February 1 next year.The inmates in their letter to the court had claimed that while those arrested for financial crimes, like the Chandra brothers, were ""enjoying an extra luxurious life in Tihar Jail"" with a ""separate VIP ward"" for them, other prisoners were allegedly not getting sufficient food, drinking water, fruits and other necessities, including medical treatment."

And on their way back from Ghosh Mansion, Aaduri gives Hem the lowdown on Lata and Ronny.Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, arguably the greatest exponent of relationships in literary Bengal, had written in Devdas that childhood love was, for all its intensity, ultimately cursed. It seldom led to happily ever-afters.But we are both over 18, Kakimoni, Lata had replied, softly, suddenly maudlin even though she found the possibility that what they had  that perfect, fragrant, sunset-coloured thing  might be poisoned to be highly remote. Shed buried her nose in the pink pashmina shawl she had stolen that season from Manjulikas almirah.When shed lifted her head, she saw Kakimoni smiling. Whaaat? shed said, and Kakimoni shucked her chin. That pink is perfect for people newly in love, shed laughed. You are right, it doesnt apply to those who are not children. But Kakimoni said that tartly, raising her eyes in the direction of the verandah where Ronny was bickering with Molly over the carrom board, much like a minor. Well find out, wont we? she said, Whether you were children or adults!Kakimoni would then heave herself from the bed and go out to their little kitchen, carved out of a nook where a tertiary stairway had been boarded up  the Ghoshes had all divided up their kitchens by then  in order to make them scrambled egg sandwiches with cheese. And Lata would drag herself out of bed and curl up in one of the Bombay fornicators kept outside on the verandah (neither she nor Ronny knew the term then), five of them in a line, and impatiently wait for Ronny to stop playing carrom and revise economics with her. Its he who needs the revision more, she would huff. But the sight of him and Molly wrapt in play also made for a pleasant picture. Once, unknown to Ronny, she had snuck his camera out of his bag and taken pictures of them.Where are those pictures? she wonders. Hadnt Ronny framed one and given it to her?When theyd broken up, shed told Kakimoni bitterly, on a weekend she was home with dark circles under her eyes, You were right. Childhood love is poisoned.Not me, Kakimoni had replied sadly, enveloping her in a hug, Sarat-babu.***The Bombay fornicators are long gone.Lata stands now where they used to be lined up and watches as the lights over the courtyard come on. It was Ghosh Mansion all this while; now, in the blink of an eye, it is transformed from a decaying house in a decaying neighbourhood into an unfamiliar place, a new continent, one where happiness and success and glory are all a handspan away for the taking.After Latad taken charge of the Molly-AJ wedding, along with the army Nimki had summoned from the massive contacts list on her phone, Ghosh Mansion had suddenly come alive in the last two days. Given the paucity of time, the rooms on the ground floor were all locked up for the evening in lieu of being cleaned (Lata kept a roster of the keys and promised the various owners of said rooms that it was a temporary matter). The corridor and the courtyard leading to the naach ghar were scrubbed clean. Not even a speck of dust should be visible to the Marwaris, Nimki was heard shouting every 10 minutes or so, Mollys mother-in-law has OCD and we better live up to her standards of cleanliness. In any case, Molly doesnt know any housework. If they see dirty corridors here, they will always link the two. FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Lata had also decided that since there was no time to get the walls painted, a major red herring was required. She cajoled the electrician to create a canopy of twinkling lights over the courtyard.The effect, Lata now sees, feeling quite pleased with herself, is magical.Molly steps out of Kakimonis bedroom in her engagement outfit and sighs at the lights. She wears a white chanderi full skirt trimmed beautifully in gold, paired with a post-box red choli. Much to her mothers unhappiness, shes refused to wear anything around her neck but the plain gold choker that Manjulika and Lata had given her from Manjulikas own collection and a pair of gold danglers that had been their great-grandmothers.Lata looks critically at Molly, straightens her tikli  the sole item from her parents trousseau  and then, gently kisses her cheek.I dont know what Id have done without you, Molly murmurs into her hair.Im glad I am here. And I hope you and AJ will come to London and stay with me so I can dispense jamai aador and luchis like a grown-up Ghosh.Molly squeezed her hands. Boro Jethis gold bracelet, studded with pearls and rubies, glittered. It had been a pair that, Lata knew, was given to Jethima, the eldest daughter-in-law, by their grandmother, and Jethima had given her one at her wedding, reserving the other for Molly. What about Goopys bride? Manjulika had said to Jethima then. Arre baba, Jethima had replied conspiratorially, Goopys wife will get a lot!I miss Goopy, Molly said.I was just thinking about him! Lata exclaimed, Anyway, now listen, Bobbys just texted me. They are about 15 minutes away. I think you should go now and sit in the throne room. Guests have arrived. Wheres the entourage?Almost as though theyd heard her, Mollys girlfriends, the old ones from school and college and the new ones from Berlin, all trooped out of her room, where theyd been getting ready. Their individual beauty enhanced by the collective glamour, the girls held themselves erect and frowned in concentration, speaking to each other in code. Lata did not miss a single detail of this pageantry: the wisps of hair slipping out of elaborate hairdos, the silken saris curving and catching at unaccustomed feet. They walked up to the balustrade awkwardly and then, finally finding their stride in their saris, followed Molly down the elaborate staircase, where ancestors in gilt frames looked down at them approvingly.Lata took pictures on her phone, waving the girls away, exhorting them to mind the way. A few minutes later, as they crossed the courtyard, carefully carefully, doddering on their high heels, saris and lehngas bunched up so that their calves were briefly visible, the lights fell on their youthful faces and covered them with stardust.From upstairs, in her pink-yellow tussore sari, Lata watched them and marvelled at the fierce brevity of childhood and youth.Now it was here. Alive and flickering in the stack of Mills and Boon novels under her bed, clattering upon the carrom board, surfacing in the large cupboards in the store room which were perfect for stolen kisses and the third-floor terrace which was perfect for horrible fights.And now it was gone.***First came the ashirbad and then the ring ceremony. The Jaiswals and the Ghoshes and the Germans and the assorted others all mingled happily, eating the delicious (if vegetarian) hors doeuvres and drinking gallons of Blue Lagoon.As regards the food, Boro Jethu had firmly put his feet down. At the Oberoi, they could serve whatever mishmash modern cuisine they wanted to, but at home, it would be old-fashioned comfort food. It was a gargantuan tragedy that the affair had to be made vegetarian. Yes, there would be piles of motorshutir kochuri with stuffed aloor dom and chholar dal with coconut bits. Yes, the old thakurs would whip up family secrets that would never ever be revealed to the Jaiswals. And yes, there would be five kinds of savoury fries, excluding mochar chop and five kinds of mishti, excluding doi. No chatter about calories would be entertained. No dahi vada, golgappa or that sort of rubbish would be served. They were the Ghoshes after all. And there was no question of serving any kind of fancy salad with imported leaves, olive oil and vinegar  only the time-honoured slices of cucumber, tomato and onion on a plate, along with mustard and mayonnaise.Lata had escaped the vice grip of relatives, who had far too many questions than she could handle and whose comments about how slim her waist still was and how expensive her sari looked were all lined with a certain malice. She now stood in a corner and exchanged notes about the next day with a surly Bobby. (Who looked smoky-eyed and bewitching in a black chikankari anarkali set with mukaish work on it.)Whos that? Bobby asked, suddenly interested in a man who had walked up to Nimki and had clasped her hands in his. He wore a beautifully tailored suit, in charcoal grey, and suddenly Lata found herself looking away.(To be continued)"

5ce6181ce8e3fc56af411a7c,PCOS: A lifestyle disorder,https://www.telegraphindia.com/health/pcos-a-lifestyle-disorder/cid/1677239,2018-12-01,"Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) or Polycystic Ovarian Disease (PCOD) is common among members of the younger generation, with almost 10 million people affected globally. Its worldwide prevalence varies from 2.2 per cent to 26 per cent and, according to latest statistics, in India one in every four young women is said to have PCOD. The disease is said to affect urban population more than rural folks, which means, as we become more educated and improve our socio-economic status, we are becoming unhealthier!PCOS is definitely a lifestyle disorder. One should try to control and prevent it as the disease can lead to a lot of long-term health problems, like diabetes, heart diseases, infertility, gynaecological cancers, hypertension, depression and gestational diabetes.What is PCOS?It is a multifaceted disorder with various symptoms, affecting women in their reproductive age. Most women who suffer from PCOS develop small cysts in their ovaries, which is why its called polycystic. These cysts are not harmful but lead to hormonal imbalance. Primary symptoms include abnormal facial and skin growth (hirsutism) and baldness, acne, weight gain, irregular or absence of menstrual cycle and increased levels of male hormones.PCOS was first reported by Stein and Leventhal in 1935. With rising urbanisation, the disease picked up pace and it was only in 2003 that Rotterdam Criteria for the diagnosis of PCOS was formulated. The criteria areAt least one ovary should be polycystic and it should be confirmed by a radiological examination (usually an ultrasound).Ovulatory dysfunction should be reported.Excessive secretion of androgens (male hormones) to be confirmed by blood tests.The rising trend of PCOS has multi-factorial causes  genetics, sedentary lifestyle, environmental, nutritional deficiencies, metabolic disorders, chronic inflammation and poor immunity.Are our genes to be blamed?Not really. Our genes have always had an important role to play; they definitely increase the risk, but its not necessary that it would lead to a certain condition. However, a study conducted in the UK has shown that 24 per cent of women (with PCOS) have their mothers suffering from PCOS and 32 per cent of the women have sisters with the same condition.Nowadays, there is a rush to be good at everything and this has probably made people forget how important it is to eat right, exercise, sleep well, and have a good emotional balance. The increasing prevalence of PCOS in young adults can straightaway be correlated to a sedentary lifestyle and lack of nutritional food. Lack of exercise, weight gain and obesity lead to metabolic imbalances, such as insulin resistance, which is high in urban Indian population. Insulin resistance leads to deranged hormones and increases the chances of diabetes and other metabolic disorders.A study conducted by AIIMS shows that obesity is present in almost 60 per cent women who suffer from PCOS; 50 per cent have fatty liver; about 70 per cent have high insulin resistance; 60-70 per cent have high levels of male hormones; and 40 to 60 per cent have glucose intolerance.What can be done?Ayurveda, the age-old science of life, speaks of prevention and cure through aahar (diet), vihaar (lifestyle) and aushadh (medicine). It should always be read in this chronological order.Aahar, the most important pillar, is the fuel for our cells. Women who are suffering from PCOS should consume a balanced diet with high-fibre foods that fight insulin resistance. Also, lean protein sources should be added to the diet. One should have five small meals instead of three large meals, for this helps in weight loss. Avoid food with high glycemic index (a relative ranking of carbohydrate in foods). Add a lot of greens and fruits to your diet.Make sure you abstain from reheated, processed junk food. Try to switch to unrefined salt, sugar, flour and oil. Eat good fats such as ghee, mustard oil, seeds, sesame and cashew nuts.One of the important aspects involves weight reduction. Any short-term fancy crash diets for weight loss should be avoided as they may lead to severe nutritional deficiencies.Sometimes we feel we are eating healthy and well, but due to chronic underlying inflammation and metabolic disorders in PCOS one may get severely nutritionally deprived. The five nutrients which are commonly deficient in women with PCOS are Vitamin D (almost 67 to 85 per cent of women are deficient), Vitamin B12, zinc, magnesium and folate. Having enough water throughout the day is also important.Maintaining a proper sleep schedule is a vital factor. Get eight hours of sleep, during which you should disconnect from all gadgets at least an hour before bedtime. This will definitely fetch you good sound sleep.Maintaining a healthy weight is priority when it comes to managing PCOS. This can be achieved by incorporating 30 minutes of exercise in your daily routine, five times a week. Consumption of alcohol and smoking is a strict no-no.PCOS is just not an endocrine disorder but a combination of metabolic and psychological complications. If left unattended, PCOS could lead to infertility, thereby causing stress, depression, marital and social maladjustment and lowered self-esteem. People suffering from PCOS need to be treated holistically, as it affects a womans mind, body and her identity.Once a diagnosis has been established, one should seek a medical practitioner and management should be done. At times, correcting your diet, lifestyle, reducing weight lead to a reduction in PCOS symptoms. Simply eat healthy, stay happy, exercise and relax to feel rejuvenated. Your body and hormones take good care of you once you take care of yourself.Shikha Prakash is an ayurvedic consultant at Padaav Speciality Ayurvedic Treatment Centre, Dehradun, and a visiting consultant at AMRI Hospital, DhakuriaTHINGS TO DO"

The officials sealed the stock of 50 tonne of edible oil worth Rs 42.92 lakh.The unit owner used to purchase cheaper edible oils in bulk and would do the branding, labelling and packaging at his unit located at Dangde Farm in Pisoli (Haveli taluka). When we raided the unit, we found large tanks of cheaper edible oils and mustard oils, Suresh Deshmukh, joint commissioner (food), FDA, Pune told TOI.The owner was also found operating the unit without oil testing laboratory, which is mandatory. Besides, the person in-charge of the operation at the unit was not technically qualified. The edible oil packaging unit needs to test the oil periodically and maintain a record of the same. But there was no laboratory on the premises. We have also drawn samples of the oil and sent them for tests to the government laboratory. Deshmukh said.The officials found that the packaging unit was selling adulterated oil when a sample drawn randomly during Diwali showed the adulteration. The officials then raided the unit late on Thursday night. FDA food safety officials Ulhas Ingawale, Santosh Sawant, Anil Gavate carried out the raid under the guidance of state FDA minister Girish Bapat.Incidentally, the FDAs vigilance department had raided several oil mills in the past, taken samples and found packets of sunflower, soybean, groundnut oil refilled with cotton seed oil. There are instances where miscreants removed oil from tins of reputed brands and mixed it with ordinary palm oil or any other cheap variety of oil, said another official.According to experts, such impurities are difficult to identify as the blending of cheaper oil like palm oil does not change the physical property or taste of the product. But it changes the chemical property, which affects the consumers health."

Read MoreThe shrine in Haryana is a far cry from the stone sculpted grandeur of SabarimalaIt is said that women who enter the temple end up widowed for seven lifetimesMustard oil is offered to pray for ancestorsDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityEven as the heated debate on entry of women in Keralas Sabarimala temple refuses to abate, the Kartikeya temple in Pehowa town of Haryana enjoys relative anonymity. In Hindu traditions, Kartikeya is revered as the elder son of Lord Shiva The shrine in Haryana is a far cry from the stone sculpted grandeur of Sabarimala, but it is also out of bounds for women. It is believed that any woman who enters the garbha griha (sanctum sanctorum), will be widowed for seven births.People from Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Delhi visit the temple and offer prayers to ancestors. TOI visited the shrine to ascertain the reasons why women are restricted from entering the temple. To get there, you need to negotiate narrow alleys in the pilgrims area along what is said to be the bank of the Sarasvati river (as claimed by locals). A large board welcomes visitors to the ancient temple and warns women against entering it.Recounting the legend, Giri said when it was time for Lord Shiva to name his heir, Paravati announced that whoever went around the universe and came back first would be the winner. Kartikeyas younger brother Ganesha, who had a rat for a mount, simply circled Lord Shiva and Parvati saying they encapsulate the universe. He was declared winner. When Kartikeya, who was astride his mount, the peacock, came to know about this, he was furious. He removed the skin and blood he got from his mother and cursed her for the deceit. Then he announced that if any woman ever came to see him in this form, she would be widowed for seven successive births, explained mahant Giri.The sanctum sanctorum comprises two blocks of stone and a marble image of Lord Kartikeya flanked by two oil lamps. Visitors offer mustard oil on the blocks and lamps. Mahant Sita Ram Giri, head priest of the temple, said the ancient structure dates back to the 5th century BC and his family has been officiating as priests for generations.After this, Giri said, Kartikeya came to Pehowa, where mustard oil was offered to cool him down. Thereafter, all those who visit the temple offer mustard oil to cool the deity. It is said that the practice soothes the souls of ancestors.See, we only warn women entering the temple about the reasons for the prohibitory orders. After hearing about it, they do not dare visit the sanctum sanctorum to take darshan of the Pindi (sacred symbol) of Lord Kartikeya. Women can enter the temple. The prohibition is only to see the Pindi (sacred symbol) of Lord Kartikeya).The priest said even Yudhishthira, the eldest Pandava, is said to have visited the temple for peace of the souls of soldiers who perished in the battle of Mahabharata in Kurukshetra. He said the two oil lamps lit by Yudhishthira at the time still burn.When asked if any woman or organization ever demanded entry for women in the temple, Raj Tilak, sahayak mahant said a few months back, a representative of the Haryana chief ministers office came and asked if there is a complete ban on entry of women in the temple.I told him we only warn women against entering the sanctum sanctorum by narrating the story and the curse. If somebody still wants to enter, they are not stopped, he said. The representative visited the temple after an organization submitted a complaint to the CMO about the ban on the entry of women in the temple."

Of this Namakkal district alone houses about 80 % of the total strength of the birds.With the production of more than three crore eggs per day, Namakkal zone was only second behind Hyderabad zone in the country in the production of eggs.Of the three crore eggs produced per day, about 50 lakhs were exported to Gulf countries, thus topping the list among all the zones in the export of eggs. However, due to the bird flu reported in one part of the country or the other, Gulf countries frequently banned the import of Indian eggs.At present, only a limited number of eggs are being exported to the countries that were not members of the World Health Organisation (WHO).The production of eggs went down year by year in the last few years. The egg production which stood at 3.36 crore per day in 2013, went down to 3.14 crore per day in 2014, 3.05 crore in 2015 and 2.84 crore in 2016. Last year, the production further slumped to 2.81 crore per day.However, increase in egg production during the current year has brought joy to a big extent to the entire poultry farming community.According to the egg production figures released by the egg production committee, about 2.93 crore eggs were produced on an average per day in the last 10 months. This is 12 lakh eggs more than last years per day production.The egg production per day recorded by Namakkal zone since March is: March 2.82 crore, April 2.85 crore, May 2.89 crore, June 2.93 crore, July 2.97 crore, August 3.03 crores, and September 3.06 crore.In October, the production of eggs stood at 3.14 crore per day, registering an increase of eight lakh eggs per day in one month.According to A. K. P. Chinraj, president, Tamil Nadu Poultry Farmers Association, the poultry industry was suffering heavy financial loss due to the sky-rocketing price of the feed and other ingredients such as cholam, soya, sunflower, mustard seeds etc since 2013. Hence, the farmers preferred not to introduce new layer birds. This led to a fall in the production eggs year by year.At present the price of feed and other ingredients has registered a downward trend, following which more layer birds have been introduced this year. This has led to reasonable increase in the egg production in the last few months, Mr. Chinraj said."

No, the BJP MP is not contesting the state poll; he is campaigning for his mother, chief minister Vasundhara Raje. The Jhalawar-Baran Lok Sabha MP has been campaigning in the district so that the chief minister can concentrate the partys election management in rest of the state.On Tuesday, the TOI found Singh courteously giving his cup of tea to a 71-year-old retired solider Fateh Singh at a tea stall in Salotiya village. Villagers informed that the BJP MP always treats them with respect, sits on 'dari' (sitting mat) with elders even if a chair is offered to him and keeps inquiring about the day-to-day lives.There is no problem in approaching the elected representative in our constituency. The chief ministers family has been living with us for decades and understands us better. The development of this place happened in last 10 years. The issue of abrupt power supply was taken up in this tenure and it was resolved, said Madan Lal of Sunel village.Singh is confident that BJP will return to power in the state. The BJP leader said, The party won consecutively during the time of Bhairon Singh Shekhawat nearly 25 years ago. We will repeat that under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi , party president Amit Shah and chief minister Vasundhara Raje.On Congress fielding Manvendra Singh , son of former external affairs minister Jaswant Singh, against the CM, the BJP MP said that it was a political game plan of former CM Ashok Gehlot.Singh said, Gehlot had lost an election to Manvendras father Jaswant Singh in Jodhpur . Fielding Manvendra from here was predesigned by Gehlot to avenge his defeat from the past.At a time when elections are being fought on caste and religion lines, Raje and her family is being widely accepted by all in the region. On Tuesday, 70 minority candidate joined BJP. We have joined BJP after witnessing development in the area. Several medical facilities were introduced in Rajes tenure. There is peace and harmony here, said Irshad Ali, president of the Vyapar Mandal in Sunel.While traveling through the agricultural fields in Jhalawar to ensure his mothers victory and bring BJP back to power, Singh also found time to interact with his son Vinayak. Traveling with his father, Vinayak looked as curious to know how politics work and as he was keen to find out how mustard oil is extracted."

Going by the legal records, however, Ashok, 26, will have to wait a long time before he has to face his hangman as only two convicts have actually been hanged in all these years. The sentence of two brothers, convicted in a double murder case, was carried out in 30 years ago in 1988.Apart from two brothers who were hanged, six had their sentence commuted to life imprisonment, two were acquitted later, one killed was killed in police encounter during his parole, while three are awaiting their pleas or mercy petitions to be heard in higher courts. One convict Sanjeev, son-in-law of ex-MLA Reluram Poonia, is absconding.In 1988, the district court had awarded death sentence to two brothers, Amrik Singh and Jeet Singh, both residents of Shakarpur village of Jakhal , for double murders in 1978. An appeal was filed at Supreme Court (SC), which upheld the sentence.The brothers had killed their brother and brother-in-law in a land dispute in which three of them were injured, including their parents. The parents had initially given testimony against their sons as eyewitnesses. When the case had gone to SC though, both of them gave an affidavit and told their statements to be false, but no mercy was found.The others sentenced to death include the wife of Randhir Singh, the then sarpanch of Ghirai village, who was sentenced to death in 1984. However, the high court turned the sentence into life imprisonment, giving mercy to the woman. The woman had murdered the second wife and children of her husband.In 1994, the court awarded death sentence to four people, including Harswarup in a trio murder, who was acquitted by the SC. There were allegations of murder of his two sisters and a teacher of Barwala.In 2000, the district court had awarded death sentence to Krishan in a double murder case of Gurkhpur which later changed to life imprisonment. Krishan was convicted in the murder of two witnesses of a case.In 2000 again, in a case of five murders, the court had pronounced death sentence to Ramkishan, resident of Talwandi Rana village, and a laborer Munna, which, was confirmed by the SC but later changed into life imprisonment during the review plea. Ramkishan along with Munna had killed five of his neighbours in a dispute.The court had also announced death sentence to Dharmavir and two others in a triple murder case of Mayyar village in a land dispute. SC acquitted one while one was killed in an encounter during parole and the punishment of Dharmavir was changed to life imprisonment.Death sentence was awarded to ex-MLA Relurams daughter Sonia and son-in-law Sanjeev for murdering the family, which was changed to life in the high court. Sanjeev is now absconding after the parole leave.Yesterday, the district court had announced the death sentence to Suresh, a resident of Jugalan village in honour killing. One brother was in a shock, but other ate sweets before being hangedSenior advocate Sohan Wadhwa, who was the advocate of the two brothers, Amrik Singh and Jeet Singh who was hanged in the central jail in 1988, said there was no sympathy for the two brothers.

5ce5dd9ee8e3fc56af40f89f,M.S. Swaminathan calls GM crops a failure  Centre’s adviser faults paper,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/ms-swaminathan-calls-gm-crops-a-failure-centres-adviser-faults-paper/article25694592.ece,2018-12-08,"A research paper co-authored by leading agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan, which describes Bt cotton as a failure, was criticised by Indias Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA), K . VijayRaghavan as deeply flawed.The paper, Modern Technologies for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security appears in the latest issue of the peer-reviewed journal Current Science . It is authored by P.C. Kesavan and Dr. Swaminathan, who are both senior functionaries of the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF). The article is a review of crop development in India and transgenic crops  particularly Bt cotton, the stalled Bt brinjal as well as DMH-11, a transgenic mustard hybrid. The latter two have been cleared by scientific regulators but not by the Centre.There is no doubt that GE (genetically engineered) Bt cotton has failed in India. It has failed as a sustainable agriculture technology and has therefore also failed to provide livelihood security for cotton farmers who are mainly resource-poor, small and marginal farmers, according to the paper, The precautionary principle (PP) has been done away with and no science-based and rigorous biosafety protocols and evaluation of GM crops are in place.Flawed and full of errorsThe piece also raises questions on the genetic engineering technology itself on the grounds that it raises the cost of sowing, and the insertion of foreign genes (in the plant) could lead to molecular and cellular events not precisely understood.The Kesavan and Swaminathan Review (sic) is deeply flawed and full of errors. Needs scientific rebuttal, Mr. VijayRaghavan tweeted from this personal account. Before being appointed the PSA, Mr. VijayRaghavan, a biologist, was Secretary, Department of Biotechnology, which funds a variety of molecular biology projects. Mr. Kesavan, who is the lead author of the piece, told The Hindu that he was unaware of Mr. VijayRaghavans comment but was expecting a scientific, point-by-point response (of any flaws).Im not on Twitter but I believe a senior scientist shouldnt be making such irresponsible comments, he said. The Hindu reached out to Dr. Swaminathans office and was told that the paper had raked up a lot of controversy.Press conference soonWell likely soon be holding a press conference or a discussion on some of the points raised since the paper was published, a spokesperson for the MSSRF said.Mr. VijayRaghavan said in a text message that he wouldnt be immediately elaborating on his criticism but would in a few days.Last resortMr. Swaminathan, credited with leading Indias Green Revolution, has in recent years advocated sustainable agriculture and said the government should only use genetic engineering as a last resort. Swaminathan emphasised that genetic engineering technology is supplementary and must be needbased. Only in very rare circumstance (less than 1%) may there arise a need for the use of this technology, according to the paper.However, the MSSRF also dabbles in GE research. It has a programme on developing drought-resistant GM rice by using genes from mangroves to potentially protect rice varieties grown along the coasts from being affected by higher saline content  a consequence of warming seas from climate change. The programme is ongoing but isnt aimed for the present. Genes from salt-tolerant plants too arent idealhowever GE may be deployed to manage against abiotic stresses, said Kesavan. Abiotic stresses refer to environmental factors that could meddle with plant yield, as opposed to biotic stressors such as insects."
5ce5df16e8e3fc56af40fa0a,A tale of two States,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/a-tale-of-two-states/article25694572.ece,2018-12-08,"A few farmers sit huddled near a statue of Sardar Patel at Balaguda village in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh pouring out their woes over steaming cups of tea. The statue marks the entry point to the Patidar-dominated village.One of them, Manoj Patidar, who has just returned from the Mandsaur wholesale market, says that the goods and services tax (GST) and rising prices of diesel have made agriculture a loss-making activity. If the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government stays for another five years, we will have to sell our lands, says the tall farmer, his wry smile deepening the lines on his weather-worn face.In another place and State  in Rajasthan  separated by distance as well as priorities, Chhatar Singh Rathore of Tena village in Shergarh tehsil in Jodhpur district has a very different concern.He runs a roadside dhaba on National Highway 114, which connects Jodhpur to Jaisalmer. His main complaint concerns what he believes to be the wilful disregard of Rajput sentiment. Rajasthan Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje, who is seeking a second consecutive term in office, he says, has humiliated Rajputs by not backing their opposition to the film Padmaavat , and also marginalising Manvendra Singh, son of former Union Minister Jaswant Singh, who is a Rajput.With not much farming visible in the entire region, caste is the primary marker of social identity, unlike in Madhya Pradesh, where locals display a clear sense of identity as farmers. The contrast between Mandsaur and Shergarh points to the differences between two worlds. While both are rural, one is agrarian and the other is dominated by an array of non-farm activities.On November 30, all eyes were on New Delhi where there was a massive protest by farmers who had gathered from all over the country in the thousands. Opposition leaders such as Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, and CPI(M) general secretary Sitaram Yechury spoke. This event came in the wake of another landmark protest held more than a year ago.In the middle of last year, farmers organisations had taken out a rally that touched Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, among other places. The participants also visited Mandsaur, where, a month earlier, five farmers had been killed in police firing. Weighed down by debts, the agitating farmers were demanding loan waivers.As politics heats up in the run-up to the 2019 Lok Sabha election, the Opposition sees farmer anger as having the potential to dent the prospects of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has performed well in most State elections held since it came to power in 2014. The reading is not far off the mark. The BJP scraped through in its stronghold of Gujarat in the 2017 Assembly elections, as a result of urban votes. The Congress, on the other hand, did well in rural Gujarat.However, one was able to get an idea of the situation while travelling through Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan over the last month. In a complex picture, the rural cannot always be conflated with the agrarian.Long list of woesMadhya Pradesh today presents a picture of rural discontent that is cementing an amorphous farmers identity  a sort of occupational consciousness  that the ruling BJP will have to be wary of in the future. But the same does not hold true in Rajasthan, where the rural sector is involved in an array of occupations  from stone mining and animal husbandry to forays into the hospitality sector through highway and city restaurants. There is nothing like a farmers identity across the vast, parched, swathes of Indias largest State by land area.It takes half an hour to reach Pipliya Mandi, the epicentre of last years farm unrest, on the road from Mandsaur to Neemuch town in Madhya Pradesh. Mukesh Patidar, a soyabean farmer in his mid-30s, has come to the mandi (wholesale market) to buy agricultural implements. My village, Chilot Pipliya, which is about 17-18 kilometres from here, saw one farmer become a shaheed (martyr) last year, he says. He adds that soybean farmers are a distressed lot, with a long list of grievances.If the fertilizer DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) cost Rs. 800-900 per 50 kg in 2013-14, it is now priced at Rs. 1,440 for 45 kg, he says. Potash, which was priced at Rs. 450 per 50 kg one-two years ago, now costs Rs. 900 kg, he adds.We use tractors to prepare our fields for the crop. They run on diesel, which has gone up from Rs. 50 a litre to around Rs. 70 a litre, Patidar says. And labour charges have also gone up from Rs. 150-200 to Rs. 300 a day now. Why will they work for less? They are getting grain at Rs. 1-2 a kg.He predicts that the BJP will lose votes in villages around Pipliya Mandi this time. Dilip Patidar, a farm activist who also runs a shop selling various agricultural goods, says the GST has made things difficult for farmers. He says, The GST on pesticide is 28% now. These were taxed at 0-4% earlier. Look at the motor that pumps water to fields. It was taxed at 6% earlier but attracts 12% GST now. The pipe to connect the motor to the fields attracted no tax earlier but attracts 12-18% GST now.All this has made farm inputs dearer. Of the entire area under soyabean cultivation in India, about half is in Madhya Pradesh, the soyabean State of India. The Malwa region, of which Mandsaur is a part, accounts for more than half of M.P.s cultivation of the kharif crop. Fields are prepared by tractor in the summer months. Renting is the norm for small and medium farmers and tractors are rented out for Rs. 700 per hour, up from Rs. 500 because of diesel price hikes. The cost of soyabean seeds, Dilip Patidar says, is Rs. 5,400 per quintal. Labour charges for sowing as well as harvesting have gone up, he adds.Electricity bills too have shot up. While it is possible to run a diesel engine instead of an electric motor to pump water into the fields, with diesel prices going up, it is becoming an expensive proposition now as with diesel becoming more expensive, with costs are Rs. 200 per hour.The soyabean produce is transported to the mandis (wholesale markets) in Pipliya Mandi, Mandsaur and Neemuch. Here again, transportation is more expensive because of the rise in diesel prices. The present minimum support price (MSP) for soyabean is Rs. 3,399 per quintal, but it sells in mandis at Rs. 2,800-3,100 per quintal.In 2013-14, the mandi prices had gone up to Rs. 4,500-5,000 per quintal, says Mukesh Patidar. He blames faulty export-import policies for the fall in prices.Mandi prices keep fluctuating on a demand-and-supply basis, and vary each day. Says a wholesale trader at the Mandsaur Mandi who refuses to be identified, These are like the stock market. It is partly the luck of the farmer and partly his ability to read trends that determine the price he gets for his produce.Look at onions. When prices begin to rise, they import these and the prices fall again, says Dilip Patidar.Indeed, the interests of farmers and consumers are at odds. When the prices of farm produce rise, the commissions of wholesale traders and other intermediaries in the supply chain push up the retail prices of farm produce. When prices fall, food price inflation ceases to be a problem but farmers face losses, rendering agriculture unprofitable as an occupation.For example, at the Ajmer vegetable wholesale market, tomatoes were selling at Rs. 8 a kg. On the previous two days, 1 kg was was selling at Rs. 10 and Rs. 12, respectively. Just 2 km away at the retail market, it was selling at Rs. 20.The dip in farm fortunes is visibly impacting the politics of Madhya Pradesh, a traditional BJP stronghold, with the Congress clawing back in the villages. The troubles of increased documentation, paperwork and bank payments,  seen by many as a part of the formalisation of the sector and cleaning up of the system  have also annoyed farmers.The M.P. government has put in place a subsidy scheme called Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana (BBY), under which the government promises to plug the gap between market prices and the minimum support price (MSP). But to avail it, a farmer has to register himself at an authorised office and produce the required documents at the grain and vegetable market when he goes to sell his produce.Says Sunil Solanki, a farmer: Our soyabean crop gets a subsidy of Rs. 500 a quintal. But for this we have to submit a copy of our documents to the mandi merchant, who submits our farmer code numbers to the official market committee and then credits the money to our accounts, a process which takes between 10 and 15 days. The government subsidy under the BBY, he adds, takes two to three months to get credited to a farmers bank account. Unlike farmers elsewhere, farmers in M.P. are not paid in cash as everything is digitised.In other words, say several farmers, they pay in cash for labour, for renting tractors, and to transport the produce, but get paid by bank transfer. The time lag results in a cash crunch. They complain of long queues at markets and banks. Sensing this as an opportunity, Congress leaders have begun to promise cash payments to farmers if voted to power, according to local residents.Economist Utsa Patnaik says that the coming together of farmers across classes  the poor and the rich  was long overdue. She says: There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation, and the displaced will be absorbed by industry. The experience of Europe was different. Rather than being absorbed in industry there, the displaced were exported to North America, Australia and South Africa, and they captured the resources there after subduing indigenous people. We dont have that option.She adds: The open trade policies have exposed farmers to the highs and lows of global prices, which they cannot withstand. The meaning of priority sector has also changed under the influence of neoliberal policies, and farmers are unable to access low-interest loans. They have to borrow from private lenders at high interest rates and end up in a debt trap. It is only now that people have begun to notice the farm unrest that was waiting to burst forth.Other sources of incomeFew farmers can be seen at the Ajmer wholesale vegetable market after 11 a.m. They come here at 3 a.m. and leave after selling their produce  in return for cash payments  by 9-10 a.m. The mandi lacks the scale of operations or the frenzied activity of, say, the Surat wholesale market or even Azadpur Mandi in Delhi.The reason is not hard to find. This correspondents journey through Rajasthan, across 2,100 km, covering Jaipur, Tonk, Ajmer, Sawai Madhopur, Nagaur, Pali and Jodhpur districts, showed farm activity present only in the villages close to Tonk.Rasoolpuri village, which has high Gujjar and Meena populations, has farmland where mustard is grown. Here, farmers complain about rising diesel and fertilizer prices and the limited supply of water, which is available only from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. The produce, they say, sells at Rs. 3,200 a quintal, much below the MSP of Rs. 4,200.Farmers at a tea stall just outside the village say they will vote for the Congress as they are fed up of having their concerns brushed aside.But most of rural Rajasthan is a very different world. Villages, even around Jaipur, for miles on end have hardly any farm activity. The better off among villagers have diversified into non-farm activities such as dairy and poultry, while the poor are into animal grazing or work as labourers in construction activities and other sectors.A 40-minute drive on the Jodhpur-Jaisalmer highway leads to the Balesar-Shergarh belt, an arid, sparsely populated area dotted with Rajput-dominated villages. A detour from the highway down a narrow, broken road reveals what substitutes for farming in this region: stone-mining for the construction sector is in full swing on both sides of the road.Meghlasia is a village with Meghwal (Scheduled Caste) and Rajpurohit families. The latter, who describe themselves as gurus of Rajputs, are Brahmins by caste.Stone-mining is a key source of income for the villagers. In addition, they also sow bajra (millet) after the first rains in June-July, but the yield is subject to the vagaries of the monsoon rains.Caste is the markerLike many other Rajputs who have opened restaurants or dhabas because there is not enough water for farming, Chhatar Singh Rathore of the Rajput-dominated Tena village too runs one on the road towards Jodhpur.Says Rathore, Many people in my village run restaurants on the highway. The richer Rajputs also own restaurants in Jodhpur. There are 10 restaurants in the city run by people from my village.He tries to summarise his villages sources of income: Our previous generation saw many people join the Indian Army. You will find many ex-servicemen here. This generation has taken to the restaurant-catering sector in a major way. That apart, many from the village have migrated to Surat to join the cloth industry where they specialise in designing and packing. Some even race horses in Dubai.The Rajput community in the State has gravitated towards the hospitality sector, with heritage hotels and havelis dotting the State. Many are owned by richer Rajput families. They have a traditional feel and visible Rajput markers such as photographs of men in traditional attire holding a sword or rifle. A lot of them try to attract foreign tourists.This non-farm rural world is in sharp contrast to that of M.P., where an occupational identity centred on farming is being forged. In Shergarh tehsil of Jodhpur, caste remains the prominent identity marker, with cultural issues occupying centrestage.Rathore is unhappy with the Rajasthan government for not standing behind Rajputs on the film Padmaavat . He complains that Vasundhara Raje got the entrance to the Raj Mahal Palace in Jaipur sealed to target former royal Diya Kumari, and also humiliated the family of BJP veteran Jaswant Singh.In Tibna village, about 90 km from Jodhpur, water supply poses an acute problem. Sarpanch Bhawani Singh Rathore points to a dry hand pump which is wrapped in a sack cloth. The village has houses placed wide apart, and is populated longitudinally, one house after another for a few kilometres. It has just 300 families, says the sarpanch, of which 150 are Rajput. Other than water, villagers also complain about the lack of school teachers in the local government school. However, despite their various frustrations, they do not think of themselves as aggrieved farmers. Caste remains the key marker of identity and status.You find three types of scenarios, says political analyst and author Sajjan Kumar. The first is Madhya Pradesh, where agriculture is linked to the market, with cash crops such as soyabean and cotton. Here, farming is under stress because of a fall in market prices and the impact of demonetisation. The second is seen in agrarian States such as Bihar and Uttar Pradesh (excluding western U.P.). Their agriculture is not linked to the market, with mainly food crops such as rice and wheat being produced. An arid State such as Rajasthan presents a third scenario, where agriculture is not central to rural life.He explains the significance of these diverse realities: An occupational identity, where people identify as farmers, is emerging in States of the first kind, such as M.P., Maharashtra and Gujarat. In States such as U.P. and Bihar, while agriculture is central to rural life, caste and religion remain dominant identity markers in the absence of strong market linkages of agriculture. In Rajasthan, in the near absence of agriculture as a key rural vocation, identity markers are still tied to caste.Rathores sentiments lend credence to this hypothesis. I have no problem with [Prime Minister] Narendra Modi. He says we should sell pakodas if we can and I have been doing so at my restaurant, he says. My problem is with Vasundhara Raje. Rajputs will try to ensure a victory for Manvendra Singh at Jhalrapatan. What is a Rajput without self-respect?There has been a concerted attack on agriculture over the last few decades under the influence of neoliberal policies. There has been a mistaken belief that we should displace farmers and promote industrialisation.Utsa Patnaik,Economist"
5ce5d89ce8e3fc56af40f6af,"The Exposure Tour: In Calcutta, first-time voters from Mizoram",https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/the-exposure-tour-in-calcutta-first-time-voters-from-mizoram/cid/1678088,2018-12-09,"A tiny niche of Calcutta exulted in a Mizo wave this week, when 32 Psychology students of Pachhunga University, Aizawl, arrived with a cheery chibai (hello). Elections just over, these first-time voters from Mizoram, the lone Congress bastion in the Northeast, will be back home in time for the poll results on Tuesday.The idea of this exposure tour germinated when the two professors accompanying the 25 girls and seven boys discovered the Salt Lake-based development organisation and Unicef partner, Prayasam, on the Internet and asked if their students could come and interact.Lucy Ralte, proudly displaying her inked finger, brimmed with excitement. This is the first time I voted, she said. And this visit is heralding more changes, of terrain, world view and life skills. We were overwhelmed by the welcome. The Prayasam family greeted us with tika and gave each of us a handbag, T-shirt and photo frame, all made by them. Such warmth reminds me of Mizo hospitality. We were divided into four groups to join activities like painting, music, cooking and media. They taught me to knit and Im making this scarf for an installation at their arts podium, Kalanjali.Samuel Zothansanga has joined the music group. Adept at playing the keyboard, he unhesitatingly picks up the guitar to break into song. This environment is so warm, we felt at home right away. I especially like their unique way of sharing knowledge. This creative pursuit has brought about a perception change, this young voter said. Will be a change in political fortunes back home? Well, the Congress has ruled for 10 years, he smiled. The major unit of his group is on the terrace, dancing. Mizo musical talent is legendary, and these students adapted to Bollywood and Bengali tunes readily, under the guidance of Prayasams Subhojit. Youre doing good, he encourages Tuyir, Laltlanpari, Malsawmkimi, Zodinpuii and others. On their part, these girls, along with Lalduhawmi and Lawmzuali, taught the Calcutta youngsters Cheraw, the Mizo bamboo dance.In the adjoining pantry, a group learnt how to cook Bengali cuisine while Sujit, Rahul and Abida of Prayasam picked up the nuances of bai (Mizo vegetable soup), antam (a dish with mustard leaves) and arsa kan (fried chicken) from David, Lalnunpuii and their mates in colourful aprons. Sujit, who hails from the hard-hit Dakshindanri colony, went to community college in Mesa, Arizona, and his fluency in English made cooking an easy pastime.But the popular draw was visual basics and community television under Manish, a bright youngster who attended community college in Wisconsin, US, and has just been invited to the Sundance Film Festival next month. From Salt Lake, Calcutta, to Salt Lake City, Utah, he beamed. As a community journalist and filmmaker, I learnt about the Mizo socialisation process, shaping their lifestyle and ethos. Like us, the Mizo youth too have deeper socio-economic cultural norms. The three days gave us an opportunity to research their daily life experiences and explore our culture; how each is coping and embracing transitions and change.Manish has come a long way from his roots in Nazrulpally colony, but has his feet firmly on the ground. He is not overawed by his achievements because Prayasam has a legacy of equipping underprivileged children: they have gone to Oxford University to speak to students, been invited by Bill and Melinda Gates and trained by Adobe in filmmaking, among other activities. Learning from Manish was such a delight the Mizo visitors cannot wait to go back and replicate community TV on their campus.The group that opted for art was most in evidence to an onlooker, because students like Esther and Laltlankimi have painted an entire wall with colourful graffiti and helped Mili and Monoj decorate Kalanjali.Prayasam founder Amlan Kusum Ganguly said their youth and Pachhunga University students engaged as a learning community. Young men and women in Mizoram are being encouraged to set up their own entrepreneurial start-ups. The visit provided exposure on how the youth of Prayasam are handling their ventures and social enterprises with a larger vision. Like here, youth in Aizawl and elsewhere in Mizoram often fall prey to the vicious cycle of drug abuse, unemployment and cyber crime.Professor Samuel Vanlalruata, who accompanied the students, said, If only there were youth organisations like Prayasam there!As they bid the new friends mangtha (goodbye), there was no doubt that come elections or change, the Pachhunga-Prayasam bonding will endure."
5ce5c081e8e3fc56af40ead2,Don’t believe the anti-GMO campaign,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/dont-believe-the-anti-gmo-campaign/article25714142.ece,2018-12-11,"A review article, Modern technologies for sustainable food and nutrition security, which appeared in the November 25 issue of the peer-reviewed journal Current Science, is deeply worrying. The article was authored by geneticist P.C. Kesavan and leading agriculture scientist M.S. Swaminathan and describes Bt cotton as a failure. As the Principal Scientific Adviser to the Government of India, K. VijayRaghavan, rightly said, this paper is deeply flawed. It has the potential to mislead the public and the political system.Rely on scientific evidenceWhile the general public can be easily swayed by unauthenticated reports, the authors, as scientists, should have relied on hardcore scientific evidence before making such adverse comments. The statement that only in very rare circumstance (less than 1%) may there arise a need for the use of this technology [GM] is not in consonance with their other statements such as the one in the concluding paragraph: Genetic engineering technology has opened up new avenues of molecular breeding. However, their potential undesirable impacts will have to be kept in view. What is important is not to condemn or praise any technology, but choose the one which can take us to the desired goal sustainably, safely and economically. Professor Swaminathan also said in a response to the criticism of the article: Genetic modification is the technology of choice for solving abiotic problems like drought flood, salinity, etc. It may not be equally effective in the case of biotic stresses since new strains of pests and diseases arise all the time. This is why MSSRF [M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation] chose mangrove for providing genes for tolerance to salinity.Abiotic stress in crops is a major hazard and does not fall under the less than 1% category mentioned in the review article. Major science academies of the world such as the U.S.s National Academy of Sciences, the African Academy of Sciences and the Indian National Science Academy have supported GM technology. The U.S. National Academy of Sciences, after a massive consultation process, published a 420-page report in 2016 with the observation that Bt in maize and cotton from 1996 to 2015 contributed to a reduction in the gap between actual yield and potential yield under circumstances in which targeted pests caused substantial damage to non-GE varieties and synthetic chemicals could not provide practical control.In 2016, 107 Nobel laureates signed a letter challenging Greenpeace to drop its anti-genetically modified organism (GMO) technology stance. They stated that the anti-GMO campaign is scientifically baseless and potentially harmful to poor people in the developing world. Data from a large number of peer-reviewed publications have shown that, on average, GM technology adoption has reduced pesticide use by 37%, increased crop yield by 22%, and increased farmer profits by 68% (A Meta-Analysis of the Impacts of Genetically Modified Crops, published in PLOS One by Wilhelm Klmper and Matin Qaim in 2014). Yield gains and pesticide reductions are larger for insect-resistant crops than for herbicide-tolerant crops. Yield and profit gains are higher in developing countries than in developed countries. Data from a billion animals fed on GM corn have not indicated any health hazards. Those in the Americas and elsewhere consuming Bt corn or soybean for over 15 years have not reported any health issues. It is preposterous to think that governments would allow their people and animals to be fed poisonous food. Even reports based on faulty studies in experimental animals that stated that GMOs cause cancer were withdrawn. Major food safety authorities of the world have rejected these findings.Not a failure in IndiaBt cotton is not a failure in India. The yields hovering around 300 kg/ha at the time of introduction of Bt cotton (2002) have increased to an average of over 500 kg/ha, converting India from a cotton-importing country to the largest exporter of raw cotton. There was a small dip for a couple of years and the yield has now increased to over 550 kg/ha. The question to be asked is, what would have the yield been if Bt cotton had not been introduced in 2002?It is unfortunate that farmer distress is being wrongly attributed to Bt cotton failure. Farmers continue to grow Bt cotton. The development of resistance can be tackled through practices like Integrated Pest Management and by stacking Bt genes to fight secondary pests. The priority is to accelerate development of Bt cotton varieties that can be packed densely in fields and increase the yields to over 800 kg/ha, as is the case with other countries.GM mustard (DMH-11) is a technology to create mustard hybrids. Being a self-pollinator, mustard is difficult to hybridise through conventional methods. Genetic modification allows different parents to be combined easily, helping yields go up substantially. The herbicide glyphosate is only used for selection of hybrids and is not meant for farmer fields. In any case, reports on the probable carcinogenic potential of the herbicide have not been accepted by major science academies. Yield data can only be assessed in farmers fields. For this, trials are necessary. The question then is: why are the trials being scuttled? The moratorium on Bt brinjal is the most unfortunate step taken by the government in 2010 and has crippled the entire field of research and development with transgenic crops. Bangladesh has used Indias data to successfully cultivate Bt brinjal, despite all the negative propaganda. Reports indicate that as many as 6,000 Bangladeshi farmers cultivated Bt brinjal in 2017. How long will it take for Bt brinjal to enter India from Bangladesh?India has one of the strongest regulatory protocols for field trials of GM crops. Many scientists have been part of the monitoring processes, and it is an insult to the integrity of our scientists to indict the Review Committee on Genetic Manipulation and the Genetic Engineering Approval Committee as lacking in expertise and having vested interests. The paper by Dr. Kesavan and Dr. Swaminathan seems to have got most things wrong for whatever reason. GM technology is not a magic bullet. It needs to be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. There is definitely scope for improvement in terms of technology and regulatory protocols. But it is time to deregulate the Bt gene and lift the embargo on Bt brinjal. A negative review from opinion-makers can only mislead the country. In the end, it is India that will be the loser.G.

Prima facie the girl was strangulated and she was also raped, the police said.There were no visible injury marks on her body except a slight scratch on her chest. She lived with her maternal grandparents in a village, said SHO Radha Kishan.After coming from school on Tuesday, she went to graze cattle near her home with other children, but when she did not return home till late in the evening, her family members started looking for her, he said.Her body was spotted the next morning in the mustard field, about 200 to 300 metres away from her home, he said. The police are suspecting a 20-year-old youth of the same village who attempted suicide in the morning after the girls body was recovered. The youth became a key suspect as he was drunk and was spotted near the minor girl on Tuesday evening."

On offer is everything from Gariahater Ghugni Chaat, Iilish Maacher Deem Bhaja, College Street er Maacher Chop, Calcutta-Style Chilli Chicken, Kalighater Kosha Mangsho, Golda Chingri Malai Curry and Thakur Barir Khichuri. All of this is finished off with Calcutta Mishti Doi and Park Street Kulfi Falooda.This is the time for office Christmas outings, and Little Kolkata, started by two enterprising Calcutta boys, Prabir Chattopadhyay and Biswajit Deb Das, both 36, is picking up corporate bookings from the likes of HSBC, Barclays and Ernst & Young. The duo ran a supper club, which they have formalized into Little Kolkata. Now 4 for three luchis  which works out to a little over Rs 100 a luchi  might seem a trifle steep (especially when my cousin, Krishna, cooks it for free back in Calcutta), but if the cooking is genuine, I am more than happy to pay the price. Of course, I have to suspend judgement until I have tried Little Kolkata, but it appears to have got off to the equivalent of a brisk 100 runs for no loss before luncheon.Prabir says that 70 per cent of the dishes are authentic and the rest has to be adapted to local taste in a part of London with a lot of international tourists. The mustard dishes, for example, have to be tempered with yoghurt. He cannot import chefs from Calcutta, but has trained a number of Indians. He is especially proud of his khichuri, which is a homage to his grandfather: he was head priest at Kalighat temple.Jacob Rees-Mogg ShutterstockFamiliar bank ripplesUrjit Patel, who resigned as governor of the Reserve Bank of India, will have some sympathy for his counterpart in the UK, Mark Carney, a Canadian recruited in 2013 to be governor of the Bank of England. In India, at least, people are not as boorish as the hard-line Brexiteer, Jacob Rees-Mogg, who has not taken kindly to Carneys forecasts that the British economy will be badly damaged for years to come if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a withdrawal agreement of the kind Theresa May has negotiated.Rees-Mogg, who wants Carney to be ousted  sounds familiar?  accused the governor of whipping up Project hysteria, and said, Unfortunately hes a second-tier Canadian politician, having failed in Canadian politics, hes got a job in the UK, which he isnt doing well.Commenting on Patels resignation, the Financial Times adapted Lady Bracknells quip from The Importance of Being Earnest: To lose one central bank governor may be regarded as misfortune. To lose two in two years, as prime minister Narendra Modis government has, looks like carelessness.Mallya's judge: courteous but no-nonsenseWhat else do we know about Emma Arbuthnot? She is the chief magistrate at Westminster Magistrates Court who, in passing judgment on Vijay Mallya, described him memorably as a glamorous, flashy, famous, bejewelled, bodyguarded, ostensibly billionaire playboy. The first time I saw Emma in Court No 1, she came across as being just as gentle and sweet as Agatha Christies Miss Marple. Throughout the year-long proceedings, she was unfailingly courteous to Mallya. But she was brisk and no-nonsense when delivering her devastating judgment, even while referring to the RP (requested person) as Dr Mallya (not entirely sure where his PhD is from).In her personal life, Emma Louise Broadbent married James Norwich Arbuthnot, a former Tory parliamentarian from an aristocratic family, in 1984. Since her husband was elevated to the House of Lords in 2015, she can now call herself Lady Arbuthnot of Edrom. Lord and Lady Arbuthnot, who have a son and three daughters, have homes in London and in Berkshire. In her judgment, which she signed off as plain Emma Arbuthnot, she said she did not think the negative Indian media coverage of Mallya would affect the fairness of a future trial.She also said that Mallyas lawyers, Ms (Clare) Montgomery and Mr (Ben) Watson contend that Dr Mallyas case has totemic significance in Indian political life. He is being attacked by politicians and the press. The Defence argues that the press is obsessed with the RP. I accept that Dr Mallya has courted publicity over the years and that judging the number of journalists from India who attend Westminster Magistrates Court whenever the case is listed there is great appetite for news about the case. This is a case which should be turned into a play based purely on court transcripts. In a sense, along with Mallya, India and its political, legal and banking systems were also held up to scrutiny and, despite the verdict, did not emerge smelling of roses.Richter scale of weddingsSomeone really ought to do a PhD on comparing big fat weddings in the west and east  say, that of Meghan and Prince Harry versus the Ambani-Piramal extravaganza in Mumbai and Udaipur, where Beyoncs presence ensured extensive coverage internationally. But Mukesh Ambani was following in the footsteps of Lakshmi Mittal, who hired Kylie Minogue for the French wedding of his daughter, Vanisha, in 2004, and Gopi Hinduja, who recruited Jennifer Lopez and Nicole Scherzinger for the nuptials of his son, Sanjay, in Udaipur in 2015. On the Richter scale of Indian weddings, Bollywood stars are now warm-up acts.A black Chippendale chair ShutterstockFootnoteAs the year ends, so do the celebrations marking the 300th birth anniversary of Thomas Chippendale, possibly the worlds greatest furniture maker. I was told by Russell Elliott, who represents Windsor House Antiques, that Indian craftsmen, trained by furniture makers sent from Britain, produced Chippendale copies but added creative touches of their own. Many are now in the Royal Collection in England and treasured as works of art in their own right."

Every year, sometime in autumn, our two friends take us out to dinner to a place that they recommend, or one that we want to go to. This time we were late in keeping our date  thanks to my own preoccupations. But then, a few nights ago, we met at a restaurant they suggested  Tres in the Lodhi Colony Market  and had a good time together.Tres opened up some years ago and there was a time when everyone was talking about it. But this and that happened, and somehow I never went there. I was disappointed when I heard that it had shut down. Then, some weeks ago, it opened again  much to my joy.It is a cosy place, with the right kind of lights, though perhaps not the right kind of chairs. Their servers are cheerful and eager to help. The prices are on the higher side (a meal for two should cost about Rs. 3,000) but the menu is interesting. For starters, we asked for king prawn and kalamari with radish cucumber salad, smoked duck breast with peppered barley kimchi and Josper-baked Camembert with red grape and pepper preserve and grilled sourdough.For mains, our friends had the tenderloin steak with a baked potato mash, wilted greens and sauted mushroom, my wife asked for the pork belly (from the small plates section) and I, the crispy skin salmon fillet. For dessert, there was tiramisu.The starters were superb. I am not allowed to eat much cheese, but Camembert is one of my favourites, so I had a bit of that, and sang that old Hindi film song, Tu cheez badi hai mast mast to myself. A Josper oven is a grill-cum-oven, and helps professional chefs control temperatures to a t. The cheese was just right, I thought  neither too melty, nor too hard. The red grape and pepper preserve added to the taste, as did the grilled sourdough.Crunchy and tangyThe prawns and calamari were crunchy and tangy, and had been tossed with a lime chilli drizzle. I liked the smoked duck breast, too. The salty taste was balanced by a ginger plum gel and herbed salad.My salmon fillet with a crispy skin was excellent. It came with dill risotto and charred morning glory, but I concentrated solely on the fish. The fish had been cooked just right  so it was neither flaky, nor rubbery. The pork belly, I am told, was delicious. I am not allowed red meat yet (I am still trying to convince my doctors that in some quarters, pork is not considered red) so I could only look at it with sad eyes. It was served with a vegetable marmalade, which complemented the taste of the pork belly while the pickled mustard seeds gave it a nice and sweet kick (or so I was told).What was really disappointing was the tenderloin that my two friends were so looking forward to. They wanted the steak medium rare, but it was pretty tough and they had to struggle with their steak knives. I tried a piece and found it much too chewy. To top it, they charged extra for the truffle oil that the steak came with. That, I thought, was rather mean.The deconstructed tiramisu  mascarpone mousse, Kahlua jelly, coffee soaked savoiardi sponge and chocolate crisps  was okay. I am not much into tiramisus, and I would have preferred it constructed rather than deconstructed.But on the plus side, we were together, and I was dining out after a while. The steak apart, it was a nice meal, and it was good to be with close friends. There is something to be said about tradition, after all."

Such a board exists only in Telangana. The CM will head the board along with minister of jails and other officers. The money generated through the sale of these products will go to the board and not the state government.The funds will be utilised for the welfare of prisoners and development of jails.Sources said that there are plans to establish bakery units at the Ludhiana and Gurdaspur Central jails where biscuits, bread and cakes will be made.Units to produce interlocking tile and expellers for mustard oil are being set-up at the Bathinda Central Jail.Women at the Ludhiana jail will make sanitary napkins. Besides, a unit to make LED lights and bulbs has been made operational at the Kapurthala jail. The inmates assemble these lights and earn between Rs 10 and Rs 20 per piece.Also, carpets and soft toys will be made at the central jail in Amritsar. Women at the prisons in Patiala and Bathinda will do phulkari work and rugs will be made at Ferozepur and Ludhiana jails.The prison department will tie-up with Markfed (Punjab State Co-operative Supply and Marketing Federation Limited) to market the products, said an official, who did not wish to be named. The department is also trying to tie-up with the State Skill Development Mission to train the inmates.We are trying to develop skills, so that when the inmates finish their jail term, they can find employment the prison department will also earn money by selling the items and spend it on the welfare of convicts, said Additional DGP (Prisons), Punjab, Rohit Chaudhary."

Swaminathan, has said that hes a supporter of genetic engineering technology and that he ought not to have co-authored the article, which was a review of genetic modification (GM) technology in crops, in India.I wish to reiterate my total commitment and support to modern technologies including genetic modification and gene editing. Also, my emphasis has been on generating synergy between technology and public policy. In view of my extremely limited role in the paper, it would have been appropriate for Prof. Kesavan to have been designated as the sole author of the paper, he said in a statement made public on the MS Swaminathan Research Foundation website on Wednesday.The paper, Modern Technologies for Sustainable Food and Nutrition Security, was authored by P.C. Kesavan and Prof. Swaminathan, both senior functionaries of the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF). The article was a review of crop development in India and transgenic crops  particularly Bt cotton, the stalled Bt brinjal as well as DMH-11, a transgenic mustard hybrid. The latter two have been cleared by scientific regulators but not by the Centre.Among other things, the paper described Bt cotton as a failure and that Indias scientific regulators of GM crops suffered from endemic conflicts of interest, (and) lack of expertise in GMO risk assessment protocolsHowever Dr. Swaminathan reiterated his belief that genetic engineering was unsuitable for crops that face biotic stresses (such as damage from insects) and was more amenable to making crops resistant from abiotic stressors such as temperature and salinity.The controversy erupted after the paper was criticised by several scientists including Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA), K. VijayRaghavan, who characterised it as deeply flawed.In an email to Dr. Swaminathan, Mr. VijayRaghavan wrote the review made extraordinary generalisations about the Indian regulatory system. It alleges both incompetence and collusion. These are very, very serious allegations against entire committees and GovernmentEminent scientists and global leaders such as you have participated and coordinated discussions on these issues.I reiterate my total support to modern technologies, including genetic modificationM.

There is little hope of the trend being reversed in the face of growing materialism and self-reliance. But man basically being a social animal , lone engagements with food satisfies neither the stomach nor soul adequately.Therefore, the Christmas-day lunch attendance of around 30 at Melanie Fernandes house, year after year, warms the cockles of the heart. This year wont be any different as members of five generations of her extended family will squeeze around the dining table to partake of conversation and banter.And, oh, did we forget the food? For the impoverished Cratchits in the Charles Dickens tale, A Christmas Carol, the best meal of the year in terms of taste, variety and splurge was the Christmas-day dinner of goose, potatoes, pudding and roasted chestnuts. At the Fernandes lunch, also their best meal of the year, the Goan touch with a strong Portuguese influence is evident in the range of dishes.The 68-year-old Melanie and her sisters cook up a storm in the kitchen with their sorpotel, assado de porco (pork roast), sannas (rice cakes with a dash of toddy), chicken cafreal, baked or fried fish and the jewel in the crown  chicken roast with a stuffing of liver, bacon, raisins, cashew nuts, bread and vinegar.The fare is almost similar at Rohini Fernandes Christmas-day lunch where around 20 people gather at the table. Its a tradition Rohini took over from the senior members of the family around a decade ago. In attendance are members of four generations of the family, a priest, friends and elderly, lonely people.Wealth manager Christopher Louzado provides the whole shebang on the food front with sweets and savouries like rose cookies, cakes, marzipans and cheeseballs matching the sorpotel, ham, sannas and salads bite for bite. His is a D-I-Y family which prepares everything at home even if the cooking process is tedious. For instance, a smoked leg of ham is soaked overnight in brine, boiled in beer and spices for 3 hours the next day, cooled, studded with cloves and mustard honey glaze before being baked and sliced.Its dinner that Christopher organises on Christmas day every year for at least 15 people from among family and friends. His dentist-father Colin is much in demand at the dinner primarily for his special concoction of rum, fruit juices and spices  a hot Christmas punch which promises to deliver but not floor you.Christmas for Conrad Dalton begins early, around the start of December, like it is in the West. The retired group captain from the Indian Air Force and wife Yessonda throw a house party for family and friends with live music, dancing and a spread on the table. Conrad takes pride in his Goan roots and insists on singing the traditional mandos (Goan folk songs) at the party.One of the many stories that has been retold over and over again at Melanies dining table is that of her great-great-grandfather, a Noronha, who came to Pune from Goa in 1857 in search of employment. While improving on the smattering of English that he knew, the man worked his way to set up a bakery and wine shop in the Pune cantonment.When Noronha would return to his village in Goa for holidays, eager parents would implore him to hire their young sons in his businesses in Pune. For this, he would assemble the aspirants at the village well, throw in five coins and tell them to dive in. Those who came up with all five coins got the job. Melanie is happy to relate that the youths followed Noronha in settling down in Pune. She is in touch with the generations after them who still raise a toast on Christmas to her worthy ancestor."

While Bimla returned home directly from the polling booth, Kamaljeet and her supporters celebrated the victory by visiting the village gurdwara. Later, when she reached home, Bimla Devi welcomed her by pouring mustard oil along the door  a traditional gesture of welcome."
