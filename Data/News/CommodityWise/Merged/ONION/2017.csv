5909e4a27be9e033f19b8906,2017: 17-year-olds with 17 questions,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/2017-17-year-olds-with-17-questions-kashmir-bastar-demonetisation-bastar-4453977/,2017-01-01,"To mark 2017, The Sunday Express meets 17-year-olds across the country touched by the big events of 2016  to listen to their questions as they begin their first year of adulthood.Vishal Gupta, Indore | I am boarding a train again. What if this one derails too?The over 1,200-km journey from Indore to his village Bilaujha in Mau district of eastern Uttar Pradesh was a special one for 17-year-old Vishal Gupta. His sister Ruby, 23, was getting married on December 1. The shopping for her trousseau was done, and father Ram Prasad Gupta, 45, a sales assistant at a wine shop in Indore, had borrowed Rs 3 lakh from friends and relatives to provide for the other expenses. Vishal, a Class 10 student, his father, sisters Ruby and 14-year-old Khushi, boarded the Indore-Patna Express from Indore in the afternoon on November 19.A little after 3 am, when most passengers were fast asleep, fourteen coaches of the train derailed at Pukhrayan in Kanpur Dehat district, leaving over 150 dead. Vishal and his family were in the S-1 coach that was one of the worst hit in the accident. A few hours after the accident, Ruby, Khushi and I managed to pull ourselves out of the debris, but we couldnt find our father. We lost all our belongings, including the money that my father had borrowed, recalls Vishal.A student of Little Angels Convent in Indore, he will return to school in February, after his sisters wedding. The thought of that journey is scary, he says. I have not boarded a train since the accident. What if that train derails too? Why cant drivers be more careful? asks Vishal. Its ironic that the government talks of bullet trains when they should be worrying about the safety of passengers. Isnt it more important that passengers reach their destination safe, even if late? he says.

Their father, Paramananda Harijan, 45, squats on the floor as there are no chairs available for attendants. They have been here since the night of December 14 when Rashmita had to be rushed to hospital after being diagnosed with sickle cell anaemia Dr Priyaranjan Bahali, who did the morning rounds at the ward, told them that Rashmitas haemoglobin level was 6 gm/dl, less than half of the ideal count.Kanchan, a Class 12 Arts student of Sai Vinayak College in Majhiguda, admits she is worried about missing school. My final examinations are in March and I dont want to miss classes even for a day, she says The Dalit girl from Pakhanaguda village in Nandahandi block of Nabarangpur is the most educated in her family of five that includes Rashmita, their younger brother Balaram and her parents. Two years ago, after she scored 56 per cent in her Class 10 exams, Kanchans parents enrolled her for Plus 2 in a private college. The monthly fees is Rs 2,200, and Kanchan knows the money is daunting for her father, who works as an MNREGS labourer.What bothers Kanchan more, though, is the lack of buses as she must travel 20 km every day to college. She pays Rs 10 for the 30-minute ride, but rarely gets a seat. Read more here  Debabrata MohantyNishant Khushwaha, Delhi | I want to acquire skills. Can I do that, and not be a labourer like my father?In August, Nishant Khushwaha earned his first salary, at a cardboard factory in northwest Delhis Shalimar Bagh. It was the first time I earned regular money. It was apna paisa (my own money) and I could do anything I wanted with it, says Nishant, a lean teenager with long hair backbrushed into a pompadour. But the stint was shortlived. Nishant caught chikungunya and a bad bout of brain fever, his mother Sunita says. By the time he recovered, demonetisation had been announced, and it was the end of job prospects for the school dropout who has no inclination to study.In the new year, Nishant hopes to get a stable job in a mobile phone manufacturing factory.My friend Sahil works in a unit where mobile phones are assembled. Kaam seekhna hai (I want to acquire skills). Why cant I get a job like that? I dont want to be a labourer like my father, he says. Read more here  Sarah HafeezLoman Ali, Kairana | Why not get us a job? We will leaveIn 2017, Loman Ali hopes to get a job. The money would help, but above all, the job would allow him to get married to the love of his life. They met at a wedding in Kandhla and fell in love instantly, he says. Living in a one-room house with his father, two brothers, two sisters-in-law and their five children, in Kairanas Nahid Colony built for the riot victims of Muzaffarnagar, Loman pines for privacy to even talk to her.He hasnt thought about whether he can legally marry the girl, who is 17 too. When it comes to that, the teenager hopes the fact that he has no document proving his age will help. Since no one in the family, originally belonging to Fugana village  one of the worst hit in the September 2013 violence  remembers his birthday, it is an approximate guess that he is 17.

But can I still?Tabish Rafiq Bhat says he always hoped to do a Masters in Business Administration (MBA) some day. But the pellets that pierced his left eye shattered his retina  and his dreams. Now, he says, he cant look at the printed word without his eyes watering.My future seems dark just like my eye, says the 17-year-old, who wrote his Class 10 examinations in November. Tabish says he asked for a writer during the exams, but the Board of School Education turned down my request. My left eye hurt badly when I wrote my exams, he says, lying under a blanket in his single-room house that is partitioned to make space for the kitchen.The family is preparing for another surgery  the fourth  on Tabishs left eye. Doctors say there are two more pellets inside. They say they can only remove the pellets and that I wont be able to see with my left eye.

Will the curfew end?For the majority of her teenage years, Alice Yumnam was blissfully unaware of what an Inner Line Permit (ILP) meant even though, she admits, peer pressure initially prompted her to take part in the protests on the issue, which first cropped up in 2012.Alices locality, Khurai in Imphal East district in the state capital, has always been the epicentre of Meitei-centric protests in Manipur. And their demand for some form of an Inner Line Permit (ILP), which restricts entry of outsiders into Manipur, has largely been driven by the youth wing of the Joint Committee for Inner Line Permit (JCILP), a group of civic organisations that has been spearheading the movement since 2012.

Then how are we going to ensure this isnt repeated?When news that his uncle had passed away reached him on March 19, Mohammad Shahjad Alam was at his madrasa at Mubarakpur in Uttar Pradeshs Azamgarh district. It was only after he returned home to Jharkhand two days later, he says, that he realised what had happened. His uncle, Mohammad Majloom Ansari, 35, and 12-year-old Imtiyaz Khan were lynched, allegedly by a mob of cow vigilantes, at Jhabar village in Jharkhands Latehar district, and their bodies strung up on a tree. The two cattle traders, herding oxen to a fair in Hazaribagh, were accused of taking the animals for illegal slaughter.When I returned, all I could see was people in tears. The memories just refuse to fade. I dont remember any celebrations at home since, says Alam, sitting in his home at Nawada village, 10 km from Jhabar, where the incident occurred. Read more here  Prashant PandeyAnirbana Dasgupta, Howrah | Patriotism must come from within. Can you ask an East Bengal fan to cheer for a bad pass?Anirbana Dasgupta has an opinion on everything  from the state of education in West Bengal to the recent Supreme Court order on the national anthem  and a football analogy for each.The Class 11 student of Marias Day School in Howrah says he wants to get out of West Bengal in 2017 because the state just doesnt offer the same options anymore. Its like a football team with great forwards, but a bad goalkeeper and even worse defenders.An avid footballer, a voracious reader and a self-confessed science geek, Anirbana says he has avoided films in movie halls since the national anthem order.Of course, I will stand up for the anthem if thats the law. But if I am going to watch a movie for the Sunny Leone item number in it, I am not in a very patriotic mood, am I? Feelings of patriotism should come from within. I mean, you cant ask an East Bengal fan to cheer for a bad pass which costs the team a goal, can you? Read more here  Aniruddha GhosalDivyesh Solanki, Una | Why should I stay a Hindu? Maybe I will convert to Buddhism this yearNo money today either, says Divyesh Solanki as he walks home with his mother and sister after a day spent sorting and packing freshly harvested onion bulbs. They are hired for Rs 160 a day, and for the last three days, havent been paid their money.The farmer has asked me to come back tomorrow, says Divyesh. He doesnt know what else he could do for a living, he says. He knows what he wont do, however. Until a few months ago, almost every male member in our extended family and community skinned cows for a living. I never learnt to do it and even if I did, after what happened to members of our community, I cant imagine doing it either.Divyeshs village Mota Samadhiyala was the epicentre of Dalit unrest in Gujarat after seven men from the village were flogged on July 11 by a group of gau rakshaks for skinning a cow carcass.

He was afraid when the Naxals arrived in his village, Kodapakha in Kanker district, and demanded that he, then 10, do odd jobs for them. He was afraid when he first heard gunshots and saw bodies, when just a child. He was afraid when he left for another village to study, separated from his parents for the first time. Now, the 17-year-old says, fear never leaves him.So if he could, he would ask this question to all those responsible for the play of life and death in the theatre of Bastar: When will you allow us to stop being afraid? I want to ask the government and the Maoists, and everyone else who can do something, when will the fighting end?Naresh clearly remembers the day Naxals picked him up from his house. He was playing with his younger sister and elder brother. A group of four walked up to his father in the fields and demanded that Naresh be handed over. Read more here  Dipankar GhoseGramapudi Pavan, Andhra Pradesh | What do you think happens to Dalits in big colleges? I dont even speak good EnglishAfter his Class 10, Gramapudi Pavan wanted to join the Industrial Training Institute (ITI) in Guntur town, but opted for an Intermediate college (Class 10 and 12) because it was less expensive. Pavan, the son of a tenant farmer, and his family  parents and two younger siblings  live on Narsaraopet Road, not far from where Rohith Vemula, the Dalit PhD scholar who committed suicide on January 17 at the University of Hyderabad, grew up.A second-year student of CEC (Civics, Economics, and Commerce) at the S M Intermediate College in Guntur, Pavan hopes to go to S M College near Guntur next year for a graduation degree in commerce. It is a good college and has a big campus, he says. But Pavan has his worries: I have heard a lot of ragging happens in these big colleges. But I am more worried about being identified by my caste. Read more here  Sreenivas JanyalaCharna, Punjab | Will I be able to buy my own mixing console?Its a common sight along the Amritsar-Khemkaran rail line on the outer edge of Patti town in Punjabs Tarn Taran district: Groups of youth playing cards with cigarettes firmly between their lips. The young men, from the nearby Sangal Basti, where a majority of the families are below poverty line, are drawn to the tracks by the afternoon sun; the passing trains a minor inconvenience.Among those in one such smoke-filled circle is Charna, 17, a school dropout. His father, he says, died in a road accident when he was just seven. It fell upon his mother, who works as a domestic help, to raise Charna and his elder brother. I didnt find studies interesting so stopped going to school after Class 8. What use is studying? I know many guys who have passed Class 10 but dont have any proper jobs. They all do manual labour. So it is better to start working from now, Charna says. Read more here  Kamaldeep Singh BrarFaizan Mohammed, Madhya Pradesh | Why do we have to pay such hefty fees?Clad in a pair of jeans and a shirt, Faizan Mohammed continually fiddles with his new mobile. He says he loves the television serial Tarak Mehta Ka Ulta Chashma while the Salman Khan-superhit Bajrangi Bhaijaan was the last movie he watched. He lives near the only mosque in Ganesh Talai, a locality in Madhya Pradeshs Khandwa town populated by both Hindus and Muslims, but says he visits it only for Friday prayers.The teenagers nervous smile betrays his anxiety. Not keen to speak by himself, Faizan says he has been told by his family and relatives to avoid talking to strangers. The apprehensions are shared by many Muslim youth in the communally sensitive Khandwa town  often in the news for its link to the banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI)  who are scared of being called by the police for questioning, particularly in the wake of recent events. Of the eight SIMI undertrials gunned down by police on October 31, hours after they allegedly escaped from Bhopal Central Jail, five were from Khandwa in Madhya Pradesh.

Will I be able to speak my mind?In a little over six months from now, Aditya Chanana, a Class 12 science student, will begin college. While his days now are filled with coursework and preparing for engineering entrance exams, he often longs for a break, like the one he took through his school years, to cycle around the lush green Jawaharlal Nehru University campus, a few kilometres from his home in south Delhis Vasant Kunj locality.After a hectic school week, I would go there to unwind. I am also part of a cyclists group, and on a couple of occasions we went to the campus together. The Aravalis, the greenery, the winding roads, all made for a great cycling course, says Aditya, a student of Delhi Public School, Vasant Kunj. But Aditya no longer makes his weekly trips to the campus. In February this year, while I was cycling around the campus, I came across a protest rally. There was a crowd outside the administrative block, and I saw a couple of television reporters talking to students. I was told that a group of students had raised anti-India slogans, says Aditya, whose father works in a pharmaceutical firm. He has no siblings. Read more here.  Saikat BoseUmarfarukh Mainoddin Patel, Latur | Will there be another drought? Can government tackle it?In March, when the Latur water crisis was at its peak, like scores of others, the family of Umarfarukh Mainoddin Patel wanted desperately to leave the city. It was the worst nightmare of our life. We had to walk kilometres in the blazing summer sun to get a bucket of water, remembers Umarfarukh. Often, it fell upon the 17-year-old to fetch water for the family, which lives in Shahu Chowk area of Latur, as his father would leave for work early in the morning. The nearest water points were Gandhi Chowk and Vivekanand Chowk, both 2 km away, says the Class 12 student. He either carried the pitchers home or rode back with them on a bicycle.It was an exercise that could last up to eight hours a day, says Umarfarukh. By the time he reached the spot, there would already be long queues, of people with two-three pitchers or buckets each, struggling with the trickle being dispensed at the water point. I used to get a fright. In a crucial academic year, his studies suffered too, Umarfarukh says, as standing in the sun for so long often left him ill. His ambition is to become a judge. I want to ensure justice to the poor, especially those wrongly charged In this country, only those who have money get justice, the poor have little recourse to justice, he says.

Ours was the most unlucky batch. We had faced a similar situation in Class 10 in 2014 when our exams had got postponed due to the floods in the city. Instead of 2014, we sat for the exams in 2015, and some months later, appeared for Class 11 exams, says Sama, playing with her two younger brothers, who are in Classes 7 and 8.I thought I would make up for all that this year, but 2016 proved even worse, sighs Sama, who had cleared Class 10 with distinction. After her initial schooling at a private English-medium school in Karan Nagar, Sama now studies in the Kothibagh Higher Secondary School, a reputed government institution. In the five months following Hizbul Mujahideen militant Burhan Wanis killing, Sama couldnt move out of her house and due to the Internet and mobile phone blockades, struggled to stay in touch with friends and classmates. I couldnt even concentrate on my studies due to the protests and curfews, Sama adds. Read more here  Mir EhsanArya Mohan, Bihar | Now that there is liquor ban, can Nitish Kumar ensure its success?If I happen to meet Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, I would ask him one straight question: Isnt he the same person who took liquor to every door because of a liberal excise policy earlier? He has been invoking Mahatma Gandhi very often to support the liquor ban, but I would like to ask him if Gandhi was not relevant then.At the same time, clarifies Arya Mohan, a student of Class 12 at DAV, BSEB Colony, Patna, she supports prohibition as well as Nitish Kumar and his development vision. Prohibition is a great tool of women empowerment. In a low-income family, with its head a drinker, education becomes secondary. I am happy that some of these families probably understand the value of education now, she says, adding that she has heard from friends stories of families being destroyed by drinking.

The six-member family lives in a single-room house in the villages Dalit quarter. Divyesh, who turns 18 in March, says the July 11 incident has left him bitter. We respect the cow as much as anybody else does. We never kill a cow; only skin dead ones. Yet, we are victimised. I wonder if this will ever change, he says.Talking about the discrimination they live with, Divyesh adds, Even while we work on others fields, we have to bring our own utensils from home for food and tea. We are made to sit at a distance during lunch. Why should I stay a Hindu? Maybe I will convert to Buddhism next year, says the Virat Kohli fan. Divyesh hopes to be a policeman some day. The job will earn me respect and a salary. But for that, I need to clear Class 10. I have applied as an external student and will take the exam in March, says Divyesh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Looking at the daily arrivals, it looks productivity is higher even though the acreage was lower, a senior agriculture ministry official said.Around 20% of the countrys total onion output is grown during the kharif season. Since the kharif onion cannot be stored, farmers sell off the produce in domestic as well as overseas markets.The arrival of quality onions has boosted exports in the last few weeks. About 13,56,381 tonnes of onions have been shipped abroad in the April-September period of this fiscal.The government is still assessing onion production figures for the 2016-17 crop year (July-June). Last year, the countrys onion output was higher at 20.99 million tonnes. Maharashtra contributes more than a quarter of the countrys overall output."

An alumni wing of St Xavier's College, Ranchi along with other people from the region set up a food stall at an Indian Fair at Charlotte in North Carolina of United States of America (USA) few months ago.One among these non-resident Indians (NRI) Abhishek Sinha, working as vice-president manager in Bank of America who pursued intermediate (Science) from 1994-96 and Bachelor of Science (Chemistry honours) from 1996-97 in St Xavier's College while sharing details of this American inclination during the college alumni meet on December 31 told TOI, ""In mid-September, we had thought of participating in the fair with homemade litti-chokha, samosa and mutton rice. It was a surprise to see Americans loving these items and litti-chokha more because our dishes are spicier than theirs.""""They were relishing and constantly asking us to offer another plate of litti-chokha. On the first day, all the food we made got sold out in four hours and on the second day, it was sold out in the first two hours.USA has strict rules regarding preparing dishes for fair. We had to rush to our houses, prepare hundreds of litti-chokha and return to the fair,"" he said.Accepting the love for Bihar-Jharkhand's traditional dish, Deveshi Halder, an artist settled in Bellevue, Washington, who had graduated in Economics at St Xavier's College from 2006-09 said, "" Litti-chokha is undoubtedly famous on the east coast of United States including North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Florida but not the same on our side.""Litti is prepared by flour wherein cereals and ground pulses are mixed. This kind of flour is called Sattu. Onion, lemon, garlic and salt are added in it. The material is roasted and served with or without ghee. Chokha is the smashed potato including salt, garlic, onion and chilly flakes. Both litti and chokha is served with tomato chutney.Sinha said the group displaying such Bihar-Jharkhand customs is called Sparsh and has 150 members."
58e4bffea3d24b281b101f3a,Three-fold rise in onion export,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/three-fold-rise-in-onion-export/articleshow/56286372.cms,2017-01-02,"NASHIK: The onion export of the country has increased almost threefold from April to September for this fiscal as compared to the corresponding period of financial year 2015-16 due to removal of Minimum Export Price (MEP) and introduction of 5% subsidy for exporters from August 26.Sources from National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) said, ""The onion export has increased to 13.56 lakh metric tonne during the first half of the FY 2016-17, against 4.84 lakh metric tonne during the same period in financial year 2015-16. The total onion export may touch 21-22 lakh metric tonne.""The onion export of the country is expected to touch highest-ever figure this financial year. Earlier, the highest onion export was recorded at 18.73 metric tonne during the financial year 2009-10.Nafed director Nanasaheb Patil said, ""The onion export has increased threefold because of the zero Minimum Export Price (MEP) of onions and also introduction of Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) benefits at 5% for onion exporters, which have been extended upto March 31.""""This year, there had been excess onion production in the country. Around 25 lakh metric tonne production was in excess in the country. Hence, onion export is still low considering higher production of onions,"" he said.Moreover, the average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 550-Rs 600 per quintal. The cost of production for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal. Hence, farmers are still incurring heavy losses.""This has also led to the rise in export. Farmers actually must benefit from onion export. Earlier, there were some specific onion growing pockets, but areas under onion plantation are spreading now. Hence, government need to make a proper policy to match the demand and supply of onions,"" Patil added."

However, this can be injurious to health,"" an editorial said.Saamna criticized Modi for not setting a deadline to offer relief to common citizens who had to suffer because of his November 8 move to demonetise high-value currency notes. ""The PM hasn't announced the exact details of the black money which his government has unearthed in the last 50 days...He should tell us as to why people were subjected to cruel hardships...Tell us how many more citizens should lay down their lives (for the cause of demonetisation),"" the editorial said.Saamna said the maternity benefit plan was not original. ""Under Modi's plan, a pregnant woman opting for institutional delivery will receive financial aid of Rs 6,000 in her bank account ... . However, the scheme was flagged off by the UPA regime in 2010, and was called the Indira Gandhi Matruttva Sahyog Yojana ,"" Saamna said.The editorial said that the scheme had continued even after it was amalgamated with the national food security scheme, added Saamna.In a televised address to the nation on New Year's eve, Modi unveiled a package of sops, including the maternity benefit scheme, which, the PM added, was aimed at encouraging institutional deliveries in order to reduce maternal and infant mortality. Saamna warned that Modi's plan to offer 60 days' interest waiver on loans for rabi crops would be a non-starter because of the precarious financial condition of the district cooperative central banks.""The RBI has declined to accept old and cancelled notes deposited in the district cooperative banks. The PM's waiver announcement will add to the woes of these banks. They lack the financial strength to suffer the fresh burden. Worse, the Centre is yet to release this year's rabi crop aid to these banks,"" the daily said.Recalling the case of Chhotalal , a young man from north India who had no cash to perform the last rites of his mother, Saamna said: ""Chhotalal couldn't get Rs 2,000 from the bank to arrange for his mother's funeral. There are lakhs of such Chhotalals across the country ... . They are cursing the government.""Signing off, Saamna said: ""We have affection for Modi...but stating truth is an act of not crime but 'deshbhakti'."""

Karunakaran on Monday seeking compensation for crop loss occurred due to monsoon failure.In their petition, the farmers said they used to raise paddy, onion and chilli crops on over 1,000 acres with water available in Melapavoor tank and Pattipathu tank. Since the northeast monsoon failed, most of them did not raise crops this season and the few who cultivated paddy, onion and chilli with the little water available in these two irrigation tanks had suffered a huge loss.Hence, the Collector should recommend to the government to declare the district as drought-hit so that they could get compensation. Moreover, those farmers who did not raise crops and were struggling to save their cattle should also get some assistance to save their families from starving, the petitioners said.Against churchAnother group of villagers from Chettiyur in Tenkasi taluk submitted a petition against giving approval for constructing a church in their village.The petitioners said an application seeking permission for constructing the church was submitted on June 20 last by a few outsiders and the application was rejected as no Christian family was living in the village.The same applicants submitted another application on September 2 last seeking permission for constructing a community hall at Chettiyur which housed over 500 Hindu families.Similar community halls they built at Nattarpatti and Meenakshipuram are being used as churches. Hence, their move is an indirect attempt to construct a church in our village.If the permission is granted, it will lead to religious conversion and needless tension among villagers, said K. Thangarasa, the village head.Woman robbedR. Kamalam, an old woman from Karuppanthurai here, submitted a petition seeking action against a man who robbed her of her gold ornaments after taking her to a secluded place on December 25. She said he took her with a guise of getting her employment at Athangarai Pallivasal."

Bhujbal was the party's prominent leader from the region and held sway over the local bodies.On Wednesday, various hoardings welcoming Sharad Pawar had been put up at Pimpalgaon ahead of his visit. But these did not have a single picture of Bhujbal, which disappointed supporters. New hoardings with Bhujbal's picture were placed on Wednesday evening.When asked about this during a press conference, Pawar said, ""Bhujbal has made great contribution for the development of Nashik city. Hence, there is no question of giving directive that his photo should not been included in the hoardings. We will not take any such decision about Bhujbal until the court gives its verdict.""The NCP is facing tough times as four of its leaders, including Bhujbal and his nephew Sameer, are under arrest in the past 10 months. Pawar's visit to Nashik itself was long overdue. He was last here in March 2016, just days before Bhujbal was arrested.Recently, former MP and sitting chairman of Nashik Agriculture Produce Market Committee Devidas Pingle was arrested on alleged corruption charges. The Nashik anti-corruption bureau arrested Devidas Pingle, about two months after three APMC employees were arrested for carrying Rs Rs 57.73 lakh. They failed to provide justification for carrying the cash.Also, former NCP's youth wing president Chhabu Nagare is also in jail for his alleged involvement in fake currency case.

The police also recovered printers and scanners from Nagare's house.Pawar said, ""I was listening to the representation of the Union finance ministry secretary, who said Rs 2,000 note whose colour is getting faded is genuine. One of the persons among us in Nashik would have printed more Rs 2,000 notes in his house if he was aware of this.""""There is only on Currency Note Press in Nashik, any other would have been another press at his home. I told government that such people should be hanged."" he said, adding, ""In politics, we do not make enquiry of each person, but such persons should not be spared and be hanged.""Pawar said cleaning of party, the image of which was maligned due to some wrong people, is to be done here. When asked about Nagare and Pingle, Pawar said, ""The party's image was maligned due to some tainted leaders who came into the party, but we will have to do the work of cleaning the party."""

According to sources, farmer V M Palanisamy (45), a resident of Velampalayam near Odaimedu in Erode, had availed loan from a nationalised bank several years ago to buy a tractor.After drought in 2016, he was unable to withstand the losses incurred in farming and could not repay any money towards the loan.

Prakash Kammardi. This situation has arisen as there is a bountiful harvest of various crops because of good rains in other States as well as countries. Either the cheap crops from other States are entering our markets or there is no demand for our produce in other markets because of glut in their own areas, he said.It is like rubbing salt into the wound of farmers who have already suffered crop losses owing to serious drought or floods as they may have to not only suffer reduction in yield, but also crash in the prices, notes the The Perspective and Forecasting report by the KAPC.According to the commissions report, what has complicated the matter is the impact of demonetisation. This has prevented the recovery of prices of some crops besides leading to a dip in the price of others owing to poor cash flow in the markets, Dr. Kammardi said.The commissions report has pointed out that the prices of tomato and onion have crashed by 84 per cent and 70 per cent respectively, when compared with the earlier level; and that of copra and arecanut have seen a dip of 47 per cent and 7 per cent respectively after demonetisation.The commission has suggested to the State government to take up the issue with NABARD as well as the Union government to increase the daily money withdrawal limit for farm traders in agricultural produce marketing committees (APMC) in the interest of farmers.Pointing out that the norms related to monetary withdrawal limits from banks were relaxed for tea growers of some areas, Dr. Kammardi sought similar benefit to be extended to APMCs as nearly 41 per cent of the trading of farm produce takes place in these markets.This is one of the worst harvest seasons for farmers in terms of prices in the last several decades. This has resulted owing to glut in production in other States/countries coupled with the impact of demonetisation.T.N. Prakash Kammaradi, Chairman, Karnataka Agriculture Price Commission"

While around 11 pesticides were found in the spinach samples, around five pesticides were frequently found in all the sample: chlorpyrifos, triazophos, cypermethrin, deltamethrin + triazophos and profenophos.However, it is difficult to declare the pesticide residues as unsafe as there is no Maximum Residue Limit set for spinach by the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India. The FSSAI has set MRL standards for only a handful of vegetables like soyabean, onion, ginger, okra and green chilly that are exported to other countries. But, if the pesticide residue found in spinach is compared to MRL set for other vegetables, it shows that the residues in spinach are much higher. For example, MRL set by FSSAI for chlorpyrifos is 0.5 milligram/kilogram (mg/kg) for onion. It was found to be as high as 6.3 mg/kg in spinach. The EU standard for triazophos in onion is 0.2 mg/kg which was found as high as 6.8mg/kg in spinach. The Codex Alimentarius of Food and Agriculture Organisation set cypermethrin standard at 0.1mg/kg for onion which was detected at 3mg/kg for spinach.Dr Shashi Bhushan Vemuri, former head of All India Network Project on Pesticide Residues, said, None of the pesticides found in the spinach samples should have been actually found as their usage on vegetables is not recommended. Spinach is often sprayed with pesticides just before it is brought into markets as the vegetable has big and soft leaves."

These practices were determined after examining 463 samples of food collected from across the city, and the way they were handled from storage to serving.Accordingly, testing for food-borne pathogens revealed that most of the carrots used in the samples and over three-quarters of onion  two commonly-used vegetables  were contaminated with the bacteria escherichia coli. The bacteria, known to be a part of the human gut flora, are expelled in faecal matter. Though not all, some types of E.coli can cause serious illnesses.The study was published in the British Food Journal.The study is part of the institutes larger efforts to improve food safety standards in the city. Partnering with the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) and civil society organisations, researchers at the institute have developed a training module based on the findings. A few vendors have also been trained. The training suggestions are low-cost measures to get more vendors to adopt them.Among the common high-risk practices examined in the study, which have been addressed in the training module, researchers found that pani puri vendors, who did not wash their hands with soap, had higher risk of contaminating the delicacy with fecal coliforms like E.coli. In all, about 150 samples of pani puri were analysed.Researchers also estimated that leaving peeled or cut fruits and vegetables uncovered, made them 13 times riskier to consume than ingredients well stored.Besides street food, studies in the past have also assessed quality of ice creams sold by pushcart vendors.A study published last year by food and nutrition researchers of Osmania University found that about a third of samples tested were contaminated due to poor hygienic conditions at point of preparation and subsequent inadequacies in handling."

So, notebandias demonetisation is called colloquiallycouldnt have come at a worse time. With money sucked out of the market, there was a tomato glut, and prices crashed by 80%.A 15-kg crate of tomatoes traded this year between Rs 30 and Rs 50 (instead of Rs 700 at its peak), said Kumar. I had no reason to spend on transportation and bring it to the market or wait for the price to pick up. So, I uprooted all my tomato plants in late November to minimise the loss. This is the worst we have seen in my experience.Kolar is the biggest vegetable-growing region in Karnataka, and houses Asias second-largest tomato market. In November, the ruling price of tomatoes in the Kolar market was Rs 3-5 per kg, or 85% lesser than the same time in 2015.Kumars case is echoed across India. The price of tomatoes crashed to 25 paise/kg, The New Indian Express reported on December 10, 2016, which prompted farmers in a Chhattisgarh district to dump nearly 100 tractor-trolleys, or about 45,000 kg, of tomatoes, on a national highway.Similar incidents by frustrated farmers were reported in Nashik, Hyderabad and other key vegetable-growing regions.Worst hit: Southern tomato farmers, western onion farmersTomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu were the worst hit since prices fell by 60-85% while onion farmers were the worst hit in Maharashtra and Gujarat, according to an IndiaSpend analysis of vegetable prices in seven Indian citiesAhmedabad, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Delhi, Kolkata and Mumbaibetween November 2015 and November 2016.Source: National Horticulture Board; Negative values indicate rise in pricesThe price of potatoes, which have a shelf life of up to 2-3 months, was stable in places such as Delhi and Chennai, while it rose between 17% and 25% in Bengaluru and Mumbai. The price of potatoes per quintal was Rs 1,086 in November 2015, increasing 27% to Rs 1,376 in November 2016.The price of peas dropped between 15% and 20%, with arrivals increasing in six cities, except Mumbai.The crash in prices was also due to oversupply, the data show. While the prices of tomatoes (hybrid variety) fell by 55-85%, the supply was double and even triple the previous year in parts of India, such as Ahmedabad, Kolkata and Hyderabad, according to data from the National Horticulture Board.In Chennai, for instance, the maximum price a farmer could get per quintal of tomatoes in November 2016 was Rs 760, compared to Rs 4,900 in November 2015, a drop of 85%. The supply to the city was 2,910 metric tonne, an increase of 40% from 2015.In Hyderabad, prices dropped 60% but supply increased 337% in November.Onions were traded anywhere between Rs 650 and Rs 1,500 per quintal in November 2016, compared to Rs 3,027 to Rs 5,600 in 2015.At the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) in Nashik, Maharashtra, Indias largest wholesale onion market, onions were sold at between Rs 5 and Rs 7 a kilogram.In the seven cities we analysed data for, supply was 196,400 metric tonne in November 2016, against 186,175 metric tonne in November 2015.The situation worsened in December, as prices fell by another 20-50%, and peas traded at a 10-year low in the Delhi market, according to officials from the horticulture department.Enough rains ensured a good harvest but low pricesThe monsoon rains would subside during September to November, and it would result in lesser yield, indicating lesser supply and higher prices, Bellur Krishna, managing director of the state-owned Horticultural Producers Co-operative Marketing and Processing Society, told IndiaSpend. This year, the rainfall was good in the vegetable-growing regions of Karnataka.This led to good harvest but the prices are also down due to the cash crisis triggered by demonetisation, he said.Kolar, Belagavi, Haveri and Chitradurga, the top vegetable-growing regions in Karnataka, received normal rainfall during the south-west monsoon in 2016.Karnataka declared a drought in 22 districts and some additional talukas in October 2016; the state received Rs 1,782 crore from the central government, IndiaSpend reported on January 10, 2016.The impact of demonetisation could only be to the extent of 20% of the price fall, said Krishna.Demonetisation is expected to hurt agriculture and informal-sector workers, IndiaSpend had reported on November 15, 2016.Around 9.4 million hectares, or 10% of Indias cropped area, is under vegetable cultivation, of which 50% is given to potato, onion and tomato, according to Horticulture Board data.Most of the transactions in fruits and vegetables are in cash, Brajendra Singh, director, National Horticulture Board, told IndiaSpend. So, demonetisation has definitely had some bearing. Arrivals had increased; so, the downturn was obvious.Tomato cultivation is usually routed through market clusters (around cities) and is profitable, Singh said.This time, it was available from local sources, said Singh. The price of tomatoes had gone up to Rs 50 a kg over the last two years. This year, the climate was favourable and resulted in bumper crops. Suddenly, the markets were depressed due to oversupply and because there was no cash.Singh predicted the situation would be normal over the next quarter, and crops would fetch a good price for farmers by the summer of 2017."

Refuting the police version that Angelo died under a train after running away from custody on April 18, 2014, a witness said, ""The entire incident of assault and severe beating took place in front of me. It was not possible for Richie (Agnelo) to run from custody as he was severely beaten. Police are trying to cover up by making a false claim of this train accident.""On Monday the matter came up before the special Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act court. Three cops accused under the act were represented by advocate Prabhanjay Dave. The case was adjourned to February 23.The witness said Agnelo's name was not written in the case papers drawn up on the night of April 16, 2014. He said when he asked an accused cop, Suresh Mane, why Agnelo was not taken with others for the mandatory medical check up prior to being produced before the magistrate next day, he was told his father had agreed to give them Rs 2 lakh. ""I said it was not possible,"" the witness said. He and another accused said it was on April 19, while they were re-produced before a magistrate, that cops told them about the death.A witness who was allegedly made to perform oral sex on the minor and Agnelo, said another cop, Vikas Suryavanshi, attempted to push a wooden rod up into his private part while he was hung upside down.""When they failed, Mane and Satyajith Kamble said if I didn't reveal who has the stolen chain, they will sprinkle petrol on my private parts,"" he said. The witness stated the torture meted out to Agnelo left him suffering like a ""fish out of water"".Referring to the afternoon of April 17, 2014, he said, ""Richie was screaming for help saying he needs medical attention. Foam started coming out of his mouth.`Pathan' officer threw some water on his face. He gave Richie an onion and chappal and kept it near his nose. Richie regained consciousness only in the evening,"" the witness said. He said when Agnelo repeatedly sought medical help, the woman officer abused him: ""Tu tadap tadap kar mar.."" (Die in pain).Agnelo's brother Reagan told the CBI his brother was picked up in the wee hours of April 16, 2014, from their grandparents' home at Dharavi. He and the brother of another accused said they saw cops beating one of the trio who was forced to lie naked. He stated on the night of April17, 2014, his fat her told him Agnelo was not produced in court with the others. Reagan said at 10.30am on April 18, 2014, he received a call from Agnelo asking him to get him some glucose and clothes at noon.""He said throughout the night he was thrashed very badly by the police and was giddy."" He said his brother was not in the lock up when he reached at 11.45am and cops told him since he was slightly injured, he was taken to Sion Hospital and would return shortly. ""I sat there for nearly one-and-ahalf hour, then I got a call from my father informing me about my brother's death.""The statements are part of a supplementary chargesheet submitted by the CBI last month accusing three of the eight cops from Wadala railway police under the POCSO Act, in addition to assault, wrongful confinement, and negligence in custody . The minor, who was 15 at the time of the incident, alleged Mane, Suryavanshi and Kamble had forced one of the accused to perform oral sex on him and Agnelo. The minor told the investigating agency that he was absolutely ""helpless and felt ashamed and bad when this happened, but blindly obeyed the orders of the accused."" He further said that Mane threatened him and Agnelo and said that if they didn't partake in the act, they would be beaten.The tales of torture described by the witnesses are horrific. If they are found to be reliable by the court, the policemen accused in the case must be held accountable and stringent punishment must be handed out to them to set an example that those in uniform will not be spared."

The result was a succulent and juicy fish piece.The Lucknowi Dal served along side the rice was roasted and then cooked which gave it a smoky flavour and home-like taste.

One of the teams visited Mettur Dam in the evening and took stock of the storage level.After assessing the drought-situation in Dharmapuri, the team comprising B. Ganesh Ram, Ratna Prasad and Paul Pandian inspected the damaged tomato crops at Marakottai village and cow peas at Aranganur village in Salem.At Mettur Dam, the team collected details of storage level, inflow and discharge from the dam on various occasions for farm activities in the Cauvery delta districts.District Collector V. Sampath made a power point presentation to the team members at the Mettur inspection bungalow on the grim situation and the severity of the drought conditions prevailing in the district for the past many months.The Collector also drew the attention of the Central team to the meagre water storage in the other reservoirs such as Aanaimaduvu, Kariakovil and also in all the major and minor water bodies of the district. C. N. Maheswaran, Commissioner of Social Security Schemes, accompanied the team.The second team comprising Vijay Rajmohan, Director (Trade, Extension and Drought Management), Union Ministry of Agriculture and Santhosh, Assistant Advisor, Ministry of Drinking Water and Sanitation, which arrived here after completing the visit of Namakkal, inspected the affected maize fields at Rayanpatti.The team members told presspersons at Veerapandi that they would leave for New Delhi after completing the tour of Tamil Nadu on January 25 and will submit its report to the Centre.This team was accompanied by Dheeraj Kumar, Managing Director, TWAD Board, R. Sukumar, District Revenue Officer, P.

Of these, a total of 27,452 hectares has been severely hit by drought. Over 50 per cent of the affected area was under millets, groundnuts and the productivity was affected.In turn, this had caused 3,000 tonnes fodder shortage for livestock.The district ought to receive an average 830 mm rainfall. However, it received only around 590 mm.The team inspected fields under pulses and groundnut crop in Bargur block. Interacting with individual farmers in Sivampatty village and Nadupatty village in Bargur, the team sought information on the extent of damage to crops and the overall impact of drought on the fields, that were largely under groundnuts and other pulses crops.The team also visited groundnut, pulses and millets fields at Oilapatty village in Pochampalli and Dasampatty village in Uthangarai.In Erode, dried-up crops and parched fields stared at the Central officials. The team first went to Nochipalayam village and found that mulberry, coconut and sugarcane crops had dried up on vast swathes of fields.

The impact was indeed severe, Vijayaraj Mohan, senior official representing the Union Agriculture Ministry said, after observing that a cocoon unit had to be closed down due to non-availability of water.District Collector S. Prabakar pointed out the dry sugarcane stalks to the Central team.At Attayampalayam, the officials took stock of the complete damage to papaya, mango and other crops. Farmers here said they had gone ahead with heavy investments for raising the crops in anticipation of rainfall.Implementation of the Pandiyaru-Punnambazha scheme would be the only long-term solution for preventing recurrence of drought in the district, a farmer said, while narrating the inability of agriculturists to find fodder for their livestock due persistent dry conditions. The team finally visited Samigoundanpalayam village to assess the damage to turmeric crop.On Wednesday, the team will visit Surapalayam and Moolakarai in Erode block to estimate damage to tapioca, turmeric and tomato crops, and Thalayampalayam, Karukkupalayam and Bolanaickenpalayam in Perundurai block to analyse drought impact on groundnut, cotton and maize crops.(Reporting by Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

The fishing hamlet instantly switched into a mode of frenzy as people on streets run back their home, shoving their children inside and bolting the doors.The residents peep into the streets from the little windows or holes in their house. It takes a while before they breathe easy again, after being certain it was a false alarm.Nadukuppam, a fishing hamlet on Lloyds Road, was a seemingly innocent victim to the clashes between police and the public. The residents who wanted to go fishing on Monday morning were denied access by the police.People alleged that the police harassed even innocent people because of what people asserted was a personal vendetta. They found the chance when protesters from the Marina, who were being chased found refuge in the slum, claim aggrieved residents.Abirami Raji*, an eight-year-old girl slowly steps out of her with a panic-stricken face after the false alarm. Tears roll down her cheeks. Her father was allegedly beaten up and hauled away by the police from the Light House metro station.1) The Nadukuppam fish market which was burnt down; 2) an inconsolable resident of the slum, who was injured in the violence; 3) charred remains of fish in the Nadukuppam market; 4) a resident of the slum sporting neem-and-tamarind paste on his injured legs; 5) another resident showing welts on his back;6) a resident who was attacked during the scuffle; 7) charred remains of vehicles, near the City Centre Mall in the city on Tuesday | ASHWIN PRASATHShe joins the parade of people who hesitantly walk toward the fish market that was burned down on Monday. The police walked off. Theyre not coming to our kuppam, announces an elderly man standing amid the markets charred debris. He sends a wave of relief across the hamlet with that message.I was standing near the ration shop on 8th Street. I was wearing a black shirt. The shirt was torn like paper and I wasnt treated any better, says Srirajan, a resident. He points to swollen legs and shoulders and back that are marked by blood clots.I was beaten, dragged to the streets end and dumped into a white van in which women police were eating. They beat me more, stamped me with their shoes and dumped me near the lighthouse.Nesam K, a 55-year old woman, lifts her saree to show a swollen leg on which she applied turmeric paste.Among them is a 31-year-old woman who cries for a different reason. Neither I, nor my husband was at home. We came back to find our whole house upside-down, she says.Her husband Kirubakaran walks to his house and carries the wooden door thats completely come off its hinges. Inside their little house, the washing machine has toppled with clothes strewn all around the 8x8 living room, the rice pot had spilt on the floor, their table fan stood broken and almost every object was misplaced. Our house was locked. Why would they break into it? she asked.While house-doors and windows were damaged causing severe loss, the major fire that destroyed their market and vehicles has caused immense loss to the fishing community.Behind Maniamma* (81) is a cart filled with about 50 kgs of burnt onions. The women police used powder, and the gents used diesel and tear-gas shell, she says. The woman police sprayed a white-coloured powder on the floor and the circle immediately caught fire.They threw this powder through the market. Thats how my onion cart caught fire, she wails. White phosphorus, on exposure to air, catches fire immediately. It only requires 30 degrees Centigrade to burn. It produces intense smoke which masks the origin of the fire.Sivagami A* adds, Nearly 200 fish vendors sell in this market. The women police used that powder to burn this and then took this fire and lit that auto. Then they used this fire to burn two more autos, one van and a car. She adds that a cloth dipped in diesel was wrapped around a stick to set their vehicles on fire. Others agreed wholeheartedly.Divya, who also used to sell fish in the burnt market pulls out a gunny bag from behind her and produces four objects. One might tell me that we threw this stone, But did we use this broken lathi? Did we burn these tear-gas shells? Did we use these black rubber bullets? she asks as she produces one object after another.*Names changed"

The district administration is sending the onions back to the farms, so that they can be used as manure.The district administration had purchased the onions from the farmers at Rs 624 a quintal under the support price scheme. A whopping 3.8 lakh quintals of the vegetable was procured between November 4 and December 7 last year. Of this, 75% has been sold to the APMC traders by the district administration at Rs 175 to Rs 225 a quintal. A portion of the stock was sold through the small retail outlets.What remains are the smaller variety and the sprouted lot (around 70,000 quintals), which are not preferred by the traders. The onions are rotting due to moisture and the rain in December.Fakirappa Hosamani and Kumar Sugganahalli, farmers from Petalur village, said they had taken away 40 tractor loads of rotting onion in the last 15 days for use as natural manure in their fields. They expect a good crop if there are good rains after six or seven months.Gadag tops in onion cultivation, with a 40% increase in area under cultivation (10,562 hectares) in the last decade, from 26,665 hectares. This year has seen a record harvest, despite the drought. The district administration has suffered losses of Rs 7 crore to Rs 8 crore, after buying the produce under the support price scheme."

The answer is: NO.Two years ago, the Corporation authorities had planned to construct two bridges (near Aruldosspuram and Obula Padithurai) connecting north and south Madurai after demolishing the existing causeways, all at a cost of Rs. 30 crore. This is expected to give substantial relief to motorists, who relied more on the century-old Albert Victor Bridge.Now, the major work on the bridge has almost been completed and it will ready for public use soon, said Corporation Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri on Tuesday. Approach roads to the fly-over are being laid and the work should be over in about a fortnight. Lights and other fittings, among others, have to be installed. Work is going on in full swing, he added.Fruit marketLike the two bridges, the Corporation had taken up construction of 240 shops near the integrated bus stand at Mattuthavani for fruit vendors who would exit from Vakkil New Street, Simmakkal and other pockets. Except for laying under ground drainage and road on the new campus, the shops are ready. We hope to put them to use in less than two months, Mr. Sandeep Nanduri said.Though the Corporation had planned other projects, the prevailing drought had forced the authorities to focus on providing drinking water first to all residents for now. But, in long term perspective, the city should be kept free from markets and encroachers. Though the Corporation council resolved to work on this line two years ago, when V.V. Rajan Chellappa was the Mayor, in reality , the resolution is in cold storage.The onion market on South Marret Street is yet to be moved out. As a result, it has always been a problem for smooth flow of vehicles. To add to the woes, mounting vegetable waste on the road not only encroaches the carriage space, but also emanates bad odour. Though officials claimed to have succeeded in shifting onion sellers, the attempt got stuck due to political interference from the back door, officials in the Town and Country Planning department said.Likewise, unchecked encroachments on roadsides on busy thoroughfare, by all types of vendors, had crippled movement of even two-wheelers and pedestrians in and around Meenakshi Temple, Netaji Road, South Avani Moola Street and a few other stretches, considered as tourist spots.Omni bus standAfter the Corporation established the omni bus stand at Mattuthavani, the congestion experienced in and around Periyar bus stand, Tirupparankundram Road, Palanganatham and Arapalayam had reduced to a great extent. Keeping this in mind, the authorities should shift the onion market, which would be a blessing for road users.When the Corporation is ambitious to give a facelift to the temple city after it was selected for the Smart City Project, the official machinery should work towards getting recognition as the number one clean city in the country."
58f6c9e67be9e031f13bbd4b,Centre mulls max export of onions,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/nashik/centre-mulls-max-export-of-onions/articleshow/56901099.cms,2017-02-01,"NASHIK: The decline in average wholesale price has the Union government mulling over pushing agencies like the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) to export maximum onions under the price stability funds (PSF).The average wholesale onion prices have declined to Rs 500 per quintal due to a rise in supply. In a bid to match the demand and supply, the union government is planning to export most of the onions.The onion export of the country has increased to 16.43 lakh metric tonnes in the first seven months (April-October) of 2016-17 financial year, against 5.07 lakh metric tonnes in the corresponding period last financial year. This has not benefited the farmers as the wholesale onion prices have declined due to a rise in arrival of the produce while they are yet to manage their production cost. Due to this reason, the government has asked NAFED to export onions so that prices will get stabilised.The production of onions this year has been around 25 lakh metric tonnes. The minimum export price (MEP) of onions is zero and the government has introduced 5% subsidy (MEIS) for onion exporters from August 26, which will be in effect up to March 31. The export has not increased though.It costs farmers around Rs 950 per quintal for growing onions and they incur losses if they get a price below that. The average wholesale onion price at the country's largest wholesale market, Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), has declined to the range of Rs 500-550 per quintal, putting farmers in huge losses. While the daily arrival of onions is around 15,000 quintals a day at Lasalgaon, it has increased to the range of 30-35,000 quintals a day now.A NAFED source said, ""We have just conducted a survey at the Lasalgaon APMC to check the possibility of onion exports. We are mulling to export 30 metric tonne of onion a day. It is a part of the government policy to export maximum onions and stabilise the wholesale onion prices so that farmers will not incur losses. The money required for the export is to be used under the PSF."""

593ba70f7be9e0066b6f5d0e,Bihar wish-list for Mr Jaitley,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170201/jsp/bihar/story_133304.jsp,2017-02-01,"What does Bihar expect for itself when Arun Jaitley rises to present the budget on Wednesday? Before every budget, there is hope in states that specific doles would be offered to them. But the Union budget is not for any particular state. Its for all the states. However, if funds are increased for departments, Bihar will also benefit, remarked former state finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi even as the current finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui expressed the hope that Bihar would be given major concessions. The Telegraph finds out what the wish-list of some key sectors is. ROADPromises and more promises but precious little has been done. The Centre has failed to fulfil the promises made to the state regarding the road sector despite repeated meetings. Union minister in charge of roads, Nitin Gadkari, had promised that Bihar would get Rs 50,000 crore for road projects, which did not take off. The state sent a proposal of upgrading 3,600km of roads to national highways; in response, the union ministry agreed to upgrade just 13 state highways covering a total of 910km. Promises made by the Centre to construct 53 road over bridges too have not been fulfilled. Several national highways are in need of urgent repair. All that the Centre has approved is a new link between Sahibganj bypass in Jharkhand to Manihari bypass in Bihar, including four-lane bridges over the Ganga, and Rs 1,742.01 crore for the rehabilitation of Patnas Gandhi Setu. Bihar road construction minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said: The promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on spending Rs 55000 crore on roads in Bihar are yet to be met. I hope that in this budget, the state gets the funds to repair the national highways and the amount he had promised. RAILWAYThe state expects funds for ongoing projects and betterment in passenger services. Money is required for ongoing projects which include an electric loco manufacturing unit at Madehpura, a wagon workshop at Garhara in Begusarai, a workshop at Jamalpur, and a rail bogie factory at Dalmianagar. ECR officials said a request for capacity augmentation has been sent to the railways for a coach maintenance workshop at Harnaut. Bihar Daily Passengers Association secretary Shoaib Quraishi said: The railways need to work on issues like safety of passengers, punctuality of trains, confirmed berths, improvement in on-board services and emphasis on the cleanliness inside trains and station premises. We are expecting that the railway will also work on improving the quality of food. HEALTHHealth experts are hoping that the total expenditure on the healthcare sector will increase. As per the last budget, the total expenditure for health was only 1.62 per cent of the whole budget out of which the National Health Mission had a share of less than one per cent. We are expecting an increase in the total expenditure on the healthcare sector this time. Increasing the budgetary allocation of the National Health Mission would give a boost to healthcare. The finance ministry should also focus on human resource. In 2015, the National Rural Health Mission had recommended formation of a special empowerment recruitment cell in states where there has been a delay in the recruitment of manpower in hospitals. There is a huge scarcity of doctors in state-run hospitals because the Bihar government had failed to fill vacancies in government hospitals, said Dr Ranjit Kumar, general secretary of Bihar Health Services Association. Sunil Kumar Singh, a member of the governing body of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, said the government should waive customs duty on high-end instruments that are being imported. This will ensure availability of high-end equipment in all hospitals. Besides, subsidies and incentives should be provided to the pharma industries for initiating research work. This will help in creation of new medicines of the same molecule and will ultimately bring down prices of medicines, said Singh. INDUSTRYThe focus of the government is on sectors like leather, textile, food processing to expedite industrial development and job creation. Industrialist Satyajit Singh said the finance minister should focus on increasing domestic consumption, public and private investment, exports and job creation. We feel the Union government should bring down corporate tax to a maximum 25 per cent from the current levels. The rebate on interest paid on housing loan should be increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh, as it would boost the demand in the real estate sector and make a positive impact on fiscal sentiments. The GST peak rate should be limited to 20% and the focus should be on developing micro, small and medium enterprises, Singh said. AGRICULTUREAround 80% of Bihars population depends on agriculture and allied activities for a living, but the sector contributes only 25% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP). Progressive farmer and chairman of the marketing wing of Nalanda Organic Vegetable Grower Federation, Rakesh Kumar, said it was time agriculture and horticulture were made profitable ventures, else people would be forced to leave farming. A minimum support price (MSP) should be declared for potato and onion to provide fiscal protection to farmers. Data show that the price of potato and onion has been almost static over the last 20 years, while cost of inputs like fertiliser and pesticide has multiplied several times. The Union budget should declare MSP for potato and onion and provision free electricity for farmers, Rakesh said. TOURISMBihar lacks basic infrastructure in attracting more tourists despite having the potential. Though the flow of tourists to Bihar has increased manifold but soon after their arrival, tourists start thinking about their return. It is due to the lack of proper communication linkage and infrastructure, said an official of the tourism department. Bihar is well known for its heritage sites like Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Nalanda and Vaishali, besides, historical sites linked with Jainism. But sadly these sites are just that  well known. We hope the budget provides some budgetary incentives to bring these tourist sites on a par with other popular tourist destinations of the country. Again, with certain other measures like converting Bodh Gaya into an international religious city with access without visa (based on passport of respective country) would go a long way in making it an international spiritual destination, the official said. There is still a shortage of budget hotel rooms. The government should make one, two, and three star hotels a priority, because hotel owners do not patronise building budget hotels as they think they wont make any money. The government should come forward and take initiative, the official said. REAL ESTATEThe realty sector has pinned high hopes on the budget with experts hoping to get industry status for housing sector. Sachin Chandra, honorary secretary, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI)Bihar, said: The housing sector has not yet been given the status of industry because of which finance from banks is costlier right now. Once it gets the industry status, loans would become cheaper as well as it will be easily available giving a boost to the realty sector. Also, he added, the government should increase the interest limit on housing loan exemption from the current Rs 2 lakh to either Rs 2.5 lakh or Rs 3 lakh. CIVIL AVIATIONBihar hopes the budget will allocate funds for the modernisation of Patna airport, which has seen a surge in air traffic over the past few years. Passenger flow at the city airport increased from 14.5% in 2014-15 to 32.4% in 2015-16 necessitating the much needed expansion of the airport. We are expecting the budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore to be used for the first phase of expansion work to be carried out with regard to the construction of the terminal building along with other operational requirements, said Patna airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria."

The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 251 and Rs 588 per quintal respectively on Tuesday. Around 25,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon the same day.An APMC official said that the harvest of the highly perishable kharif crop is in full swing and it is highly perishable. ""Summer crop is stored for around six months, but the shelf life or kharif onions are less than one month. Farmers have no option, but to sell the commodity at the prevailing market rates. Currently, there have been huge arrivals in the market and it is almost double in the range from 25,000 to 35,000 quintals a day,"" the official said.Daily arrival is around 15,000 quintal a day and now stands at 25,000 to 35,000 quintal a day. Onion prices have continued to drop even after the government extended 5% Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) subsidy for onion exporters up to March 31 because of the rise in arrival of onions. In the city's retail market, onions are being sold in the range of Rs 10 to Rs 15 a kg.Nanasaheb Patil, National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) director, said, ""The production cost to grow onions is around Rs 950 a quintal and farmers incur losses if they get prices below that. The government has extended a 5% subsidy for onion exporters up to March 31, but the average wholesale onion prices have continued to decline. The rise in arrival of the crop as compared to the demand has led to the drop in wholesale onion prices.""He added that though the government has extended subsidy benefits to onion exporters, the export is not taking place as needed. So, wholesale onion prices have continued to decline in the past one month.Patil said that the government needs to make efforts to increase onion exports through central agencies like NAFED and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC). ""Such agencies should be given targets of 5 lakh metric tonne each under the Price Stability Funds (PSF) to stabilise onion prices in domestic markets,"" he said."

(Hardeep Singh) The humble litti of Bihar-Jharkhand is on the roast for bon vivants from across the world. Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), the event manager of the Global Investors' Summit (GIS) in Ranchi, has roped in grub start-up GoLitti for the GIS food court in Hotwar on February 16-17 and the latter hopes to take the desi litti places with its trendy Chinese and Italian range of the traditional atta-sattu preparation. GoLitti - the state's lone branded litti joint that opened shop at Eastern Mall on Dangratoli Road only last month - is the brainchild of three friends, two of them BIT-Mesra alumni and the third a chartered accountant who left a plum job with Goldman Sachs in Bangalore to realise a big dream out of a small dough. Recalling his amazing culinary journey along with school friends and businessmen Kamal Bagla (23) and Sameer Kataruka (24), chartered accountant-turned-food manager Ankush Raj (23) told this newspaper how the inherent desire to make the homemade litti popular like the samosa or momo gave birth to GoLitti. ""A few years ago, when I moved to Delhi for my CA studies, I missed our litti-chokha, which is basically a super healthy baked dough ball stuffed with sattu (chickpea flour) and served with roasted and mashed potatoes, tomatoes, onion, chillies and spices. I shared my cravings with my Bridgeford School pals Kamal and Sameer one day, months later, and all of a sudden we had the idea,"" said Ankush. Raising a brand from a drawing room idea was no easy task. ""But, if there's will, there's a way. I quit Goldman Sachs in September last year and came to Ranchi. My businessmen friends, who are BBA graduates from BIT-Mesra, backed my dream while my mother Rita Sinha (49), a great cook, helped us rediscover litti in many avatars,"" Ankush said. GoLitti was born on January 15 this year, and is already a hot favourite with local residents and visitors alike, which includes representatives of the CII. ""We sell litti under two categories - evergreen and trendy. The first comprises the traditional baked variety along with Jain (no onion and garlic) and ghee-fried. The trendy menu boasts manchurian, schezwan, shashlik, corn, paneer, dahi, matar and mixed vegetable varieties among others,"" Ankush said, adding that officials of CII liked their preparations so much that the invite to join the GIS food court was almost immediate. And all this for just Rs 40 to Rs 95 a plate! ""We wanted to make litti loveable for all and we did it. Nothing pleases us more than when customers exclaim 'wow' after tasting our food. We will open a second joint in Ranchi in April. We are keeping fingers crossed and hoping that the summit will help us take GoLitti global,"" Ankush added."

590468007be9e04154df6795,"Luv, shuv and bheja fry on Valentine’s Day",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/mrsfunnybones/82758/,2017-02-12,"In the next two days, timelines on Facebook and the rocks on Bandstand will be packed with mushy lovers. The effects of demonetisation will vanish temporarily, as money will flow towards weary-looking red roses and wads of chewing gum that may not quite mask the smell of methi theplas or onion uttapams that passionate lovers have consumed for lunch.The tidal wave called Valentines Day is already heralding its arrival in a flurry of red hearts but does love really have anything to do with the heart or is it all just a chemical compulsion driven by the brain?Well, Helen Fisher, a biological anthropologist, believes love has three chemically driven stages  lust, attraction and attachment which I will attempt to break down with the help of my two slightly stereotypical protagonists  the girl next door and the lungi dancer who will soon fall for each other, hook, line and sinker.1. Hook a Fish: First, lets wave out to testosterone and estrogen. These two hormones are like your interfering buas who just want to make sure you reproduce and carry on the family line. Research states that it does not take more than 4 minutes to decide if you fancy each other. It has only 7% to do with what you say and 55% with body language.Which is why Romeo didnt really need to talk to Juliet, before he began spouting, O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!Or when at her cousin Montys sangeet, our girl next door spots a gentleman doing the lungi dance and yelps, He doth look like a yummy block of Chocolate Cornetto! And begins walking toward him. According to scientists at Trinity College, this is not the heart talking but the paracingulate cortex that has quickly assessed the gentlemans worthiness as a mate.2. Snort a Line: The lungi dancer and the girl next door soon land smack in the middle of evolutions great plan, the survival of the species. Surges of adrenaline have made their hearts race. An MRI would reveal that their brain areas associated with the production of dopamine are in overdrive.Considering dopamine is also what the brain releases when you take a hit of cocaine, our lovers are now literally getting addicted to each other. Love also makes serotonin in the brain dip to levels close to those found in people with obsessive-compulsive disorders, which is probably why the lungi dancer calls the girl next door a hundred times a day while she keeps doodling his initials all over her spreadsheets. The passionate lovers have fervent conversations, like on the sole occasion that our protagonist  who may have forgotten to eat intermittently but has always remembered to match her lingerie  finds she has made a blasphemous error and says, ErrBaby not today, my legs are not shaved. The lungi dancer growls, You are worried about hair? Right now I dont care if you had cactus sprouting on your thighs and Cerberus, the three-headed dog guarding my gateway to heaven.She sighs, You are such a poet but I think Cerberus guards the door to hell.He replies, If that is hell my darling, then like Prince Charles who famously said to Camilla that he wished to be reborn as a tampon, add me to that list so that I can also stay in hell forever!But even with a semi-functioning brain, she realises that it doesnt sound very hygienic so she says, Tampons have to be changed frequently otherwise the bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, gets into your bloodstream andHe interrupts, I cant understand anything you are saying but it sounds hot, come here!Now imagine two flowers frantically shaking in the wind like in our good old Hindi movies and you may get a clearer picture.3. Happily tied to the Sinker: If human beings were left in the throes of dopamine thrall then they would be incapable of focusing on anything else. So Mother Nature, who also wants parents to stick together and raise children, ensures that after 18 months to three years, all this hormonal upheaval stabilises and bonding chemicals come into play. Released during hugging as well as sex, oxytocin deepens feelings of attachment and security while vasopressin, also released during sex, is linked to behaviour that produces long-term, monogamous relationships.At this point, the girl next door, dressed in striped pajamas and flannel socks, is cribbing as she climbs into bed, Jeez! The babys projectile vomiting even beats that possessed girl in Exorcist. Once I used to smell of eau de toilette and now I guess I have to settle for eau de puke!The lungi dance champ, with a little more fat and a lot less hair, engrossed in his iPad murmurs, Hmm.. very good.She snaps, You are not listening to me, your iPad is more important than me right?He says Come on, dont be like that, as she continues to moan about how different it all was in the beginning.The lungi dancer attempts to lighten her mood, You know how much I love you baby? More than I love cockroaches, telemarketers and mummys butter chicken! and adds, So are you up for it? She giggles and five minutes later they are lying down together, doing what they both enjoy tremendously, watching the new season of Sherlock on Netflix.The cuddling helps their brains release a little oxytocin and who knows, after their upcoming Valentines dinner they just might add some vasopressin to their piggy bank as well.So now that we have figured out where love stems from, this Valentines Day instead of sending mundane heart-shaped candy boxes emblazoned with I love you, how about celebrating love in its truest sense by presenting your beloved with some bheja fry from Mohammed Ali Road with a note that says, Roses are red, violets are blue, this is the state of my brain because I am chemically addicted to you."
5904677d7be9e04154df66b7,Leafing through a salad book,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/fifty-shades-green/leafing-through-a-salad-book/,2017-02-13,"On a cold blistery day in Delhi, my nieces 2-year-old son is entertaining himself by looking at pictures in my salad book and identifying the vegetables. About nine thousand miles away in USA, my 22-year-old son has come up trumps after poring over my salad book and zeroing in on the salad for his next meal.The two boys are a generation and many continents apart and yet, this innocuous salad book is their constant tasteful companion, albeit for different reasons. The toddlers mother has bought him a whole slew of baby books featuring fruits and veggies but the little guy invariably picks up my salad book from his moms kitchen and sits down for his daily erudition. My older son, The Health Nut, while living the dolce vida in The Big Apple, is very conscious of his calorie intake like a lot of his generation and hence the salad book is whipped out every now and then.Gone are the days when salads were looked upon as slightly better than a bitter pill to swallow. No one ever tossed a salad for a midday meal or sat in front of the TV with a big bowl of healthy luscious leaves and veggies. And no one thought of salads as comfort foods!The current generation is different. Weaned on a diet of political correctness and nutritional knowledge, they are not comfortable with the ghee-cures-all attitude of the older generations. Salads have made their way into their lexicon along with words like YOLO and hashtag.With the temperature dipping in many parts of the country, when someone mentions comfort food, a lot of young gourmands think beyond steaming hot bowls of soup or mac-&-cheese. While a salad a few years back was not considered comfort food material, times are changing. A big dinner-size salad packed with winter fruits and veggies and delicious toppings can help fuel you through chilly, foggy days. Better still, it can do so without making you feel sluggish and weighed down.With the festive season almost over and done with, February is a time to enjoy the bounty of winter foods and markets filled with colorful winter produce. I love browsing the aisles of the supermarket looking at all the vibrant racks of fresh produce. The brilliance of the malta orange, the plumpness of scarlet strawberries, dewy fresh local berries, and verdant dark greens jostle in a cacophony of color on the grocery shelves. Light summer herbs are replaced by collards, mustard greens, spinach, brussel sprouts and my personal favorite, kale.The chill in winter means that there is a craving for food that is filling. For salad eaters like me, this means changing the typical salad to include hearty grains, bright citrus fruits, nuts, root vegetables and hardy winter greens.So here I am on a Saturday morning at our local supermarket trying to pick out the freshest veggies and fruits for a salad for dinner. On the menu tonight are quiches: a sundried tomato black olive quiche and a bacon quiche. I think a fruity salad would go well with the quiches. The malta oranges call out to me with their flaming bright colors. I pick up some green olives and red onions, a block of spicy pepper gouda cheese and I am all set for my familys favorite Triple-O salad (recipe below).To me, the Triple-O salad is an ideal winter salad. It is light and yet has the depth of flavor with its seasonal notes to stand up to hearty winter dishes. Its simple to make with its three to four ingredients, and can be varied based on your preferences or what you have at home.Just before I wind up my shopping, I pick up a bunch of luscious strawberries and a packet of baby spinach. This along with some pasta and stone-ground bread will make for a lovely lunch tomorrow.Back home, as I am walking in, my son calls in from NYC. Hey mom, I have chicken leftovers. Can you suggest a quick salad? I look at the oranges peeking out of my grocery bag, think about the plummeting temperatures in US and decide its time to have a Triple-O date in two cities. Take down this salad, I say to him crisply, as I start unpacking my groceries.TRIPLE-O SALAD:Ingredients:Green or black Olives: 12  15 (pitted)Red onion: 1 small , sliced into thin ringsOranges: 2 large, cut into  inch slices or sectionsCheese : any pepper or spicy cheese (optional)Dressing:1 tbsp olive oilJuice of 1-2 lemonsSalt and pepper (to taste)Method: Start by peeling the oranges, removing the seeds and cutting into neat slices and set aside. Cut the onion into thin onion rings. A trick I learnt a few years ago was to dunk the onions into boiling water for about 10-15 seconds, removing them and rinsing under cold water. This removes the pungency of the onion. Whisk together the oil, lemon juice and salt and pepper. Place the oranges in a plate, add the olives and red onions, and dribble the dressing on the top. You can add the cheese to the salad from the top or arrange it like I do, around the salad edges."

Harish Rao has directed the officials of the Marketing Department to complete the construction of 130 godowns across the State by March-end by getting funds from the Centre.Out of the construction of 330 godowns taken up with the grant given under Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (RKVY) by the Centre, 200 godowns were completed and work on the remaining 130 was in progress. The Centre had sanctioned Rs. 264 crore grant for the purpose and had already released half of it, Rs. 132 crore.At a review meeting held here on Monday, the Minister directed the officials to send the utilisation certificates to the Centre and pursue the release of the remaining half of the grant of Rs. 132 crore. The Minister also cleared construction of eight godowns in alternative sites as the sites selected initially were under dispute.Stating that production of crops, particularly that of paddy, was expected to increase significantly this Rabi season, Mr. Harish Rao said all arrangement to handle the arrivals at market yards, including the storage facility in godowns, had to be in place by the time harvesting was taken up.The Minister said it was being estimated that paddy production would be around 28 to 30 lakh tonnes this Rabi season besides, the ongoing arrivals of redgram, bengalgram, groundnut, cotton, chilli, turmeric, onion and other crops. He discussed the problems being faced by the farming community and the prices they were getting for their produce.Asking the officials to monitor prices in the neighbouring states constantly, the Minister said they should be ready for intervention whenever the prices of crops would go down below the support price. The new Marketing Act would be made in the budget session of the Assembly, he noted. Director of Marketing G. Lakshmi Bai and others attended."

It takes about Rs 950 to produce a quintal of onions.Lasalgaon, the largest onion market in the country , is witnessing a glut. It is receiving 40,000 quintals of red onions daily against an average 12,000-15,000 quintals every day . The bumper crop has resulted in traders demanding more railway wagons to transport onions to other parts of the state and country.On Monday too, the rate was ranging from Rs 330 to Rs 600, depending on the quality and size of the crop. At the moment, stocks enough for four days' business are piled up at Lasalgaon and will require at least 40 rakes to transport. The traders have got only get 15 wagons so far.""There has been a close to four times jump in the amount of crop that comes to the market yard.But there has not been any increase in the transportation facilities despite writing to the government,"" said Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC. If the traders were to use road transport, they would require 200 trucks per day , as they can carry only 20 tonnes each. They are also more expensive than the railway wagons.The situation outside the farmers bringing truckloads of produce and not finding even a place to park.""The shelf life of these red onions is one month and currently, it is peak harvest season.Farmers are being forced to accept whatever price as the shelf life is so low and they cannot afford storage costs,"" said an APMC official.This year, the onion crop has been unrewarding for farmers because of high production.Huge losses were also reported due to the four-day traders' strike at Lasalgaon in August 2016.The summer onion crop, whose season ended in October, also fetched low prices. Lack of proper storage facilities and a skewed supply-demand ratio meant that farmers recorded a cumulative loss of 20 lakh tonnes of the summer crop.The state decision to give Rs 100 per quintal to farmers hasn't worked out yet since the Centre, supposed to foot half the bill, has not approved the scheme."

What can be more shameful than befriending those who tried to murder one's father?... They cannot be pardoned.""Kya raajneeti itni gir gayi hai ke kursi ke moh mein iss prakaar ke kaand kiye jaaye (has politics degraded to such an extent that for the love of power such a thing would be done)?""Recalling the incident, Modi said, ""Fed up of attacks by Mulayam Singh as Leader of the Opposition in Vidhan Parishad, Congress got shots fired at him on March 4, 1984 but he scraped through...I want to tell Akhilesh that he should have remembered this incident before sitting in the lap of Congress.""He went on to add, ""Akhileshji ko abhi anubhav kum hain, Congress wale kitne chatur hain inko samajh nahi aata...Mulayam ji ko toh pata tha (Akhilesh has less experience.

Though BSP ruled in Uttar Pradesh and made some mistakes, my respect for her is intact"".This had prompted BJP to dub BSP as a hidden partner of Congress-Samajwadi Party.""They cannot win this race as BJP, which is running on two legs, will pip them to the post,"" Modi told the rally today.On the state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said the abbreviation of UP may be read as ""up"", but everything is ""down"" in the state.""The only thing up in UP is corruption, law and order, riots, atrocities on women, unemployment, poverty, mortality rate of mother and child, migration...and Akhilesh says 'kaam bolta hai' (work speaks)...it is not kaam but karname (misdeeds) which are speaking for him,"" Modi said.Claiming that the Centre has taken important steps for the welfare of farmers, the Prime Minister said his party has promised in its manifesto that onion and potato will be bought at Minimum Support Price and will not allow the potato growers to die.""BJP manifesto promises loan waiver of small farmers...As an MP from the state, I promise that it will be my responsibility that this promise is fulfilled in the first meeting of the BJP government,"" said Modi, who represents Varanasi constituency in the Lok Sabha.Addressing the gathering in this region having a large number of potato growers, Modi said in the last (Lok Sabha) elections the ""bahu"" (Dimple Yadav) of Samajwadi Party had promised to set up chips-making unit here which did not come through, but she won the poll.""Will you not seek a reply from her or not,"" the Prime Minister asked in his typical question-answer style of establishing direct rapport with the public.""The SP government (in UP) is anti-poor,"" he said, adding that while he himself as no home or vehicle of his own, SP leaders have large fleets of vehicles.""What kind of samajwad (socialism) is this? It is nothing but betrayal of poor. Scams are being reported even in orphanages in UP,"" Modi said.He contended that central assistance for foodgrains was not reaching the poor in UP as the state government was not interested in accepting it.He also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi saying, ""the Congress leader seeking vote from you is not aware that potato is grown in the field and not in factory...He (Rahul) took out a kisan yatra and talked about setting up potato factory.""Claiming that people of the country have hailed note ban, he said this is proved by BJP's victories in Panchayat polls in Odisha, Municipal elections in Chandigarh and Gujarat and Vidhan Parishad poll in UP.Congratulating ISRO scientists, he said they have hit a century by launching a record 104 satellites at one go.Modi also cited the decision of his government to slash prices for coronary stents for heart patients.""The stents will be sold at Rs 8,000 against Rs 45,000 earlier. Congress had failed to revise the prices for years,"" he said.Modi said opposition played all types of games in the last three months raking up issues like demonetisation and surgical strike.Referring to anomalies in recruitments in UP, Modi said police recruitment in Uttar Pradesh is driven by caste-based decisions.""We have removed interview requirement from the recruitment process in Class III and Class IV categories in central government. Around one lakh people were recruited in Railways without an interview,"" he said.There are plans for recruitment in BSF and CISF which will be done in a fair and honest manner to give jobs to the deserving candidates, Modi added.Promising to continue the fight against black money and corruption, he appealed to people of Kannuj to vote for BJP on February 19 in the third phase of polling."

The market is the hub for Bellary and small onions trade in the region and caters to retail traders from Tiruchi and several other nearby districts.It largely functions on Sub-Jail Road outside Gandhi Market and many traders process the onion on roadsides. Over 75 shops line up the narrow Sub Jail Road so much so that the road remained closed for traffic for several decades before the former City Police Commissioner Karuna Sagar took steps to reopen it for traffic in August 2009.Yet, most of the traders continue to operate on the roadsides and sacks of onion could be seen lined up along the road.Loading and unloading of onions take place right on the road. Traffic congestion is perennial on Sub-jail Road, Thanjavur Road and Vellamandi Road intersections near the market. Traffic hold-ups occur at these intersections often bringing the traffic to a standstill around the market.Meanwhile, the Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association has taken up the initiative to build their own market complex at Ariyamangalam off Tiruchi-Chennai Bypass Road.The complex is being built at a site purchased by the association in the early 90s. One hundred shops with spacious access to roads for lorries are being built.According to A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association, nearly 75 per cent of the work has been completed. We took up the project at an estimate of about Rs. 7 crore but we are facing a funds crunch so that the work has slowed down. Once we mobilise the required funds, the project will be completed soon, he said.The shops would be owned by about 78 traders who are members of the association. The association has taken up the construction on their behalf. The complex has been named Commercial Complex for All Perishable Vegetables and Fruits. As there are 100 shops at the complex, we will allot some of the shops to traders of other vegetables or perishable products, he said.The complex would have all necessary amenities and infrastructure for traders, public and farmers visiting the market. The market includes rest rooms for traders and farmers. We have provided a spacious two-wheeler parking lot, toilets and a lorry weighing machine inside the complex, he said.Once the complex is ready, onion wholesale traders would go there. The market is close to Gandhi Market and right on the highway for easy accessibility, he said. Once the market is ready, the need for onion traders to move to Kallikudi, about 15 km away from the city, would be averted."

While turmeric prices are showing signs of falling despite the harvest season setting in, prices of small and big onions have risen by 30% in the last two weeks. Farmers attribute the change in prices to the fall in quality of the turmeric yield and drop in the quantity of the small onion yield.Turmeric farmers in Erode say the acreage under full-fledged cultivation of the spice had fallen from 10,000 hectares in 2015-'16 to less than 7,000 hectares in 2016 because of the complete failure of the southwest and northeast monsoons. The lack of rainfall and moisture led to the yield of the crop falling by almost 50%, says P K Deivasigamani, secretary of the Turmeric Farmers Association of India.The present situation would naturally create a short supply of turmeric in the market thereby fall in price of the spice. In Perundurai wholesale market, the price of turmeric on Tuesday fell from Rs 8,500 to Rs 8,000 per quintal. ""Good quality turmeric coming in from Mysore is still selling at Rs 8,500 and Rs 8,700 a quintal in Erode market,"" says general secretary of the Federation of All Trade and Industries' Association, Erode, V K Rajamanickam.""However, the prices are dropping in most markets because they are being flooded with stored turmeric harvested as long as two years ago. Their quality is not good,"" he said.The turmeric harvest season in the western region, especially in Erode which is considered as one of the largest turmeric producing districts in the country, begins immediately post-Pongal. However, this year due to the drought that prevailed throughout 2016, the harvest was postponed by most farmers.""There are a lot of farmers who despite the drought sowed turmeric in at least half their land. But they are unable to harvest it because the crop has not even matured and has even begun drying up. So they can't cut it,"" says Raja Manickam. ""The yield is very low,"" he adds.Agriculture marketing experts believe that the drop in cultivation and yield of turmeric in Erode will lead to the turmeric yield in Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra setting the price trend for the spice.""Usually the yield and prices in Erode set the trend for turmeric pricing across the country, but this year since the rain was better in Maharashtra and central India leading to their yield being better, they would become the bigger market players. Their produce will even start flowing into western region markets,"" says Rajamanickam.On the other hand, shoppers saw the prices of both small and big onions go up by almost 30%. ""The price of small onions, which were around Rs 18 to Rs 20/kg around 10 days ago at Raja Street vegetable market, went up to Rs 30 in Uzhavar Sandhais and all retail shops,"" said a housewife in R S Puram, S Saraswathi. ""The price of big onions too which were around Rs 15/kg went up to Rs 20 last week,"" she said.Onion wholesalers say the prices went up because the supply had begun falling over the past 10 days or so. ""Usually 3,000 sacks of small onion are unloaded at MGR Market every day, but the number has fallen to 2,000 sacks. So farmers have begun charging Rs 15 to Rs 18/ kg as the wholesale rate, so the prices have gone up in the retail market,"" said D Sivaraj, a wholesaler at T K Market."

Farmers are staging road blockades in the district demanding better prices. The demand was also hit by the demonetisation. If I sold my crop today, I would get only Rs 60,000, Dongare had earlier said.Sule said the burnt onions will be presented to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray.According to traders, onion prices fell to around Rs 100-150 per quintal at some places for past several days and farmers were not recovering even the input costs.The APMC centres in the district, including those at Mungse and Zodge, have stopped auctions of onion, as it is not possible to send the crop to markets across the country due to shortage of railway wagons, the traders had said.NCPs women state chief Chitra Wagh, MLC from Nashik Jayawant Jadhav and some local leaders were present during Sules public meetings.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Farmers have suffered the most because of demonetisation. They will teach the party [BJP] a fitting lesson this time, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant.Districts where elections will be held on Thursday include Jalgaon, Ahmednagar, Aurangabad, Jalna, Parbhani, Hingoli, Beed, Nanded, Osmanabad, Latur, Buldhana, Yavatmal, Wardha, Chandrapur and Gadchiroli. Counting is on February 23.Both Opposition parties and their top leaders have been campaigning in Marathwada and Vidarbha. For Congress heavyweights like State party chief Ashok Chavan, former Chief Minister Vilasrao Deshmukhs son Amit Deshmukh and Leader of Opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe-Patil hope to maintain their dominance in their respective districts of Nanded, Latur and Ahmednagar. NCP leaders like Dhananjay Munde and Supriya Sule have been campaigning in Beed and Marathwada respectively, where ZP elections will be held.For the BJP, which stands fourth in terms of its presence in ZPs, the elections are of major importance to achieve its dream if a Congress-free State. The party had allotted districts to a State minister for managing the campaign, and has presented Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis as its star campaigner with development as its agenda. The civic polls are important to leaders like Pankaja Munde and State party chief Raosaheb Danve in their home districts of Beed and Jalna respectively.The Shiv Sena, meanwhile, has focussed on Mumbai and Thane, leaving rest of the State to local leaders.The NCPs Nawab Malik said the party is aiming at big wins in the first phase, and continue the trend in the remaining phases. We are confident due to the tremendous response we have received. We can surely claim that the party will emerge victorious.Demonetisation, falling prices of onion and tur daal and the governments inability to offer minimum support price to farmers were highlighted by the Opposition during the camapign.On election eve, a group claiming to be organisers of the silent Maratha rallies held a press conference asking people to boycott the BJP. Rajendra Kondhare, a key organiser of the silent rallies, said some people had indulged in a publicity stunt. The BJP released a statement saying it stands firmly with the Maratha community in its demand for reservation.BJP spokesperson Shweta Shalini on Wednesday wrote to the State Election Commission (SEC) asking for a ban on the Saamana . SEC bans newspapers from publishing material that will influence voters 48 hours prior to an election. While all parties have adhered to the stricture, the Saamana, which is the mouthpiece of the Sena, has violated it. We have requested a ban on its printing on February 16, 20 and 21, she said.Elections will be held for 2,567 seats and 11,989 candidates will be contesting. Of the total, 855 seats are in 15 ZPs and will be contested by 4,289 candidates. In panchayat samitis, 7,700 candidates will be contesting 1,712 seats.

The farmers are worried over their future.In addition, some of the cattle have already been sent to abattoir while the youngsters have left the villages in search of better living.On an average, the taluk receives 806.3 mm annual rainfall. However, this year, the taluk received only 631.8 mm rainfall. Of the 29 water bodies, the water-level has reached rock bottom in all the ponds except at that of Doddakere. With the intense heat, the plants are expected to go dry in the month of March and April.Although the farmers had harvested paddy, jowar, maize, ragi and groundnut during monsoon, they could not reap the benefit of the harvest. During the Rabi season, the farmers had sown jowar, chickpea, horse gram on 5,823-hectare land. However, the crops have already been lost on 1,635 hectare. The farmers have lost onion and green chilly crops at Ajjampura and Shivani while in Lingadahalli hobli, the farmers have lost the potato, green peas and vegetable crops owing to the drought.Commercial crops like arecanut have also been damaged at Doranalu and Lingadahalli hobli. An arecanut tree requires 20 litres of water per day. With drought, even after sinking a borewell 800-foot deep, we do not get water. In such a scenario, how do we nurture the plants. By pledging the gold and silver ornaments in the bank, we are hiring water tankers to supply water to the crops, said farmers.Officials said 3,000 farmers have registered their names under the Fasal Bima Yojana for compensation for loss of crops.Tahsildar J P Manje Gowda said, Crops across 15,000 hectares of land crops have been damaged during monsoon. A report on the loss of crops has been submitted to the state government through the deputy commissioner. The loss of crops during the Rabi season is being assessed jointly by the Horticulture, Agriculture and Revenue Department officials."

Dilip Kagda A day after her visit to Nashik, Sule tweeted about the destruction of standing crop of onions by farmers due to low prices. Dilip KagdaOnion prices have become a political issue in the wake of Nashik local body elections. A day after NCP MP Supriya Sule raked up the issue of low onion prices, the Shiv Sena also has followed suit. Hovering between Rs 4 and 5 per kg, onion growers in Nashik have been complaining of losses over the last two years. Despite a steady increase in export, onion prices have remained low. With the late Kharif onion peaking in the markets, chances of any price correction appear dim in the days to come. In view of the low prices, the Central government has also increased the window to avail export subsidy. In view of the bumper arrival of onions, there has been no price corrections till date.Watch what else is making news:A day after her visit to Nashik, Sule tweeted about the destruction of standing crop of onions by farmers due to low prices. Sules tweet comes at a time when NCP is trying to keep control of the Nashik Zilla Parishad. The long incarceration of the former leader Chhagan Bhujbal over alleged charges of corruption has weakened the party in Nashik. Both Shiv Sena and BJP are trying hard to wrestle the local body from NCP.Nashiks rural areas have been worst hit due to demonetisation with onion sowing taking a dip in need for cash. Onion being a cash and labour intensive crop, sowing for the all-important Rabi onion has been lesser than expected. Low price realisation has weaned off some of the farmers away from onion to crops like corn. Unrest among its members had also resulted in Swabhimani Shetkari leader MP Raju Shetti to announce support for Shiv Sena in the local body elections. Santosh Gorade district youth president of the outfit said that a large number of party functionaries were on the verge of resigning in March. The state government has not done anything to help us. As onion growers we could not be blind to the pains of the growers and yet remain mute, he said. Shettis announcement of support toShiv Sena, Gorade said helped them change their mind. The BJP will not be able to make any effect in the rural areas, people are against them, he said. Jaydutt Holkar, the chairman of Lasalgaon market committee has recently joined Shiv Sena, while Nanasaheb Patil a director of the committee had joined BJP.

On enquiring with the store owner, he explained how it was used as a dipping sauce with oil and spread on flat bread but also mentioned it pairs well with red meat.This seasoning can be found in several grocery stores and bazaars in the region, it can be made very easily at home as well. Fragrant and tangy, this special ingredient adds that extra dash to any dish, be it meat, fish or vegetables.CaptionArmed with this new discovery, I returned home to Bengaluru and decided to give it a try with red meat. I added it to lamb dishes back at the restaurant and was amazed at the results I got, especially with the Lamb Lasagna where the Zaatar flavour comes out very subtly amongst the strong flavour of the meat and cheese. The dish is a huge hit with the patrons and this is definitely an ingredient that I would like to experiment with, for several other dishes.Ingredients Unsalted Butter - 4 tbsp All-purpose Flour - 3 tbsp Salt Garlic - 4 cloves minced Onion - 2 tbsp chopped Milk - 1 cup Chicken Broth - 1 cup Mozarella Cheese - 1/2 cup grated Sharp Cheddar Cheese - 1/2 cup grated Minced Lamb - 200 g Zaatar - 2 tsp Leeks - 1 stalk chopped fine Celery - 1 stalk chopped fine Ground Black Pepper Parmesan Cheese - 1 tbsp grated Lasagna Sheets - 6 fresh or pre-cooked Olive Oil - 2 tbspMethod: Melt the the butter in a saucepan over medium heat.

We have the starchier and blander versions but in other countries there are the more pungent recipes from vegetables, beans and greens. They are known to contribute to the gut-health and many people live by them. Hot and biting, these foods can serve well as substitutes for the highly-salted pickles. They can be served as sides or appetisers.Kimchi (Korea)This is mostly made of cabbage, which has to be left to ferment for a week. The chopped leaves are mixed with fish sauce, scallions and garlic and kept in a cool air-tight container. You may need to lose the cap once in a while to let the gases that form escape. Kimchi can be used as a sauce for other veg and seafood preparations. You can get it in Korean and Chinese restaurants such as Hae Kum Gang in Ashok Nagar, Arirang in Kamanahalli and Shiro in UB City.Gundruk (Nepal)Greens such as leaves of either mustard or raddish are shredded and left in earthenware containers. The blackish mushy gundruk is served as a side dish, an appetiser and even mixed with soups. To prepare as soup, the leaves are friend along with thinly sliced onions, tomatoes and the usual Indian spices like turmeric. You could try it at Bameys Resto Cafe in Kormangala.Kombucha (Japan)It is a fermented tea drink and made using SCOBY, which is symbiotic colony of bacteria and yeast. This is a mildly sweet drink with a bit of fizz. There is a miniscule percentage (single digit) of alcohol and unless you glug down many litres of it, you wont get a high. This drink is credited with curing everything from diabetes and depression to AIDs and cancer, but these claims are unproven. Get it at Adi Naturals in JP Nagar, Era Organics in Sanjaynagar or Green Channel in Ali Asker Road.Sauerkraut (China, Russia)This is a blander form of pickled cabbage made with carroway seeds and salt. Few people put onion too with this mixture, but this depends on how strong you would like the flavour to be. This is recommended for the lactose-intolerant to get their dose of good bacteria for gut health. Served at Soo Ra Sang, behind Leela Palace.Natto (Japan)It is made from soybeans. This is strong smelling and was earlier made by storing the beans in a haystack. The method of preparation has changed and these are now mass-produced, available in tin cans like baked beans. This is said to be high in fiber, Vitamin K and C and minerals. Nato is cooked with soya sauce and served with boiled rice. Available at Harima on Residency Road."

""There is one client on Mayfair Road who has ordered lachha paan worth Rs 150 at least 25 times in a month!""

Once looked down upon as a poor man's food, the fruit, which is now being hailed as the new vegan superfood , is making its way into everything from biryanis to burgers.From the unripe pods to seeds and the ripe fruit, all forms of the bumpy green fruit with a golden heart is making its way to Indian meals. Malayalis use it to make everything from vegetable dishes to payasams, for Bengalis, it is the ""gaach patha"" or ""mutton that grows on the tree"". In the West, the chewy pods are fast becoming a substitute for meat while, in India, people are using it to replace carbohydrates.Jackfruit is high in dietary fibre, is a rich source of vitamin C, a powerful antioxidant, and is packed with phytonutrients, which may reduce the risk of many cancers, says Meenakshi Bajaj, dietician, Tamil Nadu Government Multi Super Speciality Hospital.""Vitamin C helps in the absorption of iron,"" she says. The fruit is also a rich source of riboflavin, which helps to heal oral ulcers, and the Vitamin A in it prevents macular degeneration of the eye. ""It is also an important source of magnesium so it further helps in the absorption of calcium, and fights osteoporosis."" It is these health benefits that people abroad are discovering says Regi Mathew, mentor and director of Kappa Chakka Kandhari, a `neo'stalgic gourmet company. Praveen Anand, executive chef at ITC hotels, says it is being used extensively in their hotels. ""In north India, we have kathal (jackfruit) ki biriyani, as well as kormas, and kebabs made of it,"" he says.The fruit is said to be among the top food trends of 2017. ""This January, at the Fancy Food Show in the US, the star ingredient was jackfruit,"" says restaurateur M Mahadevan, adding that it is used as a meat replacer in restaurants in New York and San Francisco.""The young fruit is considered a good replace ment for pulled pork and is served on burgers along with caramelised onion chutney ,"" says Mahadevan. He is planning to stock jackfruit chips and jams in Hot Breads stores there.Entrepreneurs have been quick to spot the marketing potential. Keralite James Joseph gave up a flourishing career with Microsoft to launch Jackfruit365 in 2013. ""I have always wondered why jackfruit doesn't feature on the menu in five-star hotels,"" says Joseph, adding that he realised it was because the fruit was `too sticky, smelly and seasonal'. So he came up with the idea of selling freeze-dried jackfruit.""The ripe fruit can be used to make pies and panna cotta, while the unripe pods can replace meat or tofu,"" says Joseph. After Jackfruit365 became a 100% diabetic diet company , they sell only unripe fruit online. ""The dried, sliced jackfruit can also be powdered and the flour added to idli or dosa batter and phulkas,"" says Joseph.Studies have revealed consumption of unripe jackfruit can help fight high blood sugar level. Bajaj stresses that ripe pods are not good for diabetics. ""The ripe fruit has a glycemic index (GI) of 63, while the unripe pod has a GI of only 52,"" she says.""Since it fills you up it helps cut down on rice and wheat."""

(Express Photo by Abhinav Saha) Red Fort in New Delhi. (Express Photo by Abhinav Saha)A new study of global pollution shows that Indias air is the worst in the world (www.stateofglobalair. org/data). Masked Delhiites, caught in a relentless shroud of smog, have no choice but to inhale copious amounts of particulate matter. Somewhere, a quiet realisation has sunk in that the way we live is not safe. This awareness has led to a shift, with the thinking urban citizen attempting to make substantial changes to his own environment.Since 2015, we have planned over 250 balconies, terraces and small garden patches in the NCR, says Kapil Mandavewala, 36, proprietor of Edible Routes, a specialised garden solution company. They offer quite a range  from vegetables to oxygen-generating plants, and creepers. Based on a large patch of land in Ghitorni, originally an artists collective where Vivan Sundaram has his studio and Bharti Kher is a co-owner, a walk through the garden is full of revelations on design and natural ecosystems: cabbages and broccoli grow together in chaos while tomatoes are surrounded by fragrant basil.This is called companion gardening. The basil repels insects naturally and increases the tomato yield, explains Mandavewala. While his clients in highrises prefer to grow herbs, he has encouraged some of them to try growing patches of cabbage, onion and garlic as well. There are interesting looking flower pots that one is unlikely to spot elsewhere, with white pipes embedded in the mud. Mandavewala explains that the biggest quandary of the apartment dweller, who works and travels, is not being around enough to water the plants.Once you top these pipes with water, the pot can go for a month without watering as the moisture releases into the soil slowly, he says. Edible Routes has pots with a nutritive mix of mud and manure made with a machine bought from a design student in Ahmedabad.After returning with a science degree from the US in 2008, Mandavewala began tilling his familys 22-acre farm in Gujarat and supplying vegetables to a few families in Jamnagar. A chance invitation from an NGO, Manzil, for a workshop on urban gardening led him to set up shop in Delhi in 2014. He took a 14-day course on permaculture, a system of agricultural and social design principles implemented by learning from nature. Applying it to an urban context came with its own challenges: the way light falls in a highrise, in a vertical slant, may not be conducive to all vegetables and oxygen-generating plants.A special focus needs to be given to seepage and drainage of water. It took me a while to understand urban spaces and explain to the clients as well that every space is capable of cultivating something, says Mandavewala. For one home, he introduced Malabar spinach called poe saag as a vine, a popular variation of spinach down south but rarely grown in Delhi. In another, a family grew tori along their border walls.The clients, meanwhile, are mostly enchanted by their gardens. The joy of growing and cultivating your own food, knowing what youre consuming, is something else, says Mandavewala, adding that many of them begin with being terrified at the idea of taking care of several plants. One of the ironies of urban India is that farm land is acquired by people who dont know how to farm; the ones who know want a job in the city, in an office.A consultation with Edible Routes can cost anywhere between Rs 5,000 and Rs 1 lakh, depending on the material cost, area and charges for executing the project.

The farmers have had a bumper crop this year, in comparison to the last three years.The provision for a new rake comes after the meeting between the and district administration of railway officials, where the former demanded for more rakes to supply onions.Unlike the existing system where all the onion laden goods trains head to Fatuha (Fatwa) junction in Bihar for unloading, the harvest will now be taken to Sitapur, Ranipatra, Dankuni and Malda. The rakes usually carry onion from Niphad, Kherwadi, Manmad, Lasalgaon, Dhule, Chalisgaon, Nandgaon and Nashik.An official of the Bhusawal Division of Central Railways said that it has been decided that the number of rakes to carry onions will only be four from now.""We will have the rakes as ordered by the minister, but it is likely that if the turnaround time takes longer, then the situation will be difficult,"" a railway official said.The onion merchants have welcome the move of the Central Railways. An onion merchant, Sohanlal Bhandari said, ""Since the Railways are now ready to take the onions to other destinations, we have decided to book the goods for different places instead of just focussing on Fatuha.""The new rake will enhance the carrying capacity of the onions by 30%."

What's more, it may also be sweeter and better than the current crop.The Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) has developed a new onion variety called 'multiplier onion variety,' which would make this possible.It is presently undergoing tests at multiple locations in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat to evaluate its performance in different weather conditions. Scientists said initial findings of the tests are positive and have achieved the desired results so far.They added that the variety is expected to be released nationwide in 2019.Project leader Amar Jeet Gupta of DOGR told TOI, ""There is no special variety of onion for south Indian dishes that has been released at the national level. So far, farmers of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh are cultivating varieties developed by Tamil Nadu Agriculture University (TNAU). But the yield of these varieties is limited. Hence, we decided to develop the special variety, which can be recommended at national-level for other states farmers to grow it.""The variety, named DOGR-1549-Agg, is the first multiplier onion genotype registered with the ICAR-NBPGR (National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources) in New Delhi.Commenting on the variety's strength, Gupta said, ""It matures early and is suitable for both Kharif (July-October) and Rabi (October-March) seasons. It has an average yield potential of 22 tonnes to 24 tonnes per hectare."" Gupta added that the variety has six small bulbs per cluster.Presently, farmers in South India are growing TNAU-developed onion variety called CO(On)5, which can grow only in Rabi season and has a yield capacity of 18.9 tonnes per hectare. Each cluster of this variety produces three to five bulbs, Gupta said.TNAU's horticulture department head T Saraswati told TOI, ""This is a positive development for growers as they can get high harvest. Secondly, if this variety is released nationally, states other than the southern ones can also grow it.""When specifically asked about the taste of the newly-developed variety, Gupta said, ""Total Soluble Solids (TSS) is a crucial factor as it defines sugar percentage in the onion. The TSS of CO(On)5 is around 12%, whereas TSS in our variety is between 16% and 22%. Hence, it will be suitable for South Indian dishes."""

The average price farmers have fetched for a quintal has been Rs 450.At the Lasalgaon APMC , the biggest market yard for onions in the country, the average price for a quintal has been Rs 740 in February 2016, when the state was reeling under a severe drought. Cost of production for a quintal is Rs 950. Prices were the highest in 2013, with farmers fetching Rs 1,424 a quintal.Officials said the dip in price is due to bumper production in the state. Lack of storage and processing infrastructure to increase the shelf life of the produce has left farmers at the mercy of traders, who are consistently quoting low prices. Some farmers have set their onions on fire, as they were not even getting the basic input cost.Lasalgaon was getting 30,000-35,000 quintals of red onions every day in February, as against the average 12,000. The bumper production resulted in traders demanding more railway wagons to transport onions to other parts of the state and country .""The shelf life of onions is a month; there is so much stock at the market yard, which will take 20 days to clear if we get adequate transport and the stock keeps increasing every day ,"" said a market committee official.They want 40 wagons to transport onions, but they are getting 15-18 wagons.The railways agreed to give more wagons to transport the onions, but this being the peak of the harvest, the inflow of produce is not slowing down. Officials hope that in March the produce will slow down and prices will stablise, giving relief to the farmers, who have made an accumulated loss of Rs 200 crore.Initially, prices were affected due to demonetisation, and they did not pick up till the December-end; since January , heavy inflow and skewed demand and supply ratio led to the dip in price."

The association said that under such circumstances, they are unable to repay loan and manage their homes.

How will farmers repay loan and how will they ensure education of their children?

On the contrary, prices of onions and vegetables crashed and the farmers incurred heavy losses. Wheat, pulses and even onions were imported by the government in past two years.

Borade said, ""The government needs to ensure minimum support price (MSP) for onions and other crops. But it did not do this. Prices of various crops and vegetables were badly affected after demonetisation. The market is yet to pick up even after three months since the demonetisation drive.

The Act makes it mandatory for farmers to sell their produce only to the licensed merchants at the mandis of Agricultural Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs) by paying the commission and other charges.Denotification of fruits and vegetables, according to the Centre, will put an end to a chain of commission agents between the farmers and the consumers, creating a win-win situation for both. Union Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made a strong pitch for the denotification and promoting contract farming in his 2017-18 Budget presented recently.But the Karnataka government holds a different view. We have no intention to denotify perishables (from the Act). Even now the farmers are free to sell their produce directly to consumers anywhere, including APMC yards. Moreover, the government will not be in a position to intervene and provide justice to the farmers if the traders refuse to pay judicious price, Additional Secretary to Co-operation department (APMC reforms) R Manoj said.As per the Department of Agriculture Marketing, cost to the supply chain due to handling of fruits and vegetables at APMCs is only 6% of the total cost of the produce. Cost of supply chain include 5% commission and 1% hamali and other handling cost. This cost will be significantly higher in unorganised sector due to involvement of middlemen at multiple levels.Interestingly, the ruling Congress has refused to denotify perishables despite directions from the party vice president Rahul Gandhi to all the Congress-ruled state governments in 2014. Instead, the Karnataka government exempted levy of market fee on farmers (1.5% on fruits and 1% on vegetables) and made a provision for retail sales at APMC yards.Chairman of Food Processing Committee of Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce and Industries Bharat Shah said APMCs help farmers get competitive price to their produce due to the involvement of large number of traders. Besides, the farmers get necessary logistical support such as storage place at APMCs. As far as consumers are concerned, prices of fruits and vegetables are normally the lowest at APMCs compared to other places, he added, opposing the move to denotify perishables."

It reared its ugly head last month in Jalangi of Murshidabad district, before making a worrisome appearance in several blocks of Nadia.If allowed to spread, experts said the fungus could be deadly, devouring standing wheat crop quickly. We are not taking chances whatsoever, said Pranab Kumar Hembram, an assistant director of agriculture, who along with other officials had descended on Sheikhs field to destroy the crop.The officials are in a race to clear the fields and burn the wheat to ensure there are no fungal spores that can travel from Bengal to the wheat bowl of the country in the Hindi heartland.We are felling the crop first and then spraying kerosene and setting the field on fire. We must ensure that all crops and seeds are destroyed. The spores which spread through air has to be contained, said Arun Roy, project co-ordinator and additional director of the state agriculture department. To contain the spread of wheat blast, the state government has deployed men and machines, including combined harvester machines to chop off the crop, and jars of kerosene to set them alight.The outbreak of wheat blast last year took a heavy toll on Bangladesh, where crops of over 20,000 hectares had to be burnt. Both Nadia and Murshidabad border Bangladesh, alarming the government in West Bengal.The anti-fungus drive is said to be for protecting wheat crops. But Dulal Sheikh is desolate watching his crop go up in flames. I had invested Rs 4000 for 12.5 cottah of land in terms of seed and fertilizers. This is apart from the toil my son and I put in. If everything went well I would have got Rs 6,000 for my produce, which means a profit of Rs 2,000. But now I dont know what will I do, he said, watching the thick smoke billowing from his field.The administration is offering Rs 50,375 as compensation for crop destroyed per hectare. The amount is paltry and we are not sure when the money will be disbursed, said Atiur Khan, a farmer of Sonpukur, whose crop was also set alight.Nadia is one of the most fertile tracts of Bengal with Gangetic alluvial soil flowing from rivers Ganga and Padma. Diverse crops from jute, oninon, red chilli to paddy and wheat are grown in abundance in the region.Fortunately, the fungus affects only wheat and, as a result, the adjacent fields laden with red chilli and onion are safe."

She cited that the vegetables in the village were way much cheaper than in Sambalpur city.In the village, potato was being sold at Rs 5 per kg, one and half kg of tomato for Rs 10, drum sticks for Rs 20 and cabbage for Rs 3 per kg. On the other hand, potato is selling for Rs 8 a kilo, tomato Rs 10 per kg and drum sticks Rs 35 per kg in the city.A view of the vegetable market in Sambalpuron Saturday | ExpressWhile traders attribute the difference in prices to transportation and porter cost besides levy imposed by Regulated Market Committees, failure of authorities concerned to rein in the vendors seems to have led the farmers to such a situation.The tall promises made by the BJD Government to provide 35 per cent irrigation in each block besides cold storage across the State remain unfulfilled. Blame it on the indifference of the administration which has left the vegetable growers and farmers at the mercy of vendors, who never fail to exploit them.The prices of vegetables were much lower a week ago and began rising with the rise in mercury level.Green chilli, which is available at Rs 24 per kg in the village, is sold at Rs 40 in town and city markets, tomato is priced at Rs 120 for 25 kg (Rs 4.80 a kg) and sold at Rs 10 per kg, brinjal around Rs 6 against market price of Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg, cucumber is sold by farmers at Rs 15 per kg while it costs Rs 20 in the market. On the other hand, there is a margin of Rs 10 in one kg of coriander leaves which is purchased at Rs 30 and sold at Rs 40, beans are priced at Rs 20 and sold at Rs 30.But, the summer vegetables of pointed gourd (potal) and ladies finger are expensive as of now with pointed gourd being sold by farmers at Rs 70 a kg. The same is sold between Rs 90 and Rs 120, ladies finger is sold in open market at Rs 50 per kg while farmers are selling it at Rs 30 per kg.It is the cabbage growers who have been badly hit with many failing to recover even the harvesting cost. A bag containing 40 kg cabbage is available for Rs 100 even as it is being sold at Rs 6 per kg in the open market, while cauliflower is being purchased from growers at Rs 12 to Rs 14 and sold by vendors at Rs 20.Onion growers too are crying tears of neglect. In Titlagarh, the Nashik of Odisha, distress sale was reported.

A glut of onions in the market has forced the Mahuva Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) to suspend purchasing onions since Friday. Trading will start again from Monday, but the lack of minimum support price (MSP) for onions is also hitting farmers hard.The secretary of Mahuva APMC , Jaydeep Vaja, said, ""Traders had no place to stock the fresh crop purchased and hence we had to stop trading since Friday. We will again begin trading from Monday.""""The APMC on Saturday had a stock of nearly 90 lakh kg. The transportation cost of onion has also increased due to demonetization,"" said Vaja, adding, ""The cost of transporting onion by road to Punjab and Rajasthan has increased from Rs 2.70 per kg to Rs 3.30 per kg.""""Moreover,"" said Vaja, ""transporters from Gujarat don't want to go to northern parts of the country as they unable to get any business on their return trip. Each truck carries 21 to 35 tonnes of onion depending on the size.""He further said that of late the railways have given one open wagon daily which loads nearly 50 tonnes of onion and the cost comes to just Rs 66,000 for 50 tonnes.Ghyanshyam Patel the chairman of APMC Mahuva said that though there is little interstate trade, traders from Nasik are pushing their onion into Gujarat's markets resulting in less purchase from Bhavnagar. This year's crop in Nasik is almost double that of last year.Patel further said that demonetization has increased labour cost and pushed up production cost of onions in the state to Rs 7.50 per kg, while good quality onions are not fetching prices higher than Rs 5 per kg. Lower quality onions are going at Rs 3 per kg said Patel.Patel said that he has written to the state agriculture minister, Chiman Sapariya, and Mansukh Mandaviya the minister of state for chemicals & fertilizers, and even to Parshottam Rupala, the Union minister of state for agriculture, farmer's welfare and have urged them to have support prices also for vegetables. ""We had even demanded a wagon every day and now we have been getting it for the last three days.""He said that for the last three days, Mahuva was getting nearly two lakh 50-kg bags resulting in a glut. The farmers this year may not get more than five to six rupees per kg this year, said Patel.Not just Mahuva, but even Bhavnagar APMC was also getting around 80,000 bags of onions daily and the price hasn't risen more than Rs 6 per kg for the best quality onion. D S Royla, secretary of Bhavnagar APMC said that red onions are heading to Punjab and Delhi while the white onions are reserved for the dehydration plants. There are several farmers who have gone in for sowing in February, too, and hence the market would be getting fresh crop till May."

The research presents a microcosmic example of how indiscriminate digging of farm ponds has accelerated the rate of groundwater extraction.The scheme was launched in December 2014 by Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis-led State government with an objective to harvest rainwater and enhance groundwater levels. However, the project has run into stormy weather for its haphazard and unscientific implementation, undue reliance on machinery, lack of transparency and public participation.Amruta Pradhan, a researcher with the SANDRP, said, While the government is taking credit for providing a small scale irrigation facility at the farmers doorstep, it is reluctant to take the responsibility of their unsustainable use. Majority of the scheme work has been implemented unscientifically. While one can see water as of now, it does not mean groundwater recharge has taken place.Ms. Pradhan dismissed the usefulness of plastic-lined farm ponds, remarking they were just another layer of exploitative unsustainable infrastructure, which would only help accelerate the process of groundwater depletion.Besides borewells, Pravara river (a tributary of Godavari river) is a major water source to the Hiwargaon village. Almost 80% of its ponds are dependent on groundwater, with most of them dug between 2012 and 2015 with the help of subsidies offered under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM).The 300-odd ponds in the village are the main source of sustenance for the pomegranate-dependent agro economy. The arrival of ponds has led many farmers to shift to horticulture, with pomegranate cash-crop rapidly supplanting the traditional horsegram (bajra), wheat, pulses and onion crops.Issues with the schemeMost farmers in the village, as in Westerns Maharashtra's horticultural belt, swear by the farm ponds, unmindful, however, of the consequences of groundwater depletion owing to their unregulated construction and digging.The SANDRP study revealed that none of the farm ponds in Hiwargaon had inlets and outlets or any other arrangement for excess rainwater inflow that was envisioned in the scheme. Instead of digging the ponds in a low-lying area, many of them are dug on the highest points of the farms.It further noted that soil conservation is the key to groundwater recharge, but it has been omitted in the scheme.Water conservationist Vijay Anna Borade said, Any programme claiming to deal with recharging groundwater has to pay attention to the soil. If soil is conserved, groundwater is automatically recharged. In the Jalyukt Shivar works, soil, fine sand and all the medium which hold the water and percolate it have been scrapped. If the rocks are exposed, then how is the recharge supposed to take place?He added that the works under the scheme appeared to hold water, but would not recharge it.Another problem with the farm ponds is that they expose the groundwater to losses through evaporation, something that may not become immediately apparent.Ponds for allAccording to data, around 13,950 ponds were dug between 2014 and 2016 under the NHM, the JSY and the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana, while nearly 24,700 more were under construction under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) in 2016-17.Till date, a staggering 1.6 lakh-odd applications have been received by local authorities under the Magel Tyala Shet Tale (Farm Pond on Demand scheme) ever since Mr. Fadnavis launched it in February 2016.Ms. Pradhan said, The Jalyukt Shivar programme and its ancillaries are a quick fix that have failed. The government has not taken into account the massive amount of work that goes into involving people in carrying out watershed works. The Fadnavis government has also paid [little consideration] to the educative process regarding judicious use of water.While local authorities said they are aware of the concerns engendered by the indiscriminate digging of farm ponds, they find regulation impossible.The sub-divisional officer of Sangamner said, Once the farmer constructs the pond, it is impossible for us to tell him not to use it for groundwater storage. Authorities said they were attempting to initiate dialogue with farmers in a bid to impress on them the judicious use of farm ponds."

The protesting Sanghatana activists threw onions and tur dal on the road outside Vidhan Bhavan, alleging government apathy towards farmers. A scuffle broke out between Sanghatana leader Raju Shetty and police officers when Shetty was leading a protest demanding fair prices for onions and tur dal in the state.The Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana, one of the most organised and vocal outfits working for farmers, said the state government had promised several initiatives to help farmers get better price for their produce. However, it failed to implement these initiatives, it said. The government has failed to give a better life to our farmers. Our farmers continue to suffer, we cannot tolerate this. Till the Devendra Fadnavis government takes initiatives we will continue with the protest, Shetty said.The state witnessed the highest number of suicides in 2015, with around 4,291 farmers ending their lives. In 2016, around 3,052 farmers in the state committed suicide. The numbers arent any better. We demand justice, we demand a better life for the farmers, added Shetty. Several Sanghatana activists were arrested after they threw a bag full of onions on the car of state Agriculture Minister Sadabhau Khot. The cause for which the Sanghatana is protesting is genuine and we understand. They are demanding better life for farmers and that the farmers can earn some profit, Khot said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But the incident flared up after Khainus wife Kalabati alleged that none from the administration visited the village nor spoke to them before releasing the report.The report left the villagers angry. The visit of the officials on Tuesday to collect first hand information from the relatives of Khainu was enough to fray villagers tempers. The villagers held Deputy Director, Agriculture, Naba Kishore Das and Assistant Director, Horticulture, Sunil Kumar Seth hostage for three hours.The officials were questioned on what basis the report was filed. The villagers charged them with submitting a false report without verifying facts. The officials were asked by the villagers to give a report in writing on their observation of their visit to Khainus farmland. The officials were allowed to leave the village only after they obliged.In their report, signed by them, the officials admitted that cabbage cultivation has been completely damaged while chilli and onion crops were partially damaged.

Tomato prices touched a high of Rs 42 a kg at vegetable stores in the city on Tuesday. However, it isnt just tomatoes, but other vegetables too whose prices have begun to climb and are expected to become more expensive when summer sets in.In the case of tomato, prices will have to increase as most of the tomatoes sold are coming from Nagpur, said a vegetable store owner who did not wish to be named. It takes around six days for these tomatoes to reach Chennai as they go to Bengaluru first and then come here. The demand for tomatoes is always high and the supply is getting limited, so prices have to go up.He said he was charging Rs 38 for a kg of tomatoes on Monday but since prices increased by Rs 5 at the Koyambedu vegetable market on Tuesday, he had spiked his rate to Rs 42. He explained that the difference in prices at retail and Koyambedu wholesale market is generally around Rs 4 to Rs 5 less a kg for things like tomatoes and can go up to Rs eight to Rs 10 less in the case of vegetables like beans.Vegetable vendors affirmed that most other vegetables have been hovering around the same prices with minor fluctuation. However, they warned that with the beginning of summer, prices too will go up. They attributed this to different reasons, primary one being the water problem in the State.Water shortage will definitely lead to prices being higher this summer, said S Mani, a vegetable vendor at T. Nagar. Prices of vegetables like ladies finger, especially will keep increasing as it is one of the most commonly bought vegetables in summer.He sold the vegetable at Rs 70 per kg on Tuesday. Prices of onion and potato, however, have remained stable. A kilo of onion can be bought for Rs 18-Rs 20 while a kilo of potato is priced Rs 25."

He added that the total cost of the area that had not been handed over to MHADA was around Rs. 6,000 crore.Mr. Waikar said, The matter will be probed transparently by SIT. He also assured the Assembly that action would be taken against developers of projects where no work had been done in the last eight to ten years.As per the rules, the developer must hand over the area under which redevelopment has taken place to MHADA. There have been complaints that developers, in connivance with officials, have instead sold it off at market value.Congress MLA Nitesh Rane saidofficers involved in giving clearance certificates should also be probed. Mr. Waikar accepted the demand."

In spite of heavy rains and a spurt in farm productivity, the scourge of suicides continues to spread. The highest number of suicides was in Beed (23), hometown of rural minister Pankaja Munde, followed by Nanded (22), Osmanabad (19), Aurangabad (18), Jalna (14), Parbhani and Hingoli (8 each) and Latur (5). Of the 117 cases, financial aid was provided to 46 families of the deceased. But 13 were denied relief and 58 proposals are still being processed.Head of a state-level task force on farmer welfare, Kishore Tiwari, said while the government had taken various measures, the results were not visible. ""We'll have to redraft our strategy to halt farmer suicides,"" Tiwari said. ""We will have to provide remunerative prices for agriculture produce, along with market intervention. A plan needs to be worked out to provide education to farmers' children and financial assistance for healthcare.""In 2016, production of tur, tomato, onion and most vegetables doubled and even tripled but farm gate prices dipped. Onion was sold for Rs 460 per quintal as against the production cost of Rs 950. Tur farmers were paid less than the minimum support price (MSP) in wholesale markets. The MSP for tur was Rs 5,050 and traders were purchasing it at Rs 4200-4400 per quintal.However, a comparison with figures for the previous year show a marginal decline in toll. According to data, 3,052 farmers ended their lives in 2016, of which 1,053 cases were from Aurangabad, which falls in Marathwada region. The 117 cases recorded in 2017, if seen against the average bi-monthly rate for the previous year, indicates a slight downturn. Incidentally, the same trend is visible for 2015 and 2016. Against a total of 3,052 farmers who killed themselves in 2016, the toll was higher at 3,228 in 2015, which was a drought year.Leader of opposition Radhakrishna Vikhe Patil said over the last two and half years, 9,000 farmers have killed themselves. ""We demand that Fadnavis declare a total loan waiver to protect the farmers' lives."" Patil led an opposition delegation recently which called on Governor Vidyasagar Rao to press for their demand."

Onions continue to fetch Rs380-460 per quintal, as against the production cost of Rs 950 per quintal at the Lasalgaon AMPC market , Asia's largest onion market yard. Compared to last year, there has been over-production of 25 lakh metric tonnes of onions.Although only about 10% onions grown in the country have been exported, the figure is important to keep price parity in wholesale markets.Exporters said the central government's decision of giving a 6% export subsidy helped push some of the produce out of India.According to figures from the market committee, a daily supply of 30,000-35,000 tonnes is coming in to the market yard, as against 12,000-15,000 tonnes last year.Due to good rain and increase in area under production, it has been a bumper crop but the prices that slid last December due to demonetisation are struggling to stabilize even now, the fag end of the season.An exporter from Nashik said there was demand for Indian onions abroad and they fetched good prices. UAE, Saudi Arabia and Malaysia are some buyers.Bumper production in states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka too has been cited as the reason for the glut, which had ensured that prices remain subdued throughout the year. State government officials said there have also been issues with storage in market yards. The entire dip in price and other losses due to rotting and lack of storage capacity is estimated to be close to Rs 800 crore."

(Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) Beekeeper Dinkar Patil (centre) with pomegranate farmers of Agoti village in Maharashtras Pune district. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)As Dhananjay Takle moves around the fruit-laden trees in his three-acre pomegranate farm, he cant but recall the scene just over five months back. This farmer from Agoti village in Indapur taluka of Pune district had a real scare when the same 1,000-odd trees werent setting fruit, despite good flowering.Watch What Else Is Making NewsI had planted pomegranate for the first time and invested around Rs 6 lakh in inputs, including labour. The trees started flowering towards September-end. But the flowers, instead of developing into fruits, were simply dropping, he notes. Consultation with other farmers in his village revealed that the flower drop had to do with the lack of pollination. There werent enough honey bees and other pollinating insects in and around his fields to transfer pollen from the stamen (male organ) of one flower to the stigma (female part) of the other. The result: No fertilisation and fruit formation.Takle, then, followed the advice of his fellow-farmers: Take beehive boxes, each containing a colony of 20,000-30,000 insects, on hire and install them in the field, as some of them had done earlier. I contacted Dinkar Patil, a bee keeper from Latur, who rented out three boxes for my orchard. By early November, 90 per cent of the trees started bearing fruits and I hope to harvest around 20 tonnes of pomegranate in the next 15 days. Without those bees, all my hard work would have gone waste, he says.The importance of honeybees to agriculture  more specifically, the role that the tiny-winged insects play in pollination  is too well-known to require elaboration. Not as well recognised a reality, however, is the destruction of beehives that the indiscriminate usage of pesticides have wrought and, in turn, contributed to a not-insignificant agricultural crisis. Theres no better proof of that than farmers like Takle today having to hire beehive boxes to aid in pollination.Highly cross-pollinated crops like onion, cotton, oilseeds and most fruits and vegetables depend entirely on winged insects that, during their flights to collect nectar, also transport pollen from one flower to another. Honeybees are best suited to perform this function. Our experiments have shown an average 30 per cent increase in crop yields  from 17-19 per cent for cotton to 48 per cent in sunflower and 150-170 per cent in lychees  if honeybees are artificially introduced in the fields during the flowering stage even in normal conditions, informs Laxmi Rao, assistant director of the Pune based Central Bee Research and Training Institute (CBRTI).Not for nothing, then, that as pollinator insect populations have seen reduction  linked to factors from widespread pesticide application and mono-cropping to climate change  it has spawned a business of artificial introduction of beehive boxes. In Maharashtra, there are professional beekeepers now charging farmers anywhere from Rs 1,000 to Rs 3,000 for renting out boxes for a month.Dinkar Patil has doing this for the last 15 years. Proprietor of the Latur-based Patil Bee Keepers, he was initially supplying beehive boxes to companies producing onion and vegetable seeds. But in recent years, he has noticed an increasing demand from even farmers for his pollination services. Much of it is from pomegranate, oilseeds and mustard growers, who have reported sharp dip in the natural bee numbers in their areas. The demand-supply gap is huge, because I myself get queries for 5,000 beehive boxes a year, but am in a position to fulfill barely a fifth of these. There were orders for around 500 boxes from pomegranate farmers in Indapur alone last year, but I could provide only 50, claims Patil, who owns and rents out 700 boxes round the year.A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas) A beehive box placed in a pomegranate orchard. (Photo: Partha Sarathi Biswas)Beekeeping, promoted as a cottage industry by the Khadi and Village Industries Commission, has so far focused mainly on honey. But now, a new demand avenue has opened up for beekeepers  in the form of pollinators-on-hire services. The beehive boxes are kept for a month or so during the flowering season. Once fruit-setting happens, the boxes are removed and taken to the field of the next crop whose flowering is due. Since flowering happens for different crops all through the year, barring the peak summer and monsoon months, there is a steady demand for the services offered by the likes of Patil.Patil maintains colonies of Apis mellifera or European honeybees that normally travel within an area of four square-km area to collect nectar and pollinate flowers. On the other hand, Vipin Mahajan, another beekeeper from Talegaon Dabhade, a town in Punes Mawal taluka, employs Apis trigona bees. The former species require regular supplementary feeding of concentrated sugar solution to ensure no starvation, but the bees dont migrate and farmers only need to install one box per acre.The trigona bees require less maintenance, but the requirement is three boxes per acre. Also, mellifera beehives can survive for three years, whereas trigona hives need to be re-populated every year.According to CBRTIs Rao, the lack of trained bee breeders is a major concern. This is even more so in a scenario where the destruction of the natural habitat for bee populations is already impacting pollination in major crops. There can be no second Green Revolution without conservation of honey bees. Farmers need to be sensitised about the importance of the winged visitors to their fields, she points out.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He said for the past some time there had been almost no export of vegetables to Pakistan via Attari.""In the wholesale market here, potatoes, tomatoes, cauliflower, onion are being sold for Rs 2, Rs 11, Rs 4 and Rs 8 per kg. However, in retail markets all vegetables are sold in the range of Rs 10-Rs 20 per kg,"" he maintained.Sethi said farmers' worst period started during demonetization when there was no cash flow in the market and they were forced to sell their produce at any price. ""Hoping to get the best price as had happened in the past year, farmers had brought a large portion of their fields under vegetable cultivation and also got bumper crop, but demonetization played the spoilsport. Now, with the glut of crops, the only hope now is to export vegetables to Pakistan, which is struggling with their supply,"" said president of association Ravinder Singh.Jamhuri Kisan Sabha president Satnam Singh Ajnala blamed the government for not fixing MSP for vegetables and its inability to set up vegetable-based agro industries in Punjab. ""Since there is no MSP, farmers are being exploited by commission agents and the government is not doing anything,"" he said, adding that the MSP of vegetables would at least ensure that farmers wouldn't be at loss. Besides, he opined that the government should have a dependable transportation network to immediately supply vegetables where there was a deficit."

Representational Image.This summer, tomato prices might see a spike as tomato plantations in Maharashtra have seen a sharp drop in output. Lack of ready cash with growers and an infestation of white flies is being attributed to the drop, which has affected the entire state. As against the 34,500 hectares of plantation used to cultivate tomato during summer, this year the state has seen 31,012 hectares of farmland used for the crop. The dip in area is significant in the tomato-growing districts of Pune, Nashik, Satara and Sangli.Watch What Else Is Making NewsDeepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Federation of Narayangaon in Junnar taluka of Pune district, claimed that demonetisation was to be blamed for the dip in cultivation area as farmers didnt have enough cash. Tomato is a cash-intensive crop as farmers require costly inputs on an average, an acre of crop would require Rs 70,000 as input cost, he said.Currently, demonetisation and a sharp fall in prices of almost all farm produces have shaken the economics of rural areas, making farmers wary of heavy investments. Bhise, who normally plants five acres of tomatoes, has only planted three acres of the crop this year. Another reason for lesser cultivation is the apparent infestation of white flies in tomato-growing areas. Increase in onion acreage in the last few years has increased the prevalence of white flies in these areas. This pest destroys tomato crop, so many farmers have not opted for tomato this season, he said.According to traders at the wholesale markets, lesser agricultural area for tomatoes would result in an increase in the price of the vegetable in the days to come.In June last year, tomato prices had crossed the Rs 70 per kg mark in retail markets in many parts of the state, as a severe drought had destroyed the rabi crop. This year, lesser cultivation may also result in a spike in prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

That was some two years back and now the number of my customers has grown in leaps and bounds, she smiles.Her facebook page Leelas Kitchen is a talk among the foodie groups in the city as you dont have to order much in advance. All I need is one hour. I have two helpers who do the peeling and chopping. We are always prepared to take the order and finish it in an hour, she says.Deepika says though she is an expert cook now, once she hardly had any idea about what happens inside the kitchen. It was my mother-in-law Leela who taught me the art, with all its nuances and tricks. She had magic in her hands and hence my page is named after her.There are many specialty restaurants in the city dedicated to North Indian cuisine, but Deepika says their preparations lack that authentic taste and flavour. You dont get a paratha with a thick methi filling there. While we use atta they use maida, and there is always the hygiene part. From the flour to garnish, we make sure that everything is 100 per cent North Indian.Then there are customers who want specific food, something in sync with their health or religion.

We use our own recipe for the house specials, he adds.Its one dish that has undergone umpteen makeovers, tasting different from place to place. Chef says its the quality of rice and the perfection in dum that basically defines the biriyani.In Kerala we like kaima rice, but there are people who insist on using basmati. Authentic Malabari biriyani is made with kaima only, but when it comes to North Indian biriyanis we go for the long and slender basmati. In our menu we have tried to focus more on South varieties using fried meat, he says.If you want to experiment with something other than the regular yellow biriyani, opt for the Nilgiri version. This one comes with a green tint, the result of a mint, coriander and palak blend. Its one biriyani totally different from what you have tasted so far. Each leaf used has its own unique flavour and the meat and rice gets covered in that green masala, explains the chef.If you are a seafood lover, give fish a miss this time. No, we are not referring to the yummy prawn biriyani but another signature dish - the spicy squid biriyani.Malayalis like hot and spicy food. Normally, the spice level in biriyani is moderate. But in squid biriyani its on the higher side. You can see how hot and flavourful it is by just looking at it, says the chef pointing to the slightly red dish.The menu has all the regular chicken, beef and veg variants as well and each biriyani is accompanied by a sweet mango-and-pineapple chutney, onion raita and pappad. Sometimes we serve slightly customised biriyanis taking into account what the customer likes, adds the chef.

The worst-affected were drumstick growers.Chettiyapatti, Kalikampatti, Munnilaikottai, Nadupatti and adjacent areas were major drumstick production centres in the union. Drumstick has also been cultivated as intercrop in tomato and onion fields.Several farmers preferred hybrid plant variety of drumstick to traditional variety for better yield and little maintenance.Already, several bore wells and open wells at these villages dried up owing to the acute drought, creating a shortage of water for irrigation. Residents have been running from pillar to post for water for drinking and other purposes.With no sources to maintain regular supply, horticulturists have started purchasing water from Dindigul and nearby areas to protect the standing crops.S. Palani, farmer in Kalikkampatti, said though drumstick crop was drought- tolerant, a minimum quantity of water was required to keep the plant alive.The plants should be irrigated at least once in two or three days. We had to shell out a sizable amount of money for water. Suppliers deliver water in lorries and tractors, he added.Intermittent showers in the past two days brought some relief. But it was only temporary and it would not help the horticulturists in the long run, he added.The farmers in area said already debt burden had been haunting many who had small land holdings.Several fund- starved farmers were in distress as they could not afford to buy water to protect the standing crops.

He added that the government had been given ample opportunities to act in this regard. The seers had convened a meeting of all elected representatives of the district more than three times to convince them to take immediate steps for development, but they have not done anything except provide false assurances, he alleged.After holding discussions with seers of different mutts, a delegation was sent to the CM appealing to him to take steps for the development of Chitradurga. The CM had assured the delegation of action but nothing had been done so far. Owing to this, it has become necessary to launch an agitation, he said.He demanded that the State government take immediate steps to clear all major tanks of silt in the district to ensure proper storage, provision of drinking water to people in rural areas of the district, taking up of drought relief works and also finding a permanent solution to the drinking water problem in the district.Raitha Sangha member Buthaiah said that farmers in the district were adversely affected by the consecutive drought over the past few years and though many farmer suicides were being reported, the State government had still not taken any steps to help. He demanded that the government respond to the problems of groundnut, millet and onion growers in the district as they were in deep trouble.Earlier, a padayatra was taken out from Shri Nilkanteshwar Temple, that passed through main streets of the city including Gandhi Circle, Mahaveer Circle, and culminated outside the Deputy Commissioners office. They also submitted a memorandum in this regard to Srirangaiah, Deputy Commissioner. They also staged a dharna outside the DCs office for some time."

With the figure of the last three months yet to come in, the country's onion export is expected to reach 30 lakh tonne.Moreover, the onion export increased three times more during the April-Dec period of 2016-17 as compared to the corresponding period in 2015-16.According to sources from National Agriculture Co-operative Marketing Federation (Nafed), the country exported 24 lakh tonnes of onion during the April-December period of the current financial year as against 6.94 lakh tonne during the same period in 2015-16.NAFED director Nanasaheb Patil attributed the record onion exports to the Centre's export policy. ""The Union government removed the MEP on onions in December 2015 and it has impacted the overseas sale of onion,"" he added.According to him, the Centre has also introduced Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS) of 5% for export of onions since August 2016. This has overall led to the rise in onion export.""Considering an export of 2.5 lakh tonne a month on an average, the onion export of the country may touch 30 lakh metric tonne by the end of the current financial year,"" said Patil.Onions from India are exported to countries such as Malaysia, Kuwait, Maldives, Mauritius, Nepal, Norway, Bangladesh, the UK, Russia, Singapore, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Indonesia, UAE and Italy."

I didn't know what to make of it, my friend shared her thoughts with me the other day. Does that mean we are indifferent or ignorant? she wondered aloud looking at me in confusion. I really couldnt give her any answer.The measure of your real success as a parent can be known by the way your children describe you when talking to their friends, goes a saying. I truly didnt know what her sons statement implied  what could being cool actually mean and how that could be attributed to a dont care attitudeThe current generation of parents are a confused lot. The meanings of words as they perceive them can be very different from what their children imply. It is important for parents to understand what their progeny is talking about. So it is imperative that a lot of time is spent and interaction is sustained to learn and unlock the mysteries of their expressions.When they say, Oh I am doing an onion check on that, you will not scratch your head if you know that onion check means checking of facts. You will not look dazed by the remark that she threw shade at him, if you get the picture of her publicly disrespecting him. If they assure you, we shall T-up surely and if you can gather that they will certainly turn up in the evening for the family get-together, then you will not be caught with an ashen black face. If they come hug you and say You are my bae, you will not go bonkers if you know that it is an acronym for before anyone else.Wow, how exultant will you feel knowing that they place you before anyone else! Studies have demonstrated that if parents showed interest, children were likely to explain their language, however reluctantly. Most of them, though, would be happy if their parents stopped at OMG, BRB, BFN and GBY.Way back in 1675, after labouring for 35 years, Sir Christopher Wren presented his masterpiece for Queen Annes inspection. The monarch readily pronounced them to be awful, artificial and amusing, for in those days awful meant full of awe, artificial meant very artful, and amusing meant amazing! How amazingly, awesomely and amusingly the semantic usage of words changes. Centuries hence, how our childrens lingo would be used remains to be seen.I remember the satirical yet realistic warning given by a new-age guru: Dont be a 21st century parent who cannot correct a child. How pertinent! But before trying to correct them, parents must learn their lingo, guruji."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, March 20: The state's favourite dish was omnipresent - from the dining table to a top trending topic on social media - as resident and not-resident Odias celebrated Pakhala Divas today. Thousands of people took to various social networking sites to share stories of their attachment with pakhala, while many others shared pictures of feasts over the dish at their homes and outside. The dish was also among the top trending topics on micro-blogging site Twitter throughout the day with a number of well-known personalities talking about it. Popular television personality and chef Sanjeev Kapoor tweeted: ""I am sure if today I go to any house in Odisha (or an Odia living in any part of the world), I would get freshly made Pakhala."" Writer Ravinder Singh wrote on Twitter: ""Fermented rice to beat the heat. The haves would eat it with fried fish & veges. The have nots with onion & green-chillies."" Artist Sudarshan Patnaik created a sand art on the theme with a bowl of fermented rice in the middle and a number of popular side-dishes alongside. He posted a picture of his creation on Twitter that was shared by international chefs such as Vikas Khanna and Ranveer Brar and hundreds of people from around the world. Pakhala is an Odia term for cooked rice washed or fermented in water. Depending on the palette, a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian accompaniments are served with it to spice up the taste. It was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath in the Puri temple since it was built in the 12th century. The dish has a number of variations, including jeera pakhala, dahi pakhala, basi pakhala, sajja pakhala and chaiin pakhala. Rourkela resident Monalisa Routray added a twist to her pakhala. She said: ""Instead of rice, I tried rice-stuffed dumplings immersed in curd. As side dishes, I had potato patties and fried drumstick. My family members all appreciated my unique spin to the dish."" Odia film-maker Biswananth Rath, who lives in Chennai, said: ""The day is an attempt to preserve the tradition of this Odia cuisine. The Odia association here got together and had a hearty pakhala meal. We also invited a number of non-Odia people."" Akshaya Mohanty, who lives in Rhode Island, US, said: ""I have invited my non-Odia friends here so that they can get a taste of the popular dish."" Lately, a number of hotels and restaurants have included pakhala in their menus. A vegetarian pakhala meal is available at Rs 350 and a non-vegetarian one comes for a princely Rs 400. There are budget eateries as well, which are offering the dish at Rs 70. ""A dish that hydrates the body is advised as a remedy against sunstroke. We have pakhala at home almost daily during the summer. But today, my friends and I wanted to celebrate the occasion in a special manner,"" said Manisha Dash, who visited the Dalma restaurant here."

Among the ones served here, the tomato tartare is a better choice than its chicken counterpart. Double cooked with mozarella and served with black olive powder, the tartare is delicate.The Free-range Chicken had a unique combination of bell peppers and pecorino romano cheese ice cream. The lightly sweet ice cream with a cheese-like taste is a suprising twist because you dont expect your dessert to sit on the appetisers. But it goes well together.Shrimp -- oven baked and roasted -- are served with white spring onion cream and black truffle, they are a must try. The baked shrimp has a strong orange flavour and the roasted is crispy. The cream of white onions lends the dish a sweet and sour flavour.After the Antipasti is served the Primi Piatti, which is essentially pasta. The lemon foam adds a tanginess to the Fagottini pasta served with burrata, lobster and green peas.The parmigiano reggiano (a hard, granular cheese) aged 24 months is a perfect match for the ravioli. It looks fancy but tastes familiar, like it is homemade. The tomatoes add a zing to the morel mushrooms, green peas and asparagus.Secondi Piatti, another mains, has chicken breast and thigh, spinach, wild mushrooms and pumpkin with rosemary, sauce saracena moscato looks exciting but falls flat with the meat cooked in mushroom sauce rubbery.The sea bass tastes fresh. The platter also includes potatoes prepared in saffron sauce. All good here.Finally, the desserts, or as Italians call it Dolci, include Tiramasu Parfait and Citrus Tart, Cream and Nuts. The chef special Tiramasu is highly recommended, with its overpowering coffee flavour. As you dig into the Tiramisu, the cream oozes out. There is a hint of chocolate.As the name suggests, the tart has a strong citrusy flavour from the layers of lemon cream. It is topped with fruits and nuts. The strawberry is a great add-on, softening the otherwise acidic and sharp flavour of lemon.The reviewed dishes were part of the Capri to Calabria, Southern Italian food festival, which closed on March 24. But, few of them will be included in the restaurants main menu in the coming weeks."

However, in a short span of time, it has indulged in corruption like no other party has. The governments principal secretary (Rajendra Kumar) was arrested by the CBI on corruption charges. There was a scam in onion purchase, appointments in Delhi Commission for Women (DCW), water tanker procurement and street lights. One of the AAP ministers was involved in the Hawala case. Another minister is involved in land scam, Shah said while addressing a rally of booth level workers at Ramlila Maidan to motivate them before the civic polls.The rally was attended by six Lok Sabha MPs of Delhi including BJP state unit chief Manoj Tiwari, Union ministers M Venkaiah Naidu, Nirmala Sitharaman, Jitendra Singh, Sanjeev Balyan and Vijay Goel. Saturdays rally also marked the partys formal launch of campaign for the April 23 municipal elections.Barely a week after a new government being sworn-in in Uttar Pradesh, Kejriwal is seeking its performance report. Dont worry, BJP will fulfil all its promises. And, we will not ask for your performance report because it is expected from responsible people. Thirteen of your MLAs are facing criminal cases. How do you explain that? Before the municipal election campaign, you (Kejriwal) should order a magisterial enquiry to look into corruption charges against your MLAs, the BJP chief said.Shah asked the people to dislodge AAP government in the next (assembly) elections. MCD election will work for laying the foundation for assembly elections. To ensure development, there should be a government, which is not indulged in fighting with the Centre. MCDs should work in coordination with the centre and state government for the growth, he said."
58fbd25ca3d24b44f321f598,The breakfast story,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/the-breakfast-story/article17660948.ece,2017-03-25,"On some Sundays, my breakfast consists of two fluffy bhatureys with a good helping of chholey, and some onion slices and pickled carrots and chillies on the side. I go to the local sweetshop for this, and I find that their fare is usually good. But the last time I got our breakfast packed from this busy eatery, I was a bit disappointed. The chholey was fine but the bhatureys were a little hard. They reminded me of bedmi, and suddenly I yearned for the bedmi and hot aloo sabzis that Chandni Chowk is known for.Vegetarian sideOnce the stomach demands, the body obeys. So a few days ago, I decided that while the weather was still bearable, I needed to go to Purani Dilli. I had gone there in the evening once and had my fill of kababs. Now I needed to go to the vegetarian part of the Walled City in the daytime for bedmi aloo.Think bedmi, and you think of Shiv Misthan Bhandar. This is an old, old shop on the mouth of Kucha Ghasiram (Shop no. 375, phone no. 23921406). This is near the Fatehpuri Mosque side of Chandni Chowk, away from the Red Fort end. The shop has just 11 items on the menu.If you are there in the mornings, you can breakfast on nagori halwa (Rs. 60), a delicious dish of small puris which you pierce in the middle (the way golgappas come) and stuff with halwa and eat. Apart from bedmi aloo (Rs. 90), they have chholey bhaturey (Rs. 80), and kachori and samosa (Rs. 50). They sell six kinds of sweets  jalebi and imarti (Rs. 500 a kilo), gulab jamun (Rs. 450), suji halwa (Rs. 400), mung dal halwa (Rs. 450) and malpua (Rs. 400). You can also buy them by plate  two imartis, for instance, are for Rs. 60 and two pieces of jalebi for Rs. 50.When I used to go there earlier, you had to stand and eat. Now the place has expanded at the back and there is seating for at least 30 people. If you are eating there, helpers keep filling your slot for sabzi and chholey if they find it empty. I, of course, took the bedmis home  and had a delicious lunch of two big puris stuffed with a dal paste, a nicely runny potato sabzi and lightly cooked chholey. I had all this with some tart methi chutney and pickles.The best thing about Shiv Misthan Bhandar is that every dish is cooked in desi ghee. I love the flavour and taste of ghee, so bedmi fried in ghee is like ambrosia for me. And because there are only 11 items on the menu (unlike the big vegetarian fast food chains, where you get everything these days from pizzas and pasta to noodles and burgers and bhatureys and chaat), Shiv Misthan keeps a strict check on quality.

They are more in demand over the Bellary onions, say traders.Over the past few days, small onions are being sold Rs. 30 to Rs. 45 a kg depending on quality at the wholesale outlet at Gandhi Market. The price has gone up by Rs. 15 a kg over the past one month. In the retail market, top quality small onions were being sold at Rs. 50 a kg.Arrivals have come down to just 50 tonnes a day. There is no local supply. Normally we get about 200 tonnes of small onions a day, said A. Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association. Supplies from Dharapuram and Udumalpet met the local demands in the nearby districts, he said.Perambalur and Tiruchi are the major onion producing districts in the State. The crop is raised on over 8,000 hectares in Perambalur district and on about 4,000 hectares in Tiruchi district. However, stocks with onion growers in Perambalur and Thuraiyur are mostly held back as seeds for the next season.The failure of the monsoon has led to the situation. There has been a severe drop in yield and many farmers had not gone for the crop as there was no rain in Perambalur district. In some places, the crops have withered. Even those who managed to raise the crop have reported sharp drop in yield,said R.Raja Chidambaram, state secretary, Tamizhaga Vivasayigal Sangam.Mr.Thangaraj said that the price of small onions is not likely to come down at least for next five to six months as there is no scope for fresh crops in the summer.Meanwhile, the price of Bellary onions, currently ruling at around Rs. 11 a kg at the market, could go up slightly though steadily in the days to come as the short supply of small onions would result in a higher demand for the bigger onion variety, he said."

However, those governments are happy with the quality and taste, it said.The organization also points to logistical concerns. Considering the mid-day meal scheme is its primary focus, it'd be difficult to supply three meals a day, it said. ""If we were to supply food for three meals, then the focus would shift from our primary goal of mid-day meal for kids. While politics has been a prime factor, the change in plan (earlier the talk was about supplying one meal a day. Later it changed to three) was also a reason,"" said a member of Iskcon.The government also admitted logistics was a deal-breaker, considering Iskcon may not be able to offer variety and would stick to a certain menu with its centralized kitchen.""With hoteliers, not only will food be available faster, there will be also more variety at the canteens,"" said an official.A ccording to government sources, the canteen contracts will now be packaged for 10 or 15 wards and bids will be called for a single hotelier to supply breakfast, lunch and dinner. The government is expected to consider only those hotels which have large chains or networks in the city. This is to maintain uniformity in hygiene and quality of food. Besides, the government may supply the ingredients through its public distribution system to ease burden on the state exchequer."

Owners have invested money to realise a dreamBorivli is a suburb located along the western suburban line of Mumbai and has several eating joints, including themed restaurants. As one stands in front of the well-known Esspee Tower near the Borivli railway station, an aquarium shop, a rather big one, lit up well and spic and span, stands out.As one approaches the shop, the visitor would see Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd, one of the biggest aquarium shops of Mumbai and Caf Hydro, the first aquarium-themed caf in the country with the biggest fish tunnel.Such aquarium cafs or ocean restaurants are quite common in some of the big tourist destinations in the world. In India it is the first of its kind with a fish tunnel or an aquarium tunnel. In the country, there are several restaurants with an aquarium or a fish tank or an aquarium wall.For 41-year-old Rupesh Sakpal, the director of Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd and Caf Hydro, this was not the first time that he had made an aquarium tunnel. The dream project of Rupesh is at Rajendra Nagar at Dattapada Road at Borivli East. In fact, Borivli is a bustling tourist destination and a happening place in the suburbs. When the Taraporewala Aquarium on Marine Drive was refurbished a few years ago, Sakpals company was tasked to create a 180-degree acrylic glass tunnel of 10x15 sq feet.A restaurant was on the back of my mind. We thought why not to make it more interesting. An aquarium always attracts crowd. In fact, in a restaurant where there is a fish tank, people prefer to sit by its side and dine. I thought of giving a different experience altogether, said Rupesh, explaining his pet project.The 17x15 sq ft fish tunnel is at the level-2 of Caf Hydro. The level-3 has a huge wall aquarium. Setting this up was a challenge and we decided to give it a try, adds Rupeshs uncle Manohar Sakpal, who is the chairman and managing director of Bhagirathi Group.With a variety of colourful, exotic, big and small fish of over a dozen varieties gliding around and excellent lighting, you are in a different world. When you have a meal, there is nothing like it, said Shaibal Gupta, a foodie who had dined at Caf Hydro.Manohar supported Rupesh, who has a Bachelor of Fisheries Science degree, when he started a 100 sq ft aquarium shop on September 9, 1999, near the Borivli railway station. His three-storeyed aquarium shop and caf now are spread over 10,000 sq ft.The ground floor or level one is filled with youngsters and has a feel of Mumbais local trains. It has been constructed using train tracks, train floors, sleepers, racks, ladders and a blue-coloured staircase. The roof has several artwork and bottles.The one-stop pet mall restaurant has been set up at a cost of nearly Rs 25 crore. We have made investments to realise the dream. We are very clear that aquarium is our core business and everything will revolve around it, said Rupesh, who is also developing a public aquarium in Ranchi in Jharkhand. We have to look at hygiene and service and nearly 100 people work round the clock in three shifts, he said as he attended phone calls.After Caf Hydro was inaugurated on January 26 this year, the number of calls have increased. Several corporate houses want to visit, do group bookings or have a similar aquarium in their offices and workplaces, he said. Nowadays people are looking for what is known as a stress-buster aquarium.Paste food, which is made of proteins of fish, is the unique concept of this restaurant. There are variety of delicious dishes like fish bao, fish burger, fish hotdog, fish bullets, fish cake roll.I stay in Borivli and came to know about it and decided to visit the place. I found it interesting and it is something new. Visiting this place gives you a different feeling, different excitement and thrill, said Vinod Yadav, a resident of Borivli.We constantly innovate, said Rupesh as he rolls out the extensive menu that looks like a tabloid-sized newspaper.Caf Hydro will soon become happening place for Mumbaikars, said Rupesh. The menu has been designed looking at the taste of patrons and we constantly take their suggestions, he added.Mouth-watering itemsSome of the fast-moving food items include dishes from surimi, a paste made from fish or other seafood meat, which can be used as a primary ingredient for several dishes. Fish onion ring is another interesting mouth-watering item and so is Thai fish cake.The list also includes fried fish balls, cholli garlic fish bullets, crispy chicken pops, seafood har gow, grilled chicken and prawns shanghai, grilled fish cake bao and peri peri chicken roll. Vegetarian items include bao, hand-cut potato batons, herbed potato wedges and cheesy onion rings.Besides Continental and Thai cuisine, the restaurant also offers simple Indian food like rice and chicken curry. There is a big spread of desserts and mocktails as well.As of now it is a no-liquor restaurant. Asked about this, Sakpal said: As of now we are on the launch mode. The aquarium shop is huge. On display are 425 fish tanks and over 325 species of marine and freshwater fish. After a meal at the caf, one can see and buy fish tanks, aquarium lights, tank decoration equipment, artificial waterfall, etc. Spa for pets is the another interesting thing.Asian Arowana is the brand ambassador of Caf Hydro. Arowana basically seen in various Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia. The shop has a wide range here. One can purchase a pair of guppy for around Rs 50. The shop also fish species ranging between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh.Some of the commonest ornamental fishes include guppy (lebistes reticulatus), molly (mollienisia latipinna), sword tail (xiphophorous hellerii), platy (xiphophorus varitus), siamesr fighter (betta splendens), angel (pterophyllum scalare), tiger barb (barbus tetrazona) and widow tetra (gymnocorymbus ternetzi)."
593ae62d7be9e00e1ecd3ee0,Virulent vegetarians,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170403/jsp/opinion/story_144086.jsp,2017-04-03,"First they went after slaughterhouses. Then they turned to meat shops. Next they will invade our kitchens. That is not all. Yesterday beef was taboo. Today it is mutton. Tomorrow it will be fish and fowl, and eggs too. Let us be warned. The vigilantes are on the rampage and Uttar Pradesh is only their latest stomping ground. Within 24 hours of being sworn in as chief minister of India's most populous state, Yogi Adityanath ordered a state-wide crackdown on slaughterhouses. Officially, the drive is targeting ""illegal"" abattoirs and meat shops, but hundreds of legal slaughterhouses too have been sealed by the administration for violating some rule or other. Since slaughterhouses have to comply with a complex maze of over two dozen rules, it is easy to find some minor infraction to justify a shut down. As for the plethora of unlicensed operations, ground reports from UP indicate that one key reason for these is that no new licences were issued for the last 15 years, thanks largely to the aggressive movement launched by Adityanath and his Hindu Yuva Vahini musclemen. Afraid to frontally take on the Hindutva brigades, and yet mindful that a significant section of the state's Muslim populace was directly dependent on the meat trade, the previous state governments allowed the businesses to continue without any official licence. In any case, abattoirs and meat shops are certainly not the only businesses that operate without a licence. Thousands of small and micro enterprises in India's teeming informal sector - from vegetable vendors to pan sellers, barber shops to roadside dhabas - thrive in a grey zone that is not strictly legal but far from being criminal. But then the Adityanath government's drive has little to do with what is legal or illegal. It stems, on the surface, from a deep-seated hatred towards the Muslim minority and is aimed at crippling them both economically and culturally. In this, Adityanath is not alone. In state after Bharatiya Janata Party-ruled state, the drive against meat shops and abattoirs is gaining ground: authorities in Rajasthan, Uttarakhand, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh have also been instructed to 'lay down the law' and shut down enterprises that have been quietly doing business for years. And where the law is not on their side, 'persuasion' in the name of 'sentiment' is the new tactic. Last week, for instance, a vigilante outfit by the name of Shiv Sena (which Uddhav Thackeray has since disowned) went around shutting hundreds of meat and chicken shops in Gurgaon on the outskirts of the national capital since ""Navratri"" was on. The group issued notices warning the owners not to open their shops on Tuesdays and during the nine-day festival. A spokesman of the outfit told reporters, ""A number of Hindus keep fast during Navratri and every Tuesday. It does not feel good to see meat being sold and served on this day..."" Most of the shopkeepers - belonging largely to the minority community - complied with the 'request', he added. Hindu Yuva Vahini, Bajrang Dal, Shiv Sena, Bharatiya Gau Raksha Dal - these groups go by many names, their activities seemingly uncoordinated, their organizations apparently autonomous. That is just a faade. In truth, they have all been spawned and nurtured by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh's ideology that its practitioners proudly label ""cultural nationalism"". The goal of ""cultural nationalism"" is the creation of a Hindu rashtra whose primary enemies, on the face of it, are the beef-eating Muslims and Christians. But the real intent of cultural nationalism goes much deeper: it aims at creating a monolithic ""Hindu"" identity and abhors the bewildering diversity of cultural practices that make up the tapestry of Hinduism. Food is central to culture, to identity, to community and is not just something we put into our mouths for bodily sustenance. Whether consciously or subliminally, the Hindu Right is deeply aware of this subversive power of taste and tradition and that explains its obsession with the eating habits of people, its aggressive efforts to impose a 'Hindu' diet that goes well beyond the taboo against cow meat - which itself is far from universal even among practising Hindus in India. Although individuals in the BJP or even the RSS may be non-vegetarian, the dominant impulse of the sangh parivar is a virulent vegetarianism - signs of which have become much more evident in recent years. BJP-ruled states such as Madhya Pradesh have doggedly refused to supply eggs under the school mid-day meal scheme in spite of its proven nutritional value for growing children; vegetarian fare - particularly Gujarati snacks - has become de rigueur at official functions in Delhi; and bans on the selling of mutton, chicken, eggs and fish on Hindu festival days is becoming more frequent. While vegetarianism is a growing fad in the West too, in India it has a much longer and complex history - deeply entwined with the notions of 'purity' and 'pollution' that underlie the caste system. Ages before the famous French anthropologist, Claude Lvi-Strauss, produced his path-breaking work, The Raw and the Cooked, to explore culture in culinary terms and offered the raw-cooked-rotten food triad, ayurveda divided foods as tamasic (stale or rotten), rajasic (stimulating) and sattvic (pure and calming). Tamasic foods that include all meats were regarded the most inferior and fostered tamas (darkness, sloth, lethargy) while rajasic evoked excitement and passion. A sattvic diet - strictly vegetarian that eschews garlic, onion and spices too - was considered the best, and said to promote calmness and equanimity, the prescribed diet of sages and priests. Over the centuries, the subtler essence of this classification got vulgarized and food rigidities came to mirror social inequities. The upper castes, in particular the Brahmins, used their vegetarian diet to buttress claims of sattvic superiority over flesh-eating lower castes. Movements like the Arya Samaj also added to the cult of vegetarianism. With Nagpur Brahmins dominating the RSS leadership, the orthodox upper caste Hindu's visceral revulsion to meat - coupled with fear and loathing for the meat-eating Muslim - became embedded in the sangh's psyche; as did the myth of the spiritually elevated vegetarian Hindu. Never mind that serenity and equanimity are the last qualities that come to mind when we witness the vitriolic outpourings of the saffron-robed political "" yogis"" and ""sadhvis"" in our midst. What the RSS-inspired vigilantes deliberately overlook is that a vast majority of Hindus are non-vegetarian. According to the Baseline Survey of 2014 by the Census of India, 71.6 per cent of Indian males and 70.6 per cent of Indian females are non-vegetarian. In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Bengal, the figure crosses 98 per cent. Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Odisha closely follow, with over 97 per cent non-vegetarians, while the figure is 93 per cent in Bihar. And, as is well known, Brahmins, too, are traditionally and determinedly non-vegetarian in states such as Kashmir, Bengal, Bihar, Assam, Odisha and along the western coast. Yet, there is a concerted effort to push vegetarianism as quintessentially Hindu - and imposing this stealthily through a combination of coercion and persuasion, fear and shaming. Non-vegetarians, rarely, if ever, force anyone to eat meat - respecting the tenets of dietary freedom that militant vegetarians increasingly refuse to reciprocate. Sadly, meat-eating Hindus have not come out in protest against ""Navratri"" fiats that are slowly becoming the norm. Nor have they shown any solidarity so far with the hapless butchers and cooks who dish out delicious kababs and biryanis that millions of Hindus consume with gusto. The saffron mobs, backed by State power, may be targeting the visible ""Other"" today. Tomorrow it will be the rest of us, our choice of cuisine, our way of life..."

The strike is set to enter the fourth day on Monday. While prices of some vegetables have crashed, there's glut of others because they aren't being lifted from the city and its neighbouring villages. Also, some vegetables have become dearer as they aren't being ferried to the city, leading to a shortage.""I got my last delivery of onions three days ago. I was supposed to receive another shipment on Monday, but now that doesn't seem likely,"" said Seyid, 21, a vendor in KR Market . While Seyid continued to sell onions at the same price as before, he said he might be forced to jack up the rates if he doesn't get new stock soon.Pushpa and Venkateshappa get their provisions from the Kalasipalya wholesale market. The couple normally trades in cauliflowers, drumsticks and carrots. ""It's very bad. We last got a delivery two days ago. We haven't been getting anything fresh. The cauliflowers have begun to rot. I usually sell each cauliflower head for Rs 25-30. Now, with everything spoiling, I wouldn't even get Rs 10 for a piece,"" said Pushpa, adding normally she would sell carrots and drumsticks for Rs 15-20 per kilo, but the prices have shot up to Rs 35-40 due to the strike.Pyarejaan, 64, who gets onions from the Yeshwanthpur APMC four times a week, said he hasn't faced any problem so far, but might in a couple of days when he'll run out of stock. Ibraz Khan, a wholesaler in Kalasipalya, gets his produce from Karnataka, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh. While his prevailing stocks will last for a few days, he says he isn't receiving new shipments.""If there is a shortage of a particular vegetable, the price will rise. But if there is an excess, we'll have to lower the prices substantially,"" he said. ""Since truckers are on strike in south India, I'll have to pay Rs 5,000-15,000 extra to those ferrying potatoes from northern states,"" he added.Ilias, a potato, onion and garlic wholeseller, said that his stock will last only two more days. ""Price per bori (50kg sack) has gone up by Rs 50. Additionally, we were earlier selling onions at Rs 10 per kg; now the price has increased to Rs 15,"" he said.""As of now vans and tempos seem to be doing most of the transporting, something that may not be sustainable in the long run as they aren't equipped for inter-state deliveries,"" he added.Vendors in Russel Market were largely unaware of the ongoing strike and said business is continuing as usual. Aslam Amin, a vendor, said three tempos come from the City Market every day with his stock, and that the strike hasn't disrupted this schedule. ""Our stock will last for another week, so we haven't been affected. However, if the strike continues, we might have a problem,"" said Mushtaq Ahmed, a vendor who gets his vegetables from Yeshwantpur and Kalasipalya markets.Noor, a small-time vendor, gets 10-15 kg of each vegetable every day, but received his last shipment two days ago. ""If this goes on, I won't have anything to sell,"" he said.Truckers are protesting the Centre's move to scrap old vehicles and levy toll on state highways, and are demanding a reduction in third-party premium paid to insurance firms.Not in a mood to relent, truckers intensified their strike on Sunday with nearly 23 lakh vehicles transporting important commodities staying off the roads.G R Shanmugappa, president of the Karnataka State Lorry Owners and Agents Association, said they'd continue their protest till they get a response from the central government and the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority (IRDA).""Some 23 lakh trucks stayed off the roads on Sunday throughout the south zone. We have also got an assurance from LPG association workers that they'll support us in our protest. There are only three filling stations for the four southern states - in Mangaluru, Vizag and Salem and they have informed us that they'll not go in for filling. We are also in talks with petrol and diesel association workers who have said they will join us from Monday,"" he said.The truckers are protesting high insurance premiums and scrapping of old vehicles. According to Shanmugappa, private insurance companies are hand in glove with central government agencies as well as IRDA to ensure that decisions benefit them alone. ""They do this once a year. Hike the rates and wait for the money to flow in. They earn crores through this. But we'll not give up till we get some respite,"" he said.However, the truckers' leader said they had not interfered with the supply of certain crucial commodities. ""We have not disrupted transportation of some essential commodities like milk, medicines and water because we don't want the public to suffer. However, the supply of wheat flour, corn meal, finger millet and other foodgrains has been affected,"" he said.Commenting on the strike, chief minister Siddaramaiah on Sunday said that he has directed transport minister Ramalinga Reddy to hold meetings with the truckers' association to resolve the issue soon."

Within six months, they got the best results by growing a minimum of 3 to 4 quintals of onion seeds in an acre of land. Krishi Vigyan Kendra scientist Sarvagnay Salimath said that amidst severe drought, farmers in the district decided to support the authorities in conducting the systematic experiment and succeeded. Farmers used to depend on dealers from other States to get onion seeds, but their problem would be sorted now as they would get them at low cost in the district itself.At present, the good quality onion seeds cost around Rs. 2,000 per packet and if farmers get yield by cultivating them, they can earn profit, he said.Farmers Revanna, Ravindra and Rajappa, who have grown onion seeds, said that the move would play a crucial role in ensuring good profit to farmers who are in pathetic condition owing to drought. Easy availability of seeds would make farmers take up more cultivation of the onion crop, they said."

The chefs at the roadside joints knew the palate of their customers. They did not have to imagine hard for a hybrid snack, having earlier successfully tried their hands at recreating an aloo-da-paratha or mooli paratha or a gobhi paratha with chicken, mutton or fish stuffing. The plain, innocent pakoda is the worst victim. It had seen lacto-vegetable stuffing earlier, but lately has to bear with the more thriving non-vegetarian filling such as the chicken pakoda or the fish pakoda.Now the saddest part. The ubiquitous golgappa, which also goes by the name pani puri or gup-chup in the West and the East of India respectively, are being sold with chicken stuffing in metros like Mumbai and Calcutta. The mashed potato is the victim again. The days are not far when the same will be sold in your neighbourhood joints. These innovations lack creativity and are simply brazen acts of stealing from the recipes of our great-great-grandparents across India.""If it was not for the chicken stuffing inside it, I would never try it in the first place,"" a friend, relishing chicken samosa at a roadside joint, once confided in me in a whisper. I appreciated his sensibility. He perhaps whispered to avoid offending the simple, authentic samosa on my plate. That's guilty consciousness there. I had to return the gesture. I contained my aversion for the metamorphosed food on his plate and reciprocated with a smile. I said okay. Long live our Indian snacks! Now the days are not far when even our pani puri with chicken stuffing will be available in the Indian restaurants in the West, with happy native takers!Email: gurbirwrites@gmail.com"

(File Photo) As against the 3 lakh odd hectares which was sown for Rabi onions this year Maharashtra has seen only about 2.2 lakh hectares of onion plantation for the current year. (File Photo)As onion exports from India clocks an all time high, the central government has decided to extend the 5 per cent subsidy on the produce till end of August. This would be the second time that the central government has increased the window of the subsidy to stabilise onion prices in the last six months in the wholesale markets.With a glut in onions due to increased acreage, the central government had reduced the minimum export price (MEP) to zero in December 2015. However, as prices failed to recover last year the government had announced a 5 per cent export subsidy under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme (MEIS).Initially, the subsidy was supposed to be till March end but has been extended to August end of this year.Onion exports from India witnessed a steady rise with the year 2016 clocking the highest ever exports in the last 10 years. Total of 23,99,822.48 metric tonnes (MT) of the bulb was exported last year as against 11,14,418.13 mt of exports recorded in the year 2015. Singapore, Malaysia, UAE, Sri Lanka and Philippines have emerged as major export destinations for Indian onions. Khariff, late Khariff and now Rabi onions are going off shore.However, the steady export has not done much good to the wholesale price of onions. Prices at Lasalgaon market in Nashik district continued to hover between Rs 5-6 per kg much to the distress of the farmers.The state government had announced a special scheme to compensate for losses encountered by growers at the rate of Rs 1 per kg. In view of the low prices the crucial Rabi area has seen an alarming decrease.As against the 3 lakh odd hectares which was sown for Rabi onions this year Maharashtra has seen only about 2.2 lakh hectares of onion plantation for the current year. Rabi onion feeds the market between March to October and is the only produce which can be stored.Jagdish Apshunde, an onion exporter from Nashik wholesale market, reasoned that the glut due to bumper production of the last two years has not led to price rise. However now that people will be storing their onions, there are chances of a slight price hike in the near future, he said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Representative imageThe proposed Indira canteens have hit a new hurdle with two major hoteliers associations conveying to the Karnataka government that they cannot supply food for the proposed outlets as it is not feasible for them from the economic point of view.Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had set aside Rs 100 crore in the budget for 2017-18 to establish Indira canteens in the 198 wards of Bengaluru. It is almost designed on the lines of Amma canteens of Tamil Nadu. It is supposed to serve breakfast, lunch and dinner at an affordable price.Initially, the government had been in talks with Iskcon for supply of food to these canteens. The government wants garlic and onion in the food. But, Iskcon expressed its inability to use both in its preparations. Later, the government approached two major hoteliers associations.The hoteliers associations are not interested in the offer made by the government. For them, it is a conflict of interest. Any involvement in running the canteens including supply of food will mean affecting their own business interest, they say. This despite the government stating that it will reimburse the expenses and also ensure the hoteliers make profit.Bruhat Bengaluru Hotels Association, with around 2,000 hotels in BBMP region as its members, was approached by the Food and Civil Supplies Department to supply food to the canteens. The 81-year-old association, which is one of the oldest in Karnataka, has outright rejected the proposal.We have our own problems. Catering is not an easy task. There is shortage of manpower. So, we rejected it, Association President B Chandrashekar Hebbar said.Hebbar said the hoteliers were asked to provide details like quantity and ingredients that will be going into the food preparations and also their rate chart. However, the association did not respond.Karnataka Pradesh Hoteliers and Restaurants Association, which is an umbrella organisation comprising hoteliers associations in all districts, too has rejected the government offer. Its president M Rajendra, like Hebbar, has said it is not financially viable to supply prepared food.Besides, he said the concept of providing subsidised food itself is flawed. Any government should help the poor stand up on their own. They should feel proud that they are earning. They should not be made to depend on any freebies, Rajendra said.Food and Civil Supplies Minister U T Khader said the reason his department approached the hoteliers was to utilise their expertise. We had explained to them that their business will not be affected as the canteens are meant not to wean away their regular customers but for the poor, Khader said.He said the government is not banking only on the hoteliers for supplies. Many NGOs, youth associations and even individuals have come forward showing interest in the scheme. We will talk to them soon."

Petrol and diesel tankers, however, continued to ply although they have supported the strike.The South India Motor Transport Association (SIMTA) has been on strike objecting to the Centres decision to raise third-party insurance premium of vehicles by as much as 50 per cent.Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, president of Bengaluru Wholesale Foodgrains and Pulses Merchants Association, said, Except onion and potato, supply of all other perishable goods has been hit. There is shortage of essentials like sugar, jaggery and pulses.He added, Transactions have been impacted heavily, especially in Yeshwantpur market. Although the protest has extended to other states in the south, there have been no issues in Chennai and Puducherry.Mysuru and Bengaluru are bearing the brunt.Secretary of Akhila Karnataka Federation of Petroleum Traders Ranjith Hegde said, Petrol pumps across the state are open and tankers are plying. We have extended our support symbolically and we totally disagree with the taxes and hike in insurance premium.However, we have innumerable formalities like writing letters to oil companies to be carried out before we join the protest physically. The decision to formally join them will be taken after discussion, he said.Voicing similar opinion, Bhushan Narang, president of Bangalore Petroleum Dealers Association, said, There is no impact on petrol or diesel. Vehicles are moving as usual. As of now, there are no plans to join the protest.Ravindra, a member of SIMTA, said that representatives of central government are likely to call for a meeting on Wednesday to discuss the matter.He said, Petrol and diesel associations are supposed to join the strike from Wednesday. Around 4,000 tankers were off the roads on Tuesday.We will launch an all-India protest on April 8 if our demands are not met."

58f519067be9e01a17c9295c,The summer fruit king,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/goa/the-summer-fruit-king/articleshow/58087550.cms,2017-04-09,"Summer is the time for nature to put the brightly coloured kokum or bhirandam fruits on their trees, mainly in India's Western Ghats region. Seven species of this garcinia indica are endemic to the Ghats, growing its dense canopy of leaves and yielding fruit even with little or no care.It is no wonder, then, that Goans, as in the rest of the Konkan, learnt to harvest this fruit in the summer and devised ways to use it year round. Just like the mango panh or panak, the fresh bhirandam fruit is also used to make a refreshing summer drink.The fruits are washed and broken open to separate the seed and outer rind. Adding water little by little, the pulp is extracted from the seed and skin of the fruit. As bhirandam are known for their sourness, one requires at least half a kilo of jaggery for the extract of every 15 medium-sized fruits. Dilute the mixture of the pulp and jaggery to a thin, transparent consistency and add salt and pepper and cardomom powder to taste.The skin of the fruit left behind can then be dried in the summer sun to get the blackish solam, which are preserved and used as a souring agent in food , in place of tamarind, round the year. Usually, the rind of bhirandam are dried without extracting the pulp and if you have made your solam after taking the pulp from it, you will need to add more of them to achieve the sourness you desire.To store the kokam extract like a squash, much after the summer is gone, add minimal water when extracting the pulp and add jaggery and salt to it and bring the mixture to a boil. Cool and store in a bottle in the refrigerator. This squash can be preserved for up to six months, if done right.If you are not a fan of sweet drinks, just soak the dried sollam into some water and squeeze the sourness out of them. Add salt, finely chopped green chillies, asafoetida and coriander and dilute with water to make a drink of thin consistency. This footi kodi is usually had following a meal and is believed to help digestion. But one may also gulp it down as a drink with a ting of jaggery for taste.Kokum also gives us the famous Goan sol kodi, with coconut milk, had as an accompaniment to a rice meal.Solam are also locally used to rub on insect bites for relief from the sting.They are especially useful when cooking local forest produce like aalloo, surran and maadi, which are rubbed with the sollam so that they do not irritate the mouth on eating. The solam are rubbed on the hand while cutting these foods too, to safeguard the hands from the itching sensation.Sollam are a key ingredient in tisreo sukhem, the vegetarian gravy tondak where sollam add the flavour in the absense of onion in the masala and in the mixed vegetable Goan khatkhatem. It goes with any fish curry too.If you have a kokum tree in your reach, the tender, reddish leaves of the tree are also edible and carry the same sourness as the fruit. Eating these leaves with salt is just a fun, childish thing to do, if you find yourself in the Western Ghats, near a kokum tree in the summer."

As a result, farmers have started feeding areca nut sheaths to cattle at Machenahalli.The village, located 35 km away from the district headquarters, is reeling under drought for the last eight years. The farmers are struggling to feed fodder to their cattle as the district administration has not opened fodder bank. Those who have a few animals are selling them to tide over the situation at lower prices. The situation is same at Kurubarahalli, Thandya, Shankaranahalli and K B Hal.Theerthamma, a villager, said, Our men visit areca nut farms and wait for the falling of areca sheaths and get them to feed the cattle. Women have to walk for miles to fetch a pot of water. We are struggling day in and day out to get fodder for cattle. There is no employment for us in the surrounding areas as well. We are bearing the brunt of drought.The villagers said the government has increased the incentives for motivating dairy farmers. But the milching cows are dying without fodder. A fodder bank was opened at Belavadi two months ago and fodder was distributed only to a few people. The fodder did not reach our village. If the situation continues, then cattle will did due to lack of fodder and drinking water, they rued.The villagers said water is not being supplied through tankers. A barrel of water was supplied on the previous day of Ugadi festival. After that, the tankers have not come to the village. About 95% of the borewells have dried up, they said.Nanjundappa, a 70-year-old farmer, said, The village lake had received water in 2010 after the Belavadi Doddakere overflowed.

However, due to perishable nature of fruits and vegetables and more dependency on climatic factor, many times these crops face either glut or shortage thereby affecting farmers as well as consumers.""The glut situations are observed in many crops like tomato, onion , potato as well as garlic which lead to heavy fluctuations in area and production in subsequent years. The seminar will focus on various issues related to the topic and formulate policies and strategies to avoid the problems faced by the farmers,"" said an official from NHRDF.The prices of vegetables are decided on the demand and supply ratio. Onion prices go up if demand is more as compared to supply and the prices crash if supply is huge as compared to the demand.The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 400 to Rs 500 in the past six months due to arrivals of onions in large quantity at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee markets. It costs Rs 1,000 for producing one quintal onion. Accordingly, farmers incur losses if the prices go below that. Hence, this workshop will help farmers understand the glut management for vegetables particularly onions.Divisional revenue commissioner Eknath Dawale will inaugurate the event."

In the last 15 days, prices of many vegetables have more than doubled barring that of potato and onion.In retail markets and shops in Satellite area, except potatoes and onions, no other vegetable is available at rates below Rs 50 per kg. While in Agriculture Produce Market Committee, (APMC), Ahmedabad, brinjal is selling somewhere between Rs8-Rs16 per kg in wholesale, the same is selling in retail at Rs 60 per kg in city localities.The prices of vegetables at APMC have gone up by around 15%, while in retail the prices have almost doubled. Officials from APMC said that all vegetables, except potatoes and onions, are in short supply.According to Gujarat agriculture department, the sowing of vegetables, which was normally done across 1.24 lakh hectares was done only across 82,000 hectares. The department however claims that the sowing of vegetable was around 9,000 hectares more than that in last year.Prices of several vegetables had crossed the Rs 100 mark in retail market in 2016, but had eased after demonetization.Agriculture minister, Chiman Sapariya, however, said, ""The shortfall in sowing has no relation with demonetization. The sowing was delayed because there was less rainfall in 2016, and hence farmers moved away from vegetable to crops that needed less water.""""We hope that prices will likely come down within the next fortnight when the summer crop starts to arrive. The prices are generally on the higher side during this period,"" said D M Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad.Patel said, ""During demonetization, bulk buyers were away from the market.

If you thought 'classroom chaos', you're off the mark. Now, speaking of mark... it's the evaluation process that seems to be keeping them up all night. Mirror spoke with PU lecturers to know what's going on with the evaluation process. Many of them admitted that going through answer scripts was, too often, a task that required a certain emotional durability Here's an example quoted by a lecturer, who had to evaluate a student on his write-up on the Chipko Movement. Instead of an answer, this is what the lecturer got. ""Sir, please pass me this one time. I honestly tell you that I know everything about Vandana Shiva. But at the moment I can't recall anything about her.""This 'Ghajini' student didn't just stop there. Instead of Chipko Movement, he wrote paras after paras trying to convince the evaluator why he should be passed and how, if done so, he will go on to become a Vandana Shiva himself one day and ""re-start"" a new Chipko movement.While some take the coax-plead-beg route, some are self-confessed hard-workers, calling for their ""efforts"" to be appreciated. For example, this was the note left in Kannada by a student in his English exam answer script: ""Sir, I am a Kannada student and don't know to write in English. I have tried my level best to answer your English exam in Kannada. You need to appreciate my efforts and pass me.""This may bring to mind the recent case of an SSLC student who ""mistakenly"" took his first language test in English instead of Kannada. He then went back home and got his parents to demand a pardon/re-exam from the board.Evaluators say that the 'emotional' card is too frequently played. Take, for example, this one: ""There are valid reasons for you to pass me as I don't have parents and need to take care of my siblings. Know that you're not holding in your hands a pen, but my future.""The lecturer said: ""I recall one more incident where a student had written that his father was a soldier and had died fighting for the country and so he couldn't study for exams."" And another one claimed that if he/she didn't score above 80 per cent, their parents would discontinue their studies. The lecturer said that while they wouldn't pay heed to such pleadings, these do sometimes take a toll on them, emotionally.* DO OR DIE""If the evaluator doesn't pass me, I shall be forced to do black magic on him and his family so that all of them die. I am a good student and have written all other papers well. But Maths is tough. And it's not my fault that it is tough. I dream of going to college like my brothers. If I fail, my family will abuse me and I will be forced to hang myself.""* ALL FOR LOVEOne answer script narrated in detail why the student must be given marks and be passed. Apparently, he was deeply in love with a girl and planned to ask her hand in marriage (ahem... underage?) but the girl refuses to have a loser for a husband. So unless the examiner is gracious enough, he'll lose in the exam, and also the girl.* AND THEN, THIS""On Sunday, I tried making chicken sambar at home. I want to share the recipe with you. First, I bought a kilo of chicken from the market. The chicken was of good quality. To start with, I had to chop it into pieces, then add masala and grind it with onion in a mixer-grinder. Then you can prepare sambar that will be really tasty."""

She was my first mentor and sole inspiration to get into cooking. From the classic rajma chawal with homemade curd to the simple spice-flavoured raitha, I learnt it all from her. My first every dish was methi chicken and stuffed gobi paratha  one of my favourites!I was born in Dehradun, but spent my whole life in Lucknow  the flavours, currys, biriyani, kebabs, kormas, parathas  being a foodie, it was a great place to live. Following my mothers instructions and watching several TV shows, I began to think about the fast-food culture in the country  most places offer western fast food. I wanted to give delicious and healthy Indian fast-food and started a take-away joint in Lucknow  spinach, ragii rolls with fish, chicken and soya were very famous.I love experimenting with food and thats what keeps me going  golgappas served the molecular way, ulta tawa paratha and galouti kabab, frozen chicken tikka salad are what I love to cook in Modern Indian cuisine.Though I know several cuisines including Japanese and continental, my roots remain in Awadhi cuisine. From cooking Gosht meat with garlic (whole pulp) and onion and transforming it into a flavoursome curry to barsi meat (meat prepared and stored for a day, a Pakistani concept), I enjoy doing it all. Ingredients like javitri, dry rose petals, cardamom and cinnamon are my best friends. Their aromas give new dimension to food and can be used in both sweets and savoury items. Its magic!Speaking of sweets Sohan halwa, a toffee-like sweet made of wheat, water and sugar is famous in Lucknow and Delhi. Its my number one favorite, followed by rasagulla, kala jamun and lucknowi kulfi falooda.I enjoy cooking for my family. My ultimate dream is to visit Japan and learn about their authentic dishes.

Hence, we want to try this smart and new idea of going on strike to awaken the government, which is not ready to take any farmer centric policy decision , said Yogesh Rayate, a grape farmer from Nashik district.He said he has been waiting for about a decade for the government to allow import of African grape varieties, which could reduce the production cost by half and have better acceptability in the international market.Having spent Rs 70,000 as primary expenses on a two-acre brinjal plot, Rayate has been asking anyone and everyone to take the brinjals for free as the price in the local market has dropped to just about Rs 2.5 per kg. About 40-50 villages from Nifad and Chandvad talukas have contacted me for joining the agitation, said Rayate.Farmers have demanded complete loan waiver, supply of free electricity to farms, implementation of the recommendations of the Swaminathan Committee Report, full subsidy for micro irrigation systems and a minimum price of Rs 50 per litre for milk.The Lasalgaon agriculture produce market committee, the largest in Asia for onions, had organised a meeting to take guidance from Dhanajay Jadhav from Puntamba village of Ahmednagar district, where the first resolution to go on strike was passed on April 3. Since then, the leaderless movement appears to have spread like wildfire, with about 70 villages having passed the resolution to join the strike.The agitating farmers have decided to submit their resolutions en masse to the government on May 1, when it is mandatory for all the village panchayats to organise gram sabhas. Villages in vicinity of Lasalgaon have decided to join the agitation as onion prices have fallen to about half the cost of production. Our teams will spread out from April 22 to different parts of the state to explain the demands to the villagers, said Jadhav.Farmers have decided to involve the cooperative dairies, which they claim have agreed to refuse sale of liquid milk and instead process it into various milk products from June 1."

Much disappointed are 1,500-odd farmers in tribal hamlets in the Anaimalai Tiger Reserve. For the first time in a decade, these farmers were prepared to stop using chemical fertilizers and begin organic farming . But lack of rainfall has forced them to postpone sowing to April or June.NGOs and experts have suggested alternate cropping pattern to tribal farmers living at hamlets in the ATR. ""Due to various factors such as green revolution and migration of people to forest fringes, the traditional farming methods of tribals changed and this affected the entire ecosystem. The farmers in this region traditionally sowed millets, grain amaranthus, black gram and groundnuts. But they slowly shifted to rice and beans due to competition and to increase their revenue. But use of fertilizers was affecting rivers and streams inside the forest, which is a tiger reserve,"" said Peter Prem Chakravathi, a biologist working with the tribal farmers in the ATR for the past three years.""They are beginning to realise that living inside the forest they cannot pollute the environment,"" said a forest official.The major tribal hamlets that are under focus are Kodanthur, Poparai and Thalinji in the Udumalpettai division. Other hamlets that are also getting trained are Kodar, Malasar, Malai Malasar, Maduvar, Pulayur and Eravalar.P Mullai, senior project officer of World Wildlife Fund who is training and orienting the tribals, said, ""Their traditional method is natural farming. But after middlemen increased, they began producing short-term crops using a lot of fertilizers and chemicals. But slowly, we are trying to create awareness and nearly 40% of the farmers have agreed to shift to organic farming. Next week, we are taking them to Udhagamandalam to visit farms that use traditional methods,"" said Mullai.Forest rangers and officials said the only deterrent was marketing their produce. ""We are trying the show them the demand for organic produce and are trying to tie up with organisations to market their products. Once that is finalised, we can create a model and make all tribal communities follow the best practices,"" said a forest ranger.The farmers are slowly realising the multi-cropping system can get more revenue. ""Last year, they suffered huge losses as all the farmers only produced beans. But this year, TNAU has agreed to supply hybrid varieties that will increase their yield. We are hopeful that by June the cultivation would begin and the 958 sqkm area of ATR, which is biologically one of the most important part of the Western Ghats, will be preserved for the future generations,"" said Mullai.G V Rajalingam, assistant professor at TNAU, said the tribal farmers can adopt the latest technologies and grow ladies finger, small onion and cauliflower instead of paddy, lablabs and French beans. Also, crops like beetroot and turnips were suggested for the winter season."

But, the vegetarian varieties that using mushroom or pumpkin or okras are also fairly common,"" says executive chef at Cidade de Goa, Sunit Sharma.The light yellowish-green gravy is prepared by grinding together a mix of spices like cumin, coriander, garlic and turmeric with grated coconut. The resultant paste is then strained to obtain what is called the first press coconut milk. The extraction of the second press follows post the addition of a little bit of water, and it is in the second press extract that the dish is prepared.Cooking the caldinho begins with a dash of chopped onions and some tomatoes that are used to give the curry some texture. But, one must keep in mind the acidity factor of the tomatoes during preparation. ""The tomatoes' acidic nature is highly likely to cause the coconut milk to curdle if you are not careful. It's important to use just the optimum amount of tomatoes to prevent the gravy from losing its flavour,"" says Oswin Pinto , owner and chef at Hogworth, Miramar. ""If you aren't sure, the best idea is to avoid the tomatoes entirely,"" he advises.ith its origins hidden in the ubiquitous broth or soup , the caldinho is yet another outcome of the amalgamation of Portuguese and Konkani influences that gives Goan cuisine its unique character Named after the caldo, which means soup in Portuguese, the caldinho is probably one of the most understated yet versatile dishes of the coastal state's culinary offerings.This creamy curry was once served at the dining table of the elite. ""Caldinho was eaten with bread by the rich as the first course of the meal during the Portuguese era. Besides the high-value fish, an entire coconut goes into making one plate of caldinho, which makes its preparation an expensive affair,"" says owner of Viva Panjim, Linda D'Souza.Unlike conventional curries that are heavy on spices and chillies, the caldinho is prepared using a generous amount of coconut milk. In another recipe, grated coconut is cooked till it turns into a paste.The principal ingredientbe it fish, or prawns, or vegetablesare added once the onion turns translucent, and the second press coconut milk extract follows soon after. The stew is then allowed to simmer till the ingredients are properly cooked and topped off with the first press coconut milk.The curry sauce is not spicy in the vegetarian caldinho either, but continues to be flavourful like its seafood counterpart. The caldinho goes well with traditional Goan rice or bread and is best served piping hot.""It is easy to cook and lends itself well to a variety of ingredients,"" says Sharma. ""While it might seem unlikely that a coastal state like Goa would have a vegetarian version of the caldinho, the long periods of abstinence from non-vegetarian food, practised by both Christian and Hindu communities has seen the dish evolve over time,"" he adds."

Picture shows MPCC president Ashok Chavan at a Sangharsh Yatra rally.PTIPTIAmidst demands of farm loan waiver in Maharashtra, the State government has announced Advanced Farming  Enriched Farmer scheme, with an aim to increase farmers income by cutting production cost and increasing the output.The scheme will be launched in the upcoming kharif season. Under the initiative, the government has declared each tehsil in the State as a unit where planning will be done for agri-development. The major tasks that would be undertaken are: raising production of major crops (up to the level of its genetic yield potential), diversification of crops, introducing marketing techniques, uniting farmers through farm producers companies and making them financially stable.According to a government resolution published last week, each tehsil, under the scheme, will be given a production target for crops. The target would be planned keeping in mind that farmers, after selling their produce, receive more money than the loan they have obtained. For farmers who are already receiving more money than the loan obtained, the target is 20% more than their present production.Additionally, the government will also spend 60% of the fund available for mechanisation of farming on tractors, power tillers, transplanters, and machines for polishing, grading, and packing the produce. The grants will be deposited in farmers bank accounts linked to Aadhar.The government has also announced that it would increase grants for construction of green houses, onion shades, and shade nets, among others. A farmer outreach campaign will also be launched from May 25 to June 8, to inform farmers about the techniques to be used in agriculture ahead of the kharif season.The Opposition has been aggressively demanding farm loan waiver since the beginning of the Budget Session of the State Assembly in March. The major Opposition parties  the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP)  are presently touring the State under Sangharsh Yatra to press for their demand.Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has said that while his government wants to waive off the loan, a decision effecting the same will be taken only at the right time and not based on the Oppositions demands. He has also said the State government would invest more in agriculture rather than announcing a loan waiver. State Finance Minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, in his Budget speech last month, had also said that the government aims to double farmers income by 2022."

The decline was accentuated by decline in fuel and power inflation and manufactured products.... Fuel prices were significantly cut on March 31 while rupee has been on an appreciating trend since February 2017.These two factors have pushed down fuel and manufactured product prices, he said.Primary food inflation trended higher as vegetable inflation emerged after six months of deflation although food price pressures are not yet a concern, as prices of cereals, pulses and spices have fallen sequentially in the last two to three months, said an analysis by Nomura.Fuel price inflation moderated on favourable base effects and a fall in most market-linked fuels. Furthermore, manufactured inflation moderated sharply to 3% in March from 3.7% in February as prices for manufactured food, non-metallic minerals and machine tools declined sequentially while other categories experienced muted increases, it said.Food inflation has increased a bit and this would require greater monitoring in light of the evolving weather conditions, said Pankaj Patel, president of the industry body FICCI.The government is keeping a close tab on the progress made on irrigation projects, cold chain projects etc. and improvement in these areas is likely to yield positive results.The focus on drip irrigation and micro-irrigation along with improvement in the efficiency of cropping patterns and water use mechanisms will strengthen agri-production and productivity, he said. Commodity prices  crude as well as metal prices  had been edging up putting pressure on wholesale prices over the past few months. However, the WPI based inflation announced today shows a decline from the previous month and this can be attributed to softening of inflation in fuel and power and manufactured goods segments. Further, the recent strengthening of rupee vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar will also contribute towards limiting imported inflation, he said.Output pricesThe analysis done by Nomura research analysts Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf said: Despite the surge in input cost inflation since January, firms have been reluctant to raise output prices, likely reflecting uncertainty over the demand outlook after demonetisation.As demand recovers, we expect firms to start passing on past input cost increases to consumers and the sharp drop in perishable food inflation to reverse. Yet, we believe February marked the peak in year-on-year WPI inflation and it should gradually taper off over 2017 on base effects, they added.Considering the higher-than-expected WPI inflation in Q1, we are raising our 2017 forecast to 4.7% (from 4%) they said."

These safety practices will help develop and design tailor-made training material for street food vendors in future,"" the study pointed out. Of the 463 samples checked for microbial contamination, 163 were of salads, 150 of fruit juices, and 150 pani puri samples.The bacteria found on the food stuff analysed were S aureus, E coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia spp. ""Pani puri samples picked from the vendors, who did not have soap at the vending unit, had significantly higher contamination of faecal coliforms than those who had,"" the study revealed.The diseases they cause range from simple loose motions and vomiting to severe food poisoning, leading to even death. Earlier studies revealed that fountain soft drinks and sodas served even in big malls are contaminated with E coli."

According to the study, peeled and cut fruits left uncovered have 13.4 times risk of E coli contamination compared to the fruits kept in closed containers.""The purpose... is to identify and prioritize the key food safety practices among street food handlers that lead to microbial contamination. These safety practices will help develop and design tailor-made training material for street food vendors in future,"" the study pointed out. Of the 463 samples checked for microbial contamination, 163 were of salads, 150 of fruit juices, and 150 pani puri samples.The bacteria found on the food stuff analysed were S aureus, E coli, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Bacillus cereus, and Yersinia spp. ""Pani puri samples picked from the vendors, who did not have soap at the vending unit, had significantly higher contamination of faecal coliforms than those who had,"" the study revealed.The diseases they cause range from simple loose motions and vomiting to severe food poisoning, leading to even death. Earlier studies revealed that fountain soft drinks and sodas served even in big malls are contaminated with E coli."

We are looking to develop machines or mechanisms that can help perform various farming tasks efficiently.""Most of the students' prototypes were developed to be affordable, and decrease the amount of labour for farmers while addressing agronomical issues.A member of the student team that developed the milking machine, Subodh Kumar, said, ""The most common issues faced by farmers are knee joint and spine troubles, from carrying heavy loads and bending for long hours. This is why we developed this affordable device to milk cows without having to bend."" The onion harvester was another device which did not require the farmers to bend.A pesticide and fertilizer sprayer was also developed, which sprays automatically as the machine is pushed through the field. A lever connected to the wheels of the cart moves the pump of the spray gun.Karan Gohil, one of the students from the team who developed the sprayer, said, ""Carrying tanks of fertilizer or pesticides on the back over a long period can hurt the spine. Our prototype tries to reduce this carrying of loads on the back through an affordable device."" The display also had a device called ""PlowBot"", which is a three-in-one machine to plough, sow seeds and harrow the soil in one go. Vinod Ramakrishnan , who was part of a team that developed the device, said, ""These processes are usually done with tractors. But all farmers cannot afford tractors. However, these manually operated devices could cost as little as Rs 2,000 when mass produced."""

Sojitra revealed this to another farmer Chandu Vaghasiya, who worked on a neghbouring field, when the latter invited him for a cup of tea.

Uttam Kumar Reddy said the Chief Minister K. Chandrasekhar Rao has sensed the rising anti-incumbency wave in the State and the public meeting at Warangal was another attempt to hoodwink people with false promises.The CM is in fear, seeing the rising dissent and now wants to dilute it by making another round of false promises, he said while addressing a meeting organised by farmers of Mattampalli mandal on successful completion of several developmental schemes including Lift Irrigation Projects.Mr. Reddy ridiculed KCRs revived love for farmers and said agriculture sector remained neglected during the last three years. Farmers lost four consecutive crops and failed to get better prices for their produce during this Rabi season. Over 3,000 farmers committed suicide during the TRS regime and not a single family got the compensation of Rs. 6 lakh under GO 421.Moreover, no TRS leader visited the family of distressed farmers who committed suicide. He said Rs. 4,000 per acre fertilizer subsidy promised by the CM from next year was just an election gimmick and wanted Mr. Rao to prove his seriousness by paying the subsidy from the Khariff season.Taking a jibe at Gulabi Coolie, he said when IT Minister KT Rama Rao could raise Rs. 7 lakh by selling ice-cream, he should have sold chilli, turmeric and onion to help the farmers who are in deep distress for not getting remunerative prices for their produce.Mr. Reddy said the fear of students prevented KCR from addressing the centenary celebrations of Osmania University and it reflected how he has cheated the students and now fears them. As against the promise of giving one job in each household, he has failed to give even one job in all villages. Only KCR's family got four jobs after formation of Telangana,he said.Exuding confidence that Congress party was all set to come to power in 2019 elections, he announced that if voted to power, Congress Government would waive crop loans up to Rs. 2 lakh in one shot.He said the Government would create lakhs of jobs and all unemployed youth would be paid a monthly stipend until they get a job.

Vegans in Bengaluru meet up for a potluck and spend hours discussing ideas, political issues, recipes over a hearty vegan lunch at Cubbon Park.They have been meeting up since 2009 and the vegan community in the city has only been increasing. According to the vegans, there are roughly about 400 vegans in the city and majority have turned to veganism for reasons such as animal abuse.Veganism is a practice of abstaining from animal products and is also an underlining philosophy that rejects the commodity status of animals.Milesh Kumar, a software engineer decided to turn vegan in 2003 and had been living in the city for years. He read up on the plight of dairy industry and decided to make a concrete decision of turning vegan. His friends and family were not able to understand his decision but he was adamant. Realising the importance of keeping oneself driven in the choice made, he decided to look up for other people following the same practice.In 2009 it was easier to connect because of Facebook and soon enough an informal group was formed, ready to meet up and share a vegan lunch. The vegans have now started meeting regularly on the last Saturday of every month between January and November. December is the only month they dont meet because people enjoy vacations then.The upcoming vegan potluck will be held this coming Saturday on April 29 between 2 pm and 5pm. It is not important that only vegans should attend the potluck. Anybody who is curious can. Aakriti Gupta, attended a potluck two years ago when she was not a vegan. It took her almost half a year and a lot of contemplation before she decided to guarantee her path.There are only two criteria on attending the potluck. First of all the person should get his/her own vegan meal which can be shared with at least five people. The second point is that the person should take care of the utensils.Southie Food Can Easily Be Made VeganVegans will agree that most of the time people look at them in awe and question what do they really eat. Milesh Kumar has an answer for that. South India cuisines such as idly, sambar, rice, rasam are almost all vegan, it is just that it has not been identified as one. If you separate the dairy products from the South Indian food, everything is easily vegan, he says.He also argues that being vegan is not being deprived as most people believe it to be. We can enjoy the same food with different ingredients and now there are many options open. We dont drink cows milk but there are options such as soy milk, coconut milk, peanut milk etc. Last potluck I made rosogulla. I also ensure to take curd rice every potluck, the curd is from peanut milk, he adds.What being vegan meansBeing vegan means being compassionately driven to be responsible not just to avoid cruelty, shares Milesh who further adds how the animal industry contributes the most to greenhouse effect.Akriti learned about veganism and explored the subject with her husband. She was not so much of a cook at home but after she turned vegan she started cooking at home and enjoying recipes her friends gave her at potluck. It obviously takes more than one try to nail the dish though, she laughs.One of her favourite dishes is the pasta she makes by using potato, onion and cashews as the sauce. I add a lot of mushrooms because I love it and season it with the usual spices and herbs, she shares. Aakriti became a vegan strictly from the environment point of view. We constantly blame and question what the politicians are doing about the environment but we ourselves dont do anything. I wanted to change that about myself, she adds.As of today, we will find majority of vegans as adults who have made a choice by themselves.A countable number of vegans are children, because of their vegan parents. About one per cent of the vegans choose to the path because of the health benefits veganism is said to have. Personally, when it comes to health benefits, I have only realised that I dont catch cold as much but besides that I havent figured other benefits, shares Milesh, who says he turned vegan for ethical reasons."

Recently, senior RSS functionaries held a coordination meeting with the government where they expressed concern about the honour of the cadres.Adityanath said the formation of the BJP government in UP marked the beginning of a movement to eliminate the politics of caste, nepotism and appeasement and only the politics of nationalism and development will stay.State BJP president and deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the party will not make any compromise on the honour of the workers, but the workers too should ensure that any act against the government does not succeed.Adityanath said when illegal slaughterhouses were being closed, some people had met him and expressed concern over employment and health issues. I said we are completely vegetarian, we do not eat onion and garlic, but are we less stronger than you? Most members in my cabinet are vegetarian and they work from 7 am to 1 am.

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam.The cost of the local variety of brinjal, thorny ones, has been rising in the last one month, he said. It was priced Rs. 15 a kg earlier. The rates steadily increased during April and are now priced Rs. 80 a kg. The regular variety of brinjal costs Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 a kg.As for beans the price went up from Rs. 15-Rs. 20 two months ago to Rs. 80 now. The price of carrot rose from Rs. 10 to Rs. 50, Mr. Balu said.Ladys finger is selling at Rs. 15-Rs. 30. Beetroot too has become costlier  from Rs. 10Rs. 15 it has gone up to Rs. 40.Onion and tomato offer some solace to consumers. Onion sells at between Rs. five and Rs. 12 a kg, and tomato at Rs. 10.The rate of tomato continues to be low when compared to other vegetables, as there is yield during summer in parts of Andhra Pradesh, he added.Potato costs between Rs. 15 and Rs. 20; small onion between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40; drumstick Rs. 20; green chillies Rs. 20; snake gourd between Rs. 25 and Rs. 30; bitter gourd between Rs. 20 and Rs. 30; and ginger between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40.Cost cuttingMr. Balu said, Already, people have started cutting down the purchase of vegetables due to the spiralling cost.Those buying a kg earlier are now purchasing  of a kg.Those who buy four kinds of vegetables prefer to purchase just one or two varieties, he said."

The construction of the Super Expressway will make the farmers lose their irrigated land in the area. Hearing the farmers grievance, MSRDC MD R Mopalwar promised to look at other alternatives to save their land.Our discussion with them has yielded a positive response. We have suggested them an alternative alignment that will go over mountains and forest land. This will not only save our land but will also save them a lot of money. With our homes and wells, the cost of our land will be much higher. There will be no loss of tree cover as there arent many trees there; it is mainly exposed rock. We are not against the construction of the highway, but we will not let them take away our irrigated land, said Kokate. The alternative alignment suggested by the farmers goes very close to the Kalsubai Harishchandragad Wildlife Sanctuary and thus declared unfeasible by MSRDC.If we are to change our route, we will be entering the buffer zone of the sanctuary and we will not get the permissions for that. Today, we are outside Kalsubai by exactly 100 metres. We instead suggested that we will make an elevated road on that stretch. This will reduce our footprints to the least possible and we will require only half the land. They have 60 wells in these lands and elevated road will protect the wells also. We will continue our discussions with them and examine what best we can do for them, said Mopalwar.Of the 21,000 hectares required to build the Mumbai-Nagpur Expressway, 399 hectares is forest land, 17,499 hectares is agricultural land and 2,922 hectares is unused land. In the 710-km stretch around eight kilometres will pass through irrigated land. The Sinnar-Igatpuri farmers will together be losing around 46 hectares of land together. On this land, farmers grow grapes, pomegranates and vegetables like onion and potatoes among other crops. Their lives and family depend on this land.The construction of this highway has wreaked havoc in our lives. We constantly live in the fear of losing our land and our familys peace is lost. It is a mental torture. Farmers have begun carrying poison in their pockets now, says Shantaram Dhokne, a grape farmer from the area. Like other farmers, they too complain of pressure from officials to surrender their land. The measurement surveys are conducted with intense police presence and on our slightest protest we are lathicharged. Cases have been filed against 42 people in our villages to prevent them from protesting, says Namdeo Arote.There are many dams in our area. Only when the water from these dams reach all the fields will there be true development and not by constructing these highways, said Kero Pawar. The Rs 30,000-crore project will pass through Nagpur, Buldhana, Amravati, Wardha, Washim, Thane, Aurangabad, Akola, Bhiwandi and Nashik districts and will cut down the travel time between Nagpur and Mumbai by half.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Jagan Mohan Reddy on Tuesday warned that he would take the fight on behalf of farmers to the doorstep of the Assembly unless Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu takes concrete steps to mitigate their plight.Making an emotional speech to mark the conclusion of his two-day Rythu Deeksha here, Mr. Reddy said his party would raise issues concerning farmers during the short Assembly session to be held during the second week of this month.He said the prices of edible and commercial crops had touched a record low and cited chilli as an example.Mr. Jagan alleged that Mr. Naidu had broken his own record of inflicting misery on farmers for the third consecutive year. Mr. Naidu has always supported contractors. He never hesitates to highlight the costs involved in the construction of the Pattiseema project, Handri-Neeva, Galeru, and the Secretariat citing inflation but has never bothered to raise burning issues such as support price for farm produce and mess charges to students studying in welfare hostels, Mr. Reddy said.The State governments apathy in dealing with issues concerning farmers was evident as banks failed to meet the targets in both the kharif and rabi seasons.Out of the 1.4 lakh accounts of farmers, 40 lakh accounts have become either overdue or non-performing assets (NPA) accounts, said Mr. Reddy.Mass migrationThe YSRC leader said mass migration of farm labour had become a regular phenomenon. The lack of water and scarcity of fodder had forced many farmers to migrate to neighbouring States of Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Kerala.In Kurnool, farmers cultivating onion in nearly 29,000 hectares are forced to sell it at just Rs. 1.50 per kg. Those protesting against the fall in prices are being threatened with police cases, he said.Party leaders Ummareddy Venkateswarlu, Marri Rajasekhar, Ambati Rambabu, Lavu Krishnadevarayulu, MLAs Kodali Nani, Pinnelli Ramakrishna Reddy, and Lella Appireddy were present."

How can a person who works for such long hours be weak,"" the chief minister asked. His comment, in the backdrop of ban on slaughterhouses and a related argument that the resultant scarcity of meat was depriving people of cheap, healthy food, went viral on social media.Yogi, on the occasion, also announced that Rs 4,000 crore had been sanctioned by the Centre under Namami Gange project. With this, pilgrims visiting Ardh Kumbh in Allahabad in 2019 would be able to see a cleaner Ganga, he said.Recounting the second important achievement of the new government, the chief minister said the BJP government ensured anti-Romeo squads were formed and began working effectively within 24 hours of the government formation.Beginning his speech on a lighter note, Yogi said there was curiosity around the world over what 'namoona' (character) Modi had appointed UP chief minister. Reminding the party workers that they had more responsibility than before since the BJP was in power now, he said it was the moral responsibility of party workers to ensure that people's trust in the government remained intact. He asked them to be cautious and not to take law in their hands.Only those who would tread the path of development and patriotism would survive, said Yogi, adding that the government was making every effort to bring holistic changes in the work culture of the government. Emphasising on cleanliness, the chief minister said Prime Minister Narendra Modi's focus on 'swacchhata abhiyan' was meant to make people healthier and stronger.Urging party workers to change the tradition of giving flowers and bouquets to the leaders, the chief minister said soon all ministers in charge would begin visiting the districts they have been given responsibility of. The party workers instead of welcoming them with flowers should clean one locality or village and take the visiting minister along to show it.After putting in efforts, they can also ask the minister in charge to do the needful in their area, Yogi said and added that soon he would also begin touring divisions and review the progress of development works.The four-time MP from the Gorakhpur said his government was determined to end ""mafia raj"". Similarly, UP government is focussing on transparency and for this, every tender, even if it is of Rs 1 lakh would be issued through e-tendering.Elaborating on various policies, Yogi said a new mining, excise and industrial policy would soon be announced. Stressing the mining policy, he said the UP government has decided to link mining with satellite imaging in a bid to ensure transparency.Hitting out at previous governments in the state, Yogi said the state of affairs in mining department has been such that a minister used to earn more than the total revenue of the government.""Government will take tough action against anybody who tries to meddle with law and order in the state,"" he said."

Highly placed government sources told TOI that the Union ministry of agriculture and the ministry of consumers conducted a survey to check the possibility of the scarcity of the produce in coming few months.""The government has been creating buffer stock of onions under its PCF for the past two year through central agencies like NAFED and SFAC. But there is no such plan for this year as there has been bumper production of onions and there is no possibility of scarcity of onions in the coming future.""In April and May 2015, the government had procured 12,000 tonne of onions through central agencies like National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) and Small Farmers' Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under the PSF to supply onions to consumers at moderate rates during scarcity.Of the 12,000 tonne, NAFED had procured 5,000 tonne, while SFAC had procured 8,000 tonne.Last year, in April and May, the government procured 17,000 tonne through Central agencies. Of which, SFAC procured 12,000 tonne, while NAFED had procured the remaining 5,000 tonne.When contacted NAFED director Nanasaheb Patil said, ""We have no communication from the government to procure onions under PSF. We are yet to receive demand from the government."" However, he refused to divulge any more details on the issue.In 2015, onion prices had skyrocketed to all-time high of Rs 5,700 per quintal on August 22 due to scarcity of onions and the government had to import onions to meet the demand despite the buffer stock of around 12,000 tonne that was created through central agencies like NAFED and SFAC.The retail prices of onions had touched to Rs 80 per kg in Nashik's retail market and Rs 100 per kg in metro cities like Mumbai and Delhi.While the kharif and late kharif crops are highly perishable with a shelf life of less than 25 days, the summer crop has a shelf life of six to seven months. The farmers also prefer storing onions with a hope of getting better prices.The summer crop is harvested in April and May, and caters to the market for the next five-six months until arrival of fresh kharif crop by October end. The kharif crop is harvested in October-November, while late kharif crops are harvested in December and January.The scarcity of onions is created if the supply of summer stock is affected during the period from June to October. Hence, government had decided to create buffer stock of summer onions in April and May to deal with the scarcity during these five months."

Driving past Gole Market the other day, I recalled how often I used to go there, and how many of those eateries are not there anymore.Once upon a time, kababs meant Galinas, which sold juicy seekh kababs and roomali rotis. If we wanted Kerala mutton fry, we went to Shridharans. Bengali food meant the Basu Lodge, where you got home-style dal and veggies, and a small sweet shop called Bengal Sweet Home, which sold delicious Bengali samosas. And when we wanted fish, we went to Gujarat Fisheries.The shops have all downed their shutters, and I seldom find myself in Gole Market any more. But a thread on Facebook pushed me into making a trip to this little market area in central Delhi a few days ago.The FB conversation  on this popular site called Delhi Food Walks  was on chholey bhaturey.Everybody had an opinion on where the fare was the best. I think the best chholey bhaturey are still to be found at Chachas in Kamla Nagar, Nagpals in Amar Colony, Nand in Sadar Bazar and Standard in Old Rajendra Nagar. But a few diehard foodies  including old friend Tulu Patnaik  swore by Odeon Sweets on Bhagat Singh Market in Gole Market.Always happy to try out something new, I landed up there. The name was familiar and I realised that I had actually eaten their chholey bhaturey long years ago when the sweet shop was on the middle lane in Connaught Place, near the Odeon theatre. This is now on the Bhagat Singh Market Road which is the main road that leads you to Gole Market from CP. The address is 22, Bhagat Singh Market, and the phone numbers are 64656470 and 9716345474.The place is known for its sweets, too, so I tried out a bit of the moong dal ki halwa (Rs. 600 a kilo), which I thought was good, well roasted and deliciously rich. But I was on Mission Chholey Bhaturey, so I packed some for lunch (Rs. 70 a plate) and went right back home.And it was quite an enjoyable lunch, too. The chholey bhaturey had come with some green chutney, thin strips of pickled raw mango, pickled green chillies and onion slices. I laid them out on my steel ki thali, tore off a bit of the fluffy bhatura, dipped it into a mound of chholey, lightly topped it with the green chutney and popped it into the mouth. Then I bit into a green chilli, had some of the mango pickle and the onion slices and burped elegantly.In the final analysis, I think my four favourites still get the tiara. This was nice, but the chholey would have tasted better had it been less oily and just a wee bit more moist. I found it a little too dry. The bhaturey was excellent, fluffy and light (well, they are not light, I know, but a good bhatura should always appear light). Overall it was a good lunch. Not quite healthy, I agree, but satisfying nevertheless.The Odeon sojourn makes me want to go back to some of my old favourites. I think its time I did a comparative study of chholey bhaturey shops in Delhi, and like the Miss India pageant (which, I may as well confess, we disrupted at a function in Delhi many, many years ago), give away crowns. Those who wish to join the panel of judges may please send in their applications."

Now that we are familiar with the process, we will go ahead ahead with the other four products.""""The process is likely to take about one year as sufficient time has to be given to the public to raise objections if any. Besides, other formalities need to be completed,"" he added.Obtaining the tag will boost exports, he said. ""We are developing marketing linkages and also going to provide publicity so that farmers can make the most of it. We have a lot of work to do as these are the special products of AP. Our aim is to provide value to the products by getting them the tag which helps in branding and value addition,"" Chowdhary said.As per the application made to the GI Registry, Banaganapalle mangoes also known as Beneshan, Baneshan, Benishan, Chappatai, Safeda, Banaganapalli, or Banginapalli are popular and extensively used fruit all over the world. The agro-climatic and geographical conditions prevailing in Banaganapalle in Kurnool district and adjoining areas has given the unique characteristic to the mangoes for more than 100 years."

The farmers at the Kurnool Agriculture Market Yard are waiting for buyers keeping their produce in heaps. Buyers are not showing any interest to lift the stocks as farmers are not coming forward for distress sale as yet.Last year, the price offered to farmers was about `13,000 but this year the price has fallen to an all-time low of `1,500 to `2,000 per quintal. The farmers are caught in a bind as they cannot resort to distress sale or they cannot take it back either as they do not know what do with the produce.R Ramakrishna Reddy, a buyer at Kurnool Market Yard said: We would have purchased chilli at a better price but the quality is very poor. He was not sure if the government would pay them subsidy later. We were taken for a ride in the past. The government announced subsidy for onion last year but till date the arrears have not been cleared.Let the government first clear the arrears. Then we will purchase chilli, he added. Farmers at their wits end G Venkateswarlu, a farmer from Remata village said that he had raised chilli in five acres by investing huge amount borrowed from money lenders.After harvesting, he had brought the crop to the market yard but there are no buyers there. He says, To some extent, what the buyers say is true. The quality of chilli we have is poor this time compared to last year as there has been drought in the district for the last three years. There is no groundwater and whatever water we could strike is alkaline and not fit for watering the crop.We are forced to throw away the crop in the garbage as we are not even recovering the money spent on transportation from the farm to the market yard in Kurnool, K Venkataramudu, a farmer from Guduru village stated. He urged the government to help them out by buying their produce or else they are forced to commit suicide.Every day, we are hearing news about farmer suicides from droughthit regions. However, with red chilli prices touching new low, farmers like me may be meeting the same fate, Venkataramudu lamented. Kurnool agriculture market yard secretary A Narayana Murthy said that they will start a special counter to purchase red chilli under subsidy price scheme.Already the government has announced the subsidy scheme and we are waiting for orders. The quality of red chilli is being sold at a minimum rate of `500 per quintal and maximum of `3,000 per quintal, at present, in wholesale market, he added. In Nellore too, problem is same.The mirchi farmers in the district are literally in tears because of the market fluctuations. Though the area of cultivation had increased when compared to the last year, green chillie farmers in upland areas are a distressed lot due to steep fall in prices.On the other hand, red chilli farmers are flooding the Guntur Mirchi Yard to sell their produce at remunerative prices. Farmers buoyed by profits in the previous year, increased area under cultivation in the district. Majority of the farmers in upland mandals such as Vinjamur, Kaligiri, Kondapuram, Jaladanki, Duttalur, Varikuntapadu, Udayagiri and Seetharamapuram had cultivated red chillie. According to sources, 1,150 farmers had cultivated green and red chilli in 3,075 hectares this year.Out of 3,075 hectares, red chilli was raised in 2,104 hectares. Out of 2,104 hectares, red chilli was raised in 329 hectares in Vinjamur, 466 in Kaligiri, 113 in Kondapuram, 84 in Jaladanki, 153 in Duttalur, 21 in Varikuntapadu, 1.2 in Seetharamapuram and 4 hectares in Seetharamapuram mandal. Green chilli growers tense Green chilli, which is chiefly used in curries, is a perishable crop by nature and the growers cannot preserve it in cold storage plants as is the case of red chilli waiting for a favourable market environment. We are issuing cultivation certificates to chilli farmers to sell their produce at remunerative prices under Market Intervention Scheme.The government is initiating steps for price stabilisation by eliminating middlemen in the process of procurement, said Anuradha, a Horticulture official. It may be mentioned here that farmers in Atmakur division had earned `3 lakh to `4 lakh profit per acre last year by selling green chilli in Maharashtra and Karnataka.The farmers invested `1.75 lakh on mirchi cultivation in one hectare this year. According to sources, farmers cultivated green chilli in around 3,200 acres in Anantasagaram, Marripadu and Atmakur mandals this year. In the previous year, green chilli was raised in 2,300 acres of land. I invested `30,000 per acre to harvest the crop. I paid a daily wage of `120 to each labourer"

The sowing of summer crop, which has ended, shows onions have been sown over an area of 14,300 hectares. Usually sowing of onion is carried out over 10,300 hectares in the state.Officials said that not only had more onion been sown than usual, but that 31% more onions have been sown compared to last year.""Farmers usually decide on sowing of a crop looking at availability of water and prices fetched by the crop last year,"" said an agriculture official.Ghanshyam Patel, a farmer of Mahuva, said that the summer onion crop fetches better prices than that of other seasons. While one bigha land sown with onions produces about 200 metric tonnes of the crop, Patel said costs of cultivation per bigha was about Rs 30,000. A bigha's yield can fetch anywhere between Rs 60,000 and Rs 70,000 in summer, Patel added.Karanbhai Kashibhai, a resident of Mahuva, said, ""Last year, onions fetched prices between Rs 20 to Rs 30 per kg, which was a good price. So this year, I have decided to go in for onion farming."" He said that in Mahuva, a majority of the farmers have gone in for onion farming, and the area is considered the onion belt of Gujarat According data available of the 14,300 hectares cultivated for onions, 11,700 hectares were in Bhavnagar alone. In the past couple of years, retail prices of onions have touched Rs 100 per kg many times. The gap between wholesale and retail prices is huge, and at a time when the wholesale rates of onions were between Rs 3 and Rs 6.50 per kg, the vegetable retailed at Rs 25 per kg or higher in city areas like Satellite and Navrangpura.The overall sowing area for summer crops in the state is usually 9.83 lakh hectares. However, this year there has been a decline in overall sowing of summer crops and only 84% of usual area, or 8.27 lakh hectares have been cultivated. Agriculture officials, however, maintained that the scenario was better than last year, and 68,800 more hectares have been cultivated for summer crops.Officials said sowing and cultivation was poor last year as the government had to reserve water for drinking purposes and didn't release irrigation water for summer crops."

They also blocked the state highway for several hours.Angry farmers from different villages brought about 5 tonne onion loaded in tractors from their farms to the roads on Wednesday morning. They shouted slogans against the state government and demanded better price for their produce. Police said that over 200 farmers joined the protests from various villages of Mahuva in Bhavnagar and Savarkundla in Amreli.Farmers dumped loads of onions on the state highway to show that they were not earning profit by producing onion. This is happening for the second successive year, farmers said.""For the second year in a row, onion growers are not getting decent prices for their produce. They are suffering heavy losses as they are finding it difficult to recover even the input cost. Farmers are getting Rs 20 per 20kg (about Re 1 per kg), which is peanuts,"" said farmer leader Deepak Malani from Ambardi village of Savarkundla.""Farmers are left with no option but to destroy their farm produce as they can't even afford to take their harvested onion to marketing yard as transportation would prove costly for them,"" he added.Farmers also threatened to boycott the state government's Krishi Mahotsav over the low prices of onions. Malani also demanded that government declare minimum support price (MSP) for onions.Recently, a study by the Department of Agricultural Economics at Junagadh Agricultural University (JAU) had found that cultivators of tur, isabgul, fennel, potato, garlic, coriander and tobacco received highest return for their investment, while onion producers got the least return in 2015-16.While, a farmer who invests Re 1 for cultivating tur, receives Rs 2.32 in return, an onion cultivator got just return Rs 1.05 as against the same investment.Various factors including area of production of particular crop, monsoon and market price played important role in farm produce returns."

At the worst, traders say the prices may continue to soar for at least the next two months when supplies are expected to improve.Prices of vegetables like bean, carrot and brinjal have increased, forcing buyers to be economical with their purchase. While bean is the most expensive, carrot is selling for Rs 60-70 per kg. Even beetroot, which was selling for Rs 20 per kg is now selling at double the rate.Ladies finger, sold at Rs 20 per kg, has also gone up to Rs 30 per kg. Even broad bean (avarakkai in Tamil) is now being sold at Rs 60-70 per kg.The prices may continue to stay this way until July when the yield from the fresh crop is expected to arrive in the market, said S Chandran, president, Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association.Although the prices of tomato and onion are currently low, Chandran feels those could also go up soon. Tomato is selling at Rs 10 per kg while onion costs Rs 15 per kg at the retail market in Koyambedu.Chandran says the supply of vegetables has reduced. On any given day, around 450 to 500 trucks supply vegetables to Koyambedu Market but for the last couple of weeks the supply has reduced to 350 trucks, he said.The demand for vegetables is more as it is an auspicious month. We even expect the prices of tomato to double in the next 10 to 15 days, Abdul Kader, secretary, Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association, told Express.Even the price of coriander, which is in huge demand due to rise in temperature, is Rs 15-20 per kg.

It had, however, increased the reverse repo rate -- which it pays to banks for parking funds with it -- by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent, narrowing the policy rate corridor.As per the new series data, industrial output growth slowed to 2.7 per cent in March as against 5.5 per cent a year ago."

And with two other areas outside, one that is bustling with DJs chartbusters and another quieter space outdoors, where you can enjoy the meal along with the beautiful Bengaluru weather.Their new menu is born out of sustainable living practices. It includes sustainable food that is made out of locally sourced ingredients. They use deep sea fish and their chicken is claimed to be antibiotic and artificial hormone free. While today several restaurants in the city boasts of offering healthy food on their menu, Fava claims to be one of the very few that aims for ethical food.The Polenta Crusted Crispy Goat Cheese and Thyme Roll is crunchy on the outside and its insides melt as soon as you take a bite. It is served with a spiced tomato relish. The Plated Smoked Salmon Labneh is cooked very well and has subtle flavours of capers, dill and paprika ruling the palate. The Grilled Deep Sea Prawn with Black Sesame too is cooked right and has the smoky flavour of the prawn that blends well with chilli, garlic and extra virgin olive oil seasoning. In the Plated Mezze and Salad category, I absolutely fell in love with Father Michaels Valombrossa Burrata.If there was one word I could use to describe it, then it would be beautiful. The dish is a maple tree farm organic beetroot mezze with dukkah and popped amaranth. The Melon, Watermelon & Feta Salad is what you call basic done right. The dish is simple and lets the fruits and the feta take a centrestage with its natural flavours, which by the way are absolutely fresh tasting. The dish is tempered with pomegranate, mint, arugula, balsamic reduction and extra virgin olive oil. Among pizzas, I tried the multi grain vegetarian Funghi Misti pizza. It tastes fresh out of the oven with toppings of corn, jalapeno, bell pepper, onion and mozzarella.In the main course, I would highly recommend the Mediterranean Style Stir-fry with Millet & Black Rice Risotto. The dish is warm, tastes fresh and healthy thanks to the locally sourced grains that take the stage to recreate an Italian Classic with organic vegetables. Among the non vegetarian dishes, the Signature Pomegranate Chicken is a must have. The chicken is very well cooked with the subtle pomegranate flavour. It is served with chargrilled vegetables and parsley-arugula vichyssoise. At Fava, the kitchen uses Earth Loaf chocolates made from Indian cacao beans. The chocolates are made in Mysuru.If you are in the mood to experiment, try Favas homemade liquid nitrogen infused 100% natural ice cream, sorbet and frozen yoghurt with topping. I had it in caramel popcorn. The ice cream is super smooth and has a strong caramel flavour. It was topped with a few caramel popcorn. My favourite, however, is the Duet of Chocolate Fondant . It has the chocolate crunch, with a gooey foundant that oozes when you dip in your spoon. It is a play on hot and cold chocolate flavours. Do give this one a try.Among cocktails, I tried the liquid nitrogen infused house special Cocktails including Fava Martini, Pink Bramble and Morgan Colada. I particularly enjoyed the Fava Martini that had a good punch of gin that blends well with cranberry juice, gingerm blue curacao, grenadine and fresh lime.Morgan Colada too was an interesting combination, especially for Captain Morgan rum fans. This cocktail has spiced rum mixed with pineapple juice and coconut milk. Other than these, the Tiramisu cocktail too was an interesting spin on the dessert. It has tequila, Baileys mascarpone and espresso. Id say if you are ending your meall with a drink, let it be Tiramisu.Cost for two: `1,900 (approx.)"

As a result, the State is witnessing a bumper crop which in turn led to a crash in prices.More than 500 farmers of 10 village of my area threw their entire produce on the roads because of low prices. To produce 20 kg onion, a farmer invests more than Rs. 75-85 that includes inputs like fertilisers, water, seed and labour costs. Now, he gets only Rs. 25-30 per 20 kg, Paresh Dhanani, the Congress MLA of Amreli told The Hindu .According to him, more than 1.5 lakh farmers in Amreli and Bhavnagar districts have been affected by the fall in prices. I had planted onion on eight acres. This year, we have bumper yield but no price. I will not recover even a third of my investment. Same is the situation of thousands of farmers across this onion-growing belt of Bhavnagar, said Punjabhai Ahir, a farmer.He added that the government must fix a remunerative price of onion at Rs. 100 per 20 kg. Mr. Dhanani agreed and said, Neither the State nor the Central government has done anything to help the farmers in distress."

On Mother's Day, we take a closer look into the lives of new-age moms who manage their time between their families and being an online star with ease...What started out as a pet project with no particular vision in mind for Kabita Singh has turned out to be one of the biggest cooking shows in India today. The self-confessed foodie used to watch a lot of cooking shows online, but always felt that they weren't too beginner-friendly, and that prompted her to start her own channel in 2013. ""I was never really interested in the subscribers and views count, until one recipe of mine  Bread Gulab Jamun  went viral in 2016. Once I realized the kind of impact my videos were having on people, I become more serious and regular about it,"" says the self-taught video editor and producer. The mum of two  a five-year-old and a five-month-old  adds, ""These days, I shoot and edit during the hours that my toddler naps, or whenever my husband keeps them occupied.

He was immediately taken to the nearby government hospital where doctors pronounced him brought dead, the rural SP said, adding that police had not received any complaints regarding threat to the life of Yadav.Patna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Manu Maharaaj said an FIR under section 302 (punishment for murder) of the Indian Penal Code had been registered with Fatuha police station. The incident seemed to be a case of personal rivalry, Mahraaj said and added that police had gathered some vital clues against the assailants.

With the harvest of shallots , like that of other vegetables, hit by the drought , the price of the vegetable has shot up by almost 150% in the past two months. With a kilo of shallots now costing almost Rs 100 per kg, households which used the vegetable generously are forced to rework their food budgets.Ironically, the price of big onions has been slowly but constantly dropping. Vegetable vendors attribute it to the arrival of excess stocks from Pune.Shallots, that is an essential part of many south Indian dishes like sambar, poriyal, bhajjis and other non-vegetarian dishes, used to cost as less as Rs 25 per kg three months ago; it now costs Rs 100 per kg. ""The price went up to Rs 40 in March. From then, it increased to Rs 70 by mid-April and Rs 90 in the beginning of May,"" said G A Wahab, secretary of the traders association and president of the Saibaba Colony Vegetable Vendors Association. ""The wholesale rate for the vegetable itself is Rs 90 per kg,"" he said. ""This is mainly due to a shortfall in supply of the vegetable. We don't know if farmers are hoarding it, or if there genuinely is such a big drop in harvest,"" he added.Shallot farmers admit there is a shortfall in the supply cycle, but attribute it to a combination of factors, including the drought and very low prices for the vegetable last year. ""Last year, shallots fetched hardly Rs 15 to Rs 20 per kg, and even that did not find buyers,"" said a farmer, T Kadhiresan. ""So, almost two-thirds of the shallot farmers opted to cultivate other vegetables like beans, spinach and tomato,"" he said. ""While that itself reduced the price, the drought like conditions and the climate reduced the yield by less than half,"" he said. ""Shallots need a lot of mist and no heat during its growing stages, but without that last year the yield dropped from the usual five tonnes an acre to two tonnes an acre,"" he added.With the prices likely to remain high, many housewives have begun reworking their budgets. ""I used to spend Rs 500 a week for vegetables, but now it has gone upto Rs 650,"" complained Aashrita Kanwal, a resident of Saibaba Colony. ""Besides this, I have also begun reducing my usage of shallots and am using onions instead,"" she said.That seems to be the way forward because onion prices have begun dropping. While the vegetable costs Rs 9 in the wholesale market, it costs Rs 12 to Rs 20 in the retail market. ""It has dropped by 0.50 p to Rs 2 per kg, because stocks from Pune have begun pouring in,"" said Wahab."

With no storage facility, farmers often leave the crop standing in the field. However, with heat likely to spoil the standing crop, the farmers have been forced to harvest the produce.This year, farmers in Jodhpur sowed onions in record 24,000 hectares. They harvested more than 3.60 lakh tonnes onions. This bumper harvest has now become a bane for the farmers.Shyamlal, an onion farmer from Rampura village, is unsure how he will clear the loan he had taken. Many other farmers are now neck deep in debt, because they cannot even get the production cost. Some farmers are selling onions by the roadside at 2 per kg fearing that the produce may get rotten in this heat.Gordhan Siyag, another farmer, said there was an immediate need for creating storage facility for the produce.The farmers are now demanding that their produce be bought by the government at the minimum support price. The state government, however, has yet to take a decision.Contacted, Jodhpur MP Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said he recently raised the issue in the Lok Sabha. The biggest challenge is to keep the onions safe. Efforts will be made to provide relief to farmers, including creating sheds to store onions, he said.According to agro trader Daulal Boob, in the past, the government had taken action against traders who stock the onions beyond limit. This time, the stockists are going slow in procuring the produce, he said, adding that since there was no facility to store onions in the district, it has to be sold off quickly.Former chief minister Ashok Gehlot termed the situation as unprecedented where onions are left to rot in open, while farmers who produced them face penury.State government must shun its indifferent attitude and immediately announce MSP for onions for the entire state and start procuring, he said in a tweet."

The incident occurred around 5.15am on Fatuha railway station road where Pappu (42) had gone for a morning stroll. Two motorbike-borne criminals followed him near the railway crossing and opened fire from close range, causing serious injuries. Relatives of the trader took a profusely bleeding Pappu, whose house is at a stone's throw distance from the site, to Fatuha primary health centre. He was later shifted to a private hospital in Patna where he succumbed to his injuries. Agitated over the incident, the slain RJD leader's supporters blocked the Patna-Bakhtiyarpur road that goes through the area and paralysed traffic for nearly two hours. The police had to face the ire of the local residents who pelted stones at them and also indulged in arson. Taking note of the lapses on the part of the police, Patna senior superintendent of police (SSP) Manu Maharaaj shifted the station house officer (SHO) of Fatuha, Sujeet Kumar, and posted Avinash Kumar as the new SHO. The SSP had earlier received complaints from local residents about lack of patrolling in the sub-divisional town, around 20km east of the capital. Three incidents of murder and loot were reported from the area in the past two weeks. Fatuha deputy superintendent of police Anoj Kumar said the reason behind the murder of the trader was yet to be ascertained. The deceased's relatives denied enmity with anyone. Six years ago, Pappu had lobbied for being elected as a Member of Legislative Council (MLC). An investigating officer said the incident has been captured on a closed-circuit television camera installed at a shop on the station road. The two assailants fled towards the house of Nawal Yadav, who, sources said was a rival of Pappu. The officer said Nawal's nephew Chhotu had allegedly threatened Pappu with dire consequences following a dispute over a trust land. ""We are probing the case from this angle too,"" the officer said. A resident of the area, Ghanshyam Prasad, said a quack was killed in Khirodharpur village under the jurisdiction of Fatuha police station last week. Earlier, a mob had lynched an engineer. ""At least three persons were killed in a month,"" he added. SSP Maharaaj had deployed additional armed forces at Fatuha and asked the new SHO to undertake routine patrolling in the sensitive areas of the town."

And fried onions are the sine qua non of Hyderabadi cooking. The process of chopping onions, however, is painstaking and is always followed by shedding of tears.To make everyday cooking a wee bit easier, Everyday Gourmet Kitchen (EGK), a Mumbai based enterprise founded by Satyajit Roy offers a variety of onion products. This food processing firm has a wide range of onion products for domestic and industrial use, like crispy fried onion, wet fried onion and fresh fried onion. These products can be ordered online and arrive in polythene sachets. The price range is Rs 250-300 per kilogram.This innovative idea was not an immediate hit in the market says Satyajit, Initially there was a reluctance from the market to accept the product as the response that we got from commercial kitchens was that they peel cut and fry their own onions as they have been doing for many years.Once we got some of the bigger kitchens to try our product, they realised the multi-pronged benefits of EGK Fresh Fried Onions. Reduction in time, labour and resources at a competitive rate allowed many kitchens to make their operations more efficient.The organisation says they offer onion products that maintain the taste of your food, have minimum preservatives and reduce laborious tasks involved in cooking which require no skill. This type of food processing when done right is also a way to reduce yield wastage on a very large scale.The company has also roped in onion farmers to join their initiative: Since the people most affected by the volatility of the onion market are the farmers, we decided to tie up directly with them to provide a stable and fair buyback arrangement for their produce.This allows them not worry to about selling their produce and concentrate on their core competency which is increasing the quality and yield from their farms, says Satyajit. He was inspired to launch such an initiative as there is an abundance of onion produce every year and he intended to make a dent in thewastage figure which stands at approximately 5 million metric tonnes yearly."

In Gandhi market, which has a number of whole trading houses for onion, the price of onion (first quality) was hovering between Rs. 80 and Rs. 94. Second quality was sold between Rs. 60 and Rs. 70. The price of one bag of small onion (50 kg) was quoted between Rs. 4000 and Rs. 4700 on Tuesday.The prices of onion are shooting up. It had never reached Rs. 100 a kg in wholesale market in Tiruchi. I expect that it will definitely breach Rs. 100 mark this year, said R. Naresh of Rajaganapathy traders in Gandhi market. Tiruchi market receives onion loads from Thuraiyur, Perambalur, Mysuru, Sathiyamangalam, Samjarnagar, Kollegal and Pollachi. On an average, it gets 15 to 20 loads (12 tonnes each load). However, market source said that arrival had come down to just four loads a day.There has been a severe drought in most of the onion growing areas in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Crop failure had been reported in several areas. The prices are likely to shoot up further in the next few weeks, Mr. Naresh added."

The department had provided seeds at subsidised rates for 650 ha. In the rest of the areas, farmers bought seeds from the open market.Farmers of the district, who mainly depend on onion cultivation as their main cash crop after paddy and maize, had harvested more than 15,000 tonnes against the local annual consumption of about 6,000 tonnes.In the absence of adequate irrigation facilities, they had sunk water harvesting structures in Bhawanipatna, Kesinga, Narla and Golamunda blocks to water their crops through traditional methods.The farmers, who had eyed good profits, are now forced to sell their produce from the harvesting field at throwaway price. Onion is being sold to traders of other States at around Rs 5 per kg. In the markets of Bhawanipatna, Kesinga and Junagarh retailers are selling onion at Rs 10 per kg.As has been the practice, traders from outside, particularly Chhattisgarh, purchase onion at cheaper prices, hoard it for about three to four months till the demand rises and sell it at higher price. The irony is, even consumers of Kalahandi purchase onion from these sources paying higher price during lean season.Lack of storage facility and absence of controlled market network to check distress sale have been the main reasons behind the current plight of onion growers.Under Horticulture Mission, 20-tonne onion storage capacity is available to farmers at 50 per cent subsidy, but there are few takers. Reason: Each storage facility costs Rs 1.75 lakh.Gopabandhu Sahu, a farmer from Matia village and Kaluram Majhi of Kharsel village said they do not have enough money to use the storage facility. They are forced to sell onion directly to traders after harvesting to avert losses.Deputy Director, Horticulture, Sudhakar Sahu, said of the allotted target of 400-tonne storage of 20-tonne capacity each in 2015-16, only 200 farmers used the facility. In 2016-17, only 100 farmers availed the benefit. Citing the reason behind the decline, Sahu said under the system, farmers have to first invest for availing storage facility and then get subsidy. Under such circumstances, if banks are ready to finance the storages, more farmers can avail the benefit.On marketing, Sahu said Regulated Marketing Committees can lend a helping hand by opening mandies with storage facilities or utilise cotton mandi as onion is grown in areas where cotton is harvested."

The order issued on Thursday comes after two years of delay. Farmers are gearing up for kharif operations this year in three weeks.The purpose of input subsidy is to provide relief to farmers who have lost their crops due to drought or floods or any other reason by releasing subsidy on the expenditure incurred during the immediate agricultural season. More than 200 mandals in seven districts of Andhra Pradesh were hit by drought during Kharif in 2015, triggering migrations and suicides. Along with paddy, cotton, chillies, onion and other cash crops, horticulture crops such as mango and acid lime were also affected.""The government seems to have woken up from a long slumber and released funds for crops damaged in 2015. It is not showing interest in handing out assistance to farmers, but is all too willing to release funds to clear the bills of contractors. This shows the government's priorities,"" said MVS Nagi Reddy , former member of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research.While the Centre releases 50% of the funds, the state government is required to release the remaining. The Union government had released drought relief funds in 2016 itself. Sources in the horticulture department said that the state government had failed to release its share and hence the input subsidy was put on hold. ""As the state has to utilise its finances judiciously, it used the available funds according to its priorities. Hence, there was a delay of almost two years,"" admitted a top official."

Shallot prices had crossed Rs. 100 a kg three or four years ago too, but largely went unnoticed because of a simultaneous climb in onion prices.Shallots are mostly cultivated in Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh. The current price rise is attributed to a fall in production. A friend of mine who exports vegetables said shallots were coming from the fields at Rs. 120 a kg.A vegetable commission agent at Chala said small onion was priced in the Rs. 70-Rs. 105 range depending on quality, though it had touched Rs. 115 some days ago. The current hike in prices was owing to a fall in production, leading to fewer truckloads arriving in the city markets.These are also exported in substantal quantities, he said.Small onion prices would come down in a month, he said, warning that in another month or two onion prices were likely to shoot up."

The mango crop still on the trees will be affected as the hailstorms and rain were accompanied by strong winds.""So far there have been no reports of rain in the coastal areas and the summer sesame crop has thus been saved. Rain and strong winds could completely destroy or badly affect the sesame crop in he coastal areas.Former agriculture officer B M Vaghela said the summer groundnut and bajra crops will be in the fields in areas where the sowing was relatively late. These unseasonal rains will affect the crop quality as the water will adversely affect the flowering of these crops. He further said that the farmers who want to sow BT cotton will do it early, as there will be some moisture in the upper soil layer. However, not many farmers will go in for early sowing. Vaghela said that the onion crop, which has been harvested in most places and may be lying in the fields, would be adversely affected as well.N C Patel, vice-chancellor of Anand Agricultural University said, ""Standing crops may be affected. However, barring mango, there should be no great impact.""Similar unseasonal rains earlier, coupled with heavy winds in parts of Amreli and Saurashtra have affected 15-20% of the mango crop.

There were reports of heavy rain accompanied with strong winds in parts of Amreli. This rain and wind will definitely affect the crop.

It seems the State is not keen on taking the financial burden to protect farmers from selling their produce at distress price, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told a BJP delegation from Odisha.The basic objective of MIS is to provide remunerative prices to farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. However, the MIS is implemented on specific request of the State Government willing to share the loss with Central Government on 50:50 basis, Singh said.It has been brought to my notice that Odisha farmers are incurring huge losses due to fall in prices of onion which is being sold at `3-4 a kg. But there is no proposal yet from the State Government for market intervention under MIS, the Union Minister told the delegation.The Uttar Pradesh Government has taken the benefit of the scheme this year to protect potato growing farmers, Singh said and added that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had successfully gone for market intervention under MIS last year.Stating that MIS is for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are generally perishable in nature, the Union Minister said though funds are not allocated to the States, the Centre shares the loss of farmers based on specific proposals received from them.With a bumper harvest of onion this year, the State is staring at a possible crisis of the vegetable due to lack of storage facility. As the Centre expects about six per cent decrease in onion production against last year, it has advised the State Government to take timely ameliorative measures to tackle any potential crisis in onion during the lean season.On the day, the State Government advised the Horticulture Department to give stress on informing farmers to store their produce to meet the demand during crisis time.Though the State Government is giving 50 per cent subject to a maximum of `87,500 for construction of onion storage facility under Horticulture Mission, there are hardly any takers.While a 20-tonne onion storage facility costs about `1.75 lakh, the farmers have to bear the cost to reimburse the subsidy amount later.

In a reply to a question in the Assembly on May 9 2016, the CM had informed that 11.09 lakh hectares were covered under assured irrigation in 2015-16 kharif season. This is only 18 per cent of the total agricultural land of the State, BJP MLA Pradip Purohit told reporters here.Though many farmers in the State committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden, the Government refused to accept the fact to cover up its failure. Nothing could be more unfortunate than to claim that farmers of Odisha do not commit suicide. This shows the apathetic and insensitive attitude of the BJD Government, Purohit said.What happened to the State Potato Mission after three years of its launching? the BJP legislator sought to know from the Government.As per the Mission target, the State was supposed to be self sufficient in potato production. With its annual requirement of about 12 lakh tonnes of potato, Odisha had produced 2.68 lakh tonnes last year. Purohit attributed the failure to lack of storage capacity in the State.Quoting a reply of Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout in the Assembly, Purohit said only five cold stores of the Cooperation Department are functional while 13 have remained defunct. The Government has failed to revive a single cold store during the last 17 years.Even as the State has achieved self sufficiency in onion production, the farmers are selling their produce at throw away price due to lack of institutional support from the Government, he rued.Similarly, the State is way behind the national average in egg and milk production, Purohit added."

Besides, this will encourage farmers to take up other crops.The BJP in the run up to 2014 Lok Sabha elections had promised to ensure 50 per cent profit to farmers on their input costs. While the Centre has failed keep its promise to the farmers, the State Government has passed a unanimous resolution during the Budget session of the Assembly urging the Centre to fix MSP at `2,930 per quintal of paddy.Responding to Deb, State BJP vice-president Samir Mohanty said this is one of many suggestions NITI Aayog has given to the Centre which is yet to take a call on the issue.Mohanty advised the State Government to follow the Chhattisgarh Government which has been providing a bonus of `300 per quintal of paddy to its farmers over and above the MSP.Dubbing this as an attempt to deflect the attention of people from the real issue, Mohanty said the State Government should take concrete measures to protect farmers from selling onion at distress price.The BJP leader advised the State Government to seek assistance of the Centre under the market intervention scheme (MIS) to save farmers from resorting to distress sale."

The State Government has also renamed the department as agriculture and farmers empowerment, Rout said.For the first time, paddy production has crossed one crore tonnes. Paddy productivity has also increased to 2,438 kg per hectare which is more than the national average of 2,404 kg. Irrigation potential for 54.74 lakh hectares has been created (for both rabi and kharif cultivation) in 2015-16, Rout said and added that agriculture budget has also increased to Rs 14,930 crore in 2017-18 from Rs 13,182 in 2016-17.Farmers, who repay loans of Rs 50,000 regularly, are getting the benefit of one per cent interest rate from 2015-16. Five members of a farmers family are also eligible for health insurance of Rs one lakh. So far, health insurance of Rs 195.45 crore has been provided to 3,91,838 farmers, he said.There has also been a three-fold increase in fish production from 2.6 lakh tonnes in 2000-2001 to 6.08 lakh tonnes in 2016-17. Besides, 2711 pucca houses have been provided to fishermen during the last three years, Rout said and added that rest of the beneficiaries will be covered in phases.While milk production has increased to 20.02 lakh tonnes, export of prawn has reached 35,612 tonnes amounting to Rs 1792 crore in 2016-17, Rout added.Congress seeks waiver of loansBhubaneswar: Alleging that both the Centre and State Government have neglected the agriculture sector and farmers, Odisha Pradesh Congress Committee (OPCC) on Tuesday demanded waiver of loans of small farmers. The BJP had come to power by promising to implement the recommendation of Swaminathan Committee report for fixing minimum support price (MSP) of paddy. But why has the promise not been kept? asked OPCC general secretary and spokesperson Sulochana Das.Das alleged that both BJP and BJD are responsible for the current plight of farmers in the State as both the parties were in power in Odisha for nine years as alliance partners.Criticising the Government for its failure to open a model mandi in the State even after 17 years, she sought to know what steps have been taken to stop distress sale of onion and other vegetables. She demanded that the State Government should admit that loan burden and crop loss are the causes behind suicides by farmers and give compensation to their families.Criticising the Government for not acting on the announcement to create additional irrigation potential for 10 lakh hectares of agriculture land, Das wanted to know what steps have been taken to identify sharecroppers."

Not just that. A big fish market at Rs. 3 crore is planned near Virattipathu with financial support from the Government of India. And, lastly, lorries coming to the city shall be parked near Kochadai, where a big space is being readied at around Rs. 2.70 crore with amenities like rest room and restaurants for drivers/conductors.Presently, the fruit market (wholesale and retail vendors) has its business along Vakkil New Street, East Masi Street and parts of Yanaikkal, very close to the Meenakshi temple, which is being given a facelift under the Swachh Bharat Mission.All the 240 outlets have been built on a sprawling 4.86 acre land near Mattuthavani integrated bus stand. The building has been raised with a contribution of Rs. 12 crore from the fruit vendors associations.The Corporation had planned to get the infrastructure done at Rs. 3 crore, which included construction of a compound wall, UGD system and water facilities, said Commissioner Sandeep Nanduri.Almost 80% of the work is over. When the market becomes operational, not only the city would be decongested in select areas, but the Corporation would also start getting revenue of Rs. 3 crore every year. A fruit vendor, Ganesan, on Vakkil New Street said that they would be too glad to move out of the city to Mattuthavani. Only the Corporation is delaying the shifting. If they hand over the keys today, we will start operations there from tomorrow was his reply.Under the Government of India project, the Corporation had planned to construct a fish market near Virattipathu at Rs. 3 crore, with funds (Rs. 1.50 crore) coming in from National Fisheries Development Corporation, grant of Rs. 1.20 crore from Tamil Nadu government and Rs. 30 lakh from TUFIDCO as loan. Corporation officials said that with Madurai entering the top 100 list in Swachh Survekshan ranking, the Centre was giving funds with a commitment from the local body to take up works that would help the city remain clean. Only when the users cooperated, the projects would become a success. In some cases, business model had to be adopted. Thus, for using a facility, the users had to pay a sum for the upkeep of the infrastructure, they said. The Swachh Bharat initiative provided funds for building infrastructure. Thus, for the maintenance of these facilities, the users had to contribute to the local body, they added.When asked about the plan to shift the onion market from East Marret Street, Mr. Nanduri said that talks were on with the association office-bearers and a plan would be drawn up soon. A senior police officer said that with 13 major intersections and over a million vehicles using the roads within the city and on the peripheries, shifting of markets would be a relief to motorists.The number of accidents, which were reported due to the collision between two-wheelers and trucks/tempos, too might fall, the officer opined."

If required, we will write to the Centre to procure onions from farmers through Nafed, Patro said.Politics over onion took centre-stage after BJP took up the issue with Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh seeking his intervention.Singh had advised the State Government to take recourse to market intervention scheme (MIS) to provide remunerative prices to farmers. As implementation of the scheme needs approval of the Centre, which shares 50 per cent of the burden, the State Government has to make specific request for market intervention.Since there was no proposal from Odisha Government for market intervention to check distress sale of onion, Singh told a BJP delegation that the State may not be keen to take the financial burden to protect the farmers.Accusing the Centre of maintaining double standards, BJD spokesperson Pratap Dev told reporters that on the one hand, it said there is bumper harvest of onion while on the other, it advised the State to maintain buffer stock to meet possible crisis of the edible bulb during monsoon season.Even if distress of sale of onion in the State is true, this is not Odisha specific. Even farmers in BJP-ruled States like Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh are selling onions at much lower price, Deb added."

A visit to Irur, Karai, Kolakanatham, Varagupadi and Ayyalur in the tri-junction of Tiruchi, Ariyalur and Perambalur disitricts on Tuesday brought to light different stages of farming activity by onion growers.In Irur, onion cultivators were seen trying hard to plough their fields using a tractor making maximum use of the summer rain realised in the area about a week ago. A farmer, Selvam, said he would raise onion in the fields in course of time.T. Kaliyamurthy of Irur said that he had raised the chinna vengayam the seeds of which he had preserved since last season. The rain though not sufficient, has considerably made the fields wet. Utilising the bore well, I have decided to raise chinna vengayam on 40 cents of my land, he said. He was confident of harvesting 35 bags of onion each of 75 kg.Weeds posed a serious problem to the growth of the crop. In the first phase, the growth of weeds will be controlled. However, it has to be manually cleared during the successive phases, says Tiruvonam, another farmer.At interior villages in Karai and Kolakanatham, farmers were seen clearing weeds, indicating that the 60-day crop had registered adequate growth in about 20 days."

Although it was ready for commissioning by the end of 2014, absence of power connection delayed the process. Installation of a 750-kv transformer besides electricity supply at a cost of `20 lakh were necessary to make the pack house operational.Though the pack house was commissioned on May 15 this year, the onion growers had to sustain loss for distress sale of their produce.Under Titlagarh sub-division, known as Nashik of Odisha, the onion is grown on 20,000 hectares in Titlagarh, Muribahal and Bongomunda blocks. While distress sale of onion is not a new phenomenon in the region and the Horticulture department is well aware of the plight of the farmers, the authorities were in no hurry to commission the pack house.In the absence of a storage facility, the farmers were forced to sell onion as well as paddy at distress prices for fear of their stock getting damaged in the pre-monsoon showers. Taking advantage of the situation, the traders purchase onion at as low as `3 per kg and hoard it till prices soar so that they can rake profits. The retail price is around `14 per kg.Deputy Director, Horticulture, PK Swain said already 100 tonnes of onion have been stocked against the 900 tonnes capacity of the facility."

T. Shaik Maideen, R. Kasamuthu and Chelladurai took up the issue at the farmers grievance redressal meeting held here on Friday. They said that the works selected under kudimaramathu scheme had not been executed properly as the officials and the contractors had been executing the work in a shoddy manner. They added that the very objective of the scheme would get defeated if this situation was allowed to continue.Even though the farmers reiterated their allegation with a few evidences, the officials remained silent without making any clarification.Observing the silence among the Public Works Department officials, Collector M. Karunakaran, who chaired the meeting, announced that farmers living in the areas where kudimaramathu scheme works were going on would be informed about the work to be done in their area and the agriculturists would be allowed to inspect the work. The Public Works Department officials should carry out the kudimaramathu scheme works only in the presence of the farmers, Dr. Karunakaran ordered amidst thunderous applause from the agriculturists.The Collector said over 52,000 farmers in the district would receive compensation under the crop insurance scheme during the next week as almost all farmers had suffered crop loss owing to monsoon failure. While small and marginal farmers would get 100% subsidy for installing micro irrigation equipments to save the horticultural crops, others would get 75% subsidy under this scheme.We expect sufficient rainfall during the south-west monsoon, which would usually start in the first week of June along the Western Ghats. Anticipating good rainfall this year, weve stocked adequate quantity of chemical fertilizers. The direct disbursal of fertilizer subsidy to the farmers will come into effect from June 1, Dr. Karunakaran informed.Joint Director of Agriculture Kanagaraj said the farmers could join the Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme during the kar season. Farmers going in for paddy cultivation should pay the premium before July 31 and the deadline for gram varieties was August 15. Agriculturists cultivating plantain and onion should pay the crop insurance premium under the Prime Ministers Crop Insurance Scheme by September 30.Representatives of private insurance firm, who participated in the meeting, informed that disbursal of compensation for withered paddy under the crop insurance scheme would commence on May 29.Dr. Karunakaran said the list of beneficiaries under the crop insurance scheme would be displayed in the office of Village Administrative Officers as farmers refused to accept the proposal of posting it online.Over 52,000 farmers in the district would receive compensation under the crop insurance schemeM.

Police also arrested Nitish Kumar (22) and Lokesh Kumar (23), who were allegedly paid for shooting Pappu.""We are at work to catch the main shooter, identified as Manish Kumar (24),"" Patna SSP Manu Maharaaj told newsmen on Saturday.Pappu was shot dead by two mobike-borne criminals near Fatuha Bazaar around 5.15am on May 16 soon after he left home for morning walk.""Nitish was driving the bike while Manish was riding the pillion. Manish fired the bullet which hit Pappu on the right side of the neck and exited from the left side of his skull. A country pistol was used in the crime, which is yet to be recovered,"" the SSP said and added it was Lokesh who tipped the shooters about Pappu exiting from his home for his walk.Police said Bachu and Dhananjay had struck a Rs 2-lakh deal with the killers. ""A sum of Rs 25,000 had been paid in advance; the remaining amount was yet to be paid,"" Maharaaj said, quoting the arrested accused.Property dispute was the reason. ""Also, Pappu spent money during Dhananjay's marriage ten months back and, in return, kept an SUV gifted to Dhananjay in dowry.

5a04867a9855b76bf13bd9cc,Shallot prices skyrocket in southern markets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/shallot-prices-skyrocket-in-southern-markets/articleshow/58968704.cms,2017-06-01,"Madurai: Skyrocketing shallot prices are bring tears to the eyes of consumers. While a kilogram of shallots or small onions sold for about Rs 28 in April in the wholesale market, it has now risen to Rs 100 for the same amount.President of Madurai district wholesale onion market association C Mohamed Ismail said that Madurai used to receive 4,000 bags of shallots, with each bag weighing between 50 to 60 kilograms, but it has dropped to only 1000 bags, which are divided equally between the Madurai Central market and the Paravai market.The situation is similar at the Oddanchathiram vegetable market in Dindigul, one of the biggest markets in the region. The market deals with 300 tonnes of onions on normal days when there is a good supply from the farms, but now, traders said, they are getting only 100 tonnes daily.P Sakthivel, member of the Oddanchathiram shop owners association, said that the supply from Dindigul and Theni has dropped drastically since May 1. At Oddanchathiram, the best quality shallots sold for Rs 95 a kilogram on Friday, while the smaller ones went for Rs 70. However, at the Madurai onion wholesale market the price rose to Rs 110 per kilogram.Traders attributed the steep hike to the prevailing drought conditions in the state which has affected the last harvest in April.S Periyasamy, a farmer from Dindigul, said, ""Onions are water intensive crops. If we water the crop once a week we get a good yield, but this year we were not able to do even that.''Meanwhile, many retail shops in residential areas have stopped selling shallots, as people are not ready to buy it for such a high price. Thangaraj, who runs a shop in Gomathypuram, said that people don't want to buy more than 100 grams which is not profitable. ""I can earn profit only if I can sell quarter kilogram for Rs 25. I have not sold shallots for the past one week as a result of the price hike,'' he said.A P Mahendar, a farmer and onion commission agent, said that the lack of rainfall leading to drop in produce was the sole reason behind the rise in shallot prices. ""I don't think the prices will come down in the next three months as this 60-day-crop cultivated in the end of March this year failed to produce sufficient quantities,'' he said.If there is enough rain, and the conditions are conducive there would be yield of not less than five tonnes of quality shallots per acre, but this season the shallots are small in size and the yield is about three tonnes or less per acre, according to him. ""At present about three lorry loads of shallots are being brought to the Oddanchathiram market from Mysore, the reason why it is selling for Rs 100. Otherwise, it would have been much more,'' he added."

We got our usual supplies. The situation will be the same tomorrow too. The problem will start if the strike doesnt end by Saturday. The wholesale markets are shut on Sunday. This could make matters worse.Ashok Walunj, former APMC director and onion and potato wholesaler, said, We have enough stock to last a couple of days. Retailers could take advantage of the situation and hike the prices. We support farmers. Their issues should be resolved at the earliest.Sharad Pawar, a retailer in Turbhe, said, There will be rationing of stock by wholesalers on Tuesday. We will get limited supply. This will definitely affect prices of vegetables. Also, the demand from panicking consumers will rise.Sunil Shingre, a farmer from wholesale market, said, The government should waive our loans and also ensure that we get good prices for our crop. We have been taken for granted for long.Prakash Shahane, a vegetable vendor at Savarkar market in Dadar, said, We are asking our regular consumers to buy a little more.Suryakant Mahadev, who has a shop at Dadar market, said there will be clarity on the situation by Saturday.We have received our daily quota of milk products and there is no problem now, said Santosh Kadam, manager of the Naiguam branch of Apna Bazar.Consumers seem to be quite confused over the issue.

(Source: PTI Photo) Ahmednagar: Farmers spilling milk on the road during their state-wide strike over various demands at a village in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra on Thursday. (Source: PTI Photo)Day one of the farmers strike in Maharashtra saw supplies of fruits, vegetables and milk being hit in major cities like Mumbai and Pune. While members of Kisan Kranti, the umbrella organisation of farmers which spearheads this unique strike, maintained that theirs was an apolitical movement, Sadashiv Khot, minister of state for agriculture and marketing, said the protest was politically motivated and was being fomented by people who have failed in their political career.Farmers across Maharashtra had decided to go on strike from June 1 as repeated talks with the state government had failed to resolve the stalemate. Yogesh Rayate, state level coordinator of Kisan Kranti said complete loan waiver of the farmers and implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about fixing of agricultural produce were their main demands. As the state government failed to respond to our demands, we had no other option but to go on strike, he said. In response, farmers across the state took to stopping vehicles of fruits, vegetables and milk towards urban areas. A call was also given to farmers not to provide milks to dairies and not to sell their agricultural produce in the wholesale markets.As a result of the call, wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune reported a sharp dip in arrival of fruits and vegetables on Thursday while markets in Nashik, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar were completely closed. Rajendra Shelke, president of the potato and onion sellers in the Vashi wholesale market in Mumbai, said there was a dip of 35 per cent in the arrival of vegetables. Dilip Khaire, chairman of the administrative board of Pune wholesale market, said there was a dip of 50 per cent in arrivals.The onion market of Lasalagon in Nashik district was completely closed as not a single farmer came to sell his produce. Vashi traders maintained that in case the supply continues to get hit, the rise in the prices of commodities could not be ruled out. Stray incidents of violence were reported from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune where farmers took to damaging milk-carrying tankers as well as vandalising trucks carrying vegetables. In many areas, farmers emptied milk containers and dumped vegetables on the road. Police had reportedly taken action against some protesters in Nashik, Aurangabad etc.Dairies across the state had reported a dip in procurement of milk as farmers refused to provide milk and at places stopped milk tankers. R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)  the proprietor of Amul  said their milk procurement was hit in Maharashtra. Amul sells around 19 lakh litres of milk per day in the state and Mumbai is one of the major markets of the brand. We procure around 10 lakh litres from the state and the procurement was less today.In many places, the tankers were stopped, he said. Sodhi said while they were able to deliver milk on Thursday, if the strike continues, milk shortage could not be ruled out. Kolhapur-based Warna Cooperative Dairys milk tanker was attacked allegedly on Wednesday night near Satra, when it was transporting milk to Mumbai. B B Bhandari, general manager (transport) of the dairy, said they supply around 2.5 lakh litres of milk to Mumbai and procurement of the same was hit. We shall be transporting milk under police protection to Mumbai, but procurement has been hit, he said.An unfazed Khot said the state government will be able to ensure smooth supply of milk and vegetables to the urban areas. The people who are behind this strike are failed politicians who do not want the farmers to prosper, he said. Khot said the government was ready to talk and the on-going strike was not the solution. Rayate and other Kisan Kranti members, however, refuted Khots charges.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Narendra Vaskar Navi Mumbai was among a handful of APMCs where the strike had little impact on Thursday. Narendra VaskarMAJOR Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) shut operations on Thursday after farmers decided to stop supplying their produce as a mark of protest against the government for not acceding to their demand for a crop loan waiver. On the first day of the strike, there were reports of farmers turning violent and clashing with police while trying to stop vegetable-laden vehicles from entering local markets.In Yeola, Nashik district, the state police launched tear gas and fired rubber bullets to disperse a stone-pelting mob. One person and five policemen were injured.The incident took place near Jalal toll booth where protesting farmers reportedly stopped over 100 vehicles carrying vegetables and threw the produce on the road.The mob allegedly first burned down a vehicle over rumours that it was carrying beef. After that, the protesters started searching each vehicle that passed through the stretch and threw items found in those on the road. Some of the protesters also looted vehicles that were carrying oil and ghee, after which the State Reserve Police Force was called in. The mob then pelted the police with stones and five policemen were injured.The police used tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the mob. One youth, 35-year-old Yashwant Jadhav, was injured in police action and five of our men were injured due to stone-pelting by the locals, Nashik S P Ankush Shinde said.Incidents of violence also took place in areas like Niphad in Nashik district and Kopargaon, in Ahmednagar district. In several other incidents across Maharashtra, farmers blocked roads and vandalised vehicles ferrying vegetables.In places like Satara and Shirdi, farmers demanding a Minimum Support Price of Rs 50 per litre of milk threw milk on the streets as a mark of protest.The state-wide protest, however, did not have an immediate impact on major cities like Mumbai, where major APMCs like Vashi operated as usual. But local traders said that the situation is likely to deteriorate from tomorrow as the intensity of the protest increases.We received close to 550-600 vegetable-laden vehicles in the market on Thursday that is close to the normal inflow of produce. However, we are apprehending that things will go bad from Friday as the agitation picks up. The market usually remains closed on Sundays and the city may end up feeling the pinch of the strike from the beginning of the new week, Ashok Shinde, a trader at the Vashi APMC, said.Vegetable vendors at Borivali and Ville Parle (East) markets are worried fearing a rise in supply prices from Friday. Although the supply prices have not increased yet, we apprehend the trouble to start tomorrow with a shortage in supply and rise in prices of vegetables, said Ashok Kumar, a vendor at Borivali market.The Vile Parle (East) market seemed more affected, with supply prices already having increased by Rs 10-15 on Thursday, according to vegetable vendor Ram Vinay. Although the prices have not increased, less vegetables were supplied to us.On Friday, the supply will be even less, said Ghanshyam Kandu, another vendor.In Nashik district, all 12 APMCs remained empty with farmers refraining from bringing their produce to the market. Nashik supplies a bulk of the fresh vegetables that come to Mumbai. The total turnover of these 12 APMCs is around Rs 23 crore per day, which came to a grinding halt. The APMC remained open but hardly any farmer came in with their produce, said Vilas Shinde, a trader from Nashik APMC.In Ahmednagar district, there were reports of milk and vegetables being thrown on the streets by farmers. In Pune APMC, too, supply of vegetables was affected. We generally get 1,100 vehicles in the market every day. On Thursday, we received only 725. The number will go down. Prices shot up by 10-20 per cent in the market and it will go on if the condition prevails, Vilas Bhujbal, a trader in Pune APMC, said.Farmers have stopped sending their produce to markets across the state as part of a protest to seek loan waiver from the state government.Some of the major demands of the farmers are that the state should clear the 7/12 extracts that are property documents of farmers from all liabilities.The farmers are seeking interest-free loans, a pension scheme for farmers over 60 years, uninterrupted power supply and a minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre of milk.Nearly 99 per cent of the farmers from our village did not send their produce to the markets. This is a do-or-die situation for us. We do not get proper price for our produce. We have a situation where onion gets sold at Rs 2 per kg. How can the farmers afford to sell at this price? Going on strike hurts us financially but we hope that this temporary hardship will provide us long term relief, Zakir Mulani, a farmer from Akluj in Solapur district, said.As tonnes of perishable goods like vegetables and milk were on the line, some farmers found ingenious ways of preserving their produce to use them once the strike ends. Some farmers in Ahmednagar turned their milk into khoya and basundi for future use. Big land owners in Nashik district opened up their cold storage units for stocking up the produce of local farmers.Although there was solidarity amongst the farmers and traders, instances of protesting farmers been beaten up by the public were reported.In Aurangabad, APMC farmers who were trying to implement the strike were assaulted by local traders opposed to the move. Around 20 per cent farmers did not take part in the strike and brought their produce to the market. We were requesting them not to do so when we were assaulted by local traders, Jayaji Suryavanshi, an activist from Aurangabad said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"

Maharashtra Farmers' Protest Explained",http://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-are-milk-vans-onion-trucks-being-emptied-on-roads-maharashtra-farmers-protest-explained/story-jBn2fivHIlWPunCw513lYO.html,2017-06-01,"Spilling milk, emptying onion trucks  this is the first time farmers from Maharashtra are seen in an aggressive avatar.THE DEMANDDistressed over falling prices of agricultural produce and other issues, farmers have demanded a loan waiver.During 2016-17, banks had disbursed farm loan worth Rs 40,000 crore to the states 13.7 million farmers. The loan disbursement has been 80% of the overall agriculture credit target which was set at Rs 51,000 crore for the fiscal.Bank of Maharashtra, the largest public sector lender in the state, has seen sharp rise in its NPA from 9.55% in 2015-16 to 13.26% in 2016-17. Part of the reason, bankers say, was also demonetisation when recovery almost came to a halt.As the UP government waived farm loan worth Rs36,369 crore, Maharashtra has been under pressure to do something similar.Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis earlier said the cost of extending the loan waiver to 31 lakh farmers is Rs30,500 crore and if the government decided to bear it, that would mean depriving other sections of society from their social schemes.The CM said rather than giving loan waivers, the state will focus on sustainable growth of agriculture. Due to impressive agricultural growth  12.5% this year from the negative growth rate last year  the collective income of farmers grew by Rs 40,000 crore.When asked to scrap infrastructure projects to avail funds to waive the farm loan, the CM had said the international funding agencies fund the infrastructure projects, but there was no provision of funding the loan waiver to the farmers.POLITICAL PRESSURE FROM ALLIESShiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray recently gave a veiled threat of pulling out of the government if his demand to waive off farmers loan is not accepted. Addressing the farmers, Thackeray said his party would give unconditional support to the government if it grants a farm loan waiver. Give a loan waiver and all the Sena ministers will vacate their seats and will give unconditional outside support. If the waiver is announced, we will ensure the government completes its full term, Thackeray said.NDA ally Swabhimani Paksha, headed by farmers leader Raju Shetti, will go no holds barred against Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government over loan waiver for distressed farmers. Accusing the government of deceiving farmers, Shetti said he was repenting his decision of supporting the government, which had adopted a Mar Jawaan, Mar Kisaan (Die Youth, Die Farmer) policy. The farmers who elected this government will eliminate it. The jawans being martyred at the border are from farmer families and in villages, farmers are killing themselves. The government is following a Mar Jawaan, Mar Kisaan policy, he said, adding farmers are against the Mumbai-Nagpur expressway for which their land will be acquired.FARMERS STRATEGYWhile farmers want a loan waiver, the state government has sought time for deliberation. The strike is the farmers way of creating shortage of milk and vegetable supplies to putting pressure on the government to give in to their demands."

As per reports, there are a few people, including some former members of kisan sangh who are misguiding farmers to continue their agitation,"" said BJP state chief Nandkumar Singh Chauhan while talking to reporters on Friday. The BJP chief also appealed to the farmers' union and kisan sangh to withdraw their agitation and provide an unhindered supply of essentials.Chauhan without taking name of any leader, said the Congress was taking undue advantage of situation. ""Congress leaders at some places forced farmers to dump their crop and milk on roads,"" he said.""Congress leaders in Indore and Bhopal forced farmers to dump their produce and milk on the road. Farmers were unwilling to waste their crop, but they were not allowed to take their produce to mandis or distribute it to poor families,"" said the BJP head.Farmers in several parts of Madhya Pradesh launched a 10-day-long agitation from Thursday, stopping supply of milk, food grains and vegetables to protest lack of good prices for their farm produce. Protesters had stopped vehicles carrying fruits, vegetables, food grains and emptied milk containers on roads triggering a crisis-like situation for essential commodities.Stressing that BJP-led Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in the state left no stone unturned to give farmers their due share, Nandkumar said apart from relief during calamities, the government also provided farmers a justified procurement price and ensured availability of market.""The government distributed more than Rs 4,000 crore as a relief to farmers, provided interest-free loan, subsidised seeds and machinery. They should have at least discussed with the government before taking a drastic step,"" Chauhan said.He said the government last year purchased onion and other perishable produce from farmers to help them financially. The government also announced to build warehouses for storage and establishing food processing units to provide a direct market to farmers, which is under consideration in the government policy to double farmers' income, he said."

As many as 42 cases of looting and violence were registered against the protesters. A group of over 500 stopped a truck carrying onions near Kotru phata at Niphad tehsil on the Nashik-Aurangabad highway on Friday morning and emptied half of the consignment on the road. Milk cans were being spilled on many highways. The local police and the quick response team (QRT) commandos were forced to conduct a lathi charge, following which the farmers dispersed and the road was cleared for the vehicles. Reports have also emerged of instances of violence resulting in the imposition of section 144 in Nashik.Among the cities where APMCs have been forced to shut as farmers continue their strike are Pune, Nashik, Mumbai and Thane. Lasalgaon APMC, which is the largest onion supplier in the country has been shut for the last two days. Over 25,000 quintals of onions had arrived in the market yard on May 31.Because there was no transaction in the Lasalgaon market yard on Thursday and Friday , not a single truck of onion was received by the Mumbai APMC.The data provided by Ma harashtra State Market Committee Cooperative Federation (MSMCCF) showed that markets were closed largely in Nashik, Pune and Latur divisions with full support from farmers. President of MSMCCF Dilip Mohite told TOI that the arrivals were just 10-15 per cent and there was a 90 per cent shortage overall. ""The overall shortfall will increase further as the strike intensifies,'said Mohite. In the Pune district there was 90% shortfall of produce coming into the markets while the figure was nearly 96% in Kolhapur, 30% in Satara, 40% in Solapur and 50% in Sangli district Activists like HM Desarda and lawyers have backed farmers.(Inputs from Pune , Nashik)"

Sandeep Gidde (34), an MBA, is a Sangli farmer who also works as an event manager hosting agri-exhibitions. And 47-year old Dhananjay Dhorde has a Bachelor's degree and owns a 15-acre farm in Aurangabad.Younger, educated farmers like them form the backbone of Kisan Kranti, the group spearheading the strike which has crippled vegetable and milk supply chains across large parts of the state. The apolitical, leaderless agitation has drawn support from 37 smaller groups. But its core members are between 30 and 50 years old. Few have participated in previous agitations even though they come from farming families.""Our fathers did `rasta-rokos' and hunger strikes but it led nowhere. So we decided to do something different. If you don't pinch the nose, the mouth won't open,"" says Rayate. Significantly , the Opposition's `Sangharsh Yatra' just two months ago created barely a ripple.Besides small meetings, the use of social media including Whatsaspp and Facebook helped the movement reach out to other groups, guided by Gidde's event management skills. ""I knew how to reach out to large groups of people effectively and what posts could go viral,"" he says.What drew the Kisan Kranti together was the devastating crash in prices of key crops like onions, tomatoes and tur dal over the last year. The issue touched a chord among farmers across districts.The price crash had pushed even prosperous farmers like Rayate deeper into debt. ""Grapes which cost Rs 25 per kilo to grow, fetch a price of Rs 10. Last month brinjals were selling at Rs 25 for 20 kg. It cost more to transport them to the mandi,"" he said.The final catalyst was a gram sabha meeting in Ahmednagar's Puntamba village in April where villagers initially considered boycotting sowing. Later they decided to boycott agricultural markets instead. ""They realized its only when urban food markets are affected that there will be pressure on the government,"" says G Patil, an agro-markets expert who is part of Kisan Kranti.The movement spread to the onion belt of Nashik and the milk producing regions of western Maharashtra including Sangli, Satara and Solapur. Marathwada's districts, mainly Aurangabad, also joined.The discontent among farmers in the north Maharashtra belt had escalated with the state's decontrol of agricultural markets last year, says Patil. ""Traders called a strike for a monthand-a-half and onion prices crashed to 5 paise,"" says Patil. Later, the glut in the onion, tomato and tur crop kept prices low. Farmers ended up dumping their tomato and onion crop. By November, demonetisation added to the crisis.Activists recall a similar agitation led by farmer leader Sharad Joshi in 1982 but this one has created greater impact. ""The idea spread so fast because its time has come,"" says Patil. ""The new generation of farmers are more aware.They understand issues like import subsidies and the fact that crops are sometimes imported at a higher price than domestic rates.""Kisan Kranti has also drawn professionals including lawyers and social workers, whom they rely on for advice.""We have drawn up committees for different tasks: legal advice, meetings with the government, administration and publicity ,"" says Gidde."

The vegetable and onion auctions at all district APMCs could not take place on Thursday and Friday because of the ongoing stir.Vendors had procured vegetables from farmers a day before the strike and sold it the next day on Thursday, at higher rates. However, there was no auction in the district APMCs because of which most of the vegetable markets ran dry. Some vendors sold vegetables, but they had a few varieties with limited quantity.""Nashik APMC is the major location, where vegetables are auctioned in the district. Of the total auction, around 5% or 30 tonne of vegetables are supplied to the city.

It succeeds fairly well.Canto replaces Karma The Liquid Lounge, popular in the early 2000s for filling a gap between nightclub and fine-dining restaurant. In its new avatar, it has a chilled-out, easy vibe. In the midst of families out for a mid-week lunch and noisy kitty-partying women, one does spy the odd office-goer at a quick, solo lunch.Divided up into a voluminous main area on the ground floor and a tiny mezzanine level, the sense of space was apparent the moment we walked in. Comfortable tufted couches and wrought-iron-legged tables sit atop black-and-white tiles. Adding a touch of whimsy, two giant paintings of dancers in voluminous skirts dominate one wall. There are pendant lights and wall sconces; and plenty of natural light streaming in from the large windows.The Thai curry bao was disappointing.

Our next drink, the sour Melodies, was too high on lime juice and too low on gin.

A competent but boring combination of molten chocolate lava cake and vanilla ice-cream did little to outshine the creamy brilliance of the wobbly blueberry cheesecake with crumbly shortbread base.

5a0116579855b76bf13a6c53,KKM faces ire of farmers for not taking them into confidence,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/kkm-faces-ire-of-farmers-for-not-taking-them-into-confidence-4687814/,2017-06-03,"ALTHOUGH Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Saturday morning announced that the farmers strike has been called off, it seemed to have little effect on the striking farmers in Maharashtra, who later in the day declared their intention to continue with the strike.Saturday proved to be a day of intense politicking, which saw the core committee members of Kisan Kranti Morcha, the umbrella organisation that spearheaded the movement, being ousted for not taking farmers into confidence before calling off the strike.Post-Saturday, the nerve centre of the movement seem to have moved from Puntambe in Rahata taluka of Ahmednagar to the neighbouring Nashik district.Loan waivers, implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about prices of agri-commodities and increase in the procurement price of milk have been some of the main demands which sparked the farmers strike.Since June 1, farmers have stopped movement of vegetables and milk which has squeezed supplies to the wholesale markets across the state. Dhananjay Jadhav, Dhananjay Dhorde, Sandeep Gidde, Kamal Sawant and Shantaram Kunjir formed the core committee of Kisan Kranti who were empowered to talk with the state government on behalf of the farmers.Since the last few months, villages across Maharashtra had seen Gram Sabhas passing resolutions to participate in the strike which would also translate into farmers refraining from agriculture. The movement had also called for a Maharashtra wide bandh barring Mumbai on Monday. Due to the strike, prices of vegetables spiralled and milk procurement has been hit.R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCCMMF) which markets dairy and dairy products under the brand Amul, said procurement in Maharashtra has been severely hit.Milk carrying vehicles to Mumbai are being transported under police protection from Gujarat. As the strike entered its second day, the core committee had left for Mumbai late Friday night to meet the chief minister. After a marathon meeting, Fadnavis along with the core committee members except Dhorde had called off the strike early on Saturday morning. Gidde who spoke to The Indian Express early on Saturday morning said around 70 per cent of their demands including loan waivers to marginal farmers, passing of a legislation to penalise traders trading under Minimum Support Price (MSP) were agreed upon by the government. In view of this, we decided to the call off the strike, he said.However, the decision did not go down well with farmers who claimed they were not consulted by the core committee before taking the decision. As the day progressed, the core committee members started becoming the target of attack by farmers at various districts who were clearly not happy with the decision. By evening, committees in various districts announced that the strike would continue with farmers in Nashik, Ahmednagar, Western Maharashtra, Vidarbha joining in. As the anger among farmers spread, the core committee members came under increasing fire and soon all of them were unreachable for comments.Minister of State for Agriculture Sadabhau Khot, who has been the governments face for negotiation, came under severe criticism with farmers burning his effigy in Nashik. Reports have also come in of lathicharge on farmers in parts of Nashik and Ahmednagar.Amruta Pawar, member of the state committee, said the core committee had erred in taking the decision without consulting anyone. Pawar, who hails from Nashik, said that the protesting farmers in Puntambe had decided to oust the core committee and continue with the strike. In Nashik we decided to continue the strike, she said.Pawar said they had contacted leaders of organisations that have supported the strike in Nashik on Sunday to discuss the course of action. This is going to be an open air meeting so everyone can see what is happening, she said.Meanwhile, on Saturday, Swabhimani Paksha MP Raju Shetti and farmer leader Raghunath Patil who have considerable clout in Western Maharashtra announced the continuation of the strike. Shetti and Patil have decided to call a meeting on June 8 to discuss the matter.The apparent leaderless farmers strike has come at the back of the Maratha Morcha which saw lakhs thronging the streets. Puntambe, which is in the heart of onion and grapes belt, is just about two hours from Satana where the farmer leader Sharad Joshi had started his public movement for better onion prices.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Deepak Joshi At the APMC market in Kalyan on Saturday. Deepak JoshiThere has been a split in the ranks of farmers over the decision to withdraw their agitation after a meeting with Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis late on Friday night.A large chunk of farmers criticised the delegation which met the CM and claimed that the strike will continue. The backlash against leaders who were part of the delegation which announced the withdrawal of the strike has been so strong that many of them were forced to make a clarification that the strike has not been called off yet.If farmers think I have made a mistake, then I seek forgiveness from them. If they feel that the strike should continue then I am with them, said Jayaji Suryavanshi, member of the Kisan Kranti Morcha.Suryavanshi seemed to have drawn the maximum ire from farmers who burned his effigies. Visuals of the chief minister speaking into his ears during the marathon four-hour meeting on Friday created a perception that he had struck a deal with the government.This is a decision taken by children of farmers and not by politicians. We have told the state government that if it does not stay true to its promise in the next four months, we will not allow the government to function, Suryavanshi had said soon after the core committee meeting with the CM in which the withdrawal had been announced. However, the backlash the decision received seems to have made many leaders including Suryavanshi rethink their position.Many local farmers were unhappy that the committee decided to take a decision without taking into confidence farmers from across the state.The committee should have heard what the government had to say and then come back and shared the details with farmers. They, however, announced the withdrawal of the strike without any concrete assurances from the state or taking people into confidence. For us they are not a core committee but a chor (thieves) committee and we will continue with the agitation, Bhausaheb Shinde, a farmer from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, which had become the epicentre of the agitation, said.The Maharashtra Kisan Sabha has also criticised the decision to end the strike.The CM has spun a web around farmers. He has not given any clear assurance. If others want, they can withdraw from the agitation but the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha will continue with its agitation till we receive loan waiver for farmers, said a leader of the Maharashtra Kisan Sabha.Ajit Navale, general secretary of the Kisan Sabha, said, The chief minister did not give a clear answer to any of our demands. The new October 31 deadline that has been declared is a farce the 4-person committee will only announce its findings that day. No concrete decision regarding the waiver of loans or implementation of the Swaminathan report has been taken.Fadnavis has said that the commission shall look into waiving of loans of farmers who have smaller lands. What about Vidarbha or Marathwada, where most farmers have 10 to 15 acres of land, said Navale.The Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna also criticised the withdrawal and claimed that the government was attempting to create a rift between farmers.I was first invited to a meeting with the CM but was detained by the Pune rural police at Dehu Road police station. I was allowed to go only after the announcement of the strike being called off. This is an attempt to create a rift between farmers, Sanjay Patil Ghanekar, leader of the Baliraja Shetkari Sanghatna, said.Meanwhile, farmers in Nashik held a meeting on Saturday and decided to continue with their agitation including a state-wide bandh on June 5. The farmers meeting also heckled senior BJP leaders including Dindori MP Harishchandra Chavan and BJP MLAs from Nashik Balasaheb Sanap and Devyani Pharande when they tried to attend the meeting, forcing them to leave.In spite of the strike being called off, protests continued in areas like Dindori where women farmers blocked traffic on Kalwan Dindori road. In Saigaon near Yeola in Nashik district, onion and milk were thrown on the road. Similar agitations took place in Jalgaon and Parbhani as well.The decision to call off the strike seems to have had no impact on prices of vegetables which have kept on shooting up in cities like Mumbai. The wholesale price of capsicum jumped from Rs 60 on Friday to Rs 100 on Saturday. Carrot prices increased from Rs 40 to Rs 80, tomato from Rs 30 to Rs 80, brinjal Rs 40 to Rs 80. The price of a bundle of coriander jumped from Rs 100 to Rs 150.Vashi APMC saw nearly 175 vehicles coming into the market. However, the bulk of them were from outside the state.The prices are still high. The decision to take the strike back was taken only late on Friday. The market will remain shut on Sunday. We need to see how farmers react on Monday to the strike call that has been given. Only then will we get a clear picture on when prices can stabilise, Naresh Kor, a trader from Vashi APMC said.Lok Sabha MP Raju Shetti said the people who negotiated with the government were novices and he would hold a meeting of all farmer leaders and groups in Nashik next week to chart out the course of action. The Shiv Sena also criticised the state government and claimed that the state, rather than trying to find a solution, had tried to create a rift between farmers.Rather than trying to sort out the problem, the government seems to have tried to create a rift between farmers. They are just prolonging taking a decision. This is nothing but running away from the problem. It has been the Senas long-standing demand that there should be complete loan waiver for farmers, Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut said.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

When I am not reading my favourite thrillers, I read railway timetables. And since train journeys dont happen as often as they used to, I look forward to my Metro rides.So when I read that the new Heritage Line  to Kashmiri Gate, going through Dilli Gate, Lal Qila and Jama Masjid  had been inaugurated, I decided that I would take the Metro and go visit an old haunt. My destination was Jeha Caterers in Ansari Road, better known as Sardar Ji Puri Wale.I enjoyed the journey, but not the walk it entailed. I had thought the Metro would take me somewhere close to Ansari Road. Instead it went to Asaf Ali Road. I got down there, walked in this terrible heat for what seemed like ages, and then hailed a rickshaw. And then I finally found myself at the old shop which last gave me aloo puri  and immense pleasure  some three or four years ago.The shop is on the main Ansari Road (Address: Shop No G 4 EMCA House, phone no: 9717031008 and 9971808875). There is no sign there, but if you ask around, you will be directed to it. It is a small shop, with an area outside where the puris are prepared and fried in a huge kadhai. You can stand there eat, or have it packed which is what I did.The shop has been there for 66 years, though earlier it was a smaller shack on the other side of the road. When I used to go there, old Sardarji  Nand Singh  was there, supervising the making of the puris and serving the chholey. He is no more, and his son, Harbhajan Singh Kukoo is now in charge.A dash of hingThe place is known for its poori aloo-chholey. I asked for a few plates (Rs. 30 a plate) and for some kadhi chawal (Rs. 30). I enjoyed both immensely. The pakori was soft, had bits of spinach in it and had been tempered with whole coriander and cumin seeds and a few other masalas. A dash of hing added to the taste. The gravy was runny, and not very sour. And what I liked was the fact that it wasnt spicy hot.The aloo-chholey was the way I remembered it  light and tasty. The gravy had small cubes of potatoes in it, and some little urad dal-and-besan strips, which gave a surprising flavour burst. This came with a tangy pumpkin pickle and some onion slices. The puris were delicious, prepared with a mix of atta and maida, and a thin urad-dal paste in it. This is pure Punjabi puri, Kukoo told me.Puris are sold till 12.30 or 1 pm on weekdays, and till 2 pm on Sundays. After that, you can get kachoris or samosas filled with potatoes and peas. They also sell aloo bread pakoras and paneer bread pakoras in the evenings, along with thin, crispy jalebis. In the day time, they have laddoos and gulab jamun.I am sorry to find that many of the old culinary masters  who wielded such a deft karchhi  are not there any more. But what is heartening to know is that the next generation is taking over, expanding while ensuring that the old taste is not tinkered with. Old is gold, but new can be whew!"

We have called for a shut-down of entire Maharashtra on June 5, except Mumbai. On June 6, we will lock down all government offices and on June 7, we will lock down offices of MPs and MLAs, members of Kisan Kranti Core Committee told media representatives in Ahmednagar.Leaders of the farmers agitation reached Mumbai in the evening and are expected to hold another round of talks with the Chief Minister late in the night. Activist Anna Hazare is mediating the talks, sources said.The situation in Nashik district remained peaceful on Friday, the second day of the farmers strike, but all agriculture produce market committees (APMCs) remained shut. Nashik district is the biggest producer of onion in the country. Most of the onion trade takes place through APMCs.Until farmers get a complete loan waiver and the government agrees to all their demands, farmers should ensure their unity and continue with their agitation, Pawar said here after the steering committee of the farmers agitation decided to continue with its protest during their meeting at Puntambe in Ahmednagar district. Instead of wasting vegetables and milk, farmers should rather distribute all of it to poor people in villages and thereby strengthen their agitation, he added. (With PTI inputs)Nashik city faces shortageNashik city on Friday faced shortage of veggies and milk. Many milk vendors in the city joined the protest called by farmers. Agitators stopped vehicles carrying vegetables, fruits and milk at many places. They stopped milk-tankers heading for Hyderabad from Gujarat at the Sonagir toll-gate in neighbouring Dhule district. Protesters also staged road-roko on the Nashik-Pune highway at Sinnar. In a poignant sight, poor people were seen picking food grains and veggies thrown on roads by agitators at Siddhi Pimpri in Nashik district."

After the meeting, Chouhan said the farmers have decided to withdraw the stir. However, MP Kisan Sena (MPKS), which is spearheading the protest, said they had not yet called off the agitation.The meeting, however, created a rift between the protesting farmers.

I am happy that farmers have decided to withdraw their strike. Madhya Pradesh government is a pro-farmer regime and it will continue to work for the welfare of farmers, Chouhan tweeted after the meeting.After the talks, MPKS secretary Jagdish Rawalia said they were not completely satisfied.

In Sehore district, nine policemen including City Superintendent of Police (CSP) SR Dadotia and tehsildar Santosh Mudgal were injured when protesting farmers allegedly pelted stones at them at Sonda village on the Indore-Bhopal road.

Police have registered a case against the unknown persons, said Raipuria Police Station in-charge ML Bhawan.In Delanpur village of Ratlam district, police sub inspector Motiram Choudhary and his deputy Pawan Yadav suffered injuries in stone pelting.

Both the injured policemen were admitted to a hospital, she added.The CM is expected to arrive in Ratlam to take part in a function on Sunday night.The vegetables and fruits market remained closed at some places in the state especially in the Western region.

The BJP general secretary gets points for resilience, considering how badly his recent defence of the ban went. He posted on Facebook a cropped image of cattle slaughtered elsewhere, to condemn Keralas beef festival protests.Soon, the original, uncropped photograph was unearthed, with Bangla script on shops in the background. While some websites reported that it was clicked in Uttar Pradesh, Finance Minister T M Thomas Isaac identified the image as part of a 2015 series of photographs from Pakistan.Beef, incidentally, has been Surendrans scourge in the past as well. In 2015, he was cornered over a photograph of him supposedly having parottas and beef. He responded that the controversial side-dish was onion curry. No, the trolls havent stopped.R Krishnakumar,ThiruvananthapuramLast judgementRajasthan High Court judge Mahesh Chandra Sharma grabbed nationwide attention last week after he came up with the unique theory that the peacock should be the national bird as it is celibate. Within an hour of passing an order suggesting the Central and state governments to ensure that the cow be declared Indias national animal, he said at a media interaction, Peahens become pregnant by swallowing the tears of the peacock. His comments became viral with Facebook and Twitter users putting up jokes and songs on peacock.There were, however, more interesting statements that were part of his 139 page judgement: 33 crore gods and goddesses reside inside the cow and the animal appeared along with goddess Lakshmi during the churning of the ocean in Hindu mythology; Cow is the only living being which intakes oxygen and emits oxygen and the animal is a hospital in itself. Not surprisingly, this memorable viral order was his last judgement, as Sharma retired last Wednesday.Tabeenah Anjum, JaipurRaiding the richThe recent NIA raids, probing suspected funding of separatist leaders in the Valley, carried out at the residences of some high-profile Kashmiri businessmen in Srinagar created a flutter among the Kashmir Inc. The list of those raided included the whos who of the Valleys rich and famous. The Kashmir Inc said this witch hunting campaign is being launched to hurt our economic interests.As if that was not enough, a business tycoon-turned-PDP minister took a dig at the channels for portraying Kashmir in a negative way; he, however, remains out of danger because of his close proximity to Delhis power corridors. Once upon a time, the J&K Police had raided this business magnates residence on charges of channelling hawala funds to militant organisations through the cover of legitimate businesses.Zulfikar Majid, SrinagarBirthday giftThe BJP has taken strong objection to the Nitish regimes plan to inaugurate the two bridges over Ganga on June 11 as a birthday gift to Lalu Prasad. Lalus son Tejaswi Yadav, who is the Road Construction Minister in Bihar, besides the Deputy CM, had announced that the bridges will be a gift to his father. It will be very unfair to people of Bihar if it so happens. If Tejaswi wants to gift something to his father, he should do so from the property acquired by him, said senior BJP leader Sushil Modi.Arguing that the bridges should be named after Jaya Prakash Narayan (JP), he said, The two bridges (one connecting Ara with Chapra, another connecting Patna with Chapra) should be inaugurated on June 5, instead of on Lalus birthday. He reasoned that it was on June 5, 1975 that JP launched Sampoorna Kranti (total revolution) against the Indira Gandhi regime, and hence it has a historical significance. Nitish has, meanwhile, maintained a studied silence on the issue.Abhay Kumar, PatnaUnhappy RahulThe controversy over suspected impropriety and benami transactions in sand mining action by a powerful Punjab cabinet minister has left Congress vice president Rahul Gandhi miffed, it is learnt. In a meeting in New Delhi last week, Rahul is learnt to have conveyed to Punjab CM Capt Amarinder that the image of the party was being dented by the raging buzz surrounding power minister Rana Gurjit Singh.Singhs former employees, including his cook, with meager salaries, bid and bagged sand mines in Punjab worth nearly Rs 50 crore. Though Capt is under pressure to act against his cabinet colleague, he has managed to put off the issue, at least for now, saying he will wait until the outcome of the judicial probe ordered against Rana Gurjit.Gautam Dheer, Chandigarh"

Another reason, said farmers, was the fear that their produce would go waste as a State-wide bandh has been called on Monday.On Sundays, APMCs see only around 120 trucks arriving, and no business is conducted. The ongoing agitation by farmers, however, ensured that most traders chose to work on Sunday and received nearly 313 trucks of vegetables. Of these, around 180 were from the State, and close to 302 trucks left the market after unloading.Though wholesale prices were not fixed on Sunday, an increase in supply sent retail prices down, much to the relief of the common man. The fruit, grain market and onion-potato market remained closed. In all, 259 vehicles arrived at the fruit market, 29 at the grain market, one truck each of onion and garlic and 12 bearing potatoes."

He said on Tuesday, the activists have decided to lock government offices to press for their demand.Meanwhile, the Marathwada Mukti Morcha , a Jalna-based outfit, spearheading the campaign for separate Marathwada state for the last two years, has also extended its support to the farmers' strike.Incidentally, the Mukti Morcha has invited Swabhmani Shetkari Sanghatana leader Raju Shetti to attend its convention at Aurangabad on Tuesday. ""The programme was decided long back. But still we support the farmers' strike,"" said Baba Ugle, founder president of the Marathwada Mukti Morcha.Shetkari Sanghatana has, however, taken a neutral stand. Shrikant Umrikar , a Shetkari Sanghatana leader, said they are neither in favour of nor against the strike. ""We did not want to send a message that the farmers are divided, due to which we supported the strike. We don't generally approve of any strike in June as it is the beginning of the kharif sowing season,"" he added."

Sources said that senior ministers discussed the issue of farmers agitations in MP and Maharashtra. The BJP chief Amit Shah was also learnt to have spoken to the MP chief minister over phone.Concerns in the government and the party appear to be more for the reason that the farmers agitation has come at a time when the NDA is in the midst of a campaign to drum up support for achievements of three years of the Modi government. Incidentally, MP along with Rajsthan and Chattisgarh will to the Assembly elections in the later parts of the next year.The MP government had already accepted most of the demands of farmers on June 4. Farmers in the state have never resorted to violence. There are reports that criminal gangs and anti-social elements got involved in the agitation with the support of local Congress leader. What we are witnessing in parts of the state is nothing but the criminal-political motive of the Congress getting exposed, said BJP leader GVL Narsimha Rao.With the Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi heading to Mandsaur on Thursday, a long drawn political slugfest over the status of farmers in the state seems to be on the card. Incidentally, officials in the Central government had been noting for a while that the farmers were not able to sell the crops of pulses at the Minimum Support Price (MSP), besides the bumper onion crop having led the cultivators to resort to distress sale.But BJP leaders cannot agree that the situations of farmers are distressing. MP has been registering 20 per cent plus agricultural growth, while the state has emerged as number two in wheat productions. The state has also been the best performer in spreading irrigation facilities. The state government had ensured farm loan at one per cent interest, added Rao."

It has been the second year of a bumper onion crop with no buyers, forcing the government to announce a belated decision to procure the onions for Rs 8 per kilogram.Farmers are angry because the government neither made arrangements to procure the crop on time nor intervened to ensure a reasonable price. They threw onions on roads given the prices of the vegetables plummeted to as low as Re 1 to Rs 2 per kg in certain markets, especially in the Malwa region, last year. This year too, farmers had to sell their winter crop  tomato and potato  at throwaway prices, bearing heavy loss.The distress is visible in the suicide numbers. From February 2016 to mid-February 2017, 1,982 farmers and farm labourers reportedly committed suicide, which was one-fifth of the total suicides in the state, where 21,000 farmers have taken their lives in 16 years.The National Crime Records Bureau attributed the reasons to crop failure, failure to sell produce, inability to repay loans, and other non-agriculture factors such as poverty and property disputes.The farmers should have been affluent if 20% growth figure given by the government is to be believed, said former state agriculture director GS Kaushal. But, he said, the reality was that input costs were rising and government failed to ensure remunerative price.MP farmer agitation: How the crisis unfolded June 1: Farmers begin a ten-day-long agitation in Madhya Pradesh demanding better price for their produce June 4: Clashes break out between police and farmers in Sehore, Indore and Bhopal districts, leaving six policemen injured June 4 afternoon: A delegation of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS), which is affiliated to saffron parivar, defers farmers agitation following a meeting with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan in Ujjain June 4 evening: Enraged by the announcement of BKS, other two major organisations spearheading the agitation - Rashtriya Kissan Mazdoor Sangh and Bharatiya Kisan Union - say agitation had not been called off or deferred.

But farmers in general were not able to claim benefits again as they were not able to repay the short-term loan.

Today, however, there has been a substantial increase in the supply, compared to the past few days, said Gangadhar, a vegetable vendor from Matunga market.Vendors at the APMC market in Turbhe, Navi Mumbai, reported that supply had returned to normal and prices had reduced on Wednesday. (Bachchan Kumar/HT)Ashok Walanj, APMC director who also represents the onion and potato market, said the market received 125 trucks carrying onions.Over the past few days, there was a shortage in supply. Today, however, we received a good supply of onions and potatoes. We got onions from all over Maharashtra except Nashik. We also got 50 trucks of potatoes. Prices are low, he said.Vendors said the supply of fruits had not been hit much. As it is the holy month of Ramzan, the middlemen cannot afford to stop supplying fruits. They have somehow managed to deliver a certain quantity of fruits daily. There has been some shortage, but our sup, said Prakash, a fruit vendor at Matunga market.The supply of fruits to Navi Mumbais markets was not affected much during the statewide farmers strike.

Only 15 of these were from Maharashtra. About 320 vehicles supplied the market with vegetables on Tuesday.Parts of Maharashtra are only supplying us with minuscule quantities. However, there are arrivals from outside the state, which are taking care of the demand, said wholesaler Ganesh Pingle. He added that prices have not dropped much as supply is yet to return to normal in wholesale markets. In retail markets, however, prices have reduced.Prices in retail markets are expected to drop in the next few days.

5981a5579855b768c1b03a49,Farmer anger rocks Chouhan chair,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170608/jsp/nation/story_155771.jsp,2017-06-08,"Shivraj Singh Chouhan Bhopal, June 7: Shivraj Singh Chouhan appears vulnerable for the first time since becoming Madhya Pradesh chief minister in 2005, and it's his core constituency of farmers that is threatening to become his nemesis. A farmers' agitation that led to six protesters being shot dead by the security forces in the state yesterday seems to have done what the Vyapam scam, involving bribery charges relating to the state exam for professional college courses and government recruitment, failed to do. Many in the state BJP believe that now is the time to push for a change of leadership if Prime Minister Narendra Modi and party president Amit Shah wish to retain Madhya Pradesh, which goes to the polls in November 2018. Chouhan has survived many crises, including the sinister deaths of many Vyapam witnesses and huge corruption scandals. But anger among farmers is not easy to wish away even for a chief minister who has been winning the top agriculture prize in the country for the past five years. The current agrarian crisis owes not to any natural causes but to bad political and administrative management. This is the second year running that the state has had a bumper onion crop. Throughout May, many farmers were forced to sell their produce at Rs 2 to Rs 3 a kg as the Chouhan government delayed announcing the procurement price, of Rs 8 a kg, till June 5. In Indore, farmers had left truckloads of onions on the streets in protest. According to one estimate, one-third of the state's onion crop has rotted away because of inadequate storage facilities. The otherwise prosperous farmers from the Malwa and Nimar regions went on the rampage five days after launching their protest on June 1, demanding a minimum support price and loan waivers. The demand for loan relief has spread across several north Indian states after the Yogi Adityanath government in Uttar Pradesh fulfilled the BJP's poll promise by announcing a Rs 36,359-crore waiver. Chouhan, confident of his farmer-friendly image, appeared to be taking matters lightly. He avoided the farmers' main demand - a waiver of their Rs 39,000 crore worth of loans. Around the same time, his cabinet cleared the 7th Pay Commission's suggested pay scales for state government employees, putting the exchequer under an additional burden of Rs 4,500 crore. Once the new pay scales are implemented with effect from January 1, 2016, the burden would zoom to Rs 8,000 crore. Some farmer leaders like Shiv Kumar Sharma of the Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh have been openly asking how the son of a farmer (Chouhan) could be more concerned about government employees than the far larger number of survival-threatened farmers. At a political level, Chouhan went on holding secret negotiations with the Sangh-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh. Two days ago, state BJP chief Nand Kumar Chouhan had announced a felicitation for the leaders of the Kisan Sangh for ""successfully calling off the farmers' agitation"". But other farmer organisations stepped up their agitation. Shiv Kumar Sharma, for instance, was deeply upset that Chouhan had not invited him and other farmer leaders for talks although his organisation has the largest following among the state's farmers.The prices of pulses too have fallen sharply in Madhya Pradesh. While the central government has raised the minimum support price of tur dal from Rs 4,500 to a little over Rs 5,000 a quintal, the state's agencies have failed to procure any significant amount of the produce at the assured price. Many farmers in Madhya Pradesh have sold their tur dal at less than Rs 3,000 a quintal. On Monday, Chouhan had tried to provide succour to onion farmers, offering to procure the crop at Rs 8 a kg till June 30, and announced a farm price stabilisation fund with a Rs 1,000-crore corpus. Chouhan also acknowledged that the state had witnessed a bumper production of tur dal and promised to buy the produce for the minimum support price. He further promised to allow 50 per cent of the transactions at the state's 750 mandis to be carried out through cash and the rest through bank operations. Since the demonetisation last November 8, cash transactions had fallen by 70 per cent at the mandis because of the liquidity crunch, causing hardship to the farmers. But Tuesday's conflagration, which led to the deaths, showed what the farmers thought of the sops."

Farmers are demanding loan waivers and remunerative prices for all crops, many of them encouraged by Uttar Pradeshs decision to write off loans given to small farmers. The governments of Maharashtra and Punjab, where the protests are spreading, have rightly resisted because loan waivers only offer relief that is usually exhausted in two farming seasons.The cardinal malaise lies in successive governments treating agriculture as a source of votes and not an engine of growth. That kept the rural-urban wage gap wide at 45%, almost four times that of China, and shrunk the share of farming in GDP to under 14%, although more than half of Indias 1.25 billion people still depend on it.To be sure, India is reforming parts of its economy. But not farming. If farmers are to escape poverty, farming needs to become more like manufacturing: Teched up operations, free as far as possible from imponderables, churning out quality produce that fetch the right price.For this, things need to change. The old, labour-intensive methods must give way to technology for efficiency and higher yield; Pricing and subsidy mechanism must be overhauled; and, most importantly, India must look at fewer people farming.For far too long, farming has been at the mercy of nature, especially the June-September monsoon rain. The use of technology is patchy, and only one-tenth of every rupee the government spends on rural areas goes to improving productivity  which is why farmers in India grow 46% less rice an acre than their Chinese counterparts.Our farm subsidy policy encourages the production of only low-value staples, such as rice and wheat, and the output of fruits and vegetables  that more Indians are eating and farmers producing  is not covered by the governments minimum support price. Much of the farm distress sweeping India now stemmed from a glut of potatoes, onion and tomatoes.Worse, the monopoly of traders over local agricultural markets is perpetuated by law, which bars farmers from selling directly to consumers. This kills any chance of farmers getting a fair price, lining the pockets of commission agents instead.In the past, a single season of dry spell was enough to send the economy into recession. Now failed monsoons trigger localised distress. Thats an improvement. Still, far too many farm households remain too poor. And unless the rural economy is unshackled from a time and policy warp, our dream of double-digit economic growth will remain just that: A dream."

The party has not taken any such decision. But any spontaneous reaction from the public cannot be ruled out, said BJD spokesperson Pratap Keshari Deb.While the BJP is tom-tomming its achievement in farm sector, two of the BJP-ruled States, including Maharashtra, are facing serious agitation from farmers which speaks volumes, Deb said, making a veiled attack on the BJP.The BJP is making wild allegations against our Government over distress sale of onion. Why is distress sale of onion there in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh? Deb wondered.The agriculture sector is still limping with just 1.7 per cent average annual growth during the last three years of Modi Government and most of the farmers are struggling for survival.The 1.7 per cent agricultural growth in the last three years (2014-2017) of the NDA Government is much lower than the 3.6 per cent in the last three years of Manmohan Singh Government, Deb said.Besides, the BJP owes an explanation to the people about the Prime Ministers promise to double the income of farmers which is still a distant dream, he added."

593c72507be9e00ed19a35ba,Why a bountiful harvest drove farmers to despair and anger,http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-a-bountiful-harvest-drove-farmers-to-despair-and-anger/story-Z4Tv0RSb49s9ANWv2OIP7L.html,2017-06-08,"A plentiful harvest in 2016 and imports drive some prices down 63%. A shortage of cash because of demonetisation. Despite Rs 3.5 lakh crore  enough to build 545 Tehri-sized dams  invested over six decades to 2011, more than half of all farms depend on rains. These are the three factors agitating Indians who depend on farming  90 million families, or 54.6% of Indias 1.2 billion people.As anger sweeps rural Madhya Pradesh after the death of six farmers in police firing, farm protests roil rural Maharashtra -- wholesale markets are shut, produce is being dumped on streets -- and governments of the debt-ridden states struggle to respond to demands for loan waivers, an IndiaSpend analysis and reportage from rural Maharashtra explores why farmers are both angry and desperate.The primary reason farming is unviable in India is that farms are now among the worlds smallest (the global average land-holding size is 5.5 hectares)  too many people are dependent on shrinking farms.Since 1951, the per capita availability of land has declined by 70%, from 0.5 hectares to 0.15 hectares in 2011, and is likely to decline further, according to ministry of agriculture data.Such small and marginal land-holdings, as they are called, now constitute 85% of the number of operational farms in the country, according this 2015-16 report on the state of Indian agriculture.It is hard to use modern machinery on small farms, the owners of which are often too poor to afford farm equipment. Manual labour increases costs, but labour too has been in short supply, as workers migrate to cities. Further, their size and output limits access to loans and institutional credit.Those are the larger issues. Here are the three reasons for the current turmoil, gleaned by IndiaSpends analysts and reporters:1. After back-to-back droughts, a good harvest, but incomes fallAs 2017 rolled in, the news from Indias farms appeared good.After droughts in 2014 and 2015, a good monsoon in 2016 reversed two years of rural economic decline. Indias agricultural growth contracted 0.2% in 2014-15 and grew no more than 1.2% in 2015-16, because of the back-to-back droughts. In 2016-17, the agricultural economy grew 4.1%.Across many states growing pulses, such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Gujarat, markets were flooded with produce, especially tur (pigeon pea), which witnessed the highest growth among all pulses, an important source of protein for a majority of Indians. India is the worlds largest pulses producer.However, an influx of pulses from Myanmar, Tanzania, Mozambique and Malawigrowing 20% over two financial quarters, from September 2016 to March 2017, the Business Standard reported on March 3, 2017caused the price of Indian tur to plunge.From Rs 11,000 per quintal (from December 2015), the price of tur fell 63% to Rs 3,800-4,000 per quintal  20% below the minimum support price (MSP)the price at which government buys farm produceof Rs 5,050 per quintal (including a bonus of Rs 425) since December 2016 as Indiaspend reported on April 12, 2017.The table above explains how production of pulses rose 29%, from 17.15 million tonnes in 2014-15 to 22.14 million tonnes in 2016-17. Tur production increased 50%, from 2.81 million tonnes to 4.23 million tonnes, over the same period.The MSP for tur should be increased to Rs 6,000 per quintal in 2017 and Rs 7,000 per quintal in 2018, a government committee headed by chief economic adviser Arvind Subramanian recommended in September 2016.As on March 2017, the minimum support price for tur was Rs 5,050 per quintal, nearly 20% (18%) lower than the prices recommended by the committee on pulses.As these prices crashed, farmers found it harder to find money to store their produce and prepare for the next season because demonetisationthe withdrawal of 86% of Indias currency, by value, on November 2016 left them starved of cash.2. How demonetisation  and government red tape  left farmers short of cashOn May 18, at around noon, 30-year-old Prashant Lande waited under a harsh summer sun to sell 800 quintals of tur at the Amravati agricultural produce market committee (APMC), 664 km east of Indias financial capital, Mumbai.From Kinhala village in Amravati districts Ashti taluka, in Maharashtras eastern region of Vidharbha, Lande said he refuses to sell his 800 quintals of tur to the government procurement centre, although the state buys tur at a higher rate.At the market, Lande could sell his tur at Rs 3,800 to Rs 4,000 per quintal, while the government buying centre offered Rs 5,050 per quintal.We dont sell to the government centre because the process of selling takes one month  from standing in line for the token to the sale to finally when the payment reaches the account, said Lande. Our fellow farmers who have sold their produce at the procurement centre on March 22, are yet to receive their payments and it is nearly June!It does not help that the effects of demonetisation continue to to be felt across the rural economy.Right after demonetisation, tomato farmers in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, and onion farmers in Maharashtra and Gujarat, were the worst hit as prices fell by 60-85%, IndiaSpend reported on January 18, 2017.With little respite more than six months later, the experiment has aggravated the circumstances leading to the current farmers strike.By now we should have begun preparing our fields for the monsoons, but because of demonetisation and the unavailability of cash, we are still struggling to find money for sowing, said Lande.At such a time, farmers like Lande turn to credit.Up to 57% of farm families in Maharashtra are indebted; the figure for India is 52%, according to the National Sample Survey Organisations 2013 situation assessment survey of farm households, the latest available data.This indebtedness has widespread consequences. More farmers committed suicide in Maharashtra (4,291) in 2015 than any other state, rising 7% from 4,004 in 2014, followed by Karnataka (1,569) and Telangana (1,400), as IndiaSpend previously reported in January 2017.Now, after Uttar Pradeshs new government waived Rs 30,792 crore of farm loans, pressure is building on the governments of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka to do the same. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis has been reluctant to do so, but with his governments coalition partner, the Shiv Sena, and other parties preparing for a political agitation, he may find it hard to exercise fiscal prudence.3. In an era of climate change, 52% of Indian farmers without irrigationThe basic problem across most of rural India is that despite the spread of irrigationa sector plagued by unfinished projects and corruption52% of Indias farms still depend on the vagaries of rain, which is becoming increasingly uncertain in an era of climate change.Extreme rainfall events in central India, the core of the monsoon system, are increasing and moderate rainfall is decreasing  as a part of complex changes in local and world weather  according to a clutch of Indian and global studies, as IndiaSpend reported on April 15, 2015.The droughts of 2014 and 2015 in rural Maharashtra were mitigated by the plentiful rains of 2016, but many parts of the state also endured floods. Uncertain weather affects the ability of government extension systems to provide accurate advice to farmers.The government encouraged us to grow more tur in the kharif (July to October) season, since these crops consume less water and are in high demand, said Lande, the Vidarbha farmer. We would not have faced so much loss over the last three years, had there been a proper system of canals.Despite six decades of irrigation, less than 50% (or 66 million hectares of Indias net-cultivated area of 140 million hectares) as irrigated, according to the 2015-16 State of Agriculture report. Groundwater provides water for two-thirds of Indias irrigated land, but those levels are falling from overuse.From the first five year plan (1951-56) to the eleventh (2006 to 2011), the central government has spent a total of Rs 3.51 lakh crore, as we said, on major irrigation and flood control projects characterised by time and cost overruns, shows this 12th Five Year Plan (2012-2017) report.On July 1, 2015, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY)or the Prime Ministers Farmers Irrigation Programmewith a budget of Rs. 50,000 crores over five years (2015-16 to 2019). The motto of the PMKSY is Har Khet Ko Pani (water to every field) and More crop per drop.In 2015-16, less than a third (Rs 312 crore) of Rs 1,000 crores set aside for micro-irrigation was released, reveals this government report. Of this, upto April 2016, no more than Rs 48.3 crore, or less than 5%, was actually spent, according this micro-irrigation financial progress monitoring report. The government set Rs 1,763 as the 2016-17 micro-irrigation target, but no data on results have been released.The micro-irrigation programme covers an area of 6,51,220 hectares, or 0.46% of net cultivated area.(Salve is an analyst with IndiaSpend.

""With the holy month of fasting falling in the summer heat, everyone prefers a vegetarian diet. But due to the disruption in supply of fruits and vegetables, sourcing preferred items for all has become a challenge,"" said Ghazala Khan, a homemaker.Satisfying everyone to serve their choicest meals begins early. The best suited spot in the city to purchase fruits and vegetables is Chowk Bazaar. Much before the commercial markets open, the humble thela-wallahs sell the best grade vegetables in the city, hollering out the prices of choice veggies. The carts that roll into the narrow lanes of the walled city have been silent and dry in the last couple of days.""Vegetable sellers ar few and far in between these days. Prices of lauki, palak, bhindi, turai and pattagobi and basic items like green chilli and coriander leaves have skyrocketed,"" said Sadia Aleem, a homemaker.

5a0439229855b76bf13bcf9d,Why a problem of plenty is hurting farmers,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/616449/why-problem-plenty-hurting-farmers.html,2017-06-09,"Soutik Biswas, International New York Times, Jun 10 2017, 0:07 ISTFarmers are on the boil again in India. In Maharashtra, they have been on strike for a week in some seven districts now, spilling milk on the streets, shutting down markets, protesting on the roads and attacking vegetable trucks. In neighbouring Madhya Pradesh, curfew has been imposed after five farmers were killed in clashes with the police on Tuesday. Last month, farmers in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh staged protests and burnt their red chilli crop.The farmers are demanding waivers on farm loans and higher prices for their crops. For decades now, farming in India has been blighted by drought, small plot sizes, a depleting water table, declining productivity and lack of modernisation.Half of its people work in farms, but farming contributes only 15% to the countrys GDP. Put simply, farms employ a lot of people but produce too little. Crop failures trigger farm suicides with alarming frequency. The present unrest is, however, rooted in a problem of plenty. In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the farmers are on the streets because a bumper harvest fuelled by a robust monsoon has led to a crop glut. Prices of onions, grapes, soya-bean, fenugreek and red chilli, for example, have nosedived.In most places, the governments have been less than swift in paying the farmer more for the crops  the government sets prices for farming and procures crops from farmers to incentivise production and ensure income support. So why has a bumper crop led to a crisis in farming? Some believe that the price crash is the result of Indias controversial withdrawal of high-value notes  popularly called demonetisation  late last year.The ban, surprisingly, did not hurt planting as farmers begged and borrowed from their kin and social networks to pay for fertilisers, pesticides and labour, Harish Damodaran, rural affairs and agriculture editor at The Indian Express newspaper told me.So more land was actually cropped, and bountiful rains led to a bumper crop. But traders, Damodaran believes, possibly did not have enough cash to pick up the surplus crop.Although the chronic cash shortage has passed, there is still a liquidity problem. I have been talking to traders who say theres not enough cash, which remains the main medium of credit in villages. I suspect the price crash has been caused by a lack of cash.A prominent trader in Lasangaon, Asias biggest onion market, in Maharashtra, a state which accounts for a third of Indias annual production, told me that concerns over shortage of cash leading to crop price crashes were exaggerated. There has been a good crop for sure, but a lot of traders have picked up crop, paying cash, issuing cheques and using net banking. Some of the glut and wastage has been due to the ongoing strike, when trucks of vegetables have been attacked on the highways, Manoj Kumar Jain said.Still others believe the main reason for the ongoing crisis is actually rooted in Indias chronic failure of coping with surplus harvests because of lack of adequate food storage and processing capacity. If the rains are good, you end up with a glut of crops and prices crash. The glut only highlights the inefficiencies of the farming value chain and hits farmers, said Ashok Gulati, an agriculturespecialist at the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations.Take onions, for example. The vegetable is 85% water and loses weight quickly.In Lasangaon, traders buy the crop from farmers and store the onions on concrete in tarpaulin-covered sheds. If the weather stays right, 3-5% of the stored crop is wasted in storage. But if the mercury soars, more onions dry up, lose weight and 25-30% of the stored crop could be wasted.In a modern cold storage, however, onions can be stored in wooden boxes at 4 degrees. Crop wastage is less than 5%. Storage costs about a rupee for every kg of onion a month.So the government needs to make sure  or even subsidise  to keep the vegetable affordable to consumers once it reaches the retail market. We need to make the supply storage chain so efficient that the customer, farmer and the storage owner are happy. Unfortunately India hasnt been able to make that happen, Gulati said. For one, India just doesnt have enough cold storages.There are some 7,000 of them, mostly stocking potatoes in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh. Resultantly, fruits and vegetables perish very quickly. Unless India hoards food effectively, a bumper crop can easily spell doom for farmers.Secondly, theres not enough processing of food happening to ensure that crops dont perish or go waste. Take onions, again. One way to dampen volatility in onion prices is to dehydrate the bulb and make these processed onions more widely available. Currently, less than 5% of Indias fruit and vegetables is processed.Regressive methodThirdly, farmers in India plant for new harvest looking back at crop prices in the previous year. If the crop prices were healthy, they sow more of the same, hoping for still better prices.If the rains are good, a crop glut can happen easily, and lead to extraordinary fall in prices. Farmers hold on to the crops for a while, and then begin distress sales.You need to allow future prices through contract farming, not cropping based on last years prices, says Gulati. Clearly, farming policies in India need a radical overhaul. Punjab, Indias granary, is a perfect example.At a time when India does not suffer food shortages, water-guzzling wheat and rice comprise 80% of its cropped area and deplete groundwater. Rising production of cereals has meant that government has been giving paltry rises to the farmers while buying paddy and wheat, eroding their profitability.They (the policies) are distorting the choices that farmers make  those who should be finding ways to grow vegetables, which grow more expensive every year, are instead growing wheat we no longer need, says Mihir Sharma, author of Restart: The Last Chance for the Indian Economy.But the best that the governments here do is to quickly raise crop buying prices and alleviate the farmers suffering.Faced with a crop glut at home, the newly appointed BJP government in Uttar Pradesh was smart enough to promptly raise the procurement price of potatoes  and announce a controversial farm loan waiver  and quell a simmering farmers revolt .The government in Madhya Pradesh, ruled by the same party, failed to act in time. Now it says it will pay more to buy off the surplus onions. The more things change, the more they remain the same."
5a05e6e49855b76bf13c1c20,Fault lines in the fields,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/fault-lines-in-the-fields/article18952749.ece,2017-06-10,"Abhishek Patidar, 19, had just passed his Class 11 exam this year with dreams of becoming a doctor. His family owns a piece of land  about 27 bighas  in Barkheda Path, a village 22 km north of Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh where they grow soybean, methi (fenugreek) and chana (gram). On June 6, Abhishek went to Mandsaur along with hundreds of others from his village to protest against the falling crop prices that were pushing his family to the brink of desperation. Tragically, he became one of the victims of police firing, taking three bullets on a day when farmer protests across the western belt stretching from Madhya Pradesh to Maharashtra reached a frenzied pitch. He was too young but was keen to join the protest. We grow everything in our 27-bigha land but in the last three years, prices have plunged and ruined us, says Abhisheks father, Dinesh Patidar, 55, tears rolling down his eyes.Price pinch in MalwaBarkheda Path is typical of the villages in this region. With an approximate population of 3,500, 95% of the population is engaged in farming in landholdings that are less than a hectare per family. Abhisheks family members narrate their tale of loss. The last three years have crushed our backbone because prices have plunged, forcing us to sell our produce at rates where we dont even recover our investment, says Dinesh, adding, todays market price for soybean is Rs. 2,500-2,700 per quintal while our cost to produce one quintal is above Rs. 3,000. Not only soybean, prices of onion, gram, methi , vegetables, milk have bottomed while input costs have soared for seeds, fertilizers, labour and transport, he says.Madhya Pradesh consistently boasts of double-digit growth in agriculture  averaging 13.9% during 2010-15  and like many other States, had a bumper harvest following a good monsoon in 2016. Yet as per the National Crime Records Bureau statistics, as many as 1,982 farmers committed suicide in the State in 2016-17. A combination of factors  falling procurement prices because of a glut of produce in the market, a cash crunch due to last years demonetisation policy and the predominance of smaller landholdings which are expensive to maintain  have led to a simmering anger. Like their counterparts in many parts of Maharashtra, farmers in Mandsaur launched an agitation demanding remunerative prices for their onion, soybean and pulses. As thousands of farmers poured onto the streets, stopping traffic, attacking trucks and confronting police, things turned violent and five farmers were killed as a result of police firing and a curfew was imposed across five districts.Farmers from the Mandsaur-Neemuch stretch in the Malwa region, aside from growing soybean and chana, also grow a range of spices and medicinal plants like methi , dhaniya (coriander), jeera (cumin) and ajwain (carom seeds). Yet, farmers in the region claim that prices for these cash crops have been falling for the past few years. We never sold methi below Rs. 4,000 per quintal during the Manmohan Singhs government. But ever since Modi became PM, methi prices have collapsed, says Dinesh, showing methi gunny bags stored in his house.In addition to low prices, what has aggravated the situation is the Central governments demonetisation move late last year that has adversely hit the rural and agrarian economy.  Notebandi has almost finished us in the rural areas. Even after selling our produce, we dont get money in our hands before at least two-three weeks and sometimes even a month, says Lalchand Mali, a farmer from Barkheda Panth.Interestingly, not many farmers in the region are seeking loan waiver as is being claimed in the media. Most of them want better and remunerative prices that cover their costs and provide them income for survival. Believe me, no true farmer would want loan waiver. If the government provides better prices, we will repay our debt. The problem is the government never provides better prices, adds Lalchand, who owns a two-hectare plot in the village.The Maharashtra stirIn the town of Niphad in Maharashtras Nashik district, the main vegetable market, located in a large yard opposite the tehsil office, lies deserted. In a series of godowns that lie adjacent to the yard there is a pink gleam as sunlight filters through to large sacks of onions that are waiting to be transported. In Vittal Sanaps godown, which is nearly packed to capacity with produce, a large truck with a tarpaulin cover has been parked inside for three days even as workers go about their usual task of loading onions into bright red sacks.We had an order for onions to go to Madras (Chennai) a few days back but the truck was accosted on the road before it could get to Nashik and all the onions were dumped on the road, says Sanap. Onions that are left at the mercy of the elements lose their value almost immediately, so for now Sanap is just waiting for things to tide over. The hartal (strike) will have to end soon because there are many farmers who have no choice but to sell their goods even if prices are bad.Onions and other vegetables from godowns like Sanaps go to the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Nashik from where they are taken to other cities in Maharashtra like Mumbai and Pune as well as to other States in the south like Tamil Nadu and Karnataka, and even Sri Lanka. The APMC market in Nashik is appropriately mammoth  on either side of a dusty road are two large open halls, each the size of a large bus terminus with tall pillars running right through. On June 8, a day after the one-week strike called by farmers in the region officially ended, a small group of women have set up shop to sell vegetables like cabbage, chillies, tomatoes and cucumber. They take up barely a quarter of one hall but as produce is brought in by farmers in smaller trucks, there are murmurs of anger outside with some arguments breaking out as the produce is passed inside. These women are not from Maharashtra, you can tell from their earrings that they are from Rajasthan. These are just small local farmers who want to break the strike, says one of the men. Still, even these small traces of activity raise the suspicion that divisions are beginning to form in what was till now a unified movement in the district.United in adversityAs the major commercial supplier in this region, Nashik may have become the epicentre of the farmers movement but it all started in a village called Puntamba in Ahmednagar district three months ago on April 3, when the villages gram panchayat passed a resolution warning of a Shetkari Sampa (Strike of the Ryots) from June 1. Their charter of demands addressed to Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis included ensuring crop procurement prices at least 50% above production costs, a complete waiver of farm loans, 100% subsidy on drip/sprinkler irrigation systems, and a minimum milk purchase price of Rs. 50.Farmers across the region may find a specific resonance in one or the other of these demands but what seems to have really helped the movement spread from Puntamba across the Nashik-Ahmednagar-Pune stretch of Maharashtra is the language in which the idea of the strike was communicated. Farmers face many hardships but this was the first time Ive seen farmers actually willing to go on strike to and risk everything to see that they are given some recognition, says Abhijit Dige, who owns an eight-acre farm about 60 km from Nashik. Politicians dont know what farmers go through, its not like other businesses. Devendra Fadnavis should come and work in the field for 14 hours a day, work at night in the cold to tend to onion crops, and then maybe hell understand, he says.That same sentiment is echoed by Deepak Rane who has a one-acre farm just off Niphad where he grows cauliflower. The strike should not stop because people dont realise what we go through. I am not able to recover the cost that I bear to treat my crops with chemicals and fertilizers. I work from 6 in the morning; what is it all for? he says.People from all walks of life face hardships but have you ever considered why it is only farmer suicides you have heard of? asks Dinesh Nikam, another trader in Nashik who has refused to take orders for onions and other vegetables because he says he stands in solidarity with the farmers.The illusion of prosperityWhen farm distress was first reported in Maharashtra, it focussed mainly on the prices of tur and arhar dal and the difficulties faced by farmers in the drought-prone Marathwada and Amaravati regions. After two years of consecutive drought, a good monsoon in 2016 brought in a bountiful harvest and the markets were simply swamped with produce. Record harvests were offset by a steep fall in procurement prices for both crops.The plight of those farmers is often referenced by prominent leaders of the movement in Nashik and Ahmednagar though it has to be noted that this region is substantially different. The stretch from Ahmednagar to Nashik, and down to Kolhapur and Sangli where the movement spread is a fairly contiguous belt that is home to relatively more prosperous farmers. The majority of farmers in the region over the past two decades have moved from cultivation of crops like bajra (pearl millet) and jowar (sorghum) to cash crops like grapes and onions. Many have invested in dairy farming (Puntamba, for instance, is home to many dairy farmers).Vegetables, then, are actually only a small part of the produce from this region and while the enduring visual images of the strike may be of vegetables like cauliflower and cabbage being dumped on the road, there are many places where people show us pictures shot on cell phones of roads lined with pomegranates, which is the most recent entry to the crop market here.In Italy, for instance, a village about 10 km from Niphad that was the one of the centres of the agitation, Swarupananda Bhorgade says that about 80% of the village of 5,000-odd farmers is involved in grape farming, sometimes done in rotation with onions. I have been growing grapes for the last 20 years and till about seven or eight years ago I used to sell it for about Rs. 50 a kilo, says Bhorgade. So it was only natural that I planted grapes on every inch of my 15 acres. Now it costs me about Rs. 15 to harvest a kilo of grapes and all I can get on the market is Rs. 9 to Rs. 18 a kilo, he says.Bhorgade attributes this to a number of factors, the most important of which is climate  storms would come unseasonably and the crops would be destroyed. Or there would be hailstorms. This past year, the weather was regular and the crop was good for once but there is no price. You have to take into account how much we have spent on growing these crops and how we will recover it. It costs a lot to invest in crops like grapes and pomegranates, he says, adding that farmers from the region initially tried to rope in their counterparts from Amaravati who grew tur dal but their situation was completely different. They have larger landholdings and their crop is rain-fed. They dont have to spend on irrigation and other chemicals and fertilizer like we do.On June 3, a faction of farmer leaders decided to call off the strike after Mr. Fadnavis announced a partial loan waiver for small and marginal farmers that would come into effect on October 31. In a large meeting on June 8 in Nashik that included about 3,000 farmers and 150 representatives of farmer associations from across the State, that compromise was rejected. The people who met the Chief Minister did so late at night without anybody knowing and the agreement was not along the lines of what we were originally demanding, said Raju Shetti, president of Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana that has taken a major role in advancing the agenda. If the government did not accede to the demand to waive all loans immediately and bump up procurement prices, the meeting decided that the strike would move to a new phase of hartals across district and collectors offices from June 12 and rail rokos  in some areas. As of June 8, the meeting concluded that farmers should be allowed to take their produce to the market in order to meet their minimum needs. Look for Puntamba on that day (June 12), says one of the farmers who attended the meeting. The first rail roko will be there, where it all started."

He announced his decision at a press conference on Friday evening.Chouhan was flanked by his ministerial colleagues and BJP leaders. Many party workers too gathered to listen to the chief minister on the occasion. A number of farmers were brought by the party for interacting with the chief minister. Government officials were also present on the occasion.Leader of Opposition in the state assembly Ajay Singh termed the fast as a Kejriwal drama, which, he alleged, would involve an expenditure of crores of rupees.He was referring to Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal who had gone on an indefinite fast, promising 24-hour power at half the existing rate and up to 20 kilolitres of free water for all when his party comes to power in the national capital.Congress workers in Indore sat on a dharna and prayed for wisdom for the chief minister.Without taking the name of the Congress, Chouhan said he was pained when he heard words like Thaane me aag laga do (Set the police station on fire) or Patthar maro (Pelt stones).The Mandsaur incident is the most unfortunate. I was deeply pained. I will get this inquired into as to who were behind the violence and what was their motive. Those who spread violence during the agitation will not be spared, he warned.Chouhan said it was unfortunate that children are being given stones in their hands. This is painful. Where do they want to the push the state? Where will the state go with such attitude of people? he asked.He said that during the violence, more than 100 police personnel sustained injuries. Of them, six were seriously injured. As many as 197 buses and 127 government vehicles were damaged.Chouhan said that since he assumed his office 11 and a half years back, his first and foremost priority has been welfare of farmers.The irrigation area has been increased from 7.5 lakh hectares in 2003 to 40 lakh hectares now, he said.The rate of interest on loan to farmers has been reduced from 18% to zero percent. Further, it was minus 10% because if a farmer took a loan of Rs 1 lakh, he was supposed to return Rs 90,000 only.Chouhan said if facilities to farmers had grown manifold, the bumper crop led to sharp fall in prices. That was why a Rs 1,000-crore price stabilisation fund was created to allow farmers to get adequate return on their produce.Thousands of tonners of onion has been purchased at Rs 8 per kg by the government. From June 10, tur daal would be purchased at Rs 5,500 per quintal whereas the market rate was Rs 3,400-3,500 per quintal. Similarly, moong and urad would be purchased at Rs 5,225 per quintal across the state, he said."

I know your (farmers) problems,"" he said addressing a gathering, including cultivators, here.""The state government stands firm with the farmers. We are going to buy the farm produce and give profitable prices for it,"" he assured.The farmers are, among other things, demanding satisfactory prices for their farm produce. Their stir turned violent when five persons died in police firing, while six others were injured on Tuesday in Mandsaur district.""We have already bought huge quantity of onions at Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 8 per kg. Each onion of farmers will be bought.""Your labour won't go waste,"" he promised.""We are going to buy different varieties of pulses at MSP,"" the chief minister said.Chouhan said his government was pro-farmer and recalled efforts underway to make farming a profitable business in MP.He said the irrigation facility has increased manifold and due to abundant water, farmers were reaping rich harvest.The BJP leader also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for trying hard to make agriculture a profitable venture.Chouhan said the government had extended Rs 4,800 crore as relief amount to farmers when their soyabean crop was destroyed last year. Similarly, Rs 4,400 crore went as crop insurance compensation sum last year.Earlier, the chief minister, clad in a kurta-pyjama and a Nehru jacket, with wife Sadhana on his side, commenced his indefinite fast around 11 AM at a 'pandal' erected in the BHEL Dusshera Maidan after former chief minister Kailash Joshi put a 'tilak' on his forehead.As the CM entered the venue, his supporters shouted ""Kisan ka Samman hai, Shivraj Singh Chouhan hai, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Bharat Mata ki Jai"".The Opposition Congress dubbed Chouhan's fast as a ""nautanki"" (drama or empty theatrics).""Chouhan should tell people whether his so called fast was a 'nautanki' or an act of repentance for his misdeeds that set the state on fire,"" state Congress chief spokesman K K Mishra told PTI today.""Though he is trying to send a message that he is doing 'Gandhigiri' (Gandhian way of protest), it is not so. He neither sat beneath the statue of 'Bapu' nor garlanded Mahatma's statue before launching his 'nautanki'.""After all, against whom has he started his fast at Dussehra Maidan? He should remember that (demon king) Ravana is burnt every year at the Dussehra Maidan. His Nautankibaji won't work as he has done such drama in the past against the UPA-2 government,"" he said.Under fire over the farmers' unrest spiralling out of control, the chief minister had last evening announced to go on a fast for ""restoration for peace"" in the state.He had also said that the agitation had turned ""anarchic"", and appealed to farmers to come to Dussehra Maidan and have a dialogue with him.""I won't sit in my office at Mantralaya (Secretariat)... (but sit at) Dussehra Maidan and do all work from there,"" he had said, adding that those instigating the violence would not be spared."

But what has come as a reprieve was that the prices of essential veggies such as onion and tomato, had stayed below Rs 30 per kg.Summers usually see rise in vegetable prices due to water shortage and decreased arrivals of produce. Traders say that almost all supplies to Chennai are coming from other States and hence the transport cost adds to the vegetable prices. They say the prices have been on the rise for last one week.In the wholesale market at Koyambedu, onion, which was sold at Rs 12 per kg, is now sold at Rs 17. Tomato and potato, which were sold at 15 per kg, are now sold at Rs 25 and beans sold at Rs 60.Sales are dull. When the cost is high, people tend to buy less; they buy something like half kg instead of 1 or 2 kg. But, only when we increase the prices we get decent profit, says Badriswamy, vegetable vendor, Koyambedu.Traders say most of the vegetables and fruits are transported from neighbouring States such as Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. In such cases, the cost of production and transportation falls on the vendors and traders and as a result, price rise happens and burdens the buyers.This is the case every year. Vegetables and fruits are very essential. Demand will always exist, but sometimes it is not met with sufficient supply. Hence the price rise to which Ive clearly reconciled myself, says Rathna.In Aminjikarai market, prices are at peak. Brinjal is sold at Rs 80 per kg and tomato at Rs 30. A sack of onion, earlier sold at Rs 400, is now sold at Rs 800 and 1 kg onion is sold at 20 kg. Carrots and beans are sold at Rs 70 and Rs 80 per kg, respectively.I buy minimum of all vegetables as the prices are high. My budget for vegetables for a week is Rs 100, says Allabakash."

Krishnamurthy on Friday warned of stern action against spurious seed sellers in the State and advised farmers to be wary of such products.He broke a coconut, performed pooja and applied vermillion on two bullocks and ploughed the agricultural field of a farmer, Mekala Venkateswarlu at Panchalingala village in Kurnool mandal, formally launching the Eruvaka Punnami programme. Mr. Krishnamurthy later interacted with farmers at the Montessori School conference hall in the village. Giving tips to farmers on the crops to be cultivated, seeds and fertilisers and precautions to be taken, he said Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was striving to transform the State into Navyandhra Pradesh. The government was taking concrete steps to curb middlemen who were jeopardising the interests of farmers, he said.Land recordsThe Revenue Department launched Mee Intiki Mee Bhoomi programme enabling one crore farmers to verify their land details online. Farmers would be supplied tractors on subsidy under Rythu Ratham programme, the Deputy Chief Minister said. Foolproof surveys were being done to ensure that others did not encroach upon the lands of farmers, he said.Rajya Sabha member T.G. Venkatesh said Panchalingala, Devamada, Gondiparla, Thandrapadu and Poolathota villages were made fertile on the lines of coastal Andhra through lift irrigation schemes. An indoor stadium with an outlay of Rs. 70 lakh, a farmer training centre furnished like a three-star hotel and midlife railway coach factory were coming up, he said.Kurnool MLA S.V. Mohan Reddy exhorted farmers to take up poultry farming and rearing of cattle to increase their sources of revenue. The government provided succour to farmers by purchasing chilli from them at Rs. 1,500 per quintal, the MLA said. Kodumur MLA Mani Gandhi wanted market intervention scheme to assist farmers who were hard-pressed with no takers for their produce.Raise milletsCollector S. Satyanarayana advised farmers to reduce the crop sowing area and raise millets, cut down the investment cost with traditional agricultural practices and earn increased income.A.P. Irrigation Development Corporation chairman K.E. Prabhakar said the government procured onion crop by spending Rs. 500 crore in Kurnool district. Joint Director of Agriculture Uma Maheswaramma said soil testing was done in Panchalingala and farmers were being advised on the crops to be sown.Mr. Krishnamurthy, Mr. Venkatesh, MLAs and the Collector watched the stalls put up by the agriculture and allied departments.

Some have already started sowing activities in anticipation of a good spell of rain in the coming days.The Agriculture Department has set a target of 3,58,340 hectares for sowing in the district. The department has ample stock of seeds and fertilizers for distribution to farmers, depending on their requirement, through Raitha Samparka Kendras, officials said.Since groundnut is a major commercial crop in Challakere, Hiriyur and Molkalmuru taluks of the district, the target for sowing groundnut in these taluks is 1,42,620 hectares. The jowar target is 88,000 hectares, while for maize it is 23,900 hectares.Sowing onionSo far, the farmers have not shown keenness in sowing onion, a major commercial crop in the district, as they incurred heavy losses in the past two years owing to drought and sudden collapse in prices, a source said. Farmers in the district used to complete sowing of onion on 2,000 hectares by the second week of June, but this time sowing has not been completed even on 20 ha. Once the district starts receiving good rain, the farmers may begin sowing onion.Officials in the Agriculture Department have advised farmers to take suggestions from Raitha Samparka Kendras before purchasing seeds and fertilizers, so they dont incur losses by purchasing outdated fertilizers and duplicate seeds. Such incidents have been reported in some other districts of the State, sources said.So far, the farmers have not shown keenness in sowing onion... as they incurred heavy losses in the past two yearsAgriculture Department Source"
5a05ded99855b76bf13c17f3,Gaggan Anand’s retirement plan,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/gaggan-anands-retirement-plan/article18954001.ece,2017-06-10,"Gaggan Anand says what he thinks and does what he wants. When he won his 50 Best Restaurants award this year, he promptly announced his intention to close his eponymous restaurant in 2020. It made the headlines and went viral. Why would the Indian chef, whose Bangkok restaurant topped Asias 50 Best list for three consecutive years and is now at No 7 on the Worlds 50 Best ranking, not want to set up a global Gaggan empire? Especially, when many celebrity chefs are cashing in on their bestsellers. Because I dont want to just become a brand. I have 67 employees to motivate, I make it a point to talk to everyone who comes to dine, and still am criticised that I am not at my restaurant every day, admits AnandThere is also his love for all things Japanese and his decision to open a new restaurant with friend and collaborator, Chef Takeshi Fukuyama. At 39, his move to dodge burnout could also be influenced by mentor Ferran Adria of El Bulli; the ground-breaking Spanish chef closed shop when his Michelin three-star restaurant in Catalonia was still enormously successful. Anand, who interned with him in 2010, has often named Adria (besides his own mother) as his inspiration.1080 days to rememberWith 36 months to go before he shuts his progressive Indian restaurant  about four menus a year, and 25 courses in each menu  he exhorts his team on WhatsApp to create 300 memorable dishes. The former drummer runs a tight ship of chefs from 18 countries, including Serbia, Spain and India. In their glass-walled kitchen that overlooks a private dining room, they work with the synchronised precision of musicians, but with enough back-slapping. It is back-breaking work: the tiny eggplant cookie which is Gaggans take on baingan ka bharta served as the fourth course, sees the vegetable mashed and charred in the tandoor , before being freeze-dried and compressed into cookies, then sandwiched with onion chutney. Coriander Nest and Green Apple involves several hours of shaving both coriander root and apple. Each course is a work of art.Alternative realityWhen I visit, the wait staff announces each course with a flourish  one has mustard wrapped sea bass cooked in cedar wood and charred on the table (Anands take on the Bengali fish paturi ); another is a spicy Chettinad quail served in a cage. It is a heady journey, where culinary and performance art unite, and where the menu (only emoji-filled, the key to what you have eaten comes after you have dined) throws up surprises like goat brain in a waffle or scallop curry cooked and broken down to a cold form. There is beetroot meringue with gooseberry and blue cheese and also mushroom that sits pretty like a bonsai and mango wasabi ice cream with sea urchin. The German couple seated at the next table is full of praise, and I have to agree with them, Anands wizardry with molecular gastronomy, authentic Indian flavours and the Japanese pursuit of perfection makes him deserving of his many awards. The first Michelin guide in Bangkok is due in December, and not surprisingly, he will earn a spot there too.Reinvention is keyAnand is dismissive of the adulation. What you are eating will be stale in five days, when I launch my new menu, he pronounces. Just back from a working holiday in Switzerland and Rome, he is in his trademark black jacket, with its strip of blue. He is bleary-eyed behind his Gentle Monster frames, but has his hair in a Samurai topknot and is ready to brainstorm with his team. The stories about 500 booking requests a day and the three-month waiting list at Gaggan are true, he confirms, which is why he now has a five-person team to handle reservations. Yet, social media is also abuzz over his new projects: Gaa, Raa, Sol, GohGan and a second branch of Meatlicious.Made in BangkokThe last, a steakhouse in partnership with his wife, is a runaway hit. On his Instagram account, there is a bubbling pan of yellow: fish curry at Meatlicious, sold out days in advance, with 12,000 likes and counting. Suhring, another investment, and headed by German twins, Thomas and Mathiass Suhring, has also won its share of awards. The only dark cloud, it appears, is Gaa, a brand new project helmed by his former sous chef, Garima Arora. Initially supposed to be a curry house, Anand says it is now Thai, confusion and neo-Nordic. Clearly, things have soured between the two, and he adds, Every dish at Gaa was a Noma copy. I told them that and it was not taken well. I put my money and name on new talent, but then they think they are rebels.Rockstar chefs from his team will be heading projects such as Wet, a Japanese gastropub, and Sol, a dessert address. With his Serbian sommelier Vladimir Kojic calling the shots, Wet will have at least 30,000 bottles of wine and fried chicken. Yakitori, or Japanese-style grilled skewered chicken, to be specific. A collaboration with Mihara tofu ten, from Fukuoka, will see a Japanese fine-dining restaurant, where tofu is the subject.

(Source: ANI_News/Twitter) Shivraj Chouhan said his government was pro-farmer and recalled efforts underway to make farming a profitable business in MP. (Source: ANI_News/Twitter)As the violent agrarian unrest entered its tenth day in Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Saturday began his indefinite fast at the Dusshera Maidan in Bhopal for the restoration of peace and promised profitable prices to farmers for their produce.I know of the bumper crop production that has sent the prices crashing down in the state. I know your (farmers) problems, he said addressing a gathering, including cultivators, here. The state government stands firm with the farmers. We are going to buy the farm produce and give profitable prices for it, he assured.The farmers are, among other things, demanding satisfactory prices for their farm produce. Their stir turned violent when five persons died in police firing, while six others were injured on Tuesday in Mandsaur district. We have already bought huge quantity of onions at Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 8 per kg. Each onion of farmers will be bought.Your labour wont go waste, he promised. We are going to buy different varieties of pulses at MSP, the chief minister said. Chouhan said his government was pro-farmer and recalled efforts underway to make farming a profitable business in MP. He said the irrigation facility has increased manifold and due to abundant water, farmers were reaping rich harvest. The BJP leader also hailed Prime Minister Narendra Modi for trying hard to make agriculture a profitable venture.Chouhan said the government had extended Rs 4,800 crore as relief amount to farmers when their soyabean crop was destroyed last year. Similarly, Rs 4,400 crore went as crop insurance compensation sum last year.Earlier, the chief minister, clad in a kurta-pyjama and a Nehru jacket, with wife Sadhana on his side, commenced his indefinite fast around 11 AM at a pandal erected in the BHEL Dusshera Maidan after former chief minister Kailash Joshi put a tilak on his forehead.As the CM entered the venue, his supporters shouted Kisan ka Samman hai, Shivraj Singh Chouhan hai, Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan, Bharat Mata ki Jai. The Opposition Congress dubbed Chouhans fast as a nautanki (drama or empty theatrics). Chouhan should tell people whether his so called fast was a nautanki or an act of repentance for his misdeeds that set the state on fire, state Congress chief spokesman K K Mishra told PTI today.Though he is trying to send a message that he is doing Gandhigiri (Gandhian way of protest), it is not so. He neither sat beneath the statue of Bapu nor garlanded Mahatmas statue before launching his nautanki.After all, against whom has he started his fast at Dussehra Maidan? He should remember that (demon king) Ravana is burnt every year at the Dussehra Maidan. His Nautankibaji wont work as he has done such drama in the past against the UPA-2 government, he said.Under fire over the farmers unrest spiralling out of control, the chief minister had last evening announced to go on a fast for restoration for peace in the state. He had also said that the agitation had turned anarchic, and appealed to farmers to come to Dussehra Maidan and have a dialogue with him.I wont sit in my office at Mantralaya (Secretariat) (but sit at) Dussehra Maidan and do all work from there, he had said, adding that those instigating the violence would not be spared.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

(Representational Image) The Pune Market Yard has seen vastly improved supplies, which have brought down the prices significantly. (Representational Image)Prices of vegetables in both wholesale and retail markets in urban areas such as Pune and Mumbai have seen large scale correction, bringing much-needed relief to consumers. Prices of almost all other fresh vegetables, barring garlic, have come down by almost 30-40 per cent, as the markets reported increased arrival.Earlier, the week-long farmers strike had crippled the supply of vegetables across major wholesale markets in the state. Farmers had refused to trade their produce at the markets and had also taken to the streets to stop the supply of such commodities to urban centres. The price of fresh commodities, including vegetables and milk, had gone up by a whopping 40-50 per cent between June 1-8 across the state. While the supply had improved towards the last few days of the strike, most of the supply of fresh produce was from outside the state.The Pune Market Yard has seen vastly improved supplies, which have brought down the prices significantly. As against the traded price of Rs 4,000 per quintal of June 2, tomatoes traded at Rs 600 per quintal on June 9. Similarly, for okra, prices have dropped from Rs 6,000 per quintal to Rs 3,000 per quintal. Onion prices have also seen a slight dip, from Rs 1000 to Rs 850 per quintal. Supplies have improved in Vashis wholesale market, with more than 600 trucks of vegetables arriving in the market on Saturday.Suresh Pingle, president of the Vegetables Traders Union of the market, said prices of almost all vegetables ranged between Rs 10-20 per kg. The drop in prices at the wholesale markets have resulted in a similar trend in retail markets. Vishnu Salve, president of the Pimpri retail market, said prices of most commodities had dipped by 50 per cent. However, garlic prices remained high, as supplies were hampered due to the ongoing crisis in Madhya Pradesh.  Until supplies resume from Madhya Pradesh, the trend will remain the same, he said.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"

While the rigorous training at culinary school lays the basic foundation for our profession, it is our expeditions through the country and across continents that leads our discovery of new cultures, foods, ingredients, techniques and much more. My travels have been no different!Sojourns across South-east Asia have left an indelible impression, influencing both, my style of cooking and menu planning. Interestingly, South-east Asian cuisine comes with a whole lot of unsuals. Consider the concept of serving in bowls, whereby the bowl serves as a complete meal in itself!By virtue of expediency and exquisiteness, the Vietnamese Pho, Burmese Khowsuey and Singaporean Laksa, all bowl meals, have reached tables of leading restaurants across the globe.Another lasting gastronomic influence in my life came from my five year stint in the beautiful Maldivian islands, where I picked up the art of contrasting flavours, textures and temperatures. I had the pleasure of tasting a local specialty - a yellow fish curry served with rice and crisp drumstick leaves. The taste and texture of the meal linger on, and have, in fact, become the basis for a whole lot of innovations.One such dish on our menu, which, in the true sense is a culmination of these learnings, is the Hu-Tieu-Sai-Gon!Hu tieu (spiced noodle soup) is a traditional Vietnamese dish specific to southern Vietnam. This bowl meal is a perfect balance of spiciness from chilies, sweetness from jaggery, sourness from tamarind and the crunch from fried peanuts! To prepare Hu-Tieu- Sai-Gon, make a stock of fresh veggies along with spices such as garlic, star anise, ginger, cinnamon and chopped lemongrass and bring to a boil. Strain the broth and put back on the boil. Add a homogenous mix of coconut milk, peanut butter, mushroom oyster sauce, light soy to the broth.For the toppings, use blanched vegetables and cooked rice vermicelli in boiling water for not more than a minute. To assemble, add boiled rice vermicelli in a soup bowl. Top it up with the blanched vegetables, crispy onion and garlic slices. Pour the boiling broth over this and serve alongside shredded lettuce, sliced tomatoes, sprouts, basil leaves, chilli and lime wedges.Like all my journeys, thus far, I wish to continue the exploration of the myriad nooks in this world that lead me to less travelled culinary havens and ultimately to the discovery of life itself.

593ced337be9e00e964d4303,"Farmers protest: In mobilisation, farmer allies turned on govts",http://indianexpress.com/article/india/farmers-protest-in-mobilisation-farmer-allies-turned-on-govts-4698057/,2017-06-10,"A scene from farmers protest in Madhya Pradesh A scene from farmers protest in Madhya PradeshONE gloomy afternoon this March, a disillusioned Dhanu Dhorde Patil, 43, sat watching his television in Dongaon village, about 2 km from Puntamba in Ahmednagar district, the heart of the recent farmers agitation in Maharashtra. On screen were reports of doctors striking work across the state in protest against the growing violence against them. Patil, upset by the dip in onion prices, threw an idea at his friends that evening, one that would take Maharashtra by storm. Why cant we strike work like the doctors have? By then, Dr Sanjay Dhanvate, managing director of Puntambas Asha Kiran Paraplegic Center, was already thinking along the same lines. The states farmers had tried everything from fasts to railway blockades  with little success. A strike would be the ultimate weapon  farmers would not grow or trade in agri commodities, he says.On April 3, the Puntamba Gram Sabha unanimously passed an eight-point charter of demands threatening a strike from June 1 if they were not met. A single village on strike would hardly be news, so over the next few days we asked almost 200 villages to pass similar resolutions, says Dhorde Patil, who was once associated with Anna Hazares India Against Corruption movement. With Nashik and Ahmednagar villages leading the way, over 2,000 gram panchayats passed resolutions of a Shetkari Sampa or farmers strike on May 1, Maharashtra Day. Incidentally, it was local BJP leader Dhananjay Jadhav who took the lead in Puntamba. A meeting was held in Pune on May 11 to form a core committee to spearhead the movement. Some villagers had reservations about the speed at which things were moving, but we followed Jadhavs lead anyway, says Suhas Wadane, a villager.At the Pune meeting, additional power centres emerged. There was the Karad-based event manager Sandeep Gidde, Kamal Sawant of the Bhumata Sanghatana and Shantaram Kunjir of the Maratha Seva Sangh. This core committee then began to travel across the state to spread the word of the plans for June 1, Dhanvate says. Simultaneously, Raju Shetti of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana party, an ally of the ruling BJP, had begun to openly express his unhappiness with the Maharashtra governments intransigence on a farm loan waiver. By mid-May, even as Dhanvate and 20 villagers prepared to meet Fadnavis, Shetti was planning a padyatra from Pune to Mumbai. At their meeting with the CM, Dhanvate and team were willing to reverse the strike call. But new leaders had emerged and several organisations decided to continue, admits Dhanvate.Days later, Shettis padyatra began, more or less independent of the other organisations. But the thousands of farmers who attended Shettis rallies along his route didnt really see the two struggles as separate. The demands were the same. Shettis yatra, which he labelled as his Atmaklesh Yatra  a self-professed repentance for supporting the BJP  should have set off alarm bells, but senior government sources say the administration failed to recognise its seriousness as for one, Shettis own party colleague, Maharashtra minister of state for agriculture Sadashiv Khot, had conspicuously stayed away.Once the strike kicked in and the urban centres began to feel the pinch, with supplies squeezed, the core committee was called for a marathon discussion with Fadnavis in Mumbai on June 2. The committee and the CM announced the withdrawal of the strike before dawn on June 3, with the government agreeing to the Rs 30,000 crore loan waiver. But by then the movement had acquired a life of its own. Those in Nashik and elsewhere too refused to call off the strike  the assurances were not in line with their demands.The core committee became the target of farmers ire. Giddes proximity to Khot, and the fact that top negotiator Jayajirao Suryavanshi had stayed back at Khots bungalow, incensed farmers who saw it as a betrayal. In Puntamba, where it all began, Jadhavs ties with the BJP led villagers to declare that the government was trying to sabotage the movement. While Suryavanshi eventually had to apologise, Jadhav is still to return to Puntamba even though the strike was called off on June 8.There was also a new core committee, with major political players in lead roles. Apart from Shetti, independent MLA Bacchu Kadu, president of the Kisan Sabha, Ajit Newale, veteran Shetkari Sanghatana leader Ragunath Patil and others were now picked to head the movement. It was this committees first meeting on Thursday that ended the strike, but with the new ultimatum that the state should hold talks by Monday, June 12. A strikingly similar chain of events unfolded in Madhya Pradesh. When Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan called the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) for talks four days after the farmers stir began on June 1, he was confident. The BKS, the largest farmers organisation in the state, is allied to the RSS and has in the past helped the Shivraj regime. In 2012, when angry farmers engaged in arson and beat up government and police officials in Bareli in Raisen district, the RSS simply sacked then BKS chief Shivkumar Sharma. The government slapped a slew of cases against Sharma while the RSS installed new leaders.This time, seated next to the CM at the Ujjain Circuit House on June 5, BKS general secretary Shivkant Dixit announced that the strike had been called off, and that the state government had agreed to buy onions at Rs 8 a kg. But the gamble backfired. Farmers felt betrayed  the BKS wasnt originally in the picture and appeared to have jumped on to the bandwagon only to derail the strike. As farmers bodies continued their protests, the government detained two office-bearers of the Bharatiya Kisan Union, a little-known organisation that claimed to have started the protests. Officials believed the situation had been tackled effectively. But here too, the agitation had acquired a life of its own. When the five farmers were killed in Mandsaur on Tuesday, June 6, Chouhan, despite his pro-farmer image, studiously avoided the historical town in the Malwa region even three days after the incident.The situation was bad due to low prices, and got worse after demonetisation, concedes BJP MLA from Mandsaur Yashpal Singh Sisodiya. He says the violence was a fallout of a combination of factors  falling prices, demonetisation, difficulty in getting loans form cooperatives, anger against local policemen, involvement of anti-social elements and even liquor mafia and infiltration of the movement by criminals. According to Sisodiya, the police took on the liquor mafia after a local journalist was shot dead near Pipliya Mandi last month. Police had rounded up nearly 50 people, angering them, the MLA says.Mandsaurs Lok Sabha MP, Sudhir Gupta of the BJP, terms the violence as a conspiracy hatched by the Congress. While admitting there are issues with bank transactions and poor prices for produce, the escalation of violence, he says, was politically motivated. Some BJP leaders say the government failed to anticipate the scale of the protest, as was the case, they say, when Hardik Patels Patidar movement hit Gujarat. Hardik, however, has limited support in MP, where his community already enjoys OBC status.He is desperate to come to Mandsaur but I have persuaded him against doing so. Im not sure if his presence will help or aggravate the situation, claims the state chief of the Patidar Samaj, Mahendra Patidar, who was among the very few people allowed access to one or two families of the victims of Tuesdays firing. Meanwhile, in both states, the farmers demands include a total farm loan waiver and adherence to the MSP regime. Neither government has so far come out with final announcements.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Since 2014, prices of soybean, methi, onion and pulses have plummeted by hardly any intervention by the government, said 55-year-old Kachrulal Chadavat, a farmer from Barkheda Panth village, 20 km north of Mandsaur.Having voted overwhelmingly for the BJP in the parliamentary elections in 2014, the farmers of these districts have become bitter and vocal critics of the Centre, accusing it of adopting anti-farmers policies.According to Mr. Chadavat, farming alone can no longer sustain a family."

""Notices have been given to 3,000 farmers and we have full hope that will get the due payments,"" general manager R B Thakur, told TOI, adding that the bank's demand was around Rs 300 crore and some of it has been recovered from their accounts through money deposited for crop insurance and proceeds from wheat procurement.Thakur said that there are around 1.61 kisan credit card (KCC) holders in the region and the total 'chronic default' is around Rs 80 crore. ""Of the other defaults, we recovered Rs 77 crore from crop insurance and Rs 88.5 crore from wheat procurement,"" said the officer.Bhartiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) has raised strong objection to the loan recovery proceedings. ""This is not the way to recover loan. Farmers are the sufferers. We will protest strongly,"" said Shiv Mohan Singh, BKS spokesperson, urging the government to chalk out a strategy for easy repayment of loans rather than ""threatening that their farmland would be attached"". Adding to their woes, the electricity department has snapped the power connections of more than 1,000 farmers in the same region due to non-payment of dues.National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) has recorded 11,000 farmer suicides in MP since 2008, many of them in Hoshangabad district. One of the recent ones was that of 45-year-old Laxman Mehra, who killed himself in his farmland after a cash-starved bank was unable to honour his withdrawal slip in the aftermath of demonetisation.As of March 31, 2017, around Rs 13,000 crore had been loaned to 26 lakh farmers by cooperative banks in MP at 0% interest. The interest is subsidized partially by NABARD and partially by state government. Official say that such a huge amount cannot be waived as it would cripple the finances of the cash-strapped government. The state has recently started procuring onions from farmers at Rs 8/kg despite suffering a loss of more than Rs 100 crore last year by buying onion at Rs 6/kg under pressure from farmers. The state government has promised to procure pulses, too, at MSP. Madhya Pradesh claims agriculture growth above 20%, which happens to be a world record. Ironically, it is a glut in production that has led prices to crash."

This phenomenon gave rise to violent protests by farmers in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.The death of six farmers in clashes with the police in Madhya Pradeshs Mandsaur district brought the farm crisis into national focus, uniting the Opposition against the National Democratic Alliance government. The Centre, for its part, reiterated its promise of doubling farmers income by 2020.The indicators of how farm produce prices crashed this year became clear on Monday, when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) was released. One can understand the reasons for farm distress in a bumper crop year by comparing CPI prices with the latest wholesale prices of pulses and vegetables in agricultural markets.The index showed that vegetable prices fell by about 13.5% in May, as compared to the corresponding month last year. The dip in the price of pulses was even higher, at 19.5%. This led to an overall deflation of 1.05% in food prices for the first time since 2012.The fall was higher in wholesale markets, where farmers offload their produce, with pulses and vegetables selling at nearly two-thirds (or 63%) of last years price. It was a sad year for farmers despite having a bumper crop after two tough years (of drought), observed T Haque, former head of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP).MANDI REPORT Main produce of each state suffered as prices crashedMain produce of each state suffered as prices crashedIn many states, the farmers have not even been able to recover the input costs, he said, adding that it was the responsibility of both the Centre and the states to ensure that agriculturists are provided with a price cushion.Highs and lowsIndias farm sector production grew by 8% this year, the highest ever.According to agriculture ministry data, the production of pulses amounted to 22.14 million tones  50% higher than 2014-15. Horticultural products, for their part, witnessed a growth of over 40%.However, the high production caused an unprecedented glut in farm markets already loaded with imported food items  including pulses. The government imposed 10% duty on these items in May, after prices crashed.In 2015-16, the Centre had allowed the import of pulses such as pigeon peas (tur dal) and lentils (mosur) to check rising prices even as the Opposition accused it of failing to control food inflation. The resultant glut in the market caused prices to come crashing, and the dip was as low as 80% for commodities such as onions and pigeon peas.I could not find a buyer for my produce for two whole days, said Mandsaur farmer Rakesh Patidar, who was finally left with no option but to sell his onions for Re 1 per kg in mid-May.Many farmers like Rakesh started growing onions after their prices skyrocketed in 2014, leading to a significant increase in its area under cultivation. Pigeon peas witnessed a similar trend in 2015 owing to crop failure.It seems like farmers were not looking at anything else, said a senior agriculture ministry functionary on the record production of onion and pigeon peas. They thought onions and pigeon peas would fetch them a good price, but they lost money instead.Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs violence-hit Malwa region, who have been growing onions since 2015, are now witnessing a dip in prices for the second year in a row. The situation is similar in many parts of Maharashtra, where the state government has now announced loan waivers.India is not the only country to have witnessed a steep fall in prices of pulses and vegetables this year. According to agriculture ministry officials, there has been an over 50% dip in prices across the globe due to a demand crunch. However, unlike India, farmers in other countries have the requisite infrastructure to store their produce and sell when prices stabilise."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

A few months back, the state government had formed a special committee to study possible electoral reforms in wholesale markets.In what is seen as the phase two of market reforms, the state government has decided to from a special committee to give suggestions for the formation of a new board of directors of Mumbai wholesale market. The committee, headed by marketing director Sunil Pawar, has been asked to submit its report in a months time.The trade in agricultural commodities in the terminal wholesale market of Vashi in Navi Mumbai is carried out mostly between traders. With an annual turnover of around Rs 18-20,000 crore, the market sees the arrival of agricultural commodities from across the state as well from other parts of the country. Vashi market is one of the few markets whose catchment area has little or no agricultural activities.Subhash Mane, the then marketing director, had suspended the board of director of Vashi market on charges of corruption in 2014. At present, a board of administrator is running the market and talks are on for appointing an IAS officer as the chairman of the market. Other than Pawar, the new committee has representatives from Solapur and the deputy secretary of the Mumbai market.Wholesale markets, which have been traditionally controlled by either the NCP or the Congress, has been on the radar of the Devendra Fadnavis government. Delisting of fruits and vegetables and changing the manner of election of directors for the market committees have been two major reforms carried out by the present government. Traders in the Mumbai market were at the forefront of the protest against delisting of fruits and vegetables last year.Earlier this year, the state government had given in-principle nod to allow for elections of directors from gram panchyats in the catchment areas of the wholesale markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the onion and potato traders and commission agents union, said the new body should ensure the directors should know about the functioning of the markets. The committee should be balanced and work without political interference, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Potato prices slipped more than 44% and onion too went down close to 13%.Protein items such as eggs, meat and fish also declined over 1% year-on-year in May. Only cereals in the food basket saw an uptick in prices. Pulses got cheaper.The new figures are based on the base year 2011-12. The base year was revised last month in order to reflect numbers more accurately.There was deflation in the fruit basket to the tune (-)0.73%.Commenting on the WPI based inflation numbers industry body Ficci said, the trend in inflation is in line with the broad expectations - both wholesale and retail prices remain benign. Food inflation has softened considerably over the past couple of months. Further, with global commodity prices remaining subdued and the monsoon this year expected to be normal, inflation should continue to be within RBIs comfort zone.The central bank has revised downwards its own projection for inflation in the months ahead. I think the case for supporting growth is getting stronger and we hope that RBI will take a relook into its monetary policy stance in the light of these new numbers. We need to boost investments and growth, which is so essential for employment generation across the economy."

The authorities, Anjana said, were only processing 250 trollies a day. There are already a 1,000 of us here with more arriving each day.Ranchhod Singh Goyel, another farmer, has more pressing worries. The farmer is caught between two boats: should we plant the next crop or be in line to get paid for the current crop.Though initially indifferent to the plight of farmers facing a glut and declining prices, state authorities have opened at least one procurement centre in each onion-growing district in the wake of last weeks farmers stir in Mandsaur that resulted in six deaths, including five in police firing. The procurement centres will be open till July 9.Onion growers can now sell their produce at a higher price compared to Rs 1 they were getting earlier per kilogram. The government plans to sell the onions for Rs 2 a kg. But farmers are worried. Prices will crash the moment the government stops, said a trader. And the Rs 2 onions will destroy the small vegetable vendors.The states marginal farmers are suffering too. The mandi is only procuring onions from tractor-trollies as their weighing-bridges cannot handle other vehicles. I dont own a tractor, said onion farmer Bharat Sharma. It costs Rs 1,500 a day to rent one  Rs 6,000 just to stand in line for four days to sell the onions. Instead, Sharma is selling his onions to a private trader at Rs 6 per kg, 30% lower than the government price.Poor farmers are going to private sellers because they can get cash right away, said Om Patidar, an onion farmer and trader. The government is buying, but no one knows when the money will appear in farmer accounts. We may have to organise a second agitation to get our money, farmer Mohan Sharma agreed.Madhya Pradeshs farmers have always grown onions, but when prices skyrocketed in 2010-11, the land under onion cultivation doubled over the next five years, resulting in the current problem of plenty. When prices crashed for three consecutive years, the Madhya Pradesh government offered an MSP for onions for the first time in 2016 and acquired about one million quintals. But the government did not know how to store onions, said an onion trader in Ujjains vegetable market. The entire consignment rotted away in damp warehouses.Many feel the onion crisis is emblematic of the dysfunction at the heart of Indian agriculture. State governments have no clue about price movements of agro-commodities, so they do not plan in advance, said G Chandrashekhar, a Mumbai-based commodity analyst.Though driven to distress, farmers in Madhya Pradesh have not given up on onions yet. Next year is an election year, so the government will have to buy, said a farmer with a smile, It makes sense to plant even more onions."

Since August 2015, both consumer price index and WPI are converging towards each other.SBI Research in its earlier reports had mentioned that in the coming months, both CPI and WPI would perfectly converge.

""Who organises meeting with farmers in AC hall? While we have to sell our farms due to financial crisis, the CM invites select farmers to his programme. Such programmes are just aimed at deceiving the common people and ignoring serious issues,"" said Awadhesh Nandan Sharma , district president of the farmers' outfit.Earlier this week, Nitish had slammed the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for its failure to resolve the nationwide farmers' protest. ""Farmers are in a bad condition, but the central government is indifferent to them. The government's failure to enforce MSP for farm produces has forced the farmers to protest. The country has been facing an agrarian crisis due to the low price of farm produces,"" Nitish had said on the sidelines of his Lok Samvad programme on Monday.In Friday's protest, the farmers demanded minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre for milk, Rs 100 per kilogram for pulses, Rs 3,000 per quintal for paddy and Rs 4,000 per quintal for wheat.""RJD chief Lalu Prasad never fails to term himself garibo ka neta, but he never supports milkmen, his traditional vote base,"" said Vivek."

And this time, it is from farmers of a body backed by the RSS, the BJP's ideological mentor. The Bharatiya Kisan Sangh on Thursday started indefinite protests across the state including a sit-in right in the heart of the capital Jaipur with a long list of demands including a loan waiver.The move was triggered by the Vasundhara Raje Scindia government's refusal to buy mustard at a minimum support price (MSP), or a floor price. Prices of mustard in Rajasthan, the country's largest producer of mustard, plunged after a bumper crop.This forced farmers to sell their harvest cheap to private players. It is estimated that the farmers would have got around Rs 37 for every kg if the government had procured mustard. Instead, farmers are forced to sell the oilseeds about 30 per cent cheaper, for about Rs 26 to 28 a kg.Kailash Gandoliya of Bharatiya Kisan Sangh insists that their protests had nothing to do with politics, the Congress or the ruling BJP.""For two years, we have been facing drought. Now that we have a good mustard crop, the rates went below the minimum support price. We asked the government to buy at the support price but they did not pick up a single quintal,"" he said.The RSS' farmers' body also wants a special session of the assembly to discuss the agricultural distress and implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report set up by the Centre that said farmers should get a return of at least 1.5 times over their investment.But farmers say they weren't even able to recover their investments.Phool Chand Verma is one of them; he has an outstanding farm loan of Rs 1.2 lakh that he had taken for his 3-hectare plot of land. For every kilogramme of onion that he produced this season, Mr Verma told NDTV, he had invested Rs 6. ""But in the mandi (farm produce markets), I am getting Rs 2 a kilo,"" says Phool Chand.The farmers are demanding a loan waiver but insist that the government should take long-term measures to pull them out of agricultural distress for good. It is estimated that the number of people engaged in farming in Rajasthan has shrunk by 30 per cent over the last two decades.""Loan waivers are not a solution. For how many years will the government waive loans? Actually the government should assure a good rate for farm produce so that we can make a profit. That is the only way to stop farmers from getting poorer each year,"" said Kamli Khan, a farmer from Sikar 100 km from the state capital said.With the Sangh affiliate joining the protests, the state government is worried.Agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini said the government would look into the Bhartiya Kisan Sangh's demands. ""They are part of our family... Whatever can be resolved at the level of the state government, we will address,"" he said.But it isn't going to be easy. In the last four years, the government says it given 53,000 crores in interest free loans. If it were to buy mustard at the floor price, it would have needed 500 crores more."

How can they issue a press note? I only talked about onion procurement and availability of seeds and fertilizers."" After a meeting on June 15, bank general manager Y K Singh in a press release said it came out during the bank's review meeting that recovery was 50%.Quoting government orders, the collector said, according to the press note there should be cent percent recovery of current loans and 90% dues.

He also said arm licences of farmers would be cancelled, if they are not able to pay their dues by June 20, the press note said.The press release talked about onion procurement and availability of seeds and fertilizers during kharif season.""It was a big news. Arm licences of defaulters would be cancelled especially during ongoing crisis as number of such farmers is about 2,000 in the district,"" a local journalist told TOI. The collector seems to have realised the controversy it was generating after he started receiving calls from the local media. He decided to withdraw the release and denial was issued, the scribe said.In a show-cause notice, the collector termed the press release as ""highly objectionable and misleading. I did not talk aboutcancellation of arm licence. Still you released a press note, which shows you are careless while carrying out your duties.""The collector has given three days time to the general manager to reply.

They are seeking higher support price for their produce and waiver of loans.Onion output from the crop sown during late kharif (summer) season of the 2016-17 crop year has been higher which led to huge arrivals in mandis and fall in prices.The official said the price drop was because the onion coming into the mandis was of 'table' variety and not stored due to low shelf life.Excess supply amid low demand led to crash in prices, which has hit farmers revenues. Also, the scale of arrival is so much that farmers are not able to grade the crop on the basis of size, traders said.Grading of onions would have helped MP farmers fetch better prices in Delhi and other markets, a trader said, adding that better support to growers is the need of the hour to handle problem of plenty in the state.Madhya Pradesh produces about 26-28 LT onions annually. It is the second largest producer after Maharashtra. LUX SA SRK"

JamesS_JamesA section of farmers attending the monthly grievance meeting at Collectorate here on Friday blamed the private companies approved by the government for exorbitant pricing of drip irrigation equipment supplied through the subsidy scheme coordinated by Horticulture department.K. Thanikodi, a farmer from Usilampatti, alleged that the private companies were charging more than double the market price for certain components for setting up drip irrigation. However, the government insists that we buy only from them, he said.When officials from Horticulture department pointed out that the farmers could choose from a list of 24 companies, Mr. Thanikodi and a few other farmers who supported his allegation said that the companies had formed a cartel and were charging roughly around the same amount. The farmers demanded that they should instead be allowed to choose from any vendor in the market, provided procurement bills were submitted properly to the government for reimbursement.Highlighting that farmers were asked to take care of transportation and installation, they also insisted that the entire cost be covered in the subsidy.Pointing out that the scheme subsidised only the materials and not installation or transportation, Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao, who presided over the meeting, said that the list of companies and other provisions of the scheme could not be changed at the district level. However, I will forward your concerns to the government, he said.Other issuesDelay in payment of procurement price to farmers by sugar mills, extension of drip irrigation subsidy for onion cultivation and de-silting of Vaigai dam were other issues that dominated the meeting.With several farmers raising the demand for de-silting of Vaigai dam, officials from Public Works Department (PWD) responded that a detailed project report for the same had been submitted to the government, which had to decide on the sanctioning of funds.Protest in ChennaiN. Palanichamy, president, Tamil Nadu Sugarcane Farmers Association, pointed out that the private and government-run sugar mills together owed roughly Rs. 2,000 crore to farmers across the State, of which the National Cooperative Sugar Mill in Alanganallur owed Rs. 11 crore. We are planning a protest in Chennai on Thursday if the government does not initiate measures to settle the dues, he said.Farmers also demanded that drip irrigation subsidy be extended for onion cultivation, for which Horticulture department officials said that a proposal had already been sent to the government.Pointing out that a majority of issues raised at the meeting related to PWD, Collector Rao instructed PWD officials in the rank of Assistant Engineer and Assistant Executive Engineer from every division to be present to properly respond to farmers queries.Similarly, registering his disappointment over the absence of Forest department officials at the meeting despite many issues raised in relation to them, Mr. Rao called the District Forest Officer over phone during the meeting and asked him to ensure that the department was properly represented."

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee of the then ruling Left Front in West Bengal had just stormed to power on the promise of reviving the industrial glory of the state, but Nandigram proved to be his nemesis. Overnight, farmers across the state turned hostile; the Opposition closed ranks; the intelligentsia distanced itself from the bhadralok chief minister and eventually, the Left lost the plot in a state it had ruled for 34 years.Cut to 2017, the nation is perhaps staring at another Nandigram moment. The killing of six farmers in a police crackdown in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh earlier this month has put the spotlight on Indias worsening farm crisis. The farmers unrest that has since spread to other parts of Madhya Pradesh and elsewhere in India is a wake-up call. For it is a result of years of neglect of agriculture, something that still provides livelihood to two-thirds of the Indias 1.3 billion people.Burden of farming outweighs rewardsAt the core of the problem lies a growing mismatch between what it takes to grow food and what a farmer fetches for his produce in the marketplace. Economists explain this using the phrase terms of trade for agriculture, which improved for a brief period in the 1990s before turning unfavourable for most part of the new millennium.Sample this: In 1992, a typical farmer in Punjab paid Rs 6 per litre for diesel to keep his generator sets running, bought a sack of diammonium phosphate (DAP) for Rs 200 and hired labour at a daily wage of Rs 40-50. Twenty-five years on, diesel costs 10 times more, DAP priceshave increased more than five times and farm wagesare 10 times higher. In contrast, the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat, which is what most of Punjab grows, has increased only five-fold during this period  Rs 330 per quintal to Rs 1,625 per quintal.Moreover, farmers in the past rarely spent much money on pesticides, to protect their crop. They do now, and pesticide prices have spiked more than the cost of any other input. Twenty-five years ago, farmers didnt have to bore deeper every year to pump water into the fields. They do now, because water tables are dropping at an alarming rate.In other words, the burden of farming has grown much faster than the rewards it brings. Demonetisation made it worse. As my journalist colleagueHarish Damodaranwrote, Weve entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation. Much of the trade in farm goods is cash-based and financed through a chain of intermediaries  wholesale buyers, processors and retailers. Demonetisation crippled this network of informal credit, causing a free fallin the prices of farm goods across the board.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced into distress selling. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.A bountiful harvest, which helped the broader economy post a somewhat impressive growth of 7.1% in 2016-17 despite a demonetisation-driven slump in manufacturing, had turned into a curse. What could have been an occasion for celebrations has turned into a season of mourning for deaths triggered by a glut in farm produce and their plunging prices.As someone said, it is the worst time to be a farmer. A five-part series  Being A Farmer Now -- that will appear in this newspaper, starting Monday, brings out the depth of the despair that is sweeping farmlands across India.MANDI REPORT Main produce of each state suffered as prices crashedMain produce of each state suffered as prices crashedYears of neglectThe imbalance between input costs and remunerative prices, however, is just one explanation for the growing farmers unrest. From sluggish infrastructure to lack of research breakthroughs, Indias farm sector faces many challenges. For most crops, yield per acre grew at a slower pace over the past one-and-a-half decades compared to the 1980s and 1990s. So did the expansion of the irrigation network. Successive governments have paid little attention to building research and institutional support to the farming community. As we speak the most premiere agricultural research institution, IARI, is into its third year without a full-time director.The share of government spending in agricultural research and education in the gross domestic product (GDP) has fallen by almost half in the past 15 years  from about 0.5% to under 0.3%. Developed countries, which depend much less on agriculture, spend 2% of their GDP on agriculture. The figure is at least twice higher for even countries like China and Brazil.The neglect of agricultural research has had a bearing on growth in farm productivity. In a well-researched article published recently in theEconomic and Political Weekly, economist Shantanu De Roy demonstrates how, for most crops, yield per acre grew at a slower pace over the past one-and-a-half decades compared to the 1980s and 1990s. So did the expansion of the irrigation network.Public investment in agriculture has been stagnant for nearly a decade, while private capital flows have not picked up enough to provide the stimulus that the sector needs.From my reporting days in the late 1990s, I remember how the government built a narrative to defend its failure to invest enough in the farm sector. Foreign-returned economists, many of whom occupy positions of power, would twist data to show how private sector investment could more than fill up the gaps in public investment. It never happened. We know that now.As a result, growth in agriculture has decelerated from an annual pace of 2.8% in 1990s to 2.4% through the decade of 2001-10 and to 2.1 % in the first half of the current decade.What Indias farm sector desperately needs is a radical policy overhaul based on a new imagination. Interventions such as loan waivers or MSP revisions can at best offer temporary succour. At worst, they deflect attention from the real issues behind the crisis that has been in the making for long  India is reaping what it sowed as it scripted a story of economic transformation that left the farmers out.Rajesh Mahapatra is the chief content officer, Hindustan Times.

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat?

Farmers are worried about their onion as well as for cultivating new crop. As of now, we have just stored onion at Jan Shiksha Kendras.

PTI PhotoThe farmers protests in Madhya Pradesh (MP) and Maharashtra indicate that all is not well on the economic front, especially agriculture. If such unrest could happen in MP, which claims to have registered the fastest agri-GDP growth at 9.7 per cent per year during 2005-06 to 2014-15, then no state is likely to be immune from it.MP has been a showcase for the performance of BJP-ruled states in agriculture. But it now appears that agriculture could be Prime Minister Narendra Modis Achilles heel. The governments poor performance in the sector at the all-India level  testified to by a growth rate of less than 2 per cent per annum during 2014/15 to 2016/17  has to be addressed quickly, and in a sustained manner. Otherwise, the neglect of agriculture may cost the PM heavily in 2019.What has really gone wrong with agriculture during the Modi era? And how can it be fixed? We focus here on prices and farm loans, although agriculture suffers from a number of problems.The current protest in MP seems to have been triggered by the crash in onion prices, but it also drew strength from the news of loan waivers in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Maharashtra. The seeds of competitive loan waivers were sown by the PM himself  at a rally during the election to the UP assembly, he announced that farmer loans will be waived in the very first meeting of the new UP cabinet, if the BJP were to be voted to power in the state. The new UP Chief Minister, Yogi Adityanath, followed the PMs advice diligently.Farmers in other states have been watching, and the loan waiver could lead to a demand for similar waivers in other states  Haryana, Punjab, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. We wont be surprised if loan waivers cost state treasuries Rs 2,00,000 crore in the months to come, taking state-level deficits closer to 4 per cent of their GDP.What is it that the farmers are demanding? Simply remunerative prices for their farm produce. The BJP had promised in its 2014 election manifesto that if voted to office, the party will ensure 50 per cent margin to farmers over their costs. Where does the Modi government stand on that promise after three years in office, compared to the last three years of the Manmohan Singh government?Graphics by Sarfaraz Graphics by SarfarazWe dug out official data of net margins (the MSP minus cost C2) from the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices reports of the last six years (see Graph 1). The bitter truth is that net margins in most agricultural commodities  paddy, maize, cotton, gram, sugarcane  have actually declined during the Modi regime. Moreover, if one looks at just 2016-17 data, there were negative margins on several commodities: Jowar (-18 per cent), ragi (-20 per cent), sesamum (-14 per cent), sunflower (-13 per cent), groundnut (-4 per cent), moong (-7 per cent) and urad (-4 per cent). With a glut in tur production, market prices fell way below the MSP and the real losses were even higher. Potatoes, onions and tomatoes seem to have met the same fate.No wonder there is widespread unrest amongst farmers. They suffered back-to-back droughts in the first two years of the Modi government, and now, in the third year, despite good rains and bumper harvests, they are suffering due to the collapse in prices. Loan waivers are not a solution: They are band-aids and give temporary breathing space to policymakers.The best way to handle prices is to get the markets right. Remember, prices are determined by the forces of demand and supply, and cost enters through the supply curve. Factoring in only the costs plus pricing without considering the demand side can lead to even greater distortions, and therefore needs to be avoided.But how does one get markets right? Take the case of tur; India had a bumper harvest of tur in the last season. But the government banned its exports, private entities were not allowed to hold stocks and trading in futures had also been banned. No wonder, with bumper harvest on the one hand, and strangulated markets on the other, prices crashed, tumbling way below the MSP, creating misery for farmers and causing unrest.The solution is simple: Abolish all export bans, private stocking limits and restrictions on futures trading in all agri-commodities. This is all the more desirable in commodities whose imports are open at low or zero duties. If this is not done, the government will be forced to buy all commodities whose prices nosedive. This is neither an efficient, nor a feasible policy option.For perishables like onions, potatoes and tomatoes, we need more and better storage facilities, linkages with processing firms, contract farming, opening land lease markets, etc. We need to develop efficient, equitable value chains  like the AMUL model in dairy.But there is one problem on the agri-credit front that needs to be addressed urgently. Farmers need cash immediately after harvests to pay their debts from formal and informal sources. Warehouse receipt systems and giving the farmers advances against their stocks is the way to go.The biggest failure of the RBI and NABARD has been on the financial inclusion front: Even in 2013  the latest information we have  of the total outstanding debt of rural households, 44 per cent came from informal sources (Graph 2). Interest rates in the informal sector hover anywhere from 15-30 per cent.Thus, instead of interest subvention schemes, the government needs to focus on financial inclusion if it wants to address farmers problems on a sustainable basis.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The committee also has the agriculture minister Chiman Sapariya, health minister Shankar Chaudhary, minister of state for agriculture Vallabh Vaghasiya and irrigation minister Nanu Vanani.Patel said the committee decided that the government should also provide assistance to farmers who have restored their potato and onion produce in cold storages. Apart from this, the farmer will get Rs 1 per kg for exporting the produce from the state.Officials said that if a farmer sells 300 quintals of the crop in Gujarat he will get Rs 30,000 as subsidy. If he sells the same amount outside Gujarat, he will get an additional export subsidy of Rs 30,000.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association, said, ""This subsidy will be come as a major relief for farmers who decided to stock their crop for lack of a good price. This subsidy will help farmers to at least make good their storage cost.Sources said that the subside was announced keeping in view the election scheduled for later this year.

Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

The tradition dates back to 349 AD.Shweta Pai, a professional textile designer says, The shibori art follows the Japanese philosophy of wabi-sabi. The beauty of shibori is to experiment with colours and its effect on fabric .Various colour extracts can be obtained from natural sources such as onion peels, used coffee, tea powder and flowers such as marigold and hibiscus. These materials are soaked in boiling water from which the colour is extracted. The fabric (silk, cotton, hemp or similar fabrics) is dipped in the extracted colour and various techniques are applied to obtain naturally occurring and unexpected patterns. Various techniques such as binding, stitching, pole wrapping, clamping and folding are used to obtain patterns on the fabric.The traditional textile art of Shibori dyeing is simple to learn and the materials required are easily available and inexpensive.At a workshop held at the Go Native caf in Jayanagar, members experimented with colour extract from the marigold flower on cotton fabric. Simran Monga, a graphic designer says, Everyone here shares a common appreciation towards art of all forms. Such a workshop held on a weekend helps us get away from our daily routine.The workshop was conducted by Shweta Pai who said that people today are increasingly getting disenchanted from traditional art and nature and buying products manufactured in masses.

(PTI Photo, File) Nagpur: Farmers throwing vegetables on a road during a protest as part of the Maharashtra bandh over various demands in Nagpur, Maharashtra on Monday. (PTI Photo, File)A HUNDRED years after Mahatma Gandhi led a movement of indigo growers against their oppressor landlords in Bihars Champaran district, farmers of Maharashtra launched an unprecedented strike early this month. But unlike the Champaran Satyagraha, this was a movement led by farmers themselves. It started with farmers from Puntamba, a sleepy village in Ahmednagar district, deciding at a Gram Sabha meeting in April to stop supply of all produce to cities from June 1. That resolution was subsequently adopted by farmers in villages across Maharashtra, culminating in a stunningly successful strike lasting almost 11 days.The striking farmers not only shut down wholesale produce markets and blocked highways to prevent delivery trucks from reaching urban centres, but also even dumped milk and vegetables on the streets. The Maharashtra government was, then, forced to constitute a Cabinet subcommittee of five ministers to hold consultations on the main demands that included a complete waiver of institutional farm loans and remunerative crop prices based on theM S Swaminathan reports formula of 50 per cent returns over cost. These demands were accepted in principle, following which the strike was called off. The collective might of farmers had clearly triumphed over the all-powerful state.The Maharashtra farmers agitation was remarkable for not only its seeming spontaneity and absence of any towering leader, but also it happening in an above-normal rainfall and bumper agricultural harvest year. Such protests one would have normally expected in the event of losses from drought, especially of the kind seen in 2014-15 and 2015-16.But as the accompanying table shows, the Maharashtra government infused around Rs 20,939 crore during the two consecutive drought years through time-honoured relief measures such as crop loss compensation, insurance claims and labour payments under MGNREGA. In addition, rescheduling of crop loans and reduced interest on these  plus the state governments ambitious Jalyukta Shivar programme of water and soil conservation in 25,000 drought-prone villages  turned out to be significant interventions.The trigger for the current farmers agitation has not been any natural calamity-driven distress, which was, on the whole, deftly handled by the state government. Instead, it has primarily been prices.A bumper crop resulting from good rains had ignited hopes among farmers of setting-off their losses from previous years. But what they encountered was a price crash across crops  from cereals and pulses to vegetables and fruits.Take pulses, where the Centre, in a bid to promote their cultivation to bridge domestic shortages, raised the minimum support price for tur (pigeon-pea) from Rs 4,625 to Rs 5,050 per quintal. Farmers obliged by increasing production, but the government failed to honour its promise. Far from getting the promised rate, farmers had to dump tur for as low as Rs 3,000 per quintal. Even during peak summer, they realised hardly Rs 5 per kg for tomatoes, onions and other vegetables.In short, farmers suffered more with record production on the back of good rains than when there was crop failure from drought.A second trigger for the stir was the crop loan waiver announcement by a newly-elected government in Uttar Pradesh, which took place around the same time prices were crashing. Farmer organisations admit that waiving loans cannot be a real solution, but say that it will have a soothing effect in the present context. At the least, it will bring many farmers back into the formal credit system. Also, if there can be a farm loan waiver in UP, then why not in Maharashtra?What is clear from the above is that the risk of price fluctuation in agricultural commodities isnt covered by any of the existing government relief mechanisms. The need of the hour is a framework that insulates farmers from the shocks of not just natural calamities, but also market price crashes. And loan waiver cannot provide any sustainable solution.That said, the Maharashtra farmers agitation  and the state government having to eventually concede to an unconditional loan waiver  is a game-changer, simply for showing how even an otherwise unorganised class can successfully express and negotiate demands. Organised labour unions, not to speak of industry associations like FICCI and CII, are known for constantly engaging in promoting and protecting the interests of their members. Farmers have had no such arrangements for collective lobbying. In this case, though, ordinary farmers under the most lugubrious conditions stood firm on their demands, resisting attempts to divide and weaken their ranks.The following elements may have contributed to the invisible glue of emotional unity among Maharashtras farmers: * Insensitive statements against farmers by some responsible public figures even amidst tumbling crop prices. Similar statements from top bankers (and also the financial regulator) against loan waivers and the possible adverse impact on repayment culture would only have further fuelled resentment among farmers.* The photos/videos of farmers ploughing back their onion and tomato crops because of not being able to afford the additional cost of harvesting. These images went viral on social media and were exchanged by farmers with one another. n Drying up of credit post-demonetisation from cooperatives, the lifeline of farmers in Maharashtra. They were, then, compelled to approach commercial banks and moneylenders for credit on far less favourable terms.* A spike in suicides, including in northern Maharashtra, the countrys top onion and grape producer. The latter belt has been the epicentre of the strike. The losses to its farmers have been more, as they grow a host of cash crops entailing higher investment and also exhibiting greater sensitivity to price crashes. These farmers are generally more well-off, educated and combative. They, not surprisingly, provided the leadership for the movement.* A sustained public debate on farm debt waiver in the last two years, amidst talk of loan write-offs for big corporates. The Oppositions Sangharsh Yatra and also a ruling coalition partners Atmakalesh Yatra marches in support of loan waiver would only have created the perfect pitch for the farmers strike.These elements established a common chord of angst amongst lakhs of farmers, culminating in a state-wide agitation. This is a classic example of collective behaviour driven by group dynamics that leads people to engage in unthinkable acts under unusual circumstances, as was propounded by the American social scientist Robert E Park. And nobody could have imagined that the success of Maharashtras farmer strike would pave the way for similar demands elsewhere, including in Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

5a06068d9855b76bf13c2f8d,For him  it’s not a gruelling task at all,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/for-him-its-not-a-gruelling-task-at-all/article19112103.ece,2017-06-21,"During the month of Ramzan, the rich and the poor among Muslims break the day-long fast at the Iftar every day with the rice gruel (nombu kanji). A nutritious meal, it is made using roughly the same spices one finds in biriyani, and contains vegetables or mutton. The flavour of the nombu kanji cuts across religious lines. It is a hit with the Hindus too, who collect it from the mosques near their locality here.Noorul Islam Jamia Mosque at Suramangalam, at the heart of Salem city, serves the gruel to about 2,000 fasting Muslim families in and around this area. This gruelling task begins at the crack of dawn.Over the past three days, sixty nine year-old S. Sadaqatullah Sait, a native of Keeranur near Palani, has been heading a team of half a dozen persons in preparing the gruel at the mosque. He has been doing this for the last three decades ever since the residents of Keeranur, all businessmen who settled down in Suramangalam, introduced him to the jamath leaders of the mosque in the 1980s.Every day, it takes 150 kg of rice, seven kg of garlic, five kg of ginger and onion to make the gruel. Though the gruel is served only in the evening, the preparation commences at daybreak, says Sait.The gruel is ready by 1 p.m. and the serving commences at 3 p.m. After the gruel is served, he begins preparing the sahri (pre-dawn meal) also for about 200 fasting Muslims who are living away from their families and students put up in the hostels. This is served between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m. at the mosque. This leaves Sait and his team working day and night during the month of Ramzan. No doubt, it is tiresome. But what gives us strength is that we cook for those who are fasting, he says."

Farmers in Thirumangalam, Usilampatti, Chellampatti, Vadipatti blocks cultivate onion and shallots and Sedapatti T Kallupatti stretch is known as the `onion belt' of the district.During last grievance redressal meeting, farmers' leader M Pandian placed the appeal to the horticulture department to promote onion cultivation. He stated that onion has turned a very remunerative crop this season but the benefits could not be enjoyed much in the region due to the ongoing drought conditions.Onion prices, especially of shallots, sky-rocketed this year with one kg priced at `125. The reduced supply due to drought is said to be major reason for price rise.Deputy director of horticulture, G O Poopathy told the farmers at the meeting that Madurai has received funds for 30 hectares under the National Horticulture Mission (NHM). Onions could also be cultivated profitably using drip irrigation, he said, assuring farmers that all help will be rendered by the department to increase onion cultivation."

It has also taken up with the Union government to increase procurement of sunflower seeds from 25% to 50% of the state's produce.The information was shared by Haryana agriculture minister Om Prakash Dhankar on Thursday while adding that the state government was implementing Swaminathan commission's recommendations in a step-wise manner by making agriculture risk free for farmers, with zero-interest loans and crop diversification.Replying to a question that Haryana farmers are forced to sell potatoes for even 20 paisa per kg, Dhankar said market forces cause drastic changes in the selling price of farmers' produce. On efforts to stabilise vegetable prices, Dhankar informed, ""There are plans to levy more taxes when prices improve, and use the funds collected for farmers' welfare when the prices drop.""The minister said that the state government has already requested the Centre to procure 50% to states' sunflower seeds produce at the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 3,950 per quintal.To a question on farm debt waiver, Dhankar replied that the state government's main focus is to make farmers self-sufficient instead. He said that a target has been fixed to increase farmers' income to Rs 1 lakh per acre. But he also said that farmers across the world require assistance in the form of subsidies as the agricultural sector does not yield earnings as high as that of the service sector. ""Therefore, the state government offered subsidies to the tune of Rs 11,000 crore per year,"" he said.He informed that during his tour to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji, the delegation studied techniques adopted for horticulture, floriculture, dairying, animal husbandry, storage and transportation of wheat, which would be replicated in Haryana.Taking a dig at the protesting Congress leaders in the state, Dhankar said that the Swaminathan commission's report was submitted to the government in 2006 but the previous Congress government failed to implement its recommendations. ""In fact, the then CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda had formed a committee which further delayed the implementation of the recommendations,"" he said.The minister told that against the commission's recommendation of compensation of Rs 10,000 per acre to farmers, the Congress government paid them only Rs 6,000 per acre whereas the BJP government gave compensation to the tune of Rs 12,000 per acre to farmers."

He has been standing here for the past three days and he is nowhere near the mandi gates. He is apprehensive that once his onions become soggy and start rotting, the authorities wont buy it. I am hoping to sell the onions at around Rs 50,000; it will help me just pay off my loans, with enough left for by kids school and college fees.With monsoon likely to hit the state within the next two days according to the meteorology department, Sawalias predicament captures the hope and fear that thousands of farmers are facing as they are anxiously waiting their turn in the 65 purchasing centres throughout the state.Some farmers like Naushad Khan (53) from a village in Berasia road got so fed up with the unending wait outside the mandi that he decided to sell his onions directly to the consumers in Gyaraso quarters  which is illegal  at Rs 8 per kg. However, he is being harassed by BMC who often shoo him away and also ask for bribes. I am desperate. I have to sell the onions and go back home. I cannot wait this long as I have to prepare my fields for the Kharif crop.Read more: MP farmer protest: Death toll goes up to 17 after 2 more commit suicideThe lifeline given to farmers of Madhya Pradesh by the governments decision to procure onions at the rate of 8 per kilogram might have given it a breather from the ongoing farmers agitation, but the actual relief to farmers still remains to be seen.Though officials are not saying it loud but rotten onion wont be purchased. Says P C Meena, agriculture production commissioner, This is for you to understand. Who will buy rotten onions? But the onions we have purchased are our responsibility.But one thing is certain - the government is staring at an estimated loss of between Rs 500- 600 crores, according to those familiar with the development in the onion front, thanks to the lack of expertise by the procuring, storing and distributing agencies.An official who did not want to be quoted said if we add the transportation cost of Rs 8 to 10 per kg, the cost of per kg of onion comes at Rs 18, and we are going to sell it at Rs 2, a clear loss of Rs 16 per kg.Markfed, the onion procuring agency, managing director Dnyaneshwar Patil said that so far they have procured 3.6 lakh metric tonne, but they estimate that this figure will go up to at least 5 or even 6 lakh metric tonne. But that is still only 15 to 20% of the estimated bumper production of 34 lakh metric tonne this year in Madhya Pradesh.Patil agrees that his agency and neither the State Civil Supplies department which has been given the task of storing, distributing and selling the onions has the expertise either to store or sell a perishable commodity like onion. And distributing it to all corners of the state to be sold through PDS shops at Rs 2 per kg will be a major challenge, he admits.Hitesh Bajpai the chairman of the state civil supplies corporation knows that the government is staring at a huge loss.It would be wrong to say that we are fully prepared. We do not have enough capacity to store the onions which we are purchasing so we are trying to sell them though auction. This year our loss due to wastage might be more than last year when the government purchased onion worth Rs 62.8 crores. Our aim is to minimize this loss, he candidly admits."

He stressed upon the need to buy pulses, onion and coarse cereals before the rainy season and assured farmers that their crops will be bought by the Centre and the state government. Paswan assured that the Centre will provide all support to the state government.The western Madhya Pradesh recently witnessed a major farmers agitation for loan waiver and remunerative prices. The protest intensified after the death of five persons in police firing in Mandsaur district on June 6.Besides, the number of debt-ridden farmers who have ended their lives in the state in the last fortnight has reached 22 as yet another debt-burdened peasant has allegedly committed suicide in Chhatarpur.In MP, there is a bumper crop production. The growth of agriculture sector is more than 20 per cent. Whether its fruits and vegetables or foodgrains, there has been a bumper production in the state. This is a reason for happiness for us. But at the same time prices have fallen due to bumper harvest which is a problem for farmers, Chouhan told reporters.The Chief Minister said he has requested the Union food minister to buy pulses through the Food Corporation of India (FCI) in the state at MSP so that procurement of all crops arriving in the mandies could be procured before rainy season. Chouhan also demanded that the Centre should buy coarse cereals at MSP.Responding to these demands, Paswan said: MP is a state which is producing bumper crop. The state government faces problem because of this as sometimes prices goes below MSP. I have discussed this issue with Agriculture Minister. We are taking steps and will take more to solve this problem.Chouhan said the state government is also procuring onion and pulses. The state has procured 3.2 lakh tonnes of onion out of 32 lakh tonnes production. The Chief Minister complemented the Centre for Aadhaar-seeding of ration cards to eliminate bogus cards.However, he demanded that distribution of foodgrains should be permitted in some genuine cases where there is a problem in verification of beneficiary because of poor internet connectivity or biometrics.The Food Minister has assured me that he will provide all support to the state, Chouhan said. Madhya Pradesh produces about 26-28 lakh tonnes onions annually. It is the second largest producer after Maharashtra.Wholesale prices of onion have fallen sharply below Rs 6 per kg in the state as the crop production during late kharif season of the 2016-17 crop year (July-June) was higher.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The farmers, who were hopeful of reaping profits from surplus production, have been left high and dry in the absence of poor marketing and storage facilities.In Kalahandi district, onion is grown in Bhawanipatna, Kesinga, Narla and Golamunda blocks where farmers sink small chahalas and irrigate the fields through traditional means.According to farmers, the soil here is suitable for growing onion during both rabi and kharif seasons, but due to lack of storage and marketing facilities, the area under coverage is not increasing. The Horticulture department, which plays a major role in introduction of monsoon onion in more areas of the district, it is yet to take any steps in this direction, the farmers alleged. At present, the department is providing demonstration kits to a few farmers and monsoon onion is grown on about 100 acres only.The farmers said opening of bulk storage facilities by the Government and bank patronage can help farmers in saving the crop, besides ensuring profits. Under Horticulture Mission, 20-tonne onion storage facility is available at 50 per cent subsidy. There are, however, few takers for the facility as each storage unit costs `1.75 lakh. The farmers are reluctant to go for it due to poor financial background.Under such circumstances, the farmers are forced to sell most of the products from the farm land itself soon after harvest at throwaway prices.Usually, harvesting is undertaken in April and traders from outside the State procure the produce through their agents at `400 or `500 per quintal. Agents of the traders, particularly from Chhattisgarh, Berhampur, Kolkata as well as Bhubaneswar camp during the harvesting season, procure the stock and sell it later at a higher price.With the local produce already procured, the districts consumers depend on Nashik onion. Wholesalers Tahalram Makhija and Sanjiv Swain said, local onion is available from April till mid June after which Nashik onion is imported through agents at Raipur. Three qualities of onion are sold to retailers at `575, `550 and `475 per 50 kg. The same is sold in Bhawanipatna at around `15 per kg, Swain said."

(PTI) During the protests in Mandsaur. (PTI)How money reached themWhen five protesters died on June 6 in alleged police firing near Mandsaur, the epicentre of the farmers unrest, the government announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and later doubled it to Rs 10 lakh. But with anger spreading to other parts of the state and the import of its political damage sinking in, by the end of the day, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan announced an unprecedented compensation  Rs 1 crore and a job to a family member of each of the victims.Opposition parties accused the BJP government of bidding over dead bodies and the district collector, since transferred and later suspended, publicly expressed his inability to pay the compensation, saying anything more than Rs 4 lakh was beyond his mandate.A week later, as Chouhan travelled to meet the family members, his secretariat ensured that the money was electronically transferred to the bank accounts of the families. Citing exceptional circumstances, the secretariat sent a note-sheet with the CMs signature to the General Administration Department (GAD) to clear the money. The GAD, in turn, sent a formal sanction letter to the collector, who later transferred the money from the local treasury.Officials in the CMs secretariat said there was no limit to the amount that can be sanctioned under the CMs discretionary fund. By its very definition, its the CMs discretion and the process is not bound by rules. The amount can be Rs 10,000 or Rs 1 crore, a top officer in the secretariat told The Sunday Express.In normal circumstances, the process is rigorous and requires verification.The CM had doled out huge amounts in the past, but that was restricted to players such as P V Sindhu, who got Rs 50 lakh from the discretionary fund after she won the silver medal at the Rio Olympics. Soldiers from the state who die in the line of duty usually get Rs 10 lakh.The BJP high command was reportedly unhappy with the hefty compensation, fearing it could set a precedent. When the sixth death, allegedly in police custody, took place in Mandsaur a few days later, family members and relatives of Ghanshyam Dhakad said they would not cremate his body until they were compensated with Rs 1 crore and a job. Since then, the Congress has demanded that every suicide by farmers be compensated with Rs 1 crore.To put things in perspective, a look at compensation packages announced in the past: On September 13, 2015, the day after an explosion left 80 people dead in Petlawad town, Chief Minister Chouhan announced a compensation of Rs 5 lakh for each death and a job to a family member. A farmer who was killed in police firing in Bareli, Raisen district, in 2012 got a compensation of Rs 2 lakh. The farmers were protesting against the delay in procurement of wheat caused by a shortage of gunny bags. In 1998, when the Congress was in power in the state, more than 19 farmers were killed in police firing in Multai town of Betul district. The victims families got Rs 2 lakh in compensation from the state government and Rs 50,000 from the Prime Ministers fund. The compensation for those who died in the 1984 gas tragedy was hiked to Rs 10 lakh in 2010.Family hopes to use the money for Satyanarayans father Mangilals (above) treatment.

(Photo: Oinam Anand)Satyanarayan Dhangar, 30,Lodh villageSurvived by:Parents Mangilal Dhangar and Bhanwari Bai, brothers Kanhaiyalal and Raju, and their wives Nirmala and Manju Bai.Debt: Approximately Rs 4.5 lakh, of which Rs 3 lakh is against a tractor Satyanarayan bought  he paid instalments of about Rs 60,000 every six months; a bank loan of Rs 50,000 under the Mukhyamantri Aawas Yojana to build their house; and Rs 60,000 for the purchase of manure and seed. The family owns five bighas, of which two bighas stand mortgaged for Rs 40,000 (the land deed is shared by the extended family), along with about 300 grams of silver and a gold-plated necklace for Rs 7,000.The Family: Having studied till Class 10, Satyanarayan was the most educated in the family; Kanhaiyalal studied till Class 2 and Raju till Class 5.Satyanarayan used to take care of all the household finances, says Kanhaiyalal, He was charming so he would convince people that he would pay off his debts later. Satyanarayan never married.The brothers, their wives, and the parents occupy a room each. The family grows wheat and alsi (flax) on their land. Last season, they also grew potatoes and peas. When not in the fields, the brothers work as labourers and are said to be good at reinforcing wells.Satyanarayans father, Mangilal Dhangar, prefers to sleep outside. The day The Sunday Express met the family, he was on a cot in the open, crying out in pain. He finally slips off the cot onto the mud floor. As he keeps groaning, the brothers call an ambulance and he is taken away. He was fine until now, says his wife Bhanwari.Whats in the house: Three cots, a ceiling fan, a table fan, lots of utensils and a tractor.That day: He had joined the protests because he was frustrated with falling prices, says brother Raju. Our debts kept rising and the returns from farm kept declining.Rs 1 crore: We will pay off our debt, though the Chief Minister told us he will get it all waived, says Raju. Some money might also be used for their fathers treatment. With the rest, they plan to buy some land.Its worth: Over 22 times their total debt.He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand) He joined the protests as expenses exceeded earnings, says Kanhaiyalals wife Sumitra (Photo: Oinam Anand)Kanhaiyalal Patidar, 44,Chillod Piplya villageSurvided by: Wife Sumitra, daughter Puja and son Jitendra.Debt: None, says wife Sumitra. He bought seeds and manure with help from the cooperative society. The interest on the societys loan is zero per cent for the first year and seven per cent from then on, so he avoided the interest, says wife Sumitra.The Family: Kanhaiyalal lived with his wife and children in a small, two-storey unplastered and unfurnished house, next to the homes of his two brothers, Jagdish and Ganpat, and other relatives.Like each of his brothers, Kanhaiyalal owned six bighas, on which he grew wheat, soybean and garlic. With the rate of wheat hovering between Rs 1,100 and Rs 1,200 a quintal, and that of garlic between Rs 800 and Rs 2,000 a quintal, each of us made only around Rs 30,000 last year, says Jagdish. Kanhaiyalal also had a cow and a buffalo and sold some of the milk. Milk sells for Rs 20-22 a litre, the price of water, says his mother, Debu Bai. The brothers also worked as daily-wage labourers.Whats in the house: Of the two rooms in the house, one is on the ground floor, and the other on the roof, which doubles up as a kitchen. There is a storehouse which has a few sacks of produce, an agricultural weighing machine and Kanhaiyalals motorcycle.That day: Kharcha nahi baith raha tha (Expenses exceeded our earnings), says Sumitra. Isiliye andolan mein gaye thhe (Thats why he joined the protest).The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the bank accounts of Sumitra and the children. Bank officials have told us that we cannot withdraw money from the childrens accounts yet and need permission from the bade sahab (big boss), says Laxmi Narayan, Sumitras father. The children say they are inspired by a relative, a doctor uncle in Ratlam, and want to be doctors too. While daughter Puja managed 50 per cent in Class 10, son Jitendra scored 70 per cent in Class 7.Sumitra says the childrens share of money will be saved as fixed deposits. Kanhaiyalals brothers also indicate they will be given some money to continue farming on his land. We will hire labourers to till his fields. All of us will also move to a better place within this village, says Jagdish. Then there are the villagers who have donated to set up a bust of martyr Kanhaiyalal in the middle of the village.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore is 625 times Pujas annual school fee of Rs 16,000, which Kanhaiyalal could not afford; his father-in-law, Laxmi Narayan, would pay the childs fee. Kanhaiyalal took care of his sons education, which cost him Rs 12,000 a year. Masterji in school told me I wont be allowed to take my exams if I didnt pay the fee. My father always somehow paid, says son Jitendra.The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand) The crore is not worth my husband, says Ghanshyams Rekha Bai (Photo: Oinam Anand)Ghanshyam Salitra, 30,Badwan villageSurvived by: Wife Rekha Bai, four-year-old son Rudra, month-old daughter Himanshi, father Durgalal Dhakad, sister Shamu BaiDebt: The family owes Rs 3 lakh to two banks and another Rs 2 lakh to a cooperative society. The loan goes back years. Almost all of it was to buy seeds, manure, pay for labour, hire machines, says father Durgalal.The Family: Ghanshyam never saw his daughter Himanshi. He was at the protest site on June 8, when his wife, Rekha, returned from her maternal home, where she had delivered her daughter. He left hours before I arrived, she says. His four-year-old son Rudra jumps around the house before coming back to play with his sister.Ghanshyam had enrolled Rudra in a private English-medium school, where the annual fee is Rs 10,000, says Ghanshyams wife Rekha.The family owns four bighas on which they grow wheat, garlic and fenugreek. Soon after Ghanshyams Class 12, he started working in their fields. The chief minister came and assured me Rs 1 crore. I told him to bring back my husband. I asked him who will take care of my children. He said the government would bear all their education expenses and give me a job, says Rekha.They killed my only son, says Durgalal.Whats in the house: A bedroom, another for the produce, and a third that doubles up as a kitchen and temple. Two cows, two buffaloes, a bull and a calf, and a dog, Kalu, in a fenced enclosure. Also, three fans and a television.That day: He and other men from the village were protesting and chanting Jai Jawan! Jai Kisan! when police caned them. He tried to run but got stuck in the fence. Police took him to the station. I later came to know they hit him on his head and throat till he fell down, Durgalal says. They came home around 3.30 that night and claimed he was injured. They told us to reach the police station at 9 am, but by then they had taken him to a hospital in Indore. By the time my father-in-law got there, he was dead, Rekha says.The Rs 1 crore: Our father went to Mandsaur to open accounts in the name of the children, says Ghanshyams sister Shamu. Some money has been transferred into the accounts but we dont know how much.Its worth: Zero. This crore is not worth my husband, says Rekha.Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand) Abhishek used to help his father Dinesh (above) in the fields (Photo: Oinam Anand)Abhishek Dinesh, 18Barkheda Panth villageSurvived by: Parents Dinesh and Alka Bai, brothers Madhusudan and Sandeep, grandparents Bhanwar Lal and Lakshmi BaiDebt: None. But this January, the family sold off 6 of their 29.5 bighas to cushion their expenses.The Family: Most mornings, Abhishek would assist in the fields before leaving for school around 11 am. He would then return to the farm by 5 pm, finally getting home late in the evening. He would also skip schools when there was a lot of work at the farm, says brother Madhusudan.In the just declared results of Class 11, Abhishek had scored 47.2 per cent. He wanted to do an agriculture course once he was done with school, says Sandeep, who is enrolled in a BBA course.The family grows soybean, wheat, bajra, corn, lentils. Over the past four to five years, the price of soybean has halved from around Rs 5,000 a quintal to around Rs 2,500 now. We also sold 52 quintals of onion for Rs 6,500 at Rs 1.25 per kg. How can a household run like this? asks father Dinesh.Whats in the house: There are logs of sal, about 1.5 feet in width, overhead, going across the roof of the rooms. Above them are bamboo poles, which hold a bamboo mat and the mud roof. Thats how the roof has been in this house since 1957, when we built it, says Abhisheks grandfather Bhanwar Lal, in his early 90s. The house has four rooms and a large hall which was renovated about three years ago, apart from a kitchen.That day: He had gone to the protests as he was curious others from the village were also going, says mother Alka Bai. Everyone goes to protest if the cause is genuine, adds grandfather Bhanwar Lal.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred into the accounts of Abhisheks parents. They first plan to buy back the land they sold earlier this year. They also want to buy more property and reinforce their well. Brother Sandeep will get the government job. Relatives have also been turning up frequently. I learnt of Abhisheks death today (a week after the incident) and came running, says Ramesh Chand Patidar, a relative.Its worth: The Rs 1 crore can cultivate their 23 bighas nearly 72 times over. It takes Rs 6,000 roughly to cultivate a bigha of land, says Dinesh.Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand) Babloos mother had an hysterectomy operation a month ago (Photo: Oinam Anand)Poonamchand Patidar alias Babloo, 23Takrawad villageSurvived by: Wife Anita, mother Durga Bai and sister GirijaDebt: Rs 4 lakh in unpaid home loans and about a couple of lakh more in agricultural dues for labour, seed and manure purchase, and tractor rent, among others. The family also paid Rs 50,000 for a hysterectomy operation that Babloos mother had over a month ago.The Family: With their savings and some loans, Babloos father Jagdish Ram and uncle Bala Ram built the two-storey house that Babloo lived in with wife Anita, mother Durga Bai, uncle Bala Ram and cousin Dasrath. His father had passed away in January last year, after which he dropped out of college and married Anita. The house, with eight rooms, was built two years ago, when the family enjoyed better times.Babloo inherited his fathers eight bigha on which he grew wheat, coriander, garlic and chickpeas. He also helped out on his uncles farm. We sold a quintal each of wheat for Rs 1,100, coriander for Rs 4,000, fenugreek for Rs 1,500 and garlic for Rs 3,000. Over a year ago, the rates were Rs 2,000, Rs 7,000, Rs 4,000 and Rs 8,000, says Bala Ram, who too owns eight bighas. So while he spent Rs 96,000 on the farm, he made only about Rs 60,000 last year, he adds. Moreover, the cheques against payments take over a month to be cleared, says cousin Dasrath. When not in the fields, Babloo used to repair vehicles, especially vans, to make ends meet.Whats in the house: The house is mostly empty. A crib dangles in the middle of one of the rooms.That day: Around 150 youth from our village went to protest. Police shot at a few of them from close range. He was among those hit. Villagers told us police shot him on the road. The villagers rushed him to a hospital in Mandsaur on a motorcycle but he died on the way, says Babloos uncle Bala Ram.The Rs 1 crore: The money has been transferred to a joint account opened in the names of Babloos mother and wife. The heavy dose of drugs after her operation has left Babloos mother with mental troubles, says Bala Ram. Babloos wife Anita has left for her maternal home and will return soon, he says. Sister Girija Bai too shows little interest in money matters and so, it for Bala Ram and his son Dasrath to decide. We still get notices from the bank. So we will pay that off first, says Dasrath, who dropped out of school after Class X and will get the government job.Then there are the relatives, who have not left the home since Babloos death. Will we get money? And when? Everyone only comes and takes down our names, says Babloos aunt Lakshmi. His mother Durga Bai sits expressionless.Its worth: The compensation money is 200 times the cost of his mothers operation.He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand) He had good height but never passed the Army test, says Chainarams father Ganpat Lal (Photo: Oinam Anand)Chainaram Patidar, 23Nayakheda villageSurvived by: Wife Pushpa, parents Ganpat Lal and Manju Bai, younger brother Govind, sister PavitraDebt: Only Chainaram kept a record of the expenses, so the family has little idea if they had any loans, though they say he used to borrow from the cooperative society. If there is any debt, they dont know about it as no one has approached them yet.The Family: Chainarams two-room house is one of about a dozen small houses  mostly of his uncles and cousins  that lie on either side of a narrow lane within Nayakheda village.The family owns two bighas on which they grow wheat and soybean. When not on the fields, Chainaram would, like his daily-wager father, go looking for work.Keen on joining the Army, as a couple of village youths are in the forces, Chainaram began applying around five years ago, after he turned 18. He had good height and could run quite a bit. He cleared the physical test thrice but would always be ruled out in the medical tests; his left eye was weak, says father Ganpat, 43. On April 29 this year, Chainaram married Pushpa. She is still dazed and barely speaks.Whats in the house: A cooking stove and gas cylinder, an earthen pot and utensils. The family sleeps on the floor under the only ceiling fan in the house, which has to be prodded with a stick for it to start rotating.That day: The family says he had gone to the protest, but just to look. Villagers said he had been hit on his leg. It was only the next day that we were told he was hit on his head, says sister Pavitra.The Rs 1 crore: The money will be divided among 4-5 people, says Ganpat. There are Ganpats brothers  Rameshwar, Balu Ram, Paras Ram  and his cousins, all of whom, he says, will receive a share of the crore. Also, neighbours Mangilal, 61, and Phool Chand, 72, who have lent a shoulder. But Ganpat doesnt know how it will be divided. I am uneducated. Chainarams uncle Bharat does all the work, he has all the documents. We will all sit and divide the money soon, he says.Its worth: The compensation is 376 times the value of his familys wheat production. Last year, they produced 19 quintals of wheat and sold half of it for Rs 1,400 a quintal.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Now you have to choose the nicer among all the nice shaped, clean, fresh-smelling onions and that is SO DIFFICULT. E3 2017 (the big gaming conference), was a basket of good onions.The first and best onion was the announcement of Xbox One X  the most powerful console for 4k gaming, after the PS4 of course. BioWares Anthem showcased their pre-alpha gameplay for the new Xbox. Set in a post-apocalyptic world with a jungle-like environment, there are giant monsters with steely exoskeletons, and built-in weather-dynamic events in the high-res game (many are less impressed, calling it a new Destiny game).Another important onion was the Assassins Creed Origins gameplay trailer, which has taken a completely different leap of faith this time round  one that could possibly involve sliding down a pyramid. In Origins, the game seems to have returned to its roots, unadulterated and completely stealth based like it was with Altair. Eagle vision here, is quite literal  the lead character has a pet eagle that does the necessary scouting needed to plan and execute the stealthiest assassinating strategy. Integrating close combat in an open-world with scenic accuracy, AC might just release another great hit without diluting its story.Spider-man is soon to be out for the PS4. Despite it being a mainstream franchise, its hard to look away from the awesome of the Spider-man gameplay  and his superpower seems so conducive for the perfect stealth game! Its easy to forget the various atypical uses of a strong spider web  destroying helicopters and gliding between buildings.Nintendos Metroid game announcement may be important to a few, but then Id miss out on picking the final onion that has zombies in it  Days Gone. After months of speculation, we get a taste of the open-world shooter with a lot of motorbike riding on apocalyptic dirt roads. The game is survival, stealth, close combat zombie killing and evil-human bashing, and bike racing in one.There were many more exciting announcements doubtless, but somewhere at the bottom of the onion pile. Lets hope the announcements have as many layers of depth as the onions."

The price of small onion (shallots) has gone up leaving many consumers confined to window shopping the item in the last fortnight. Likewise, carrot and beans too are no less cheap.The price of shallots which was hovering around Rs. 50 to Rs. 80 per kg till a month ago, crossed the Rs. 100 mark and is steadily moving up at Rs. 110 to Rs. 120 in Madurai, while it is Rs. 120 in Dindigul uzhavar sandhai and costlier by Rs. 10 at Thoothukudi shandy, where the price was Rs. 130.According to officials in the agriculture and horticulture departments in southern districts, the prevailing dry spell has forced many farmers to stay away from growing vegetables.Those who have their own source of water for irrigation alone were growing vegetables.When we are struggling to provide drinking water, where is the question of getting water for irrigation, Collectors in many southern districts shared with The Hindu on the dwindling storage level in reservoirs.It is not just the farmers output that has dipped, but even footfall of customers in markets.At BB Kulam uzhavar sandhai in Madurai, on an average, 130 to 150 farmers register themselves and sell their produce daily.There has been a dip in this number by 10% to 20%. Only on weekends, customers crowd the market, the supervisory staff at the shandy say and add that from 1,000 to 1,500 customers, the number has come down drastically to around 500 in the last 10 days.The price of shallot alone is not rising. There are some other vegetables, prices of which are on a steady rise, officials say. In Dindigul and Thoothukudi, the price of Bellary onions revolve around Rs. 20 to Rs. 40 per kg. Prices of carrot, beans and drumstick have gone up by 30% in the last 30 days.Cooperative storesTo check prices in check, 18 months back, the late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa opened vegetable stores across the State.People feel that since these stores did serve the lower and middle class people well, the government should continue to sell essential vegetables at subsidised prices so that the consumers can tide over the crisis. With marriage season coming, the prices of vegetables are only set to move upward and farmers say the price of shallots may touch Rs. 200 soon.Now, only on weekends, customers crowd the marketStaffUzhavar sandhai"

There are a few unresolved issues, which will be discussed and sorted later. Also, the government must address the others demands made by the farmers without wasting time, Pawar.The NCP chief insisted that the BJP government must implement recommendations of Swaminathan Commission to rid farmers across India of their financial woes.The BJP had promised this in its election manifesto, while Narendra Modi had assured it in all his election rallies, Pawar said.Pointing out that it has been two years since the state formed an Agriculture Price Commission, Pawar said the commission will ensure implementation of minimum support price to farmers.He also drew attention to the plight of onion and tur farmers across Maharashtra. Pawar said onion farmers were facing hardships as the price bottomed because of a bumper crop, while the government had stopped purchasing tur.We need to export both the items and farmers needed financial assistance to do so. The decision to waive farm loan will backfire if the state fails to address this issue in time, he said.BOXSymbolic electionSharad Pawar described the upcoming election between NDA nominee Ramnath Kovind and Opposition nominee Meira Kumar as symbolic. He said the electoral arithmetic was in favour of the NDA candidate and the outcome was a forgone conclusion. But it is democracy and we need to fight the election, he added. Pawar also clarified that he was never interested in the post."

Dr. Ajit Navale, member of the committee, said, The scheme has an upper limit of Rs. 1.5 lakh. So if a farmer has an outstanding loan above it, he would not benefit from it. It is not in line with our demand of blanket loan waiver. A meeting will be held in Nashik on July 9 and the committee will launch a Sangharsh Yatra (protest campaign) against the government, which will end on July 23. Dr. Navale said, We will hold a State-wide agitation on July 26 as our demands have not been addressed by the government.Meanwhile, National Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar said on Sunday that the farm loan waiver announced by the Devendra Fadnavis-led Bharatiya Janata Party government was not wholly satisfactory. However, Mr. Pawar said his party would support the Maharashtra government and play a constructive role in providing relief to debt-ridden farmers.The Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Krishi Sanman Yojana will write off debt up to Rs. 1.5 lakh per farmer (from the previous ceiling of Rs. 1 lakh). The scheme is expected to benefit 89 lakh farmers: 40 lakh will become debt-free; the remaining 49 lakh will be provided relief. Mr. Pawar said, This is the governments first step towards alleviating debt-ridden farmers. It is too soon for us [the NCP] to say whether it is effective or not but the ground reality is that a section of farmer leaders are already dissatisfied with the governments proposals.The NCP chief said that the government had written off-debts up to Rs. 1.5 lakh for the period between April 1, 2012 and June 2016. It ought to have done so till June 2017, Mr. Pawar said.He said that the partys second and long-term demand would be to seek the implementation of the recommendations of the M.S. Swaminathan Committee to make agriculture viable and stable. Mr. Pawar said, It is high time the Centre seriously considers implementing it. The government was aware that there would be a record production of tur dal this year, yet it did not lift the ban on the export of pulses.Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray during his tour in Nashik district said the loan waiver put forward by its coalition ally was unsatisfactory. He said, The farm loan waiver is historic, but it is not satisfactory. We will continue to demand the implementation of the Swaminathan committees recommendations, including fair prices for onion farmers and waiving debts till June 2017.The farm loan waiver is historic, but it is not satisfactoryUddhav ThackerayShiv Sena president"

On Wednesday, Union finance minister Arun Jaitley gave no immediate assurance to state finance minister Sudhir Mungantiwar, who called on him on this issue in New Delhi.Mungantiwar sought Jaitleys intervention to direct the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to allow nationalised banks to lend the state government Rs34,000 crore with a staggered repayment schedule over four years so that it can repay farmers loans. He also requested Jaitley to increase the cap on the states open market borrowing by Rs15,000 crore, over and above the existing limit of Rs35,000 crore, putting the state government in a position to raise funds for the waiver.According to information, Jaitley asked Mungantiwar to deal with the RBI for the loans and staggered repayment.The state government will have to deal with the RBI for the loans at a lower rate and their deferred schedule of the repayment. With permission to borrow and additional Rs15,000 crore, we can manage to raise Rs34,000 crore, Mungantiwar told HT.The state plans to shift the old loans that have been borrowed at a high rate of interest of about 10.5% to 7.5% to save about Rs40,000 crore on its outstanding loan of Rs75,000 crore from open market borrowings. The state has also requested the Centre for the waiver of the pre-clousure charges on the payment of the outstanding loans.Mungantiwar also requested Jaitley to extend the permission to export onions by three months to ensure rates in the domestic market do not fall on the backdrop of the bumper crop. Maharashtra farmers have produced 2.05 lakh metric tonnes of onion and the production is 25% more than the average. Similar rise in the production in other parts of the country has resulted in the fall in procurement rate of onion. The extension to the export permission by three months will prove beneficial to farmers in getting good procurement rate. Jaitley has assured us to positively consider the demand, Muntantiwar said.Meanwhile, the state government on Wednesday began the procedure to waive off loans by issuing government resolution (GR) notifying the eligibility of the loan waiver. The notification stated farmers who have restructured their loans between April 1, 2012 and 2015-16 and have become defaulters till June 30, 2016 will be eligible for the waiver of up to Rs1.50 lakh per farmer. It has also clarified farmers seeking the benefit of a one-time settlement of their outstanding more than the waiver limit of Rs1.50 lakh, will have to first pay of the remaining amount to seek the benefit.It has reiterated that except Class-IV employees, the families of the government servants, legislators, ex legislators, corporators and the members of cooperative sugar factories, district cooperative banks, cooperative milk unions will not be eligible for the loan waiver. The government has defined the family of farmers as husband, wife and children below 18 years. This means the nuclear families of the farmers will be separately entitled for the waiver.Read more:Farm loan waiver: Maharashtra to seek Centres help to raise 34,022 crore from banksMaharashtra readies game plan for farm loan waiver"

But luckily she had passed on her green genes and he happily gave up his play area for more plants. ""In fact, he was the one who tended to the plants,"" recalls Yashoda.Yashodas grandparents are into agriculture, so it wasn't too surprising that this Higher Grade Assistant in Life Insurance Corporation of India at Hyderabad took to gardening like a fish takes to water. Her favourite colour is green and her special hangout spot is her garden in her two-storeyed home at ECIL crossroads.Although as a child she kept moving towns and shifting homes owing to her dad's transferable job, her bond with plants remained unchanged.It has been five years since they moved to ECIL, and she is happy that she has her own independent home where she can plant all that she wants. Her teenage kids Navya and Teja and her husband Prasad also lend a helping hand.She credits her family and the Facebook group called Intipanta for helping her stay green. The Facebook group, she says, is a support group that suggests techniques for house gardening, watering and maintenance.Her terrace is a verdant space, with a wooden plank that supports climbing creepers and hanging pots. Softdrink bottles and plastic takeaway containers that typically end up as garbage in most houses get a dash of paint and become little homes for plants. The sweet smell of flowers mingles with the fragrance from a lighted agarbathi after the morning puja, instantly transporting you into a different natural world.The terrace hosts various plants such as crotons, cactii, vegetables and leafy vegetables.Through Intipanta, an initiative of the horticulture society, Yashoda has received seeds from gardeners in other states. Rita Borgali from Ludhiana sent me the seeds of pink lillies, Preethi from Bengaluru sent cactus varieties and Shridhar Thillai Rajan sent jasmine from Kerala, says Yashoda.She has over 500 plants in her garden. Roses, hibiscus and chrysanthemums in multiple colours take your breath away. Her garden also boasts of bittergourd, cucumber, brinjal, capsicum, cabbage, cauliflower, ginger, onion plants and almost all the leafy vegetables, so that she does not have to visit the grocery store often. Every alternate day, her family members take turns to water the plants. Sundays are all about cleaning it inside out and easily consumes half a day.With the whole garden spread across the penthouse and roof, it is tough to maintain it especially when it rains heavily through the monsoon. However, I collect water and protect them from the insects I never use artificial pesticides. Instead I use kitchen waste, butter milk, neem oil, wood ash and so on, which works as a great natural manure, she says. When she comes back home after work and puts her feet up with a cup of coffee, all the effort seems totally worth it, she says."

(Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas) Grape farmer Santosh Gorade at his vineyard in Niphad near Nashik, Maharashtra. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)Last kharif, the Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank (NDCCB) disbursed Rs 1,608.55 crore of crop loans during April-June, exceeding its target of Rs 1,257.18 crore. This season, however, it has given out a mere Rs 61.41 crore as on June 27, way below even a lower target of Rs 1,101.05 crore.NDCCB could be an extreme case of a beleaguered cooperative bank. But across Maharashtra, total kharif crop loan disbursements by DCCBs have been just Rs 5,707.42 crore from April to June 27 this year. That is barely 55 per cent of the Rs 10,451.77 crore lent out during April-June 2016.The above collapse of cooperative credit is an ongoing story of Maharashtras agriculture, at a time when waiver of past loans is whats grabbing the headlines. And its effects are being felt right now in the fields, as kharif agricultural operations gather pace with the state receiving 13 per cent above-normal monsoon rains so far.For Santosh Garade, between May and the month almost ending, there should have been at least four rounds of pruning (removal of thread-like tendrils growing from the main branches) at his four-acre vineyard. But this grape farmer from Takli village in Nashik districts Niphad taluka hasnt managed to do a single pruning  necessary for the crops proper flowering from September-October, followed by fruit development and harvesting towards February-March.The beleaguered Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas) The beleaguered Nashik District Central Cooperative Bank. (Source: Express photo by Partha Sarathi Biswas)My total investment requirement during May-July, for six rounds of pruning along with application of fertiliser, fungicide and micronutrients, is about Rs 50,000 per acre. I am unable to raise that working capital today from either NDCCB or Bank of Maharashtra. And I have no money of my own left, says Gorade.The 34-year-old suffered huge losses from his 2016-17 grape and onion crops grown on four acres and two acres, respectively. The 70-quintals average yield from onions, which fetched Rs 300 per quintal, did not cover his cultivation cost of Rs 35,000 per acre. Gorades vineyard, likewise, yielded 60 quintals of grapes per acre. At Rs 15/kg, there was no way his investment of Rs 2 lakh per acre could even be recovered, leave alone generate a return.The credit crunch that farmers like Gorade are experiencing  that too, in what looks to be a good monsoon year  comes even as the Maharashtra government has come out with a Rs 34,022-crore loan waiver scheme. The Devendra Fadnavis administrations decision to waive individual farm loans of up to Rs 1.5 lakh taken from cooperative and commercial banks  plus the direction given to extend Rs 10,000 in cash as an immediate advance  does not radically alter the picture.The loan waiver is of no use to me, as I have outstanding dues of Rs 4 lakh with the Bank of Maharashtra, notes Gorade. Nor does a Rs 10,000 cash loan help somebody growing a crop entailing much more investment than bajra (pearl millet) or soyabean. Gorade is, moreover, not eligible to receive this special loan, since the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is yet to give the nod for extending it to defaulting farmers.Gorade is planning to mortgage his tractor to obtain credit from private moneylenders. If I am a defaulter with Bank of Maharashtra and the NDCCB has no money to lend, what option does a farmer like me have? My immediate priority is to somehow ensure a decent grape crop and hope for better prices. In 2014-15 and 2015-16, I realised Rs 60-70 per kg, but both were drought years. Last years crop was good, but prices crashed, he adds.In the neighbouring village of Kotamgaon in Niphad, Sanjay More has mortgaged his wifes jewellery to borrow money for sowing soyabean and maize on his two acres. More has an outstanding loan of Rs 70,000 from the NDCCB. The Rs 1.5 lakh waiver should technically make him free from institutional debts. But the problem is that the NDCCB itself has no money to lend now. In the last two years, I have taken loans totalling Rs 1 lakh from moneylenders. I have had to knock at their doors this time as well. The loan waiver has no meaning for me, he points out. Like Gorade, Mores hopes are pinned on a good crop  and better prices.For most Maharashtra farmers, drying up of institutional finance for kharif farming operations is whats really hurting, even while political and media attention is on loan waivers. At the start of every crop season, farmers avail of short-term crop loans from commercial and cooperative banks. These are extended at a subsidised interest rate of 7 per cent interest, and go towards purchase of seed fertiliser and pesticides, and also paying for labour.For the current kharif season, Maharashtra has set a crop loan target of Rs 40,547.20 crore, of which Rs 24,985.01 crore is to come from commercial banks, Rs 13,108.38 crore from DCCBs and the balance Rs 2,453.82 crore from regional rural banks. The cooperatives are the ones that reach out to small and marginal farmers, with their average loan size being much less compared to that of scheduled commercial banks.The current credit crunch is largely about DCCBs  their inability to lend, particularly after demonetisation. Just three days after the November 8 decision to withdraw all existing Rs 500 and Rs 1000 denomination currency, these banks were barred by the RBI from both accepting and exchanging the outlawed notes. The official reason given was that they did not have fool-proof KYC (know-your-customer) verification systems in place, making them potential avenues for illicit cash deposits.As a result, the DCCBs in Maharashtra alone were saddled with Rs 4,311.79 crore of old notes deposited during the three days, which they couldnt exchange for new re-monetised currency. The NDCCB alone had Rs 342.60 crore of such notes. If we could neither exchange the old notes nor earn interest on those deposits, from where was the money to come for disbursal of fresh crop loans?, asks Narendra Darade, chairman of the bank. The DCCBs were further hit because of farmers not being able to repay loans following the price crash across crops  for which, too, Darade laid the blame on demonetisation. On June 20, the Union government finally announced that cooperative banks would be allowed to exchange the demonetised notes with the RBI. But the latter is yet to issue directions to DCCBs on the modalities of such exchange.The ultimate loser from all this has been the farmer, who suffered from low prices following demonetisation. Now, he is suffering from an unprecedented credit crunch even in a normal monsoon year.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The social media was taken by storm on Sunday with food aficionados posting pictures of varieties of Biryani and Pulao on their social media handles across India. Amongst cities like Goa, Mumbai, Chennai, Bangalore etc. Indoreans too observed the day by coming together for a potluck supper. Amit Pamnani, a city based Chef who had invited foodies over for a potluck at his residence shares, ""The idea behind the event was to showcase Indian food to the world. Internationally, people celebrate food days like World Cheesecake Day, World French Fries day, World Nutella Day, Cheeseburger Day etc. Similarly, Rushina Munshaw Ghildiyal thought of marking Indian food days to pay tribute to foods, dishes and ingredients that are Indian. Following the suit we are trying to elevate Indian food to the same level. We already had a few food days in the past recently like Pickle Masala Day, where people came together and made pickles together. On Biryani day, we made biryani as per our styles, some were signature recipes of grandmothers and some tasted authentically like Mughlai Biryani.""It was double the celebration as the day was observed on the onset of Eid and Biryani is synonymous to the festival. Food reviewer Belly Kanungo feels, ""The day gave us a chance to soak-in the Eid spirit. Initially, we had thought of having a potluck but eventually it turned out to be an elaborate Eid celebration as we had mutton Biryanis, chicken Biryanis, egg and cheese Pulao, different types of Raitas - veg, cucumber and plain authentic Raita along with some onion salad from eight different kitchens. Each Biryani tasted different from one another. There was dum Biryani which had layers of rice, Masala chicken and toppings of Kesar rice and caramelised onions that tasted absolutely like an authentic Biryani of a Mughlai restaurant. There was mutton and chicken masala pulao-biryani that tasted perfectly like how we Indoris like to eat - full of spices and Masala.""Food aficionado, Rakesh Dawani adds, ""Though, there have been debates on the difference between Biryani and Pulao but one thing is common between both these irresistible dishes that they bind foodies together. The celebration was given a pause with a dollop of Sheer-Khurma.""Indore has been seeing a lot of youngsters choosing to organise potluck dinners on occasions like Easters and even for Iftar. Shivam Anand, a 20 year old engineering student who replicated his grandma's recipe to make egg-pulao for the day is of the opinion, ""It is only because of potluck that we got to savour eight different kinds of Biryanis in a single day. Potlucks are fun and gives us ideas to experiment with different dishes in our kitchens. Indore is known for its food and such sessions are only taking the city forward as like-minded people get to meet under one roof and talk about food.""For Satyajeet David, a city based chef, Biryani means ""Celebrating - The Royal Way"". He shares, ""A day dedicated and celebrated as #PulaoBiryaniDay in India is indeed very inspiring not only for Chefs but all foodies. I appreciate the thought to embark an occasion like this once in a year. It was a memorable experience being a part of this celebration in Indore where we relished different flavours of Biryanis and Pulao. I am looking forward to celebrating this day every year henceforth. We (food Connoisseurs of Indore) are in talking to come up with more such days to celebrate the essence of Indian food."""

After remaining stable till a few weeks ago, tomato prices rapidly increased at Rs 50 per kg in the wholesale markets. Vendors purchase a 25-kg tomato case for Rs 600 and sell native tomatoes at Rs 40 per kg. Tomatoes of higher quality are sold at Rs 50 a kg.However, retailers who buy the same case at Rs 600, sell tomatoes at Rs 65 a kg at Anna Nagar and Kilpauk. The price is high for the past two days. It was at Rs 24 a kg and now it has reached Rs 56. I have cut down on the quantity, says V Nagalakshmi.Supply is less. As tomatoes come from Andhra and Karnataka, the climate there also matters to cultivate crops. Excess rain or heat, both can damage the growth of tomato plants, says Ambedkar V, a vendor.Wholesale markets at Porur and Kilpauk were closed on Friday and those that were open wore a deserted look. With tomato prices on the high, the wholesale price of onion seemed decent. It was sold at Rs 13 a kg in wholesale and Rs 20 a kg in retail.Some retail shops at Anna Nagar sold onion at Rs 80 a kg.Onions and potatoes are being sold at Rs 20 a kg.

The recent hike in prices of onion and other vegetables was an example, he said.The Central government should take decisive steps to end this crisis instead of fooling the public with empty promises, he said."

SIVA SARAVANANUnion Minister for Railways Suresh Prabhakar Prabhu on Sunday said that the three Dedicated Freight Corridors (DFC) planned by the Railways will provide logistics support for the Make in India campaign. One of the DFCs will have connectivity to the south aiding freight movement from southern States and two of the three DFCs will be completed in the next three years.The southern States will significantly benefit from the DFC. In a way, DFCs will completely criss-cross the country boosting freight movement. If Make in India has to succeed, we will have to develop a huge backbone of infrastructure for the logistics, said Mr. Prabhu at the launch of various passenger amenities for Coimbatore, Thudiyalur, Periyanaickenpalayam and Tirupur railway stations.Once DFC is a reality, it would reduce traffic on passenger train networks, increasing speed and inclusion of new services.Stating that income from freight was on a declining trend in the last two years, Mr. Prabhu said that freight rates will be reduced soon. Of the 10 products that are the mainstay of Railways income, two-third comes from the freight.According to the Minister, the Railways also plans to introduce services to benefit farmers. The Railways, with the support of Container Corporation of India, helped farmers transport onion from Maharashtra. He hinted Railways plans to start cold storage chains in stations to support farmers for transporting agriculture produces.Mr. Prabhu said that increasing the speed of trains will be a priority. As part of this, Rs. 18,000 core will be spent to increase speed of trains to 200 kmph on important lines such as Bombay-Delhi and Delhi-Kolkata. Increasing speed of services between Bengaluru and Chennai is also under consideration.Only 42 % of railway lines are currently electrified which will be doubled in the next five years. All meter gauges will be converted into broad gauges. Increasing speed, augmenting capacity and bringing in new avenues of growth are areas Railways currently working on, said Mr. Prabhu.The budget allocation for Tamil Nadu increased in the last three years. Now, Tamil Nadu is getting a share of 170 % more than what the State was getting three years ago. While the share was only Rs. 878 crore from 2009-10 to 2013-14, it has gone up to Rs. . 2,300 crore now. In a matter of three years, a change of Government at the Centre made the result, said Mr. Prabhu."

There is no definite cause for the increase, with middlemen at Vashi APMC blaming ambiguous causesfrom November's demonetisation to the farmers' strike in June as well as ""inclement weather"".Contrary to traders' claims there is no visible shortage either. Good quality, robust red tomatoes are available at all markets in Mumbai. Curiously, retail rates are rising even as wholesale rates continue to fall.APMC trader Shyam Yadav said, ""Wholesale rates rose to Rs 55-60 per kg over Friday-Saturday. On Monday, they dropped to Rs 36-40. Let us see what happens tomorrow.""Conversely, retail rates were Rs 35-40 per kg over Friday-Saturday, perhaps due to leftover stocks, which spiralled to Rs 60-80 Monday as retailers charged their pound of flesh. ""I bought half a kilo for Rs 30 to tide over the next two days. But how long can we continue like this?"" said Andheri resident Shaila Grover.Tomato is a household staple without which no meal is complete. Moreover, Shravan observances are set to begin on July 10 for north Indian communities and July 24 for Maharashtrians and Gujaratis. During this time families avoid onion and garlic and rely on tomato.One of the largest middlemen in the tomato trade at APMC Vashi, Javed Memon, cited a slew of reasons which seemed tough to swallow. ""This price increase is an outcome of notebandi. Recently there was also the farmers' strike in Maharashtra. Moreover, I am told the seeds have failed in south India. So this season we are relying on tomatoes from Maharashtra where a heat wave has beset certain growing areas. Also, remember that farmers have not been getting a good rate for their produce since the past year and a half. It is time they made some money.""Asked when customers would get relief, Memon said, ""Don't think of customers. Why think of customers alone, think of the farmer as well."" TOI asked if farmers were getting good rates at present. ""Well, not to their satisfaction. After all, the quality of their tomatoes is poor,"" the middleman said, adding prices would remain high till end-August.Mumbai receives its quota of tomato from cultivated areas in Karnataka, as well as Satara, Sangli and Narayangaon in Pune."

They also raised slogans against the State and Union governments for not completely waiving farm loans.The agitators alleged that the State government has done injustice to a majority of farmers in the State by waiving co-operative loans only up to Rs. 50,000. Farmers who have taken loans above Rs. 50,000 from co-operative and nationalised banks are suffering as they have not received crop loss compensation amount for 2016. They are yet to receive compensation for onion and other crop loss in the last two years, he added.They also demanded that immediate steps should be taken to waive all loans taken by farmers in the State. They said that farmers should be given new loans for agriculture and other purposes. Steps should be taken to fix scientific prices for agriculture produce and seeds and fertilizers should be given free to all farmers, they added.The agitators submitted a memorandum to Chief Minister Siddaramaiah through Deputy Commissioner Srirangaiah and said that the agitation would be intensified if the government fails to take immediate steps to fulfil their demands."

Also, there are three railway port centres at Gede, Radhikapur and Singabad. Over Rs 25 crore worth of goods are transported through these ports daily. Bulk of the export to Bangladesh comprises stone chips, boulders, fly ash, onion, fruits and spices.Movement of trucks have been severely affected with exporters unable to furnish their GST registration. In addition, land port stations are yet to be equipped with basic infrastructure like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system.Though the GST regime began on Saturday, problems surfaced on Sunday when trucks started plying after the Eid holiday in Bangladesh. Uzzwal Saha, secretary of West Bengal Exporters' Coordination Committee, said many exporters were unable to provide the GST registration number because they had not received it yet.Also, apart from Petrapole, none of the land port centres has EDI. As a result, Customs is refusing to pass the goods. ""We had repeatedly requested the Centre to improve the infrastructure before introducing GST. But no one paid heed,"" Saha said.Samir Ghosh, an exporter at Mahadipur, said most of the goods that are currently in transit had been booked before GST was rolled out. ""Customs is refusing to clear the items without GST. At Mahdipur alone, 2,000 trucks are stranded,"" he said.Exporters fear losses to mount as some of the goods are perishables like onion and fruits that will rot if the delay is long.At the Hili border, over 1,000 trucks are held up. Ashok Mandal, an exporter in Hili, said there was no clarity on when the situation would improve. ""All are confused. We are yet to get a notification from Customs. They too are in the dark about how much tax will be levied on our items,"" he said.Though Hili has been declared an EDI port, it does not have the requisite infrastructure to transact electronically. ""We used to submit the purchase bill to the Customs after the transit. But now they are demanding it before we send the items. It really poses a major problem for us,"" said Mandal. Frustrated with the situation, a section of exporters are contemplating a strike at the ports."

Prices of almost all fresh vegetables, barring onion and potato, have increased by over 100%.Sameer Singh, a software profession, was surprised when confronted by the hike in vegetable prices. ""I had last purchased vegetables last Sunday (June 25), when prices were stable. But today, I was taken aback by vegetable prices, which have shot up by over 100%.

""We were eating lots of salad for the past few months. But with prices of cucumber, tomato and coriander rising significantly, we had to remove salad from our menu,"" said homemaker Yadav.According to traders, prices rose mainly due to contraction in supply of vegetables after the rains. Inderjeet Thakran, president of Khandsa Market Association, said, ""Supply has reduced by 40% in a week, leading to increase in prices.""""Across north India, most agricultural fields are submerged,"" said Thakran, adding prices rise every year after rains, and are expected to settle down in 2-3 weeks. ""Prices are expected to fall by this month-end. You will see correction in prices of some of the vegetables later this week itself,"" he said.He added that tomato, which had remained relatively cheap so far due to local supply, will remain costly for some time, even as prices of other vegetables come down.""Local tomato supply has ended. Currently, we're getting tomatoes from Himachal Pradesh, and supply is low. But, this happens during monsoons every year"" said Thakran, adding that from next month, tomatoes from Bengaluru and Nasik will arrive to bring down price."

""Whenever there is a long spell of rain in the state, prices increase.""He said that prices usually stabilize when water recedes from fields.He said that the state was banking on tomatoes from Maharashtra and the south because rain has washed away around 25% of crops. But steady demand was increasing prices, he said.Sources in the APMC said that the demand for the tomatoes will increase as the shravan month begins in a week for North Indians, and by the end of the month for Gujaratis and Maharashtrians. During shravan, people avoid onion and garlic and hence the demand for tomatoes and other vegetables shoots up.It is worth recalling that farmers in the state did not receive good prices for their produce earlier this year; they were forced to throw away the produce on the roads. However, Radheshyam Marwadi, a trader in Memnagar , said that prices are likely to dip later this month. But they will increase again in August and September."

In the first phase MahaFPC, the consortium of FPCs in Maharashtra, are planning to venture in the Azadpur mandi in Delhi to sell onions.The FPC movement in Maharashtra has seen much action over the last year or so. Working under the banner of MahaFPC, the FPCs had purchased more than 25,000 MT of tur last year. The FPCs had opened village-level purchase centres and had purchased the produce on behalf of the Small Farmers Agri business Consortium (SFAC).Yogesh Thorat, managing director of MahaFPC, had said that purchases by the MahaFPC had helped stabilise tur prices in the local wholesale markets.MahaFPCs move to enter traditional markets comes at a time when the state government is encouraging farmer and FPCs to explore alternate markets or to go for retail markets. Asked about their decision to go for the traditional wholesale markets, Thorat said it would be easier to be part of the wholesale chain rather than the retail markets. Onion, Thorat said, was a classic example of a produce from Maharashtra which fetches better returns in Delhi market than the local markets. We aim to directly sell the onions from Maharashtra in Delhis markets, bypassing the various intermediaries, he said.In the first phase, Thorat said, MahaFPC will be concentrating on onions and slowly venture into other fresh fruits and vegetables. On an average, the Azadpur market sees the arrival of around 100-115 trucks of onions and in the next two years, we aim to corner at least 20 per cent of the arrival, he said. The wholesale trade in Azadpur and other places is mostly controlled by traders who purchase produce mostly in Maharashtra.The ground level procurement, sorting and grading will be done by the FPCs, while MahaFPC will act as facility coordinator. A Nashik-based FPC will be venturing into the trade of onion with Thorat hoping to start the process by the end of this month. We are hopeful that we will get the grant from the state government for the same, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

A scene from the Ernakulam market on Tuesday.Thulasi KakkatThere seems to be no respite to the common man as vegetable prices in the district continue to remain largely high, with tomato, onion and carrot being especially costly.At the Ernakulam market, small onion was sold at a wholesale price of Rs. 90 per kg and a retail price of Rs. 100 whereas tomato and carrot were sold at Rs. 52 and Rs. 60 and Rs. 55 and Rs. 60 respectively. Prices were even higher in some other markets.On an average, vegetable prices continue to be 20 per higher than what it was a month ago, though prices of some vegetables have dropped slightly, said K.K. Ashraf, vice-president, Ernakulam Market Stall Owners Association.Price of shallotsThe only relief seems to be the declining trend in the price of shallots after touching a high of Rs. 130 recently, though the ruling retail price of Rs. 100 per kg is a far cry from Rs. 65 in April. Mr. Ashraf expressed the hope that a further softening of onion prices would come about with production catching up in Tamil Nadu, the main supplier to Kerala.However, tomato and carrot prices continued to hold firm with the previous low of Rs. 20 per kg appearing to be from a distant past. Green chilli has also turned a lot spicier with the price soaring to Rs. 60 per kg from Rs. 35.The shortage of tomatoes in North India drove traders from there to the markets in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu, which in turn, took a toll on the supply to Kerala. The strike by farmers in Maharashtra didnt help either, Mr. Ashraf said.In the meantime, the Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) which aims at ensuring fair prices for farmers, was on a high over what it claimed consistently good returns for farmers. Farmers continue to auction their crops through 22 farmer markets in the district.Data collected from the wholesale markets in Aluva, Ernakulam and Perumbavoor on a daily basis by the market information centre of the VFPRCK were handed over to farmers to be used as the base price in auctioning their produce.This ensured that farmers got a price, which was even better than the market price, a senior VFPCK official said.Asked whether better price for farmers automatically resulted in higher prices for consumers, the official said that it was beyond the mandate of the VFPCK and had to be addressed by the government through market intervention measures."

I started my career in Bengaluru, where my brother also worked as a chef. He taught me all about food. After having spent five years in Bengaluru, I moved to Chennai. I have been working at Chap Chay, The Raintree Hotel, for about six months now.I have been exposed to different varieties of food since my childhood. I have always understood and loved different cuisines and flavours. My brother and the chefs I have worked with in the last 12 years have inspired me. Every place that I have been trained in, I have learned and mastered a different cuisine under some of the best chefs. From Mumbai I learnt Japanese cuisine, a couple of Thai dishes from Bengaluru, from Chennai I learnt a lot of Chinese dishes and from Kolkata I picked up a couple of Cantonese dishes. So every place has made me a better chef and has taught me a lot. My specialities however are my Japanese, Chinese and Thai food.Each cuisine stands apart in terms of authentic flavouring. For example, we use a lot of tangy flavours in Shanghai food and in Cantonese and Chinese dishes we use very little spice. But we adjust the flavours as per the taste of the customers. In Chennai, people prefer more spices and tanginess, so even the authentic Chinese flavours have to be changed.I think my best and also my favourite dishes are dimsums. I also did a dimsum festival at the hotel recently. I love experimenting with dimsums and create new flavours. Broccoli and cheese dimsums, scallop and prawn dimsums, pork bun dimsum, beef dimsums are some of my most favourite varieties. I try out different varieties because nowadays people look for new and unique flavours.I have received a lot of appreciation for my broccoli and cheese dimsums. Mostly people prefer their dimsums with a dip, so I tried a couple of varieties with the kind of dips too. I tried four kinds of dips keeping in mind the kind of flavours and taste that guests want  spring onion and garlic, tangy chilli sauce, roasted sesame sauce and tomato and onion cold sauce."

The teachers and principal are trying to get the onion removed, Class 4 student Bharti told Hindustan Times.Teachers in the school allege that the district administration authorities got the entire produce of onions dumped at the school ground.I asked the officials to at least cover the mound with gravel or sand but they did not listen to us.

Most of the residents have locked themselves in their houses due to the smell, said local resident Pushpendra Payak.Sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) BB Gangele said there must have be a miscommunication as there was no order to dump the rotten onion near a residential area or a school.

Hailing from the US, my Indian food experience was limited by both ignorance of the various dishes, and price point. Indian food in the U.S. is priced relatively high and often altered to better suit our bland-preferring palates. Adding to that was my general anxiety in asking what exactly an item such as palak paneer is.To celebrate my introduction to the local cuisine, a colleague took me on a mini-food tour. On our way to the first stop of the day, a vendor on a bicycle pulled up beside us with a rusty metal pot sitting on his back seat. She called him over and asked me if I wanted to try some. Inside the pot was a whitish fluid sloshing around, with no protection from the old pot. I asked what it was, and she responded with a word I fail to recollect. A sip of the drink and I got a slight cucumber taste. Its a drink made from curd, she said. I immediately gave the rest of the drink to her.We arrived at Murugan Idli Shop, Besant Nagar in time for lunch. Employees were still placing seats at tables in the far room, so we sat by the front window. Two sheets of banana leaf were placed on our table. Then the food came.A server ladled three globs of chutney onto our leaf, followed by two idli cakes  one plain and one covered in what I would discover to be a red spicy powder surely taken from the center of an active volcano. My colleague also ordered sweet pongal  essentially a kind of rice pudding  to help comfort my buring taste buds. The different chutneys  orange, white and brown  added a savoury, slightly spicy flavor that also helped mask the red powder. The idli itself was surprisingly soft and paired well with the chutney. The meal ended with a hefty serving of onion dosa, which I would describe as a sort of onion flapjack, but Ive never been a fan of onion dishes.Hours later, the two of us stopped at GSS Restaurant for some dinner. I was once again unaware of what exactly she would order. The first dish placed on our table contained what I would describe as six egg-shaped bread pouches filled with potato and onion, and two small bowls of broth. This, I was told, was pani puri. I immediately made the connection between the dish and soup dumplings, a Chinese delicacy which contains soup.On my first attempt to eat the pani puri, the shell cracked and spilled soup down my face. My second attempt was better, and the food was simple but delicious. Afterwards, we were served pav bhaji, a fast food dish originating from Maharashtra, India. The dish had vegetable curry served with two bread rolls still stuck to each other, and a side bowl filled with carrots and onion slices. It was as simple a dish as they come, but once again delicious without the overwhelming spices Id encountered multiple times already.Since then, Ive branched out and tried new dishes, from the simpler aloo methi to Indian Subway (the main takeaway where nearly every sandwich is spicy). Ive tasted the sour drink restaurants call buttermilk, despite the major difference with the substance I knew back home.Most likely my favorite discovery so far is the childrens drink, rose milk. When I read that item on a menu, my first question was why anyone would make a drink out of roses, or how you would even milk a rose. I was shocked to find that rose milk is actually surprisingly sweet and tastes very similar to strawberry milk. Lets just say if you want to get to know me better, lets have a chat over a cup of rose."

He writes about chunks of meat prepared in roast form on fire spits. Henceforth, the juicy, succulent and spicy has travelled from a soldiers fire pit finding its place on Turkish tables, Iranian gatherings and in courtyards of Indian households.And what better way to celebrate this wonder food than to savour it at the select restaurants of the city while cool raindrops sluice their way through frosty windowpane. Select your choice from our listing below:Chicken Tangdi KebabThe leg-pieces of the chicken are well-marinated with curd and condiments overnight that make the fibres juicy when you pick a bite with fresh, warm qaboos. Your gastronomic joy doubles up when you dip your morsel into a bowlful of green chutney and tuck rings of an onion and there you go with the blast of flavours in your mouth. We recommend Deccan Restaurant, Somajiguda. The price is also cool, I220 for four pieces. What more can you ask for.Mutton ShikampuriShikam means womb in Persian, and true to its name this delicate kebab offers you a treasure as you scoop its belly with your spoon.

Served with dahi chutney, its taste is just heavenly. Try it at Chichas, Lakdi Ka Pul. Price: I199Chicken Peshawari KebabIt comes both in bone and boneless form and has an interesting piece of history attached to it. In earlier ages, Persian and Turk soldiers used to roast meat on fire that hung from their swords. It had to be eaten immediately as the troops kept moving. In our times, the restaurants have been doing a good job. At the newly opened restaurant Mashaal, these are prepared with cheese, herbs and cream. The spices dont go to the bone, but nonetheless make the fibres delicious. Price: I280Murgh Banno KebabSavour it at Kebab Stories, the rooftop restaurant of Zaiqa-e-Hyderabad. Its a boneless chicken delicacy prepared with yellow chilies, curd, roasted gram powder, and slow cooked in tandoor. And no thats not the end, it goes for another round of cooking i.e., the pieces are coated with beaten eggs and roasted on hot charcoals. No wonder, it lives up to its royal Nawabi name. Price: I345"

Now, a month and half after commissioning of the pack house, it has gone haywire damaging thousands of bags of onion which were stored in it.Sources said a high-level meeting is scheduled to be held in Bhubaneswar among officials of Agriculture department, Apicol and district administration on the fate of onion growers whose crop has been damaged. The snag has exposed the apathy of the State Government towards providing infrastructure and promoting onion cultivation.Under Titilagarh sub-division, known as Nashik of Odisha, onion is grown on 20,000 hectares (ha) in Titilagarh, Muribahal and Bangomunda blocks. In the absence of infrastructure to conserve the produce, the crop is getting badly affected resulting in distress sell year after year. The pack house was expected to change the scenario.The pack house was constructed at an estimated cost of `5 crore. Although it was ready for commissioning by 2014-end, the only hurdle was that there was no proper electricity connection as transfer of land and financial sanction were mired in red tape. The unit has capacity to store 900 tonnes of onion and the facility was finally commissioned on May 15.The onion stored in the unit was supposed to be kept under controlled temperature, before it developed technical snag. The 100-odd tonnes initially stored in the pack house germinated exposing the fact that temperature was not being controlled. To add to the woes, there is no power back-up and long hours of power cut were inevitable. Farmers alleged that they were informed at the last moment to shift their stored produce but there was hardly anything left to shift. They said the crop was not insured and there was little hope of getting any returns affecting them further.Sources said it is being planned to compensate the farmers at `4 per kg for damaged onion. About 3,350 bags of onion have been damaged. Contacted, Deputy Director, Horticulture, Balangir P K Swain admitted that there was technical snag and hoped that the problem in the Integrated Pack House would be resolved soon.Sub-collector Girish Chandra Singh said the grievances of the farmers would be looked into."

There has been no permanent mechanism of MSP in the state.Apart from loan waiver, farmers organisations have been demanding passage of a farmers security Act and implementation of the recommendations of the MS Swaminathan Commission.People who are supporting farmers demands will gather at Gandhi Circle in Jaipur on Sunday and observe a one-day fast, Jat said. Farmers will wear black bands to show solidarity.RSS-affiliated Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (BKS) had started a mahapadao (sit-in) on June 15, but called off the agitation on June 19 after holding talks with the state government.That government assured BKS that a law would be brought in to make buying of farmers produce below MSP a punishable offence. A committee will study the laws in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. Electronic weighing machines, the government said, will be installed in all mandis in six months.The government did not give any assurance on farm loan waiver. Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab have waived farmers loans.Holding talks with BKS representatives and assurances given to them was an eyewash, Jat said, adding that 26 associations would support the July 9 protest.Last month, farmers restricted milk, grain and vegetable supply in several districts of Rajasthan after the Kisan Mahapanchayat called a bandh to support the farmers agitation in Madhya Pradesh.

Police officials are of the opinion that there is nothing wrong in cracking the whip on drug peddling.When school management notices a student doing wrong, it will bring the matter to the notice of his/her parents in an attempt to mend ways of student. In the same manner, the excise enforcement officials wrote letters to schools/college managements asking them to take measures to sensitise their students on effects of drug abuse after a few students were found purchasing drugs from peddlers. Government must appreciate the police for cracking whip on drug peddlers, a senior police officer felt. It is also said that upset over the political interference, a senior officer involved in drug bust kept himself away from media glare citing fever. Meanwhile, DGP Anurag Sharma on Friday held meet with police commissioners and SPs asking them to be vigilant against drug peddlers."

With shops and markets closed since last Sunday and supply chains cut off, people are being forced to choose between hunger and an artificial inflation.Supplies are dwindling and prices of vegetable, chicken, egg, fish, mutton and other perishable items are heading north.While fish, chicken and mutton have almost vanished from some of the markets, certain vegetables and eggs are still available but their prices however have touched a point that not many can afford for long.With prohibitory orders in the entire area and vehicles staying off the roads, supply of essential commodities in the area was badly hit. (Samir Jana)Ruma Mandal, a homemaker from the Chapapara area near Basirhat town is serving only potato curries to her family for the last few days.

Last week I paid Rs 8 for a kilo and today I bought two kilos for Rs 24, she complained.Price of onion is skyrocketing as well. Srinath Ghosh, a resident of the Bhyabla area, said onion used to sell for Rs 20 a kilo before a Facebook post he didnt even see changed his life. Now we are paying anything between Rs 30 and 32.

The difference in the demographic character of Basirhat town and that of the adjoining villages is responsible for this inflation, he said.The town population comprises mostly Hindus while most of the villagers are Muslims. Markets in and around the town are heavily dependent on these villages for their daily supply of vegetable, mutton, fish, chicken and eggs.

Fall in production in neighbouring States owing to climatic factors has led to an increase in prices of many vegetables.Tomato and okra are among the vegetables that have shown a significant increase in recent days. In Chala, tomato costs between Rs. 60 to Rs. 70 a kg, but retail prices elsewhere in the city go up to Rs. 80 a kg.Shallots continue to make homemakers shed tears, with prices ranging from Rs. 80 a kg for wholesale to Rs. 140 in retail shops for the best quality.SeasonalSays a commission agent at Chala: Prices are on the rise owing to a drop in production. This is seasonal. Take onion for instance. As onion prices are low in producer States following bumper production, not many farmers will be inclined to grow onion. Those who do will get a good price next year as prices will increase when supply dwindles. This is also the case with shallots. With less stock availability, prices are bound to shoot up. However, there has been a dip in wholesale prices of shallots, he points out. Though shallots havent been reaching the market from Tamil Nadu, an improvement in climate in the crop-growing areas in Karnataka holds out some hope for a further reduction in prices.Yet there are vegetables such as thadiyan kaya which cost Rs. 35 a kg now. I dont remember it exceeding Rs. 20 a kg in recent times, he says.Another wholesale agent says that following a shortfall in tomato production in some States, traders from there reached Karnataka markets, affecting the supply to Kerala. The prices have shot up this much within a fortnight, says a retail vegetable seller.While cowpea (payar) is available for Rs. 40 a kg at Chala, the nadan variety costs Rs. 90-100.Green chilli has not lost its bite either, with prices hovering around Rs. 60 a kg for wholesale and Rs. 70 for retail.Carrot cost around Rs. 60, though cheaper ones can be had for Rs. 45 a kg, says an agent for a farmers producer company. There are three to four types of carrots and beans available, and prices vary for each. Carrot, from Rs. 54 the day before, has increased to Rs. 62. Beans is priced at Rs. 62.Daily fluctuations too have a role to play, and over the course of a week, prices may show a substantial increase or decrease. For instance, okra that cost Rs. 57 a kg a week ago has dipped to Rs. 36 for wholesale and Rs. 40 for retail. Drumstick price too has come down to Rs. 50 a kg. Indian cucumber though is expensive.One retailer at Chala says good quality carrots are available for less than Rs. 50 a kg. But okra in his shop costs Rs. 50 a kg, though it used to cost less than Rs. 20 a kg a month ago.QualityA couple of retailers say they stock the best quality and hence prices are on the higher side for their veggies. Yet, this argument does not go down well with customers who complain of being fleeced.Price intervention, however, does not work much, say the traders.Prices of vegetables that are expensive now will come down in a month or so, some say. Yet others think the trend will continue till Chingam."

Chief minister's announcement for door-to-door collection of toys for poor kids could not take off after the famers' protest and killings in Mandsaur.The agitation was followed by a problem of plenty with bumper yield of onions, which forced government to announce its procurement at Rs 8 per kg. Sources close to the CM said atmosphere was not favourable in state for going ahead with the move. Besides, the administration was also busy over sapling plantation drive on July 2 that is aimed to create a world record.Taking the concept of 'Deewar-e-Mehrbani' or Neki ki Deewar' (wall of kindness), a step further, CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced to go door-to-door and to ask for used clothes and toys for the poor kids. Not only CM, the ministers were also supposed to visit cities which they are in-charge of, and collect clothes and toys from the houses.CM expressed the willingness to do so two months ago after which the officials swung into action. ""It was aimed to motivate people to donate, but the 'more serious' issues that cropped up after the announcement did not give time to plan the project"", said a senior official.However, to compensate it, the state's happiness department has now written letters to all district collectors to motivate people for donating used toys at the Anand Sthals- the name given by state government to Neki ki Deewar in MP.There are 172 Anand Sthals across 51 districts of the state. In Bhopal, there are six Anand Sthals including those at TT Nagar Stadium, Concept English Medium School TT Nagar, Swarna Jayanti Park on Kolar Road, near Daulat Ram Dharmshala in Bairagarh, Govindpura industrial association building and Sanjay swimming pool in Koh-e-Fiza.Principal secretary to CM, SK Mishra said the programme is in the pipeline. CM had expressed willingness to take the project forward and things would be finalised soon.Wall of kindness was a citizen-driven initiative that was first started in Mashhad, a north-eastern city of Iran with installation of few hooks and hangers on a wall called 'Deewar-e-Mehrbani' with words 'If you don't need it, leave it. If you need it, take it,' written next to it. The initiative soon became a viral movement and spread like wildfire across the globe with people painting walls and joining this humanitarian initiative."
5a0dbaa99855b76bf13d115c,Demonetisation and visible hand of market,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/621860/demonetisation-visible-hand-market.html,2017-07-09,"Demonetisation and visible hand of marketKaushik Basu, International New York Times, Jul 9 2017, 23:59 ISTlong term side-effects: Demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policy's impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected. nytIn 1776, Adam Smith described the power of the markets invisible hand. Although some economists have since overstated this power, dismissing the role of government regulation, its true that the market, when left to itself, often manages to meet a societys economic needs in ways that no one fully understands. Its a mistake for the state to disrupt it wantonly and for bureaucrats to try to do its job. And thats just the mistake India made last fall.On November 8, 2016, the NDA government suddenly declared that as of midnight that night all bills in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would cease to be legal tender. Demonetisation, as the policy is called, applied to 86% of the value of all currency in circulation. It was a state intervention of historic proportion.The goal, the government said, was to eliminate fake Indian currency notes, force people to bring out wealth they had hidden to avoid paying taxes on it  so-called black money  and help India switch from cash to digital money. To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetisation has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policys impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.Very little black money has been caught. The truly corrupt hold their black money not as money at all, but as real estate and bank balances abroad. The government had authorised people to trade in up to Rs 4,000 in the cancelled notes, so some parcelled their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills into small bundles and got multiple agents (money mules) to change them, no questions asked. The governments freshly minted Rs 2,000 notes promptly became the new stash currency of choice.In the first weeks, even months, following demonetisation, there was visible chaos. Soviet-era-style queues snaked in front of banks and ATMs. The informal sector  mostly small traders, farmers and small unregistered businesses, which often dont have bank accounts  reeled from cash shortages.But the immediate damage caused, though large, was not as large as some of us had feared. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2016 was 7% and manufacturing activity continued to grow. On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The problems appeared unexpectedly, when agricultural products arrived on the market. In January, with cash shortages in full swing, demand plunged and food prices collapsed. By February, potato prices in Uttar Pradesh were just over half of what they had been during most of 2016 (at around Rs 350 per quintal, instead of over Rs 600 per quintal).Tomato prices were less than one-third. Onion prices in May were half of what they had been a year before. The cost of onions in India is notoriously volatile  and often influenced by politics and elections  but the likeliest culprit for this years drop was demonetisation.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness. And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.The Indian economy was on a good trajectory until last year, and the government deserves credit for that. It had taken major steps to cut the costs of doing business and unify taxes on goods and services. With, in addition, the drop in world oil prices (which meant huge savings for India, an oil importer) and the rise of labour costs in China (which made Indian manufacturing and exports more competitive), there was every reason to believe that the Indian economy would soon get back to where it was before the 2008 world financial crisis: growing at over 9% per year. Instead, Indias growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1%, down from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2015-16.Telltale signsAn economy is a complex machine, and there is no way to be absolutely certain that the cause of all this is demonetisation. But there is a telltale sign: Much of the slowdown originated in the financial sector. Rural loans increased by only 2.5% between October 2016 and April 2017, compared with 12.9% a year before. The rate of growth in overall bank credit declined.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1%, down from 6.5% the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7%, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: as the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetisation will continue to course through the economy.Demonetisation did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didnt need to put 86% of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetisation was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.Indias economy has enormous strengths  such as high rates of savings and investment  and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.(The writer, the C Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.)"

In 1993, the late Madhavrao Scindia initiated a conclave of senior Congress leaders in Dabra, a small town 45 km from Gwalior, just before the 1993 assembly elections where they managed to bury the hatchet and succeeded in coming to power besting the BJP.The parallels are obvious. The show at Laahar will be Madhavraos son, Jyotiradityas, and all senior Congress leaders, including former Union minister Kamal Nath, AICC general secretary Digvijaya Singh, leader of Opposition Ajay Singh, senior state leader Suresh Pachauri, Congress state president Arun Yadav will be among the present.The Scindias, erstwhile rulers of Gwalior state, have held sway in the entire region for decades even though BJP has been in power for the past 17 years in the state.Also, Lahaar is Congress MLA Govind Singhs constituency, and the fact that he is closer to Digvijaya Singh than Scindia has not gone unnoticed in political circles. Now, it remains to be seen how things pan out on the unity front.Ajay Singh, son of late Congress leader Arjun Singh who was part of the Dabra conclave, told HT, Though the Dabra spirit was of a different era, it is also true that for the past two-three months we are moving in that direction and the Lahaar convention is a step towards it.Loud and VisibleThe preparations for the sammelan are visible all around. In Gwalior, posters portraying party unity span on the busy road outside the railway station and elsewhere in the city, appealing all to join the Kisan Sammelan.Local rallies are being taken out by Congressmen, and several vehicles, with blaring loudspeakers reminding people of the convention, have been doing the rounds of the city for the past few days.Over 2,000 vehicles will accompany Scindias rally from Gwalior to Lahaar and it will take around four hours to reach Lahar as all the leaders will be greeted at several places along the route.Tapping into Farmers AngerWith the BJP government on the back foot, the rally, focussing on the farmers crisis, is aimed at the Madhya Pradesh assembly polls, 16 months away.There is palpable anger among farmers, especially after the killing of six farmers in police firing and lathi-charge in Mandsaur in the first week of June. The farmers are demanding loan waiver and remunerative price for their crops.State Congress spokesperson, K K Mishra said the party has been raising farmers issues through Kisan Sammelans and meetings in state in the past one month. It started with Scindiajis satyagraha in Bhopal and was followed by kisan sammelans in Mhow, Khalghat and Mandsaur.After Lahar, two other Kisan Sammelans will be organised in Veerpur in Gwalior and Churhat in Sidhi district, which is Ajay Singhs constituency.BJP puts up brave frontThe BJP too realises the Congresss game plan and for the last one month the chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been trying to douse the farmers anger through a slew of measures  visiting the families of those killed in police firing and announcing compensation of Rs 1 crore for them, purchasing onion at Rs 8 per kg, waiving power bills of small and marginal farmers, and taking out a Kisan Sandesh Yatra where party leaders meet farmers.The BJP is officially trying to put up a brave front and is dismissive of the Congress.BJP state spokesperson, Deepak Vijayvargiya says the Congress does not have credibility, leadership or organisation in the state.They are doing this with an eye on the polls, and not due to genuine concern for farmers, he said."

About 300 acres are under onion cultivation alone in these villages and the farmers raised the crop twice a year.The severe drought conditions affected the onion crop too in a big way across the district. The harvesting of onion in the last season took place in the Tamil month of Maasi about five months ago. The farmers in the last season could get only 25 % of the regular produce due to the drought.The failure of monsoon forced the onion farmers to wait for the last few months. The widespread rainfall experienced in the district for a few consecutive days last month revived the hopes of the farmers. The crop required sufficient soil moisture during its growing period and the rainfall paved way for the same.The farmers have already completed sorting and segregating the seedlings raised in their fields and also procured from Perundurai, another famous onion centre in Erode district. They will be sowing the medium sized bulbs soon.According to V. Thangamani, a farmer of Alathur village, the district did not have any rainfall for months together. The rainfall received a month ago prompted the farmers to sow the bulbs now.She admitted that they were sowing the seed onion in the hope that it would rain in a month of two and thus save them from disaster. Even 3 to 5 cm of rainfall would be of immense support to the standing crop, she said. The harvesting is expected by September end.She laments that the groundwater level had plummeted in various villages. Even if we have to sink borewells, we have to go a depth of 1,000 feet. For sinking new borewells, farmers have to spend a minimum of Rs. 2 lakh. If we dont get adequate water, it will prove a disaster for us. We have to spend much even for the renovation of the existing borewells, Mrs. Thangamani said.The villagers usually market the onion crop in Erode and Komarapalayam, major markets of the western belt. However, the poor price offered by traders and middlemen is always a matter of great concern for them.R. Sathish Kumar, another farmer, says that the onion farmers will be able to fetch reasonable profit if they market the produce themselves in the local markets and weekly santhais. But with limited resources, they cannot do much and have to be at the mercy of the traders and middlemen in fixing the rate.A cross section of the farmers of the district have pleaded with the State Government to set up modern onion godowns, as done in Perambalur district."

The price of one kg of onion which remained at Rs. 110 has decreased in the past couple of days.The price stood between Rs. 85 and Rs. 95 in the uzhavar santhais on Wednesday, santhai sources said.

A man on horseback stands guard, watching from a distance. Deer that destroy crops is just one more headache for the farmers of Puntamba, a village that played a major role in mobilising the recent farmers strike in Maharashtra, when tillers decided to let their produce perish rather than sell them at a loss.Puntambas other problem has been delinquent rains. If it does not rain for another eight to 10 days, our present crop will be in trouble, says Balasaheb Chavan, a local farmer.Mr. Chavan points to a third problem: erratic power supply. For the most part, their fields get power only at night. But it is neither easy nor safe to work in the fields in the dark. There are snakes around our village. Working in the dead of the night is not easy, he says.Parallel workWith agriculture proving a loss-making proposition, Mr. Chavan says that villagers keep their households running through parallel work. The better off try their hands at small businesses. The poorer ones become blue-collar workers.Another farmer, Vilas Dhanaute, says he has just returned from the market after selling 9.5 quintals of his onion produce. He produces a slip to show that he only got a rate of Rs. 2 per kg.He explains the math. I spent Rs. 600 on transporting the onions to the market, Rs. 450 on labour, and Rs. 900 on the sacks required. Just taking the onions to the market cost me about Rs. 1,950. I earned Rs. 200 on each of the 9.5 quintals I sold, or Rs. 1,900 for the whole lot, he says. Over all, I ended up making a loss of Rs. 50.Asked why sell at all if they suffer a loss, Mr. Dhanaute says, What do we do with these quintals of produce then? We cant let them rot in our village. He points to a large tent-like storage structure next to the fields, where much of his onions still lies. He says he would have to sell them all in the coming days, but is doing it a few quintals at a time in the hope that prices rise.In early June, farmers from this village, located 15 km from Shirdi, decided not to sell their produce. This set in motion a strike that spread across Maharashtra.Farmers in the village, however, seem resigned to a bleak future for farming."

Despite huge production of onion in the state, consumers continue to get it at a rate of Rs 10 to 20 per kg in the market.Owing to big mismanagement in storage of onions, several hundred tonnes of bulbs has already been buried across the state after it started making lives of people miserable due to its bad smell. Dumping the rotten onions itself requires huge efforts on the part of the government. Black decomposed onion bulbs could be seen littered along 6 kms stretch of a highway on Chattarpur-Jhansi road.Officials requisitioned trucks to remove them from the roadside. This year 32 lakh metric tonnes of onion production took place in the state. With just about 10% capacity to store the produce in the state, the government spent more than Rs 600 crore in purchasing the onion from farmers.Government sources said there is no estimate of how much onion purchased from farmers has been destroyed.Amidst all this, a 50-kg sack of onion was sold in Bhopal mandi on Monday at a price of Rs 300 to Rs 400, depending upon the quality. The bigger bulbs and those pink in colour fetch a better price. Abdool Raqib, president of the wholesalers association of onion and potatoes, said: "" After flooding the mandis a few days back, onions have disappeared now as major quantity of the commodity has been exhausted from the local markets and has been transported outside the state. Those who have the capacity to hold it back, are likely to sell it at premium rates in the coming months. The effect will be felt by the month-end"".Wholesalers from Maharashtra Delhi and even from Kolkatta purchased onions from Madhya Pradesh at a rate of Rs 2 a kg and transported it to bigger cities. Besides, the government started diverting the onion to district headquarters by trains and trucksto be sold at fair price shops. In the meantime, onions began to rot at two places  mandis where the farmers unloaded them for a price of Rs 8 a kg and then at railway stations where it was dumped due to lack of proper transportion, government sources said.In Manasa village of Dhar district, mountains of onion were formed when hundreds of dumpers started bringing the produce, only to be destroyed for want of storage. Additional district magistrate of Dhar DK Nagendra told TOI,""We have buried 15,000 to 18,000 metric tonnes of onion. About 100 metric tonne is still stored and some of it may also be destroyed. The district administration has a target of selling 1200 metric tonnes from fair price shops"", he said. More than 600 kms away from Dhar, mounds of onion could be seen littered all along the stretch of highways. Before dumping more than 18,000 quintal of onion in trenches created by digging of murram (red clay) on Naugaon-Harpalpur road, the onion was littered on the roadside, Mangailal Yadav , a resident of Kukrel village said. After the villagers complained of foul smell, it was buried. For some days, students of Khushipura primary school stopped attending classes because of the stench of decaying onion bulbs. Latto Prasad Shriwas, headmaster of a primary school, had complained after which the onion was removed. BB Gangale, sub divisional magistrate at Naugaon, said: "" About 18000 quintal was dumped in the mine area. This was the same onion that was lying at Harpalpur railway station creating trouble to passengers. Five special trains loaded with onion had dumped the produce at Chhatrpur's Harpalpur railway station""."

Apparently, the prices of veggies from Tamil Nadu go on an upward spiral once they cross the border at Kumily.As per the price list on Tuesday, the difference in the cost of vegetables in the markets of Kumily and Cumbum - the nearest town in Tamil Nadu - ranges from zero to 350 per cent. Authorities are struggling to find a reason for the difference even after the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) system removing separate taxes at the frontiers.In fact, the vegetable suppliers incur only transportation cost, said Joseph Sebastian, a vegetable vendor. Yet, they are charging an unfair price. We cant understand the reason for such a huge difference as Cumbum is only 23 km away from Kumily.The biggest difference is in the price of cucumber. While it costs Rs 15 per kg in Tamil Nadu, it is sold at Rs 50 per kg in Kerala. There is a difference of up to 50 per cent in the price of other vegetables. However, the price of a few other items are a notch higher in Tamil Nadu.Oops! They go through the roofThe prices of vegetables soared in the retail market in Palakkad district sharing its border with Tamil Nadu. The price of cowpea is Rs 60 per kg, while ladies finger is Rs 70 per kg. The price of tomato was Rs 50 per kg and onion touched Rs 110 per kg. Madhu, a vegetable merchant from Koduvayur, said as it was not seasonal, the prices were on the higher side. Ramesh, a consumer, said the budget was going haywire even for a small family. It costs Rs 300 to Rs 500 to purchase vegetables for a week.Salad days are here again Residents of the district can now dig into their favourite vegetarian dishes without feeling the pinch.

A large number of people mainly the poor rush to the railway station and dumping grounds to pick onion for use. If they consume rotten onion, it could affect their heath.Hence, Chandra said, they have decided to dump the rotten onion at the power plant that faces shortage of solid waste needed to run the plant efficiently. The cost of generating power from onion would be Rs 6 per unit, almost double from polluting coal and about 50 paisa higher than solar.In addition, the government has also decided to convert onion into manure.Jabalpur administration has taken a good step and nearby district can dump their onion at the power plant, Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation, managing director, Dnyaneshwar Patil said. But it is not possible to send the onion from other districts for power generation as transportation cost will add to the losses. We have asked them to dump the onion to produce manure.New and renewable energy department principal Secretary Manu Srivastava, said, It is a very good decision. Due to shortage of waste products, the water based power plant is not being utilised properly. Extra transportation cost is an issue. Otherwise, onion from distant places could have brought to the plant too.ends"

(Above and three-column image below) Pictures show the Sardar wholesale agricultural market, in Surat, Gujarat.R.V. MoorthyR_V_MoorthyIt is past noon and the Sardar wholesale agricultural market in Surat is bustling with activity. Trucks drive in every minute and so do lorries smaller in size. Farmers arrive in these with loads of agricultural produce to sell. The place has multiple rows of platforms interspersed with streets and parking spots. Each platform is dedicated to different kinds of produce: onion, fruits, vegetables, etc. Things move with clockwork precision. Daily-wage labourers offload the sacks of farm produce from trucks, dumping them in huge heaps on the floor of the platforms. A different set of merchants buys this grain and transports it from here, to be sold in towns nearby. The merchants registered here who act as conduits for the sale take a 6% commission on the produce sold. The rest goes to the farmer, and is delivered in cash on the second or fourth day.This correspondent  who accompanied the ongoing yatra of farmers organisations from Madhya Pradesh to Delhi through parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat  took a detour to talk to people at this wholesale market to make sense of agricultural marketing operations.Ebb and flow of pricesThe place is a market seeing daily fluctuations of prices, based on demand and supply. If a greater quantity of a crop comes to the market on a given day and fewer merchants land up to buy it, the price falls. If more merchants come and there is dearth of a commodity, the price rises. Farmers benefit from a higher price and return disappointed if the prices are low. The prices fluctuate even within a day. To sell for a good price is like being lucky in a draw of lots.Rakesh Bhambre and Sunil Sonone, who have driven down in a rented truck from Daswel village of the Baglan taluka in Nashik district of Maharashtra, have had a hectic day. They arrived here at 2 a.m. Through the morning, they have sold their onions, which were harvested in April, and have managed to get a price of Rs. 6-7 per kg, which is not bad. They will now head back to their village in a bit. The merchant will send them the money for their produce in cash two days from now, which another truck coming from their village will deliver to them.The two Nashik farmers say they engage only in farming and have no side work to do. Their annual calendar is hectic. In June/July and October, they sow sugar cane, which requires a lot of water and takes close to nine months to be ready. This year isnt a good one for sugar cane, they fear, as it isnt raining yet. They sow onion in August and also in November. They have brought the harvest of their November crop of onion here, they say. The advantage with onion is that it can also be stored for four-five months.They also sow tomato in June and July, and the crop takes two months to be ready.The agricultural process requires a variety of expenses. They need to buy seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and machines on hire for harvesting. They have to pay the bills for power consumed while watering their fields. They also need to hire labour for various operations, from preparing the fields, taking care of the crop to loading the produce on to trucks. Labour charges range from Rs. 70-100 a day.These expenses  varying for different crops  are facilitated both by the money they get by selling their previous produce in the market and by borrowing from cooperative banks, nationalised banks and regional rural banks at an interest of around 7%. Sometimes, they have to borrow from private merchants too, at a higher rate of interest on a monthly basis. Most farmers are under debt of a few lakhs, and sometimes borrow from one lender to pay another. A good crop and remunerative prices  a matter of chance  can lead to better incomes. A slump in prices of a crop or erratic monsoon can lead to loss.The variegated world of farmersThis year, farmers in Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh and in adjoining parts of Maharashtra  like Nashik and Ahmednagar  are still awaiting rains. If it does not rain for another week, they say, their crops will be damaged. Villages, of course, have farmers of varying means. The richer ones have more land  perhaps 20 acres  and can try three or four kinds of crops in their fields. If one fails, they believe the other will not. The smaller farmers find it harder to get by.The truck in which Bhambre and Sonone brought their produce to Surat has been hired from a bigger farmer of their village, who owns trucks and hires them out.These two farmers  each owning 7-8 acres of land  however spend the year in farming, both with their family labour and hired daily wagers. The poorest in villages own no land of their own, and work on the fields of others.The wealthier farmers have also diversified into related occupations and other businesses as an additional cushion, as farming is not very lucrative and yields and prices are unpredictable. The poorest in the agricultural world either work others fields or do additional work as rickshaw pullers, construction workers, etc., sometimes becoming poor migrants. Hours before reaching the Surat market, this correspondent visited Koribhartna village near Surat, where daily wagers were working the fields of a richer farmer where okra was being grown. Dinesh, a daily-wage labourer of the village with no land of his own, said he works through the year at a daily wage of Rs. 100. He gets one or the other agricultural work through the year, he says, but adds that the money he earns is not enough for maintaining his family well.Pandane village in Nashik district is situated close to a dam from where it gets what villagers complain is sand-laced water. Pradip Shivaji Chitte, whose joint family has 7.5-acres of land, of which he works on just 2.5, has opened a small shop dealing in seeds, fertilisers and pesticides. He rented this shop two months ago in a bid to diversify beyond farming. I invested Rs. 1 lakh in this; some of my friends also contributed, he says. But till now, I am just being able to break even. Chitte says he is under Rs. 16-lakh debt and practises grape farming in the village. In our village, half the farming is grape farming; the rest is of all other crops, he says.Just preparing the fields for the crops entails a labour charge of Rs. 20,000 per acre, he claims. The fields are prepared from September and the harvest comes only by January, before which the crop requires a lot of care. The total expense, including labour, fertilisers and pesticides, comes to Rs. 1.6-1.7 lakh per acre. The selling of the produce begins from January and it sells at about Rs. 18-25 per kg. If one subtracts the expense borne from the selling price per acre, the profit is Rs. 45,000-50,000. This is the annual income for growing grapes per acre. Chitte says bigger farmers aiming at exports prepare their fields a month earlier  they also get higher prices when they sell their produce, he adds.Farmers in the Nimaad region of Madhya Pradesh also grow hybrid crops like Bt cotton.The same is the case in neighbouring districts of Maharashtra like Nashik. Jagdish Patidar, who came to Barwani for a day from Maheshwar in Madhya Pradesh to take part in the ongoing rally of farmers organisations, says he too grows Bt cotton, which requires more supply of water and higher input costs. What they look for is higher prices for their produce.Bt cotton costs more but is high yield and therefore more lucrative for farmers. When a new variety that is advertised as high yield comes, farmers will take to it for profits, says Lakhwinder Singh, an agriculture expert at Punjabi University, Patiala. Many farmers also took to it as it was advertised as resistant to bollworm, a pest that affected cotton. However, Singh cautions, the pest resistance is only for three-four years.Agitations and farmers yatraThe ongoing farmers agitations are demanding state support for making farming more lucrative. They demand that the M.S. Swaminathan Committees recommendation  that the government-announced minimum support price (MSP) should be 1.5-times the cost of production  be implemented. They are also demanding farm loan waiver, as many farmers are under large debt. However, a loan waiver does not ease the burden of loans taken from private parties.Till July 14, a Kisan Mukti Yatra involving several farmers organisations has been moving through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan, addressing villagers and articulating these demands. The participants argue that while input costs for farming have been rising, the rise in MSP has been sluggish.Swaraj Abhiyan leader and academic Yogendra Yadav, Narmada Bachao Andolan leader Medha Patkar, Maharashtra farmer leader Raju Shetti, the All India Kisan Sabha, Kisan Sangharsh Morcha, Bhartiya Kisan Union of Punjab, and other organisations are taking part in the yatra, which will converge on Jantar Mantar in Delhi on July 18. It began in Madhya Pradesh, with the farmers leaders being detained for a few hours by the police, and passed through Indore, Barwani  visiting village Barda, which is in the submergence zone of the Sardar Sarovar dam  Nashik, Vyara and Surat in Gujarat, Bhilwara and Jaipur in Rajasthan, among other places. There are regular halts to interact with people, with crowds varying from a few hundred to a few thousand turning up.The yatra comes close on the heels of the deaths of six farmers in police action in Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, and a strike by Maharashtra farmers early in June, when they decided to let their farm produce and milk perish but not sell it in the absence of lucrative prices. The strike was broken in 48 hours after talks with the Maharashtra government, which made a few announcements: loan waivers for small and debt-ridden farmers; a Bill to criminalise buying produce at rates below the MSP; the setting up of a State Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices on the lines of the Centre to look into MSP issues. The State government also offered to subsidise farmers power bills, hike milk prices and set up cold storage chains for preserving the produce.Making farming sustainableThe journey shows one thing  that farming, which sustains more than half of Indias population even if many of them also do other things on the side for supplementary income, is not a lucrative proposition. Farmlands have become smaller over generations and, except for large farmers, many do not find it rewarding but find themselves ill-trained for other occupations, says Patidar, the farmer from Maheshwar. Farmers, however, do have an emotional attachment to farming.Their fortunes depend on many things: rains, prevailing prices, and how indebted they become. Lakhwinder Singh says that the answer to the agrarian unease is either subsidies on input costs or higher prices. He says farmers need to spend not just on farming but also on services like education and health. Unless their expenses go down or incomes go up, discontent is expected, he adds. Everything from health and education to seeds that were public services once are private services now. Farmers get into this loop of rising costs of living, he explains.In Punjab, the government purchases all wheat and rice crops at the MSP. This, being scientifically calculated, can enable farmers to have some incomes that make agriculture meaningful. But the same procurement guarantee applies neither to all crops nor to all States, which makes farming less lucrative as an occupation, says Lakhwinder Singh.Farmers in Madhya Pradesh say that government procurement centres are opened late, often a month and a half after a crop is ready. But farmers cannot store it all in their fields near their homes. They try to sell their crop soon after harvest to merchants, and often get prices below the MSP. If government centres were to start as soon as the harvest came, we would get better prices, says Patidar.The troubles dont end here. Patidar says not all the produce is bought by these centres; it may be rejected on grounds of quality. Suraj, a young farmer from Naraula village in Barwani district, says that there is much paperwork in these centres to ascertain the quantity of land on which the crop was sown, the yield, and to verify that the produce indeed belongs to the farmer who brought it.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground, says former Maharashtra State Planning Commission member and economist H.M. Desarda. Lakhwinder Singh adds that if the government undertakes to purchase all major crops at the MSP, farmers will be better off.But will this not push prices of farm produce bought by consumers upward? Lakhwinder Singh disagrees. He says the large number of middlemen in the supply chain do not anyway let vegetable and grain prices reflect the prices at which farmers are selling them. The long-term answer to farmers indebtedness, he adds, is a rise in their incomes.It may become a heated debate politically, but an answer to non-remunerative farming may take longer to come.Unless there is a procurement guarantee and the farmer can count on the government to purchase his produce, the MSP has little meaning on the ground,H.M.

5a0b2b129855b76bf13cd08a,"Fruit for thought: To pay less for tomatoes, can prejudice",http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/ruminations/fruit-for-thought-to-pay-less-for-tomatoes-can-prejudice/,2017-07-16,"Whether you pronounce it to-may-to or to-maa-to (or tamaatar), there is nothing very Indian about the tomate, as Spanish Conquistadors called the fruit (yes, it is a fruit) that grew wild in the Andes. The word tomato itself comes from the word tomatl, its name in the Aztec language Nahuatl. Anglophones likely corrupted it to rhyme with potato. The French, trust them, called it pommes damour (love apples), believing it had aphrodisiacal properties.Stop right there if you are reaching for one. Even without libidinal attributes, the price of this squishy everyday companion to cooking (along with onion) has already hit a new high in India, arousing ire. At Rs 70 a kilo last week, it surpassed the price of mangoes that are on their way out of the market. By this weekend, it had raced into record territory at Rs 100-plus a kilo.Famously, the rising price of tur daal and onion  our meat and potatoes  is something governments are leery of. But tomato is, by comparison, an orphan.Remember, it was only weeks ago that we read about tomato growers in distress  selling their produce at as low as one rupee a kilo or simply throwing it away in protest on highways in drama reminiscent of La Tomatina, the festival held in the town of Buol, Spain  sans the festivities. In fact, this appears to be as much an annual occurrence in parts of India  particularly in the districts of Nasik and Kolar, the biggest tomato-growing areas  as the Valencian festival. What gives?At first blush, it would seem the tomato is getting squished entirely by seasonal factors and market forces, like so much other agricultural produce in India  particularly fruits and vegetables  that does not get government support price. Growing tomatoes is particularly dicey, says Aruna Urs, a farmer-in-residence at the think-tank Takshashila Institution, comparing it to a Las Vegas crapshoot. Unseasonal rain or unexpected heat, a mandi strike or market glut, could be the difference between boom and bust.Over the years, farmers have learned to navigate the treacherous terrain  not always successfully  using seeds that yield thick-skinned tomatoes (for longevity and ease of transport) and timing the pick to market. Urs himself speaks of planting this April by car headlights in the dead of the night to catch the right temperature (too warm and the seeds die).The result has been a bonanza  Rs 68/kilo in the wholesale market last week when anything above Rs 10/kilo is considered rich pickings. So if farmers who got crushed by Rs 1/kg price during the market glut are making a killing at Rs 100 a kilo, who can blame them? By the way, stories about middlemen milking it are vastly exaggerated. They do, but not to the extent of some of the tomato crorepati farmers who gamble by leasing hundreds of acres in what is a high-wire  high-vine  act.Still, the price variation of 100x is not just a factor of seasons and market forces, but also of cultural and culinary habits. India is notoriously shy of eating frozen and canned goods. No self-respecting Indian would be caught using tomato that is in any way processed or pureed, sliced or diced, into a can or container. Thanks to vast tracts of arable and fecund lands, landing fresh produce is no problem in most parts of the country even if there is a groundwater crisis.By contrast, in the US, where tomato accounts for 22% of vegetable consumption (outside the technicality of it being a fruit), more than 50% of tomatoes are consumed as tomato products  processed, pureed, pasted etc. What did the papa tomato say to the baby tomato? A: Hurry and ketchup! goes the joke. Q: How do you get rid of unproductive tomatoes? A: Can them. As a result, retail price of tomatoes in the US has hovered between a low of $1.21 and a high $2.47 per pound over the last 20 years  nothing like the Rs 1 to Rs 100 variation in India.To be sure, theres enormous merit in the way Indians consume fresh produce, including the tomato in all its fiery colour and cool completeness (Pablo Neruda). Instead of eating fruits and vegetables in their original state, much of the West, particularly the US, soup them up with sodium and sugar, adding needless calories and subtracting dietary fibre. Last year, the grocery chain Whole Foods invited outrage and ridicule by selling pre-peeled oranges.But there is now sufficient research to show that frozen produce is not always nutritionally leached, and in some cases, enhances it. Sans sodium, canned is not dicey either. Of course, there is nothing to beat fresh, but as long as India does not accept enforced longevity of produce, both farmers and consumers will have to periodically deal with crapshoots in the fruit and vegetable market."

BJP veteran and former chief minister Babulal Gaur is going to make the monsoon session a prickly one with a long list of questions  from the killing of farmers in police firing in Mandsaur and farmer suicide to illegal sand mining, Narmada Seva Yatra and onion purchase.The 87-year-old, who was dropped from the Cabinet on the 75-plus age criteria, has often embarrassed the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government by raising uncomfortable questions in the assembly and even in public. For instance, during the violent farmer agitation in June, he had rejected the government allegation that Congress was responsible for fomenting tension, pointing out that the Opposition didn't have the strength for it. This time, he has filed 16 questions, including many that the government is wary of discussing in the house.Congress is already going hammer and tongs at BJP on sensitive matters like disqualification of minister Narottam Mishra by EC and the farmers' unrest across the state. ""Now, Gaur is all set to make things worse by raising sensitive issues that suits the opposition,"" said a senior BJP leader.""I have raised about 16 queries in the house to know the status and government stand on schemes. I was assured about Metro Rail and Smart City projects, I also wanted to know about government's action after farmers' unrest and the firing in Mandsaur. More important is the issue of onion procurement, problems like malnutrition, Narmada Seva, Gau Raksha and funds for cow shelters,"" Gaur told TOI.Earlier, Gaur had embarrassed urban development minister Maya Singh by raising queries related to delays in Metro Rail and Smart City projects. The state leadership had to intervene to convince Gaur that work was being sped up on these projects. ""I'm an MLA and I will raise questions pertaining to development. I don't intend to embarrass the government, but I can't shun my responsibility of taking up issues of development in the assembly,"" Gaur reiterated.Gaur, perhaps the oldest politician in BJP in the state, recently announced that he will contest the assembly polls for the 11th time in 2018 from Govindpura seat of Bhopal where he is undefeated since 1980."

However, prices are high compared to previous Aadi seasons.Farmers say it is in the Tamil month of Aadi they start harvesting the summer crop. As the harvest has commenced and inflow of vegetables to markets has resumed, the prices have dropped.Tomato prices, which hovered around Rs 90-Rs 95 per kg last week, have dropped to Rs 80 on Tuesday morning. The price of small onions too has come down to Rs 85 per kg from Rs 95-Rs 100 in the past one month. Garlic, which cost Rs 200 per kg two months ago, is now priced at Rs 100 per kg.""Vegetables such as onions, chillies, tomatoes, and brinjal, among others, are ususally harvested this time of the year. And prices drop as they are easily availabile in markets,"" said Diriviyam, a farmer who comes to Uzhavar Sandhai in R S Puram. Since farmers anticipate a shortage of labour in the coming days, they have started harvesting whatever is grown. ""Several labourers will go on a pilgrimage in Aadi month. The crops, meanwhile, will start rotting after the onset of rain. So, we want to finish harvest as soon as possible,'' said a farmer.The prices are, however, still high compared to the previous Aadi months. Farmers say Rs 80 per kg for tomato is very high for this period of the year. Usually, vegetables such as tomato would be sold at throwaway prices during Aadi. This year, the cultivated area was less compared to previous years, due to water shortage. Also, the yield per acre has come down. ""On a normal year, the summer harvest will yield 10-20 tonnes of tomato per acre. Because of water shortage and extreme heat, the yield has dropped by 60% this year,"" said Senthil Kumar , a tomato farmer from Madhampatti.Farmers said they didn't expect the prices to drop further, a phenomenon usually witnessed as Aadi progresses. ""We have postponed harvest of onion to September after the rains,'' said Vijaykumar, a farmer, hinting that if at all there was a further price fall it would be after September. However, the cost of green chillies has been steadily increasing over the past one week, from Rs 30-Rs 40 per kg to Rs 88 on Tuesday. ""This is because chillies are coming from Mysuru. We are yet to get local stock from Erode, Chettipalayam and Thalavadi,'' said R Satheesh, a vegetable vendor at MGR Market."

She did  and what a meal it was.She had come carrying rice paper from Hanoi, and we went to INA Market to buy some shrimps, greens, peppers and ripe mango. And then she prepared a roll that was as much a visual delight as it was a treat for the palate. At the bottom of the translucent rolled rice paper was a thick strip of red mangoes, then some thinly cut green and red capsicum, shreds of basil and mint leaves and finally a layer of steamed shrimps.I was reminded of those rolls when I went to a lovely little restaurant called Little Saigon in Hauz Khas Market (Phone: 9650260408 and 9599450879) one afternoon. Its really little, so you have to book a table if you can.Still nostalgic about those rolls, we asked for a plate of pancakes with chicken (Rs. 220). They were different from the ones I had eaten, but rather good, nevertheless. The pancakes came with a helping of lettuce leaves, and we were urged to wrap a leaf around the pancake and eat it. There was a light fish sauce, which we could smear on the pancake if we wished to. The difference was in the casing  Chef Hana, who runs Little Hanoi, makes her batter with rice powder and beaten egg  so it looked and tasted a bit different.The fresh summer roll with shrimp and meat (Rs. 220) and with tofu and vegetables (Rs. 170) were little rolls of rice paper, stuffed with all the good stuff. I didnt try out the veggie one, but quite enjoyed my crunchy non-veg roll.Superb curryOur main dish was sticky rice with braised pork (Rs. 540) and yellow chicken curry (Rs. 330). The pork had a sharp taste, mildly sweet but piquant. The yellow curry gravy was simply superb, light and mildly flavoured, with little chunks of onion and carrot in them. The chicken pieces in the gravy, however, did not appeal to me much. I found them a bit too hard, and thought that the excellent flavours of the curry had not seeped into the meat.The vegetable aromatic rice noodle soup (Rs. 270) that a friend had asked for needed some more greens, and the server topped it accordingly. It was perhaps a bit bland, because of which we asked for the grilled fish Saigon (Rs. 320), which was very good. The fish was crisp, the flesh was firm, and the flavours were strong.We had our meal with some artichoke iced tea and hot tea (Rs. 95). And we ended with a delicious coconut ice cream with jelly (Rs. 120).This is one of the few places where you get Vietnamese food in Delhi, for strangely enough, there are hardly any Vietnamese restaurants in the city. Taj Palace had a Vietnam cuisine special called the Blue Ginger, but that shut shop, too. I find that surprising, for Vietnamese food is a rage across the world, and one of the best cuisines that you can have.I love Vietnamese food for two main reasons. One, the food is lighter than other cuisines for most dishes are steamed, grilled or boiled. And, second, the cuisine marks the coming together of many diverse influences. China and South East Asian nations have added to the cauldron, of course, but what sets it apart is the French influence, for France ruled Vietnam for almost a century from the middle of the 19th Century.But I am sure the food will catch on soon. And for the small group of die-hard Vietnamese food lovers in the city, there is always Little Saigon."

Seasonings are crucial to our cuisine and practice of medicine. Kebab chini is one such spice.This ancient spice is used not just in Indian cuisine but also in Asian and Spanish dishes. It is mostly used for flavouring curries owing to its fragrance.Kabab chini is popularly known as Allspice in English because it smells like a combination of spices including cloves, black pepper, cinnamon and nutmeg.It plays a vital role in culinary arts; it is used as a tenderiser and preservative, and to give flavour and colour. Kebab chini is also widely used in potpourri.This spice has a longer shelf life as whole fruits, so in most kitchens, they are powdered right before cooking.Kebab chini plays a vital role in garam masala; if you are making 1 kg of garam masala, the amount of kebab chini used will be 15g.Gosht Ka Taar KormaIngredientsGhee - 7 gMustard oil - 5 gWhole garammasala - 2 gOnion - 10 gGinger garlic paste - 2 gTurmeric - 2 gCoriander powder - 7 gResham patti - 2 gLamb nalli - 90 gPaya stock - 100 gCurd - 7 gGaram masala - 2 gRose water - 2 gFennel - 2 gSaffron - 2 gMace cardamompowder - 2 gBoti - 90 gSaltMethod:-For Stock Burn the paya on a burner to get rid of the hair on it Wash the paya well, put it in a stock pot filled with water Boil; Get rid of the water after the first boil to get rid of the impurities With fresh water, re boil the paya.

""While the tomato is being sold for Rs 90 a kilo in the retail market, a farmer only gets 50 paise a kilo in the mandi.

No, that's K Chandu. With one hand raised above his head and the other clutching a microphone, a freeze-frame Chandu grins from his auto which is plastered with posters of himself. It reads 'Haasya Samrat' (king of laughter) and a constant reminder of the man 'K Chandu' stage name for Chandrakant Kapse who has taken it upon himself to relieve traffic stress with his art of being funny as he uses his vehicle to ""advertise"" his skills, score gigs and test comic routines on unsuspecting riders.For a curious bunch of foreigners, he unleashed a female falsetto and masqueraded as an English-speaking woman bargaining with an auto-wallah. In splits, his passengers filmed his antic that has garnered over 850 views till date on YouTube.Not bad for an auto driver turned jokesmith from Sausuddi, a village in Belgaum, who began by performing at political roadshows and community celebrations before arriving in Mumbai 23 years ago to find his calling. ""I wanted to be an actor,"" says Chandu.There is a small chance you may have seen Chandu as a villain's henchman in one of the K-soaps or in a purple gown and large breasts playing a woman in a Hindi B-movie. His relentless wait outside the studios also fetched him a Marathi news show that he anchored for about a month.When he ran short of acting gigs, he decided to go back to his funny side and for the last 10 years, Chandu has been a mini celebrity at community festivals, malls, private parties and eco drives in not just Mumbai but Jodhpur, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolhapur and Sangli, averaging five shows a month and logging over ""700 stand-up comedy shows"" till date.Chandu dropped out of school in his teens but unintelligent he isn't. At a time when carefully scripted comic acts are flourishing, it's rare to see a comedian with a natural flair for cracking up his audience in Hindi, Marathi, Bhojpuri, Kannada, Gujrati and English with witticisms about the world he encounters every day - amorous couples in autorickshaws to Baba Ramdev's suspiciously black beard. When the rupee nosedives and onion prices shoot up, laughter resonates. While his act is more mimicry than comedy, you never know what he's going to do next - switching between 50 different voices - sometimes Mithun Chakraborty, sometimes a baby goat, buffalo, or parrot and sometimes a motorbike on high accelerator.His snappy poise as a comedian has often helped the funny man dodge a traffic fine. ""When cops ask me for my license, I tell them a joke,"" he beams, half-afraid to face people not like himself.""On the spot, my jokes come automatically,"" he says showing off his wardrobe of satin blazers, sequined waistcoats, fedoras and half a dozen sunglasses at his rented one-room house in a Mankhurd chawl where he lives with his wife and 14-year-old son.Ask him about his inspiration in a life that isn't easy and he snaps back: ""Why do you think I replaced posters of Gods and heroes with my own?

5a0b5e999855b76bf13ceb0f,Taming inflationary expectations,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/taming-inflationary-expectations/article19338912.ece,2017-07-24,"The official inflation rate dipped to 1.5% last month, the lowest in almost two decades. Inflation is a politically more sensitive challenge than joblessness for the simple reason that it affects everyone, whether you have a job or not.Indias long-term record in managing inflation has been very impressive when compared with most developing countries. We have never had the bouts of hyperinflation experienced in many Latin American economies or seen even in countries such as Israel. The relatively high double-digit inflation experienced between 2010 to 2013 was an aberration, which had a political consequence. There have been very few instances of such persistent, multi-year, high inflationary episodes in our history. The credit for this goes to the vigilance of the political system and also to effective monetary management. Inflation is after all a monetary phenomenon  more money chasing fewer goods. So, controlling money supply is part of the strategy for controlling inflation.Food prices as indicatorBut inflation is also an indicator of whether there is an excess demand or supply of goods. For instance, with a bumper crop of fruits and vegetables, prices plunge, even though money supply might be unchanged. Indeed, the recent drop in the inflation rate has been caused by a steep fall in the prices of vegetables (-17%) and pulses (- 22%). Conversely, and rather ironically, unseasonal rains in the north have destroyed a large part of the tomato crop causing prices to skyrocket. Food prices, especially of perishables, are notoriously volatile. High onion prices, even if temporary, have caused the downfall of governments in past elections. Food prices are a big component in the determinant of the overall inflation rate based on the consumer price index basket. Keeping them low and stable involves policies such as public procurement and a minimum support price regime. Inflation control thus involves a combination of monetary management along with measures to increase supply of goods (in the medium term) as also anti-hoarding measures or the release of stocks from government warehouses.Even though price stability is an important goal of government policy, it is now an exclusive mandate given to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). Last year, in a landmark reform of monetary management, the government officially gave an inflation target to the RBI. Prior to this, the central bank had multiple objectives which included enhancing growth and reducing unemployment, although price stability was undoubtedly paramount. The new paradigm, called the flexible inflation targeting framework, aims for a numerical target given by the government. The main tool to achieve it is by setting the benchmark interest rate. This decision is now taken by the six-member monetary policy committee (MPC), chaired by the Governor. The current inflation target is 4% plus or minus 2%. The MPC is deemed to have failed if for three consecutive quarters the inflation rate falls outside the band.Low inflation pointerWho would have imagined that in the new MPC regime, the first instance of deviation of the inflation rate would undershoot, not overshoot the target? Of course, technically, the MPC has not failed, for the June inflation rate of 1.5%, which is below 2%, may be transitory. However, there are strong indications and forecasts by many economists that point to low inflation in the coming months. Those numbers may be in the range of 2 to 4%.How did we get to this low inflation scenario? Partly it must be because the money supply has been kept dear, or tight. Thus, the benchmark rate (called the repo rate, or the rate at which the RBI gives money to banks) at 6.25% may be too high. Interest rates are the price of money, so if they are too high, money becomes scarce. If it is lowered, then there will be more money in circulation, more loans given out. But low inflation is also because of a steep fall in prices of fruits, vegetables and pulses, none of which was caused by high interest rates. These steep falls are highly seasonal. We have also benefited from low and stable crude oil prices, which are a crucial determinant of transport and energy costs.All eyes will now be on the MPC which meets again in less than two weeks. There is a strong feeling that high interest rates have deterred big industrial investments, or housing finance. High rates are crippling borrowers who try to come out of near-bankruptcy and are preventing a restructuring of stressed bank loans. Indias real interest rates, i.e. net of inflation, are quite high even compared to other developing countries. Much of the developed world has ultra-low rates, with some countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Japan even having negative interest rates. India needs much lower rates for higher GDP growth.But the job of the MPC wont be easy. This is mainly because its task is to target future inflation, not the past. The future has some troubling portents. The short run impact of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is bound to be inflationary. Thats because a bulk of Indias GDP is in services whose tax rate has moved from 15% to 18%. Besides, while sellers wait for their refund, i.e. input tax credit under the GST, their cost of capital locked up might go up. Many State governments have introduced additional levies to counter their apprehension of a loss of revenue under the GST. Besides the GST, there is the impact of the award of the Seventh Pay Commission to government employees. This effect will cascade to public sector organisations and State-level employees as well, and put pressure on prices. A third factor could be the loan waivers announced in some States which can cause fiscal stress. High deficit spending is not compatible with lower interest rates. A fourth factor is the uptick in commodity prices worldwide as metals and food prices are looking up.The last, and probably the most important, factor weighing on the MPCs mind would be inflation expectations. Household surveys conducted by the RBI indicate that people are expecting inflation to be close to 10% , not the 1.5% as is reported now. You may say that these expectations are irrational, but they do affect behaviour. In this season of salary increments, try giving someone a raise of 2%, as is common in the developed world. Workers will howl. Even their official dearness allowance is much higher. The real challenge is to slay this inflation expectations monster. In much of the western world, they are fighting disinflation if not outright deflation. But in India we are still struggling with inflationary conditions and expectations.In English the verb for inflation is inflate. It refers to rising prices. But in most Indian languages, the equivalent word in usage is  mehengaai , which refers to affordability and cost of living. Not all inflation is unwelcome. So if stock prices go up, that is good cheer. But  mehengaai  is hated by all. A low and stable inflation rate is a perquisite for sustained high economic growth. Mehengaai is antithetical to it. In the medium term, the growth impact of the GST, the improving ease of doing business  and hence increasing supply of goods  and a strong domestic currency, will all help keep inflation low. But the short run challenge is to temper inflationary expectations and keep them tethered.Ajit Ranade is an economist"

Poor supply from neighbouring States like Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh as well as drought in Tamil Nadu has pushed the prices up and, recently, many retail shops simply dont have any.Small onions, also known as sambhar vengayam in trade lingo, is an inevitable ingredient of Tamil cuisine. S Chandran, the president of the Koyambedu Wholesale Merchants Association, said: The market used to get Rs 40-50 tonnes of small onions per day from Karnataka, but it is now reduced to half. For example, today we received only 20 tonnes which has triggered the rise in price.At the Koyambedu wholesale market, the lowest quality of small onions is sold at Rs 80-90. The price goes up to Rs 100 for a better lot. In Koyambedus retail market, the minimum price is Rs 100 per kg. The price in the T Nagar retail market is between Rs 100-120.The Koyambedu market procures small onions from the Trichy markets which actually gets its supply from Mysore in Karnataka, Thuraiyur and Perambalur in Tamil Nadu.Lack of rainfall has affected the small onion yield in our State forcing us to depend on neighbouring states for supply, said R Jayakumar, a wholesale trader at Koyambedu market. Small onions being our major product of trade, we usually tend to buy at least 5 tonnes per day. But we now limit ourselves to 2 tonnes due to inadequacy in supply and hence the price hike. At normal times, the price of small onions would be as low as Rs 20-30 per kg, he added.We usually get at least 3-4 kg of small onions but with this price, we just have to cut down its usage. If we spend Rs 400 on small onions alone, it will really hit our budget, said a couple who were purchasing at a semi-wholesale small onion shop at Koyambedu market.I just have to replace it with big onions wherever possible, said B Ambika, at the vegetable market in T Nagar, lamenting that sambhar wont be the same without small onions.In contrast to small onions, big onions were available at just Rs 15 per kg at the retail markets of the city."

The page has been shared by a large number of people and is viral in WhatsApp as well. This would be detrimental to the health care system in particular and, in general, encourage such people who cheat the gullible public, he said.Further, Nayak said, Earlier, Shalini Rajneesh had posted about mid-brain activation, a fraud in which children are expected to read with blindfold. One of her posts had even advocated auto urine therapy for HIV, cancer and a number of such diseases. This sort of a thing is going to be detrimental to the promotion of public health when a top bureaucrat promotes such absurdities on social media, he said and appealed to minister to take action on this matter to stop posting of such fraudulent method of health care."

She should not have posted such unverified information.Narendra Nayak, convener, Consumers Education Trust of Mangalore, said: While it may be harmless to eat small raw onions and jaggery for most people, it may be dangerous for those who choose to follow this and not take proper treatment. He said: Is this cure endorsed by the Health Department and administered as treatment in government hospitals? If this really works and there is evidence for the same, it should be used as the standard protocol for all dengue patients. If it is not so, then she should retract and give a press note to that effect.Left to themReacting to the controversy, Ms. Rajneesh said it was a remedy tried out by government AYUSH practitioners. At a time when dengue is spreading rapidly, any remedial measure should be shared. Im not saying people should set aside all other scientific treatment and take only this. It is left to them to follow or not, she said and added that it was unfortunate that the AYUSH system of medicine that has history of over 5,000 years has no research to validate its treatment."
5a0e0b169855b76bf13d391b,Now  vegetables off the menu,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/now-vegetables-off-the-menu/article19353339.ece,2017-07-25,"A bag of vegetables is fast slipping out of the ambit of a budget kitchen.Rising price of vegetables is affecting most of the consumers as there is little alternative for vegetables, says V. Gomathi of Periyar Nagar in Erode. Dependence on non-vegetarian food has increased in the past one month from weekly once to thrice. We have to work on cost cutting measures for a balanced budget, she says.From tomatoes and small onions to even the fresh greens, prices of most vegetables are up across the region. It is the result of a combination of factors, say farmers, traders, and officials. Failure of monsoon last year and demonetisation had an impact on sowing, they say.Dharmapuri, Salem, Namakkal, Coimbatore and the Nilgiris are among the main horticulture crop growing centres in the State.Over 3,500 hectares are under tomato crop in the blocks of Mecheri, Kaadayampatti, Omalur, Pethanayakkanpalayam, Attur in Salem district. Small onion is raised in more than 4,000 hectares in Namakkal district and about 700 hectares in the Kolathur, Vazhappadi and Gangavalli blocks in Salem district.Repeated failure of monsoon resulted in standing crops withering in many parts, leading to fall in the arrival in the uzhavar santhais and open markets, say officials in Salem and Namakkal.Three kg of tomato was priced at Rs. 10 in May and now it is Rs. 60 - Rs. 64 a kg. During the peak season period, the uzhavar santhais used to receive about seven tonnes of tomatoes every day. Currently, about five tonnes of tomatoes reach the market.Following the commencement of small onion harvesting season in Salem District, there has been reasonable increase in the arrival of onion stock from the villages. The price of small onion which stood at more than Rs. 100 per kg last month, has come down. The price of good quality small onion stood at Rs. 84 and the second quality onion at Rs. 80 at the Salem Uzhavar Santhai on Sunday. The prices of tomatoes and small onions are expected to stabilise in the Salem wholesale markets once arrivals start from the nearby cultivation pockets.The shortage of rainfall and demonetisation seem to have played into the cropping area in Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts. Bathalahalli is the largest wholesale market that attracts traders from across the State and sends vegetables to Kerala too. The general fall in production of vegetables in Thally, Denkanikottai, Hosur and Rayakottai  whose farmers are the largest suppliers of cabbage, tomatoes, beans, carrots, beets, is one of the reasons for the price rise. The supply has fallen, but the demand has increased, say traders.President of Traders Association of Bathalahalli market Raja Reddy says the number of trucks loading vegetables is between 80 to 100 tonne on any day and it has remained almost the same, subject to availability of vegetables. The price of most vegetables range from Rs. 50 to Rs. 60 per kg. Beans has been going at Rs. 50 per kg for the last 6 months, he says. This year, tomato cultivation fell significantly. Its price at the market is Rs. 70 per kg, he adds. Normally, June- August witness a rise in tomato prices largely coinciding with the fall in the vegetables production in other growing regions of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh.The 70-day crop was hit right when demonetisation came. Farmers, who were already mid-way into the crop and awaiting harvest, were hit. To cut down on costs, the area of cultivation was also reduced, says a Rayakottai-based farmer.In the Nilgiris, though the prices of vegetables such as potatoes and tomatoes remains extremely high, English vegetables such as broccoli, carrots, beans and beetroot, which are produced in large quantities in the Nilgiris, have not seen a steep hike in prices.According to Raja Mohammed, a wholesale vegetable supplier, the wholesale rate of broccoli currently is Rs. 130 per kg., while carrots are sold for anywhere between Rs. 35-40 per kg. depending on the quality and freshness of the produce. Beetroot is also selling for between Rs. 28 to Rs. 35 per kg., which is the usual price that these vegetables are sold for during this season.The price of English vegetables increase only during the wedding season, when they are purchased in large quantities for feasts, he says. Though the prices of vegetables such as tomatoes and potatoes are still high, there has not been a major demand for cheaper alternatives, said other vegetable sellers in the Ooty Municipal Market.(With inputs from Syed Muthahar Saqaf in Salem, P.V.

If it is not so, then she should retract it and give a statement to that effect,"" Nayak said.While it may be harmless to eat small raw onions and jaggery, for some people it may be dangerous when they choose to follow this and not take proper treatment for dengue, Nayak warned.""I think this point should be clarified. While such statements by lay people and quacks can be dismissed, coming from a highly-placed and educated IAS officer of the health department tends to lend some credibility to it,"" Nayak said.Shalini was not available for comment."

The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."

Balakrishnadu from Kurnool, the sources said.Balakrishnadu was not aware of the origin of the contraband and he was asked to offload the onion bags in Rameswaram for a payment of Rs. 30,000, including diesel expenses, they said.The actual destination was Vedhalai or Uchippuli, the sources said. After smuggling the logs to Sri Lanka through the sea route, the smugglers might send them to China or Thailand from Negombo on the west coast of Sri Lanka, the sources suspected.Meanwhile, sources in forest department said the driver was arrested under Sections 35 and 36 of the Tamil Nadu Forest Act, and under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Timber Transit Rules.He was produced before a magistrate court, which remanded him in judicial custody, the sources added."

""Onion is stinking in the whole state. Besides, in Pipariya mandi alone, a scam of Rs 100 crore has taken place in the purchase of pulses,"" he alleged.Addressing the assembly, finance minister Jayant Mallaya said Rs 559 crore for PM Awas Yojana, Rs 76.91 crore for the ongoing expansion of the Mantralaya and Rs 700 crore for smart city schemes have also been provisioned in the budget among others.He said that Rs 40 crore has been sanctioned in the first supplementary for the Rs 1,000 crore agriculture price stabilization fund. The remaining funds would be sanctioned separately, he said.Referring to a better economic management in BJP government, he said that when the Congress was in power in 2003, the debt amount was 33.74 % of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) which has now been lowered to just 19.66 %.He said, ""the debt on the government hardly matters because our government is spending on infrastructure, education, health, power, irrigation and on the welfare of the people.""The FM said the per capita income in 2003-04 was Rs 8,234 which has increased seven folds and now stands at Rs 59,052.Earlier, the leader of the opposition criticised the budget provisions and said that most of the government money was wasted in publicising and projecting the image of chief minister.

The official contacted the AP State Red Sanders Anti-Smuggling Task Force (APSRSASTF) officials in Tirupati and passed on the information regarding the seizure of the contraband material.During interrogation, the T.N. police got information that it was a regular feature that some members of the red sanders smuggling network were operating between Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu through Karnataka. Ramanathapuram, the district close to the Sri Lankan coast, remained the ideal destination for the smugglers. The agents would pick up the stocks and facilitate smuggling of the precious wood to some specified locations along the Sri Lankas coast. Small ferries and fishing boats are said to be deployed to finish the deals.In the present case, Balakrishnudu had initially reached Tuticorin to unload the stock before reloading it for Sri Lanka destination. However, due to Coast Guard surveillance he had to reach Ramanathapuram, where he was apprehended. The logs were skilfully arranged beneath the onion bags to avoid detection at inter-State checkposts.Speaking to The Hindu , Circle-Inspector (Organised Crime-TNCID) Rajesh said the consignment was set to reach Sri Lanka. Though it is for the first time that we have made seizures of the red sanders in this case, we have information that regularly the goods [logs] would be coming to various locations in Ramanathapuram district, he said. The Task Force chief Inspector General of Police M. Kantha Rao on receiving information from the TN police directed a team of senior police personnel to follow-up the matter and track the possible exit routes from A.P. towards T.N. coastal districts.The networks links with Sri Lanka will be further probed. On a number of occasions, the Task Force tracked the vehicles with red sanders logs sneaking into Tamil Nadu, and successfully brought back the seized logs to our godowns, he said."

Shalini Rajneesh's post has come at a time the government has been criticised for not doing enough to prevent the disease and prompted one rationalist to describe her advice as ""quackery"". The principal secretary had forwarded the post yesterday citing the jaggery and small onions used in south Indian cuisine as an effective cure for dengue fever. The post, in Kannada, roughly translates to: ""There's nothing to lose with this easy-to-follow cure with no side effects. Take small onions with jaggery to cure dengue."" Rationalists slammed the post that came in the middle of the government's struggle to control the vector-borne disease, with hundreds of cases reported daily. ""This is nothing but quackery, that too propagated by the civil servant responsible for the state's healthcare system,"" scientist and rationalist Narendra Nayak told The Telegraph today after emailing a complaint to health minister Ramesh Kumar urging him to stop officials from spreading such misinformation. ""I just don't understand why educated people in responsible positions spread such unscientific claims. Onions and jaggery don't cure anything. A senior official like her should have been careful about forwarding such material that might encourage gullible people to consult quacks and endanger their lives,"" Nayak added. Nayak listed some previous instances too. ""She (Rajneesh) seems to be in the habit of posting such wrong information as she had earlier put up claims of urine therapy. I have listed all these posts in the complaint,"" he said, likening the opinion to Sangh Parivar's claims about cow-urine therapy. According to the Bangalore municipal corporation, 1,300 dengue cases have been reported so far this year. Rajneesh could not be reached for comment on her post, with aides saying she was ""busy in meetings"". Srinivas Kakkilaya, a doctor involved in the rationalist movement, said the bureaucrat should have initiated action to control breeding of mosquitoes. ""Firstly, dengue is a self-limiting illness, which goes away in three to four days without any treatment in 99.99 per cent cases. In rare cases of complications, the patient might need hospitalisation. So her (Rajneesh's) claim itself is wrong as jaggery and onion cannot cure dengue."" ""By vouching for something totally unscientific and unproven, she has gone against the recommendations of the (Union) health ministry that do not mention anything about jaggery or onion,"" Kakkilaya added. He was alluding to guidelines issued by the National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme."

My father was a chef and since my childhood, I have been watching him cook. I also wanted to get into the hotel industry and started my training in 2004 with Moti Mahal in New Delhi, which was the first restaurant in Delhi to serve tandoori chicken and naan. There I learnt the basics of Indian cuisine.After four months, I moved to Mumbai where I joined a kebab factory. In 2006, I joined the Marriott, and since then I was with this hotel albeit in different cities. After three years in Mumbai, I moved to Dubai for 16 months, then to Ahmedabad for three years and now I am here in Chennai.I have travelled to quite a lot of places in India and I love to cook Indian the most. We have 29 States here, and there are so many cuisines. There is so much to explore in Indian cuisine and Im still trying to learn as much as possible. I can cook Maharashtrian, Delhi cuisine, which is the food from my hometown, Mughalai, which is the root of Hyderabadi cuisine.Initially, I did not fancy South Indian food, but now I am exploring this cuisine as well. Im understanding how this cuisine works and how the ingredients are used. I have noticed that the ingredients in the recipes remain the same everywhere, hence retaining its authenticity. In Awadhi cuisine, we use ginger-garlic paste. But for South Indian dishes, we use chopped garlic and ginger in rasam or chopped onion in sambar and that makes the dish much more flavoursome. I find this cuisine healthy, as the dishes are made with coconut oil, which has many health benefits, unlike Mughalai or Awadi cuisine that uses a lot of ghee and butter.Indian cuisine is known for its spices and it is just amazing to know how the variety of spices is used to cook dishes in every region. For instance, Maharashtrian cuisine uses roots of vegetables, Mughalai food uses patthar ke phool (black stone flower or kalpasi) in their dishes, giving it an umami flavour. But these spices may not be used in Hyderabadi or Kerala cuisine. An important thing about Indian food is even if you miss an ingredient, you lose out on the flavour.My best dishes are Kashmiri mutton rogan josh, kebabs and Awadhi biryani. I believe my rogan josh is extra special because the recipe was passed on to me by my aunt, who is a Kashmiri. I have also learnt some Kashmiri dishes from her  Kashmiri rose tea and Kahwah (green tea) among others.I want to explore Kerala cuisine next. One of my most favourite South Indian dishes is karimeen polichhathu. There are very little ingredients and it is cooked in banana leaf. But the flavour and taste it gives out is just mouth-watering."

However, the press statement has not convinced the doctors.The statement says, In an attempt to spread information about the utility of simple add-on therapies like decoction of amruta balli, papaya leaves and onion, material pertaining to prevention and adjuvant therapy is being circulated. The ingredients are commonly available, cost effective and generally, would not cause an untoward reaction in the body.The classical texts of Ayurveda (Sushruta Samhita, Charaka Samhita, Dhanvantri Nighantu and a textbook on Dravyaguna) mention the use of onion as a haemostatic agent in bleeding disorders. To check bleeding, platelets are inevitable, and the combination of palm jaggery and onion would usher in that effect, the statement reads.People may contact AYUSH doctors working across the state in various dispensaries and seek more information regarding preventive and adjuvant therapy for dengue. There are 1,400 AYUSH doctors working in various government hospitals, it says.Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, consultant physician, Spandana Centre for Metabolic Medicine, Mangaluru, said, Dengue is not a bleeding disorder. Reduction of platelets is not the primary problem in dengue. It is one of the complications. There may be inflammation of blood capillaries and thereafter leakage, resulting in reduction of platelet count. By recommending something that is used for blood disorders for dengue as a remedy, the officials are further misleading the laymen.There is no mention of the word virus in Charaka Samhita. When something does not even recognise the infection, how can they recommend remedy? The National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme and WHO have a standard protocol for clinical management of dengue and it only mentions modern medicine, not AYUSH. When infectious diseases are not even mentioned in Ayurveda, how can they prescribe treatment, primary or adjuvant or otherwise? he questioned.Shalini Rajneesh was unavailable for comment. Dr Anant Desai, Associate Professor, Government Ayurveda College, said, We are merely saying it helps in controlling bleeding and can be used as a home remedy, not as a cure. During fever-like conditions, jaggery helps and onion has haemostatic agents."

The traders, who are forced to pay taxes after Madras High Court warned them of closure, are now raising pertinent questions about abject conditions of facilities inside the market.On any given day, the market, which receives around 14,000 vehicles on average, including trucks, vans, auto-rickshaws, tricycles, two-wheelers and cycles, hardly has any facilities, not even basic ones like drinking water and clean toilets, to serve the thousands who visit.If they dont set up the basic facilities, how can they seek tax and maintenance fees from us, asked a trader, angry at the Market Management Committee (MMC) for its move to seal shops that fail to pay a maintenance fee.Traders are fuming that they have to pay a maintenance fee for a market that is ill-maintained and lacks adequate truck bays for loading and unloading perishable goods.Kamal Vishwa, who owns a vegetable shop and was facing the heat for not paying the fee, said the private firm that took the maintenance contract has not been cleaning the market regularly.We have been allotted a space to throw vegetable waste. But as it is seldom cleaned, we dont have any alternative but to throw it in front of the shops, said Vishwa, who has paid the dues grudgingly.The market collects nearly 200 tonnes of garbage every day, which the MMC claims, is sent to the treatment plant.There are 68 toilets in Koyambedu market which were renovated at a cost of around `4 crore but traders complained that these still are not maintained properly. An onion truck driver confided to Express that unclean toilets forced him to use the open ground in front of the market to ease himself.However, officials denied toilets were badly maintained, but still blamed the traders for the poor condition.The toilets are renovated with high cost and it is also the responsibility of the traders to take care of it. People consume alcohol and break bottles inside the toilet creating a mess, and then blame the management, a top MMC official alleged in response.The official added that efforts are being made to have access control in the market as well as regulating parking inside the truck bays of the market. However, the issue is sub judice. We are hoping to implement it by the middle of next month once the case is settled, said an MMC official.Aside from this, the lack of parking regulations inside the market has resulted in chaos. Vehicles from other States are parked for a long time affecting trade, said Illango, a shop owner, pointing to the truck from Rajasthan which was parked in front of his shop.Now to access the goods from my truck parked at a distance, I have to hire workers to carry it from there. This is a usual scene during peak hours, he alleged.The market also does not have water facilities for more than a decade. The three reverse osmosis plants proposed long back at a cost of `58 lakh have yet to be inaugurated. Officials now say these would be inaugurated in the first week of August.The three plants are being set up in the 1st gate for the flower market, 4th gate for the fruit market and 14th gate for the vegetable market.Meanwhile, the MMC is likely to seal 80 more shops for not paying the maintenance fee. The fee is `1 per square foot that was fixed in 1998. The cost of clearing one tonne of waste in `1,000 these days. Vendors dont understand that the service MMC provides to them is funded by the fee collected from them, said a top MMC official."

I am not trying to show off...but we had...tomato soup along with tomato rice for lunch today [sic], read a Facebook post.Not just tomatoes, onion prices have also been showing an upward trend, with an average increase of Rs. 1 per kg over 10 days.Rajendra Prasad Sharma of Sharma and Company said the supply of onions had been disrupted due to heavy rain.Onion is supplied from Nashik, where heavy rain has disrupted supply. Prices have increased from Rs. 10 per kg to Rs. 20 per kg in less than 10 says, said Mr. Sharma.He, however, refused to speculate on far the prices might go up in the near future.Common phenomenonThe prices of seasonal vegetables, such as bottle gourd, bitter gourd and okra, have also doubled over the past fortnight.Hemant, a commission agent who deals in vegetables, however, argued that the rise in prices of vegetables was a common phenomenon during this part of the year.Crops are damaged due to heavy rain during monsoon, which in turn affects supply. The prices will continue to remain high for another two months, said Mr. Hemant.However, before the vegetables reach the kitchen, the prices go up by another 30-40%, making them unaffordable for the common man.Ram Pal, a squatter near Shani Mandir in Sector 37, argued that despite selling the vegetables at a rate 30-40% higher than the wholesale price, he ended up making only a marginal profit.I need to make up for the damaged and unsold vegetables and also recover the transportation cost. So, I end up making just Rs. 3-4 per kg after a hard days hard work, said Mr.Pal.Potato prices, however, continue to hover around Rs. 4-5 per kg on account of overproduction this year."

The programme is funded by the State Government with support from the Centres Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana (National Agriculture Development Scheme).AVRDC, a wing of the World Vegetable Centre, has given a new alternative to the farmers of the State by promoting onion production during the wet summer or kharif season, a practice that was never considered possible because of waterlogging problems, said sources in the Horticulture department.The programme is guided by Arshad Ahmad Pal, post-harvest specialist and Principal Investigator in the World Vegetable Centre's South Asia regional office in Telengana.Piloted in the six districts in 2016, the programme was a big success with the farmers getting a yield of about 17 tonnes per hectare (ha) compared to 12 tonnes during rabi season, the sources said.The farmers are now keen on expanding kharif onion production, the sources said adding, the government is contemplating to roll out the programme to other districts after successful completion of the project next year.Onions are grown in winter season in the State and farmers sell their crop right after the harvest due to lack of storage facility.

There has been no MEP for the past 19 months. ""The Centre is keeping a close watch on onion prices in wholesale markets,"" a government source told TOI.Members of the Lasalgaon Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) have attributed the price spurt to short supply on account of a lull in harvest. ""Harvest of fresh kharif crop will begin only in mid-October. Currently, the onions arriving in the market are from old stocks. This is the crop harvested in March and April,"" said an APMC official. Lasalgaon in Nashik is the country's biggest wholesale onion market.The official said the district's farmers, who are in financial trouble, preferred to store onions in the hope of getting better prices. He said that, in June, Lasalgaon received between 22,000 and 30,000 quintals of onions per day.Over the past two weeks, the supply is 12,000-20,000 quintals. ""This indicates that farmers have already sold the onions they had stored and they may have limited stocks now. Hence, the rise in price,"" a source added.Lasalgaon APMC chairman Jaydatta Holkar said, ""The Madhya Pradesh government recently bought 80 lakh quintals following a rise in demand in the state. Moreover, Gujarat is reeling under floods and the the kharif crop areas have reduced. This has led to a rise in demand and average wholesale prices."

Until last week, onion was selling at Rs 15-18 per kg but this week it has reached Rs 25-30 per kg. As they are used in almost all dishes, rise in prices of tomato and onions always disrupts the household budget.Wholesale price of onion has gone up from Rs 6-8 per kg to Rs 15-18 per kg. As per traders, the hike is because of incessant rains in Maharashtra , from where the state and city gets maximum supply.Another major reason is GST (Goods and Services Tax). ""Most of the transport companies have not revised their systems under GST so very few trucks are plying. Lack of carriage has hit supply, and in turn, the cost,"" said Arvind, a wholesale vegetable dealer of Dubagga.""Also, because of monsoon, the transportation time has increased from three to five days, which turns onions stale. More than 30% of them are discarded because of poor quality,"" said Sheraz Sadiq, another vendor.With seasonal vegetables already selling at a relatively high price because of heavy rains in the producing states, the overall cost of raw vegetables has sky-rocketed in the city.Housewife Shruti Singh said, ""Because of vegetables getting costlier, especially onions and tomatoes , the cost of each meal has gone up. Cooking chicken is cheaper than preparing a vegetarian dinner. Worst part is that though vegetables can be replaced by meat, there is no substitute for onions.""Bank employee Ritika Sharma said she has resorted to buying vegetables from wholesale market even though she has to buy a week's quota in advance.

As far as Monday's strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption.The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. ""If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong.

There was no triple bumper crop? So, where did all this dal come from?The state government doesn't procure dal, but it did so this year to cool down the embers of the violent farmer agitation in June. Officials procured 15,000 metric tonnes of toor from Tendukheda. When TOI contacted superintendent of land records, Narsinghpur, H L Tiwari, he said that the net sown area of toor dal in Tendukheda was ""around 8,000 hectares this year"". At 15,000MT, the average yield per hectare comes to 1.78MT which is thrice the average yield in the last five years.Information provided to TOI under RTI by the Madhya Pradesh land records department says that the average production of toor dal in the state was 0.32 metric tonne per-hectare in 2010-11. It rose to 0.63 metric tonne/hectare in 2011-12, 0.69 metric tonne/hectare in 2012-13, 0.72 metric tonne/hectare in 2013-14 and fell to 0.65 metric tonne/hectare in 2014-15. If you take the highest production on 8,000 hectares, it would only be around 5,000MT. That's 10,000MT short of what was procured. The same quantity of moong dal was procured from the same tehsil this year, though the yield per hectare is lower than toor and it was sown in less area in the tehsil.Pulses are being procured at Rs 5,000 per quintal from farmers, while the market rate is around Rs 3,500/quintal. The government spent Rs 18 crore in procuring more than 30,000MT of toor and moong from Tendukheda alone.After complaints, the agriculture department set up a probe committee comprising officials from agriculture and the co-operative Markfed. It submitted its probe report to the government on July 29, said sources.Principal secretary agriculture, Rajesh Rajora who ordered the probe said, ""We have received the report and have sent it to the government for further action."" He wouldn't comment on the contents of the report, but sources say it points out several anomalies in procurement."

The Maitree stores will sell the vegetable without keeping profit, Principal Secretary, Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Department, Pradipta Mohapatra told this paper.After a meeting with representatives of the Mahasangh (Federation of All Odisha Traders Associations) at the State Secretariat, Mohapatra attributed the sudden price rise of onion to rising cost of the vegetable at source.Odisha being a consuming state largely depends on Nashik in Maharashtra, a major onion market of the country, to meet its requirement of the edible bulb. Rise in the price of the vegetable from `8-a-kg to `15 in source market has its cascading effect on the consuming states, said Mahasangha general secretary Shakti Samanta Mishra.Holding Madhya Pradesh government responsible for the spurt in the prices in major onion mandis of Maharashtra, Mishra said large scale procurement of onion from farmers and damage of the vegetable due to poor storage facility has further accentuated the crisis.Though the country had bumper rabi harvest of onion, large scale damage of kharif crop and traders meeting their export commitments had its effect on the domestic market, Mishra added.He, however, said there is no disruption in the supply of onion to the State which is receiving 1,600 to 2,500 tonnes daily. There has been a fall in supply from Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh due to rains. The average requirement of onion in the city is about 200 to 250 tonnes.We have agreed to the State Government proposal for supplying onion to the fair price shops in the Twin City of Cuttack and Bhubaneswar in the first phase. If the situation persists, the vegetable will be supplied to other Maitree shops in rest of the districts at wholesale price, he added.The wholesale price of onion at Aiginia mandi is about `16-18-a-kg. The ideal price of the vegetable in retail markets of the city is `20 to `22-a-kg, Mishra said."

Farmers in Madhya Pradeshs Neemuch-Mandsaur belt are feeling cheated as well. Just two months ago they were facing police bullets for demanding better prices for their bumper crop of onions, which they had to dump by the truckloads on the streets.In January-February, the same region had seen protests over a tomato glut, with prices crashing to as low as Rs 2 per kg. The subsequent onion bumper crop dragged its price to Rs 2 a kilogram, forcing many farmers to let their produce rot in the fields.We have noticed that whenever farmers have perishable items with them, the prices are in the dumps, and the moment it goes into the hands of traders, there is a massive price spike, says Bhupendra Patidar, a farmer from Barbariya village in Neemuch district.Six farmers were killed in clashes with police in the Neemuch-Mandsaur region in the first week of June, leading to protests across the state and a demand for government assured minimum price at local markets. The protests forced the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government to procure onions at Rs 8 per kg.Two months down the line, when the farmers have nothing to sell and are busy sowing for the next season, the prices of most agriculture products have shot up.In May, the average price of tomatoes in Mandsaurs wholesale market was Rs 500-700 per quintal. In August first week, it touched Rs 4,500. Similarly, the price of onions almost doubled from Rs 400 to Rs 800 per quintal during the same period.Skyrocketing prices Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few months Average price of onion and tomato has been witnessing a sharp spike across the country over past few monthsWith local traders adding their profit margin, tomatoes are retailing at Rs 100 or more per kg in most parts of the country. The retail price of onion has crossed Rs 30 per kg, with a further spike expected till the fresh produce lands in September.Small and marginal farmers who constitute 85% of the farming community rarely get the benefit of high prices. The reason being they dont have storage facilities to take benefit of the price fluctuation, says Patidar, who witnessed the dumping of unsold onions and tomatoes by the roadside this year.After last years losses, like most farmers, we did not grow tomatoes this season. But now the prices are sky high and only the traders have it, says Jaswant Carpenter of Pipliyamandi, the epicentre of the farmers protest in Mandsaur.Traders, however, blame low production for tomato prices sky-rocketing.There is less production this year and therefore low supply. Most of it is in the hands of the big traders who are releasing it slowly from the cold storage so that the prices do not come down, says a government official in Indore, not wanting to be named.Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh president Shiv Kumar Sharma blames the government for the price fluctuations. In the last 14 years, the government has failed to increase storage capacity for onions or tomatoes as a result of which vegetables rot during bumper production and only traders benefit by hoarding it.Given the current spate of rains and floods, traders see no relief in sight due to supply disruption which is likely to continue till August-end. In fact, prices of other vegetables such as brinjal and cabbage will also rise due to reduced supply as the summer vegetable season comes to an end.(With inputs from Mustafa Hussain)"

""The Biju Mahila Janata Dal (BJD's women's wing) will stage protest in all district headquarters against the anti-woman move,"" he said. Pramila Mullick, the BJD women's wing president, said the government undertook publicity campaigns to ensure that maximum women use LPG leaving behind firewood. When it became a habit for them, the government now is suddenly withdrawing the benefits so that the oil companies can make money. ""There can't be a worse form of deceit by the government,"" she said. ""We will announce dates of our agitation on Wednesday,"" she said.The BJD members on Tuesday joined the opposition in the protest against the LPG price hike move in Rajya Sabha.

""Only the rich people who are getting undue benefits of subsidy, like the MLAs, MPs and bureaucrats will have to pay the actual price.""Political insiders feel the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana (PMUY), the subsidized cooking gas scheme for economically weaker sections, is a major reason why the saffron party has been able to made inroads into newer territories at the grassroots. Now, the decision to withdraw subsidizes from the middle class may boomerang, they feel. ""It may become a setback to the momentum gained by the saffron party in Odisha after its impressive performance in the panchayat election in February,"" an analyst said.For the BJD, the move comes as a godsend political weapon. ""It will help bring Dharmendra to a spot of bother at a time when there is constant media scrutiny of BJD's poll expenditure,"" he added.The Samajwadi Party state unit said the Centre's move to hike domestic LPG cylinder price by Rs 4 a month is contrary to the Centre's slogan of 'clean energy and healthy life of women'.

India consumes almost 90 per cent of the home-grown produce, but 10 per cent export is necessary to prevent a price crash.Onion exports from India have recorded a 10-year high in 2016-17, with the country recording export of 34.92 lakh tonnes (lt) of the bulb. The Central governments decision to provide repeated extension to the export subsidy and zero minimum export price (MEP) of the produce has fuelled the exports in the last year or so. Exports of onions play a crucial role in balancing the domestic price of the produce in the wholesale markets. India consumes almost 90 per cent of the home-grown produce, but 10 per cent export is necessary to prevent a price crash. Exports had virtually stopped in 2014 due to the Central governments decision to increase the minimum export price (MEP) in view of the steep increase in onion prices. Due to a glut in the prices of the bulb in 2015, the Central government had again reduced the MEP to zero (0) in December 2015. Also, the Central government had announced a 5 per cent export subsidy for onions to clear the glut in produce.Since 2015, the exports of onions have seen a steady rise and at the end of the financial year 2016-17, 34.92 lt of the bulb was exported out of the country. This was almost three times the exports of the previous year when 11.14 lt of onions was sent to foreign shores. On an average, around 10 lt of onions are exported from the country every year. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), Sri Lanka, Singapore, Malayasia and Russia are major export destinations for Indian onion.Jagdish Apshunde, an exporter from Nashik, said the governments subsidy and the zero MEP has helped increase the export of the bulb. In June, the central government extended the subsidy for three more months to help clear the glut in the domestic markets. Exports, however, had failed to do much to improve the domestic price of onions which has been trading between Rs 5-6 per kg at most of the wholesale markets in the state.Over the last two weeks, prices of onions have seen a spike, with the Lasalgoan market recording an average price of Rs 12 per kg. This price rise, Apshunde said, was temporary and will remain till the Kharif crop arrives early September. Market sources pointed out that the price rise was due to stockists wading in the market in anticipation of a shortage in the future. Agriculture analyst Deepak Chavan said the rise in price is due to fundamental market forces. The outlook for the arrival of Kharif crop  the crop which is to arrive in September  is bleak. Onions from Karnataka start arriving by the end of August and there is a 40 per cent dip in the sowing area there, he said. The dip in sowing, Chavan said, was due to farmers going for other crops due to low prices of onions. While Maharashtra has reported near normal sowing of 10,000 hectares, prices, according to Chavan, would be bullish in the face of a dip in arrival of onionthis year.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

(Express Archive) Summer tomato, harvested between May and July, sees bigger investments by farmers who expect better price realisations. (Express Archive)Speaking of tomatoes, excuse me, why arent we speaking of tomatoes? Theyve reached Rs 100 per kg. Or why arent we crying over the price of onions which has, apparently, spiraled 119 per cent in 10 days (ABP News)? These are seasonal (vegetable) problems, were told. Perhaps. But theyre of far more immediate concern to the public/viewer than politicians who are men and women for all seasons. And dont you remember that Delhis BJP government was brought to tears at the hustings in 1998 by onions?Why not also discuss, debate, expose the abysmal condition of public hygiene and sanitation? When was the last time you didnt see a male or female perform (ablutions) in public  and when, if ever, have you heard a discussion about toilets or garbage disposal or the menace of plastic? The PM cries foul but why doesnt his Mann Ki Baat or the Swachch Bharat advertisements on TV and radio on such fundamental issues make breaking news, headlines or (super) prime time debates? If the price was right, wed throw a few tomatoes at them.Lets not throw any at ABP. On Monday, at prime time, it went on the onion trail from Alwar to Nasik and onto Madhya Pradesh where it found them rotting. They bit into tomatoes too and tried to explain the price rise in both. It was a detailed, in- depth report. Odd that they should be recognised for doing what ought to be routine. More, please.Someone who was pretty red-faced under his skin but did a good job of hiding it is Nitish Kumar. The newly sworn-in chief minister of Bihar for the nth time, was at a televised press conference on Monday, bleeding, sorry, pleading, almost for understanding of the impossible position Lalu & Sons had placed him in. By the time he proclaimed Modi as the winner of the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he looked somewhat crumpled, as if someone had sat upon him.Flashback to October 2015 and recall his stirring campaign speeches we watched during the Bihar assembly campaign when he challenged the PM to beat him in the state. On Walk the Talk (April, 2016, NDTV 247), soon after calling for a Sangh mukt India, he spoke of the BJPs ideology that was potentially poisonous as it divides society; of the need to set aside differences to fight the BJP, etc. What a difference two years makes in politics.If all this worldliness in politics is distasteful and soul destroying, never fear, help is near. Double digit spiritual/religious TV channels are available to salve your disillusioned heart. There are some 20-odd such channels on Tata Sky, including its own devotion channels. More than a dozen of these are related to Hindu spiritual discourse, with Lord Buddha TV, Shalom TV, God TV, Goodness TV for religious diversity. Didnt see one devoted to Islam, which only means that they are not on the popular bandwidths because they do exist.And what on earth is YO TV? No clue, after watching it. Speaking of Tata Sky, it has a bouquet of its own channels which offer education with entertainment and exercise: Tata Sky Fitness, Tata Sky Dance keeps you on your toes, Tata Sky Comedy plays old sitcoms for a laugh, Amitabh Bachchan promises you can learn to act (like him?) on Tata Sky Acting, theres Classic Cinema for those who want to remember when Sunil met Nargis, Tata with Javed Akhtar for the poet in you, Tata Sky Gurus to teach you a few lessons, etcetra, etcetra. Some of it is far superior to what entertainment channels offer.What one of them is offering just now is Pehredaar Piya Ki (Sony TV) in which nine-year-old Prince Ratan marries a woman twice his age, Diya. The age difference would be an emancipating thing for TV soaps but for Ratan being a child groom. They marry in order for her to protect him  again a liberating idea  but decidedly odd and disturbing since surely there are other ways to protect a child? Especially, when Ratan is besotted by her.

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 2: The state government today resorted to market intervention by fixing the price limit for onion, which is now selling at Rs 25 a kg in retail market. Food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro today asked the traders to sell onion within Rs 17 per kg and warned stern action in case of hoarding the commodity. Patro said the department had been instructed to keep close watch over the price situation. Officials will purchase onion from the source and sell it at fair price shops of the government named as ""Maitree"" at reasonable price. In the first phase, it will be sold in Bhubaneswar and Cuttack. The department has been asked to keep a token of Re 1 profit margin per kg and sell it to make the retail price affordable for the consumers. However, consumers have been left high and dry as onion price is now selling in the city at Rs 25 per kg. The price of onion was Rs 15 per kg early last week. The rise in onion price following the soaring of tomato price has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at Rs 100 per kg in retail market. The state needs nearly five lakh tonnes of onion annually of which it produces nearly three to 3.5 lakh tonnes. Odisha produces onions mainly in Kalahandi, Balangir, Boudh and Angul districts as well as a few areas in the state's western districts. Odisha depends mainly on Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh for procurement of onions. Wholesalers said the recent floods in Nashik and crop loss in Andhra Pradesh had led to the price rise. ""The price of onion has increased at source points. The city is getting the normal supply of 10 to 15 trucks of onion on daily basis, but as the price has increased in the procurement areas, it has its impact in the state as well,"" said Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha secretary Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current price would prevail till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and then the price will stabilise,"" said Panda. Farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of lack of adequate number of cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to the over-production of the crop. ""However, the state government is yet to come up with adequate cold storages to ease the problem,"" said Abhiram Jena, a farmer. On the other hand, consumers are still bearing the brunt of price rise. ""The consumers have been badly hit by the skyrocketing prices of vegetables during rains. In this circumstances, price rise of onions will definitely put burden on us,"" said Nirakar Pradhan, a consumer."

They attributed the reasons for the same to shortage in stocks from their suppliers in the neigbouring states. The price has gone from Rs 20 per kg earlier this week to Rs 25 now.""Vegetable suppliers from the neighouring states are slowly running out of their existing onion stock. The rates will continue to remain high until the new crop is harvested there,"" they said.Weather parameters also played spoilsport resulting into loss of fresh stock.""Onions that were en route from Kolhapur and Nashik to Goa got soaked and spoiled on their way to the local markets. Therefore, the increase in rates,"" said vendor, Sadiq Shaikh.Tomato rates that continued to remain high for a large portion of July have considerably lowered this month. From going at Rs 80 per kg until earlier this week, the ripe reds have now come down to Rs 60 per kg. The rates are far lower in wholesale and at the horticulture run outlets across Goa. Tomatoes are sold at Rs 55 per kg at wholesale outlets, while horticulture outlets are selling it at Rs 45 per kg.""The tomato production in Maharashtra and Karnataka, where the tomatoes are sourced from, is slowly normalizing. As the supply is flowing in there, the stocks coming to Goa are also increasing leading to the drop in rates,"" said vendor Mohammad Rafiq.""New crop harvest is also awaited which will further increase the supply of tomatoes to the state,"" said vendor, Mehboob Niralgi.Horticulture officials remained optimistic that both tomato and onion rates will drop post-Ganesh Chaturthi season in Goa.The average wholesale onion price has shot up once again with 81% rise in just 24 hours at the country's largest wholesale onion market at Lasalgaon, Maharashtra, due to rise in demand as compared to supply.The average wholesale onion prices increased by Rs 1,030 per quintal in just a day from Rs 1,270 per quintal on Wednesday to Rs 2,300 per quintal on Thursday (August 3).

Supplies of onions in Market Yard have dwindled because of rotting in the godowns during the rains.Meanwhile, the price of tomato , the other kitchen staple, simmered to Rs 50-60 per kg from Rs 100 in July. Dilip Khaire, chief administrator of Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC), Pune told TOI that the rainy season often sees fluctuation in prices because of the problem it poses for reaping vegetables from the fields.""The recent rise in onion prices is the result of stocks rotting in the godowns they are stored in during the recent rain,"" Khaire said. He added that vegetable crops are susceptible to disease during the rainy season. ""Areas around Pune, such as Velhe, Mulshi, Bhor, Ambegaon and Junnar, that are to the west of Pune received good rainfall in the last few days, which caused supply problems in many vegetables, including onions,"" he saidNew onion stocks will enter the markets post-Diwali, Khaire added. APMC officials had earlier told TOI that incessant rain after mid-July damaged the tomato crops, causing supply to fall and prices to go up to Rs 100 per kg.Onion supply data from APMC showed that since August 1, when close to 11,423 quintals of onions came into the APMC market, supplies dipped to 9,615 quintals on August 2 and 8,985 quintals on August 3.Though 18,760 quintals of onion entered the wholesale market on August 4, prices continued their upward trendfrom Rs 700 to Rs 1,500 on August 1 to Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,600 on August 4. Another APMC official said onions in the wholesale market were being sold at around Rs 22 per kg on Thursday, which went up to Rs 25 on Friday.""The reduction in rainfall over the last few days has also caused a dip in cultivation of vegetables, including onions,"" he said. Yakub Pathan, owner, Fresh Vegetable Market, Wakad, said the retail price of onion is bound to be higher on Saturday.""From Rs 30 on Friday, it may go up to Rs 35 to Rs 40 on Saturday depending on the supply with retailers. Tomato supplies have normalized to an extent, but onion supplies are 50% less in the wholesale market on account of some stocks rotting due to rains,"" said Pathan.Vegetable vendors in the city on Friday were selling onions at Rs 30 per kg, as against Rs 15 on August 2. ""Tomato prices have come down to Rs 50-Rs 60. Though tomato prices have come down there is less supply,"" Inder Sen, a vendor in Koregaon Park, said."

SrinathM_SRINATHWhile the price of small onions continues to rule high, the price of Bellary onions too has shot up in the city in tune with the nationwide trend. The price has shot up to Rs. 26 a kg in the wholesale market here over the past one week.Wholesale traders at the Gandhi Market, which caters to retail traders in several neighbouring districts, attributed the hike to the sharp fall in arrivals from Maharashtra and also due to heavy rainfall in Gujarat and Rajasthan.The retail price of the onion is higher by at least Rs. 5 a kg. Just about a week back, it was being sold at Rs. 13 a kg in the wholesale market.Wholesale traders say that the market was getting about 10 truck loads of Bellary onions from Maharashtra, accounting for just about 200 tonnes a day. Usually, the market receives about 600 tonnes a day, said A. Thangaraj, General Secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association.Mr. Thangaraj said that the arrivals had come down over the past 10 days. We get bulk of the supply from Maharashtra normally during this period. But arrivals have come down, apparently as traders and farmers in Maharashtra are holding back supplies as production has been hit in some States due to heavy rain and floods, he said.Meanwhile, the price of small onions continued to rule high at the market at Rs. 70 a kg.The retail price in the city is around Rs. 80 a kg. Arrivals from different parts of the State continue to remain low in view of the drought. We are getting about 100 tonnes a day against the normal 300 tonnes, he said.The rise in price of Bellary onions, close on the heels of a steep rise in the price of small onions, has left consumers worried. Onions form part of our essential buys every day. It is a matter of concern that the price of Bellary onions, which we had been using in place of small onions over the past month or so, too has increased, observed G. Chithra, a resident of K. K. Nagar in the city.Onion traders say that the price situation, as far as Bellary onions are concerned, would depend on exports. If exports continue, there is a possibility of the price going further up, they said."

Keeping in mind our love for all things hot, crispy and spicy, Tatva, the vegetarian fine dine restaurant at Jubilee Hills, has revamped their menu to line up the best of monsoon eats.Available between 3 pm and 7 pm, the variety includes the local flavours such as Palak Pakoda, Onion bhajji, mirapakaya bajji and then a variety of the classic Indian bites such as Til-ki-tikki, seekha kebab roll, veg kurkure besides the continental ones such as Mac & Cheese bites, onion rings. and Mexican pizza. The common thread here is that all are freshly prepared and served steaming hot. The price is ` 200. Then, of course, they have all the popular bevarages  coffee, tea etc.Executive Chef Naveen of Tatva, who has served in cruise ships before he landed in Hyderabad a few years ago, says his previous work experience has taught him how different folks love different strokes and hence the variety in the fare. The restaurant that opened in November 2016 initially started off as a cafe, but with demand for fine dine food, has transformed into a place that you would look at when you want an elaborate meal.I am not exaggerating if I say that you will need to visit Tatva at least five times before you can claim to have tasted all our specialties. From starters to the desserts, Tatva  unapologetically vegetarian  has something innovative to offer. The hot, spicy and heady Hot Toddy in their mocktail section is a must-try. This toddy is one with no alcohol, but has a generous dose of Indian spices  cardamom, clove, star anise, cinnamon and pepper floating happily in hot apple juice. Highly recommended for a monsoon evening.The starters such as tasty Jalapeno Poppers are done to perfection. So are crackling spinach and water chestnut starter. The main course has a good choice of Indian breads and curries too besides continental food. The desserts are all about innovation and the Paan Tantra is what you must have. The Indian betel leaf flavoured ice cream comes in a unique glass jar . Tatva also serves Jain food  no onion, no garlic  food and the regular fare can be converted into Jain food of the guests want.The Monsoon Delights  on till August end, is a good excuse to sample their rainy fare and also get a taste of their other flavours."

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"
5a00cc4d9855b76bf13a48ee,Address it fast,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/626785/address-fast.html,2017-08-06,"Address it fastSudhirendar Sharma, Aug 8 2017, 9:26 ISTFrom being thrown on the streets in Mandsaur to being protected by the police in Mumbai in the past few weeks, tomato has turned out to be the truly red-faced farm commodity in last few weeks.Tomato has joined onion and pulses as the latest victim of price fluctuations that has left farmers and consumers fuming. While farmers were forced to sell tomato at less than Rs 5 per kg, consumers are compelled to buy it at Rs 100 per kg.Price distortions of farm commodities are a continuing phenomenon, as farmers lack control over pricing their own produce. More shocking is the fact that at the receiving end are 30% of rural households who cultivate 82% of arable land in the country.With most landholdings being less than one hectare, the capacity of small holders to bear loss on their produce is anything but suicidal. One farmer suicide every 40 minutes in the country reflects a systemic failure.The crisis amplifies when a previous year high price for a particular crop entices farmers to expand cultivation of the said crop in the following year. Farmers in Andhra Pradesh were shocked when tomatoes fetched Rs 551 per quintal in June this year compared to Rs 3,015 per quintal during the same month last year.Neither was there a drop in consumption of tomatoes nor was there an unexpected glut in the market. And, yet price plummeted like never before. Despite fertilisers and power subsidies, cost of cultivation has been on the increase each year. With farmers not making profit on their small produce (on an average farmers keep 25% produce for home consumption), about 52% of agricultural households are in debt.Average household debt is Rs 47,000. This is unlikely to change as annual income of median farmers is merely Rs 20,000 or just Rs 1,666 per month as per Economic Survey of 2016. That the middlemen and traders are milking large share of the profit is no breaking news. Shocking is the fact that in addition to farmers and consumers bearing the brunt, the state too is at the receiving end of price distortions.Having purchased 8.76 lakh tonnes of onion at a support price of Rs 8 per kg during last five weeks, the Madhya Pradesh State Cooperative Marketing Federation is now forced to sell the same at Rs 2 per kg via the public distribution system.Price distortions have caught the government by surprise too. To avoid onion stocks from rotting over, the Madhya Pradesh State Civil Supplies Corporation could fetch only Rs 2-3 per kg in the open market.One reason for the glut in onion had to do with the Federation purchasing it at a high price which encouraged the farmers from Maharashtra and Gujarat to unload their produce in Madhya Pradesh. However, the cumulative loss to the exchequer in this transaction alone is worth Rs 900 crore.What is true for tomato and onion is equally true for other commodities including pulses. Having stocked two million tonnes of pulses during last two years, crash in market price of pulses has left the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation (Nafed) high and dry.All this lends credence to the argument that farmers get no more than 25% of the price that consumers pay, and the minimum support price in the best of circumstances benefits only 6% farmers.Under such conditions, does the governments stated objective of doubling farmers income by 2022 hold any ground? Far from taking the price distortion issue head on, the Niti Aayog instead contends that without additional income from non-farm sources, farmers will not be able to cross income of Rs 18,000 per month even after the doubling efforts.The condition demands a mix of soft and hard options to pull farmers out from the current distress. The soft options include liberalisation of contract farming, direct purchase by processors and bulk buyers, direct sale by farmers to end users etc.The hard options include shifting of the workforce to non-agricultural occupations, an inclusion of supplementary sources of income, modernisation of farming and marketing practices, reforms in land lease and better price realisation.It is clear that none of the options proposed by the Niti Aayog can rid agriculture from prevailing price distortions. If farmers are not assured of remunerative prices for their produce, their interest in farming will wane further.Allow exportsA recent World Bank supported study on Price Distortions in Indian Agriculture by the Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER) suggests a ban on export bans on agriculture commodities to help farmers.The report draws reference to lost opportunity on account of export restrictions on wheat during 2007-2011 subsequent to the lifting of the trade ban wheat exports had touched a high of $5 billion in 2012.The question that begs an answer is whether or not exports directly benefit farmers? Exports do contribute to overall agriculture economics, but do not constitute direct benefit to farmers who are often at the mercy of the unending chain of middlemen.Since farmers income is unlikely to be doubled under the business-as-usual scenario, farmers would need direct cash incentives, in addition to input subsidies, to stay in the business of farming.Improving input efficiency (fertiliser and water) will help farmers make choice of crops to be grown. Crop advisories based on price trends of last few years, transit storage facilities at cluster level, and promotion of cooperative farming can enhance bargaining power of farmers.(Sharma writes on development issues)"

The breach occurred following heavy rains in the villages of Holagundi, Morigeri, Sonna, Uttangi and Talakallu, leading to the flooding of the tank and the subsequent breach.People in nearby villages faced a challenging time as the water entered their villages, flooding hundreds of acres of agriculture land where the maize crop had been sown. The 1,664-hectare tank irrigates 1,400 acres of land. A war of words broke out between the officials and the people, who said the latter had failed to take precautionary steps.Rain lashes GadagModerate rain was reported from Gadag city and other places in the taluk on Monday. It had rained in the taluk on Sunday also.Showers have returned to the district after a lull of three weeks. Farmers now see a ray of hope as crops had started withering away for want of moisture in the atmosphere in the sprouting stage itself. The Met department has forecast rain in the region over the next few days. Farmers have sowed green gram, sunflower and groundnut. They plan to sow chilli and onion in the days to come.Sowing has been completed only on 46.6% of the cultivation area in the district, which has a 115-mm deficit this monsoon.

The rates were Rs 35 per kg two days ago. The supply has increased from 6,900 to 19,900 sacks.The authorities of agriculture produce market committee (APMC) believe that traders may be hoarding onion owing to which supply to APMC is not entering local retail market.The onion is supplied from areas such as Ahmednagar, Nashik, some parts of Pune and Satara. In other markets located at major places, the farmers fetched Rs 2,300 to Rs 2,600 per quintal for onion. Artificial shortage may further increase the price.An official of Kolhapur APMC, requesting anonymity, said, ""The difference between the price and the actual supply shows that the traders are stocking up the produce which may lead to increase in prices. The supply has increased and to reduce the price all the supplied onions should be brought into the retail market. The prices have tripled in last ten days and the initial reason for the increase was the shortage, caused due to increased demand from other places.""In the coming week fluctuations in onion prices will be observed owing to hoarding. The authorities claim that once prices reach the highest level there is a tendency of consumers to buy less. In such a situation the trader cannot hoard for a long time. The supply of onion is expected to increase in the next couple of weeks, after supply from regions of Solapur, Belgaum and some parts of northern Karnataka starts.Consumer activists have made an appeal to the district authorities to scrutinise the stock of traders. According to district officials surprise inspection will be carried out in the next few days, if onion prices do not come down as estimated."

While rates of common vegetables and tubers including tomatoes and potatoes increased by 50% in supermarkets in the city, rythu bazaars too witnessed a 30% hike in prices.On Monday, tomatoes price in a Punjagutta-based hypermart was at Rs. 70 per kilo, while the corresponding price at rythu bazaar was Rs. 60 per kilo. The price of tomatoes in the last week of July was Rs. 50 per kilo. Similarly, baby potato was priced at Rs. 45 per kilo whereas it was Rs. 30 per kilo for the regular variety.Vegetables including ladies fingers and beans were very costly on Monday, with the former priced at Rs. 69 per kilo and the latter Rs. 112 per kg. Onion price, however, was at a constant of Rs. 30 per kilo in supermarkets and rythu bazaars.The weekly budget of most households have gone up, thanks to the price rise even as families tried to minimise spending. In July, there was a sudden price rise which dipped marginally in the last week. But again in August, prices have gone up with essential vegetables costing more than their prices in July, said Venkat Reddy, a resident of Rethibowli, who came to shop at rythu bazaar in Mehdipatnam.Homemakers who manage the household budget said that they have had to make do with lesser vegetables to balance out. We end up buying more tubers than fresh greens. It causes inconvenience to ageing parents who need vegetables more than protein rich tubers, said Vanaja Laxmi of New Mallepalli Colony.Farmers, who brought their produce to the rythu bazar, however, said that their returns declined with consumers buying less than usual.There is a shortage of tomatoes and beans due to poor rains.

Thereafter, the market remained closed for three days.Farmers, who have onions in storage facilities, could not bring their produce in past three days because of holidays. The wholesale onion market is expected to witness huge arrival when the market reopens on Tuesday.

After rise in wholesale onion prices, farmers are expected to bring their produce for sale in large quantity.""The supply is good in the state unlike other parts of the country. As a result, the rise in demand for onions from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune led to a rise in wholesale onion prices.According to sources, Madhya Pradesh government has procured huge quantity of onions and also disposed the stock. The onion stock has exhausted that has led to the rise in demand there. Moreover, the flood-like situation in Gujarat and Rajasthan has damaged onion crop there. The area under onion cultivation and other parts of the country have reduced. As a result, the demand for Maharashtra onions has increased in past few days.In the past 40 working days - from June 1 to August 7 - the average wholesale onion price have increased by almost five times from Rs 450 per quintal on May 31 to Rs 2,300 per quintal on August 3 due to rise in demand as compared to supply.

He wished he had stocked up on Saturday, when the price was Rs 10 less. The retailer adviced a dejected Das that it's not too late either as onion prices are likely to go up further.Heavy rain in Nashik and the delayed supply from Karnataka, the country's two major onion baskets, have resulted in a spike in prices. Contributing further to this supply crunch has been panic buying, with consumers stocking up on the crop. Onion prices in the city have either doubled or risen by 60-80% from Rs 18-20 a kg just two weeks ago. In some markets in the city and its fringes, prices have more than doubled, with onions selling for Rs 45-50 a kg.""We mainly depend on the supply from Karnataka at this time of the year. They start sending onions from the first week of July and it continues till September. We need around 2 lakh tonnes for the state but we didn't get any from this southern state still now. This is creating a supply shortage. If we don't get it within a week, the problem will be acute,"" a senior agricultural marketing department official said.In 2014, when some onion-producing states like Maharshtra, Andhra Pradesh and Rajasthan threatened to stop supply of onion, Bengal had started cultivating the crop. At present, the production is enough for four to five months. ""In June, we had nearly 2.5 lakh tonnes of onions but that has been pumped into the market to keep the price under control. In this situation, we need fresh supply from other states. Else, we can't keep the price within limits,"" the official said.When asked about Nashik, the official said, ""Even three years back, nearly 90% of the crop used to come from Nashik but because of their attitude, the government has decided not to depend on imports for onion throughout the year. We now mainly look for onions from them in October, November and December. We could have fallen back on them on an emergency basis but because of incessant rain and flood in some parts of Maharshtra, the supply has been affected,"" the official added.""Onion prices have risen to Rs 40 in our market. We are buying onions at Rs 170 for every 5 kg, or Rs 34 a kg. Add another Rs 2 a kg as cost at our end. Hence, we are making a profit of only Rs 4 a kg,"" said Dilip Mondal, the secretary of the Gariahat Market traders' body.Traders in Lake Market, Behala, Kudghat and Kankurgachi attributed the upward price spiral to woefully inadequate supply. Heavy rain has made transportation of onions from Nashik almost impossible, they said. Very few trucks are entering the city with onion from Maharashtra.""There is a fear that some people might hoard onions and keep them in stock to sell at a higher price during the pujas. We are trying to increase the monitoring system so that individual hoarding of onion can be minimized,"" the official added."

There were seven people in the room but no one is sure as to when Rehnumas hair was chopped off.Meri bitiya subah-subah apne baal dekh ke rone lagi. Kisi cheez ne uske baal kaat diye (My granddaughter started crying after seeing her chopped hair. Something cut her hair), said Kaisar Jahan, 62, grandmother of Rehnuma.The incident that took place on August 3 was the first case of mysterious hair-chopping in Braj and Rohilkhand region. Five other cases came to light on the same day.People have applied turmeric and henna on their gates to avoid attacks. (Sachin Saini/HT Photo)In all the cases, women found their braids chopped off mysteriously and some of them also fell ill.In Mojampur village of Badaun, about 80 kilometres from Bareilly, a woman, Somwati, 32, had to be hospitalised after her braid was cut mysteriously.The incident took place at around 11 am on Thursday. After finding her hair chopped off, Somwati fainted and was rushed to the community health centre.In another case, Tabassum, 22, a resident of Bisauli town area in Badaun district, was sitting alone in a room at around 4 pm on Thursday (????) when she realised that a part of her braid has been chopped off by someone.When I turned around I saw a cat sitting near my hair. She disappeared as soon as my mother entered the room, Tabassum murmured from behind her red veil as her mother caressed her.She complained of uneasiness and nausea after the incident and was admitted to a private hospital.Initially, the local police did not play attention to these incidents but when the news reached Lucknow, teams rushed to the affected areas to take stock of the situation and collect evidence. The mass hysteria soon grabbed media attention.After the incident in our village, we didnt sleep all night. Everyone prayed to Allah for the safety of women and children, said Mohd Munaf Raza Khan, a resident of Mojampur village.Apart from prayers, villagers have started using others means to protect themselves. They are dipping their palms in turmeric and leaving its impression at the entrance of their houses to ward off evil.In the absence of turmeric, people are using henna, black paint or soil. Some people have fixed twigs of neem on the doors while others are putting green chillies, lemon, garlic and onion in their houses.The more cautious ones are applying mahawar or aalta (red dye) on their hands and feet. Women have started tying their hair in tight buns and covering it with dupattas.Residents of Banna Devi area of Aligarh, 132 km from Bisauli in Badaun, have also adopted various means to save themselves after a teenage girls hair was chopped off on Thursday evening.Reena Kumar, 16, a resident of Illiaspur locality near Aligarh, was alone at her house when she found a bunch of hair near her feet.I dont remember much as I was terrified, she said when asked how she could identify her hair in the dark.She is just a child, how much can she remember, her elder brother chipped in before she could finish. He added people were terrified after the incident.Ironically, mass hysteria rules the roost in the region where the incidents have done maximum damage.Barely 110 km away from Aligarh, an elderly woman was lynched by a group which branded her a witch on the suspicion that she was involved in hair chopping incidents.Police said Maan Devi, 60, a resident of Mutani in Agra, lost her way and reached another part of the village. Her son claimed she had weak eyesight and was returning home after attending the call of the nature.Some people claimed she was a witch behind chopping of womens hair and beat her up. She was taken to the hospital where she succumbed to injuries.The post-mortem report mentioned myocardial infarction (heart attack) due to physical shock as cause of her death. Police have charged two men with murder and have arrested one of them.She (Maan Devi) belonged to Jatav community and her attackers were Baghels. Her death has pitched the people of one community against the other, said Sumesh Singh, a member of the village panchyat.Bhoot ke chakkar main gaon main ek ko bhoot bana diya.

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, Aug. 8: The state government today expressed its helplessness to contain the price of onion, which is now selling at Rs 30 a kg. ""The state produces only one-fourth of its onion requirement. Whatever onion has been produced this year in the state has been exhausted. Now, we are depending on other states such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh,"" food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro told The Telegraph. The government had announced on August 2 that it would make onion available at select outlets at Rs 17 a kg and had even threatened to take action against hoarders. It had said that the sellers should not charge more than Re 1 above the purchase price. ""There has been crop failure in Madhya Pradesh, while the crop has not been harvested in Andhra Pradesh. So it is not just Odisha, the entire country is depending on Maharashra at the moment. This crisis is not specific to Odisha. The entire country is facing the problem. At some places, onion is selling at Rs 35 a kg,"" said Patro. The minisyer said the purchase price at the source point was now between Rs 26,000 and Rs 27,000 a quintal. ""After taking the transport cost into account, the selling price in Odisha comes to around Rs 30 per kg,"" he said, adding that he had asked his department officials to sell onion at the government outlets at a price not above Rs 30 a kg. The rise in onion prices following the soaring price of tomato has hit the consumers hard. Last week, tomato was selling at between Rs 80 and Rs 100 a kg in the retail market. ""We have no role to play in the rise in onion price. The price of onion has increased at the source points,"" said secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda. Traders apprehend that the current high prices would continue till November. ""The winter crop from Nashik will reach the state in November. Besides, onions grown in various parts of the state will also enter the market in the winter and only then will the price stabilise,"" said Panda. Both farmers and traders said the state was suffering because of the lack of adequate cold storages. The state had witnessed distress sale of onions in March. However, the state government had attributed distress sale to over-production."

Deputy commissioner M. Angamuthu said no dealer shall purchase, sell or store for sale of onions without obtaining a valid licence from local administrative bodies like the municipal board. Every wholesaler or sub-wholesaler shall have to submit a report, showing details of receipt and other particulars, of arrival of onions in the market. He said every dealer must visibly display the prices and stock of onion in the local language. They may also display these details in other language. However, no dealer shall sell or offer to sell to any person onions at a price higher than that specified in the list of prices of stocks. The administration also made it mandatory to issue cash memo at the time of sale of onions. Besides, every dealer, who imports onions to the state in bulk by rail or road, will need to furnish a weekly return. The deputy commissioner issued the rules to regulate the onion market following a recent surge in the prices of the vegetable. Onion is currently selling for Rs 40 a kg in the Guwahati market. Angamuthu also directed the public works department to install closed-circuit televisions at the old and new Saraighat bridges after declaring them no-parking and no-selfie zones. The administration also directed Gammon India, which has the contract to maintain bridges over the Brahmaputra besides constructing them, to take measures to keep the bridges clean."

(Bhola Prasad) The price of onion is hovering around Rs 35 to Rs 40 in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, almost double its normal rate, disturbing family budgets to the extent that state food and civil supplies minister Saryu Roy on Tuesday evening conceded it was a genuine problem. In Jamshedpur on Tuesday, minister Roy directed deputy commissioners of all 24 districts to take steps to stem the price rise. ""I received complaints from ordinary citizens not just in Jamshedpur, but also from Ranchi, Dhanbad and Hazaribagh, about onion's skyrocketing prices. I directed all DCs this evening (Tuesday) to ensure retailers sell at wholesale prices. I understand onions coming from Nashik are costly, resulting in a sharp spurt in price in Jharkhand. But, we should try to ensure retailers and wholesalers don't hike rates arbitrarily using this excuse,"" said Roy, who is also Jamshedpur West MLA. But, despite the minister's best intentions, it is not clear if DCs can tame the prices. Shambhu Gupta, member of Federation of Jharkhand Chamber of Commerce & Industries (FJCCI), and its foodgrain committee member, said various factors were involved behind onion's soaring prices. ""For onions, Jharkhand depends on Nashik and Madhya Pradesh. But, rain damaged onion crops in Madhya Pradesh, hence the entire pressure of supply shifted on onion mandis in Nashik. So, obviously price will rise. In Nashik, earlier wholesale rate of onion was Rs 15 per kilo. It is now Rs 20. Add to add transport costs during rain, with further risk of damage. That's why price has gone up in Jharkhand too,"" said Gupta. Madan Prasad, a wholesale onion dealer at Pandra Bazar Samiti in Ranchi, agreed. ""We are selling good quality onion at Pandra wholesale market at Rs 27. Obviously, retailers will raise prices,"" he said. Satyanarayan Agarwal, a wholesaler and a senior functionary of Singhbhum Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Jamshedpur, said it looked like people would have to put up with costly onions till Durga Puja. ""Prices can reduce only when new onion crops reach the market in the last week of September,"" he said."

The tuber, which was sold at `14 a kg a month back, now costs `30.Even as the State Government fixed the upper limit of onion at `17 a kg last week and opened Maitri shops (model fair price outlets) to sell it across the State to unburden the consumers, the retailers flout the order with impunity reportedly for lack of enforcement.General secretary of Odisha Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said, they are unable to supply onion at `16 a kg to Maitri shops as the supply price soared by `8 to `10. The price may escalate further due to scanty supply from the source States, he said.Odisha largely depends on Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh for onions. The supply came down drastically as the crop was ruined in Andhra due to lack of rain during kharif season and onions worth around `100 crore was damaged in floods in MP last month.Now, we completely depend on Nashik where the onion was priced at `2,500 to `2,600 per quintal on Tuesday. What can we do if the product is high priced at the source? We are managing since we had booked the commodity at less price a fortnight back, Panda said.Though Odisha, which consumes around 1500 tonne onion daily, stands second in the country after Maharashtra in area under onion cultivation, the productivity of the crop is very less compared to other major onion producing States.Panda said Odisha produces nearly 1.2 lakh tonne onion every year. But, it fails to utilise it within the State as a major share is diverted to Raipur. He, however, claimed that the price here is less compared to other States where the edible tuber is being sold at more than `40 a kg.Both the State Government and the Centre have to intervene to check the price rise. The Centre has to hold talks with vested interest traders in Nashik to regulate the onion price, he added."

The appeal will now be heard after two weeks.The sale of garlic through agents had been disputed since the past ten years after the state government's order in 2007 banning agents from selling the spice."

In some dishes, it was difficult to guess the ingredients even after tasting it. Anokhi Kheer, an old Hyderabadi dessert is one delight. Traditionally kheer has rice or some other similar ingredient in it. The word anokhi means unique, and the uniqueness of this particular kheer lies in the fact that it uses onions instead of the usual rice as the main ingredient with milk. However, the dessert does not even have even a little bit of sharpness of taste which we normally associate with onions.The story of Anokhi Kheer dates back a few centuries. Unlike some other Nizami dishes, this used to be a dessert of the masses. Onion was an economical ingredient, and it is said that middle class and poor citizens who could not afford good quality rice substituted it with onions in their dessert. Anokhi Kheer was a typical summer food, it was served chilled to keep the body cool.Anokhi Kheer is prepared the same way as you prepare any other kheer, but the main trick is to prevent the pungency of onion from overwhelming the taste. Large white onions are used here, and sliced onions are boiled in water multiple times till the same get blanched, bringing out the sweetness. Like other kheer recipes, it is then added to reduced milk, sugar and khoya. Powdered cardamom seeds almonds, cashews and pistachios are used to add further taste to the dish.Unfortunately, this unique dish is not commonly available now. Jewel of Nizam is perhaps the only restaurant which serves Anokhi Kheer as one of their signature dishes. However, a few wedding caterers and home chefs like home chef Ahaana Khan have kept this dish alive. According to Ahaana, Choice of the right onions and patience in removing the pungency are key to the taste of this delicate dish.She laments that now very few people know about this dish, and one of the reasons of this dish going off popularity charts might be that the prices of onions have gone up many times compared to rice in the last few decades. She also mentions about another similar dish in Hyderabadi cuisine known as Lehsooni Kheer, where large garlic pods replace onions in the preparation. She fervently hopes that these delectable dishes regain their popularity in the times to come."

Rain that wreaked havoc in Gujarat and Maharashtra has affected the supply to the city, traders said.Onions were priced at Rs. 40/kg in retail market on Wednesday and this may further go up, note traders.The Koyambedu wholesale market receives only half of the normal onion loads of 65 trucks daily. The city mainly receives its stock from Maharashtra and Gujarat apart from Karnataka.With the floods damaging crops in those States, less than half of the produce is reaching the city. Moreover, stocks from Karnataka are also being diverted to other places in north India like Delhi and Mumbai where the demand is high, traders said.Onions are priced up to Rs. 35 per kg in the wholesale market due to the increasing shortage, said P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Association. Cabbage, a vegetable that is usually cheap, has become dearer as truck loads are being diverted to north India.Price of tomatoes downThough cost of tomatoes is steadily dipping, it still remains out of reach for many consumers and is priced up to Rs. 68 per kg in retail stores. S. Chandran, a wholesale merchant, said the market has started getting fresh supply of tomatoes from Hosur belt and this has brought down the price. But, we may have to wait till December for the onions to cost less as produce from Andhra Pradesh may arrive only then. Cost of onions may even go up to Rs. 60 a kg in retail market, he said.The supply scenario at Koyambedu wholesale complex is significant as several small markets in Chennai and other places such as Tindivanam, Cuddalore and Vandavasi depend on this wholesale hub for their supply. The sudden surge in prices of vegetables and off-season for weddings have also contributed to dull sales in the market. It may one or two months for sales to pick up, traders said."

Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association.The wholesale price of tomato is Rs. 40 a kg, small onion Rs. 70 a kg and big onion Rs. 30 a kg. Beans, carrot, yam and okra are all Rs. 40 a kg. In the case of chilli, it is Rs. 50 a kg. The prices of tomato and small onion are expected to come down and that of big onion go up, he says.Poor rainfallThe main reason for the spiralling prices is poor rainfall, say vegetable traders.There is no shortage in availability of vegetables and the demand has not reduced much because of the prices. Even in places where the rain has been good now, it will take three months for arrivals to start from these areas.Most of the arrivals to Coimbatore now are from other States.Further, there are restrictions to avoid overloading of trucks and transport costs are up, adding to the prices of the vegetables, Mr. Rajendran says.Hoteliers, domestic consumers and bulk buyers are affected equally. Even a domestic consumer needs four or five varieties of vegetables a day. Tomatoes and onions are essential. If the prices continue to remain high, it will bring down the volume of purchase.Usually, prices are down during this period. Arrivals from different parts of the State are not there now and most of the vegetables come from other States. Though hotels buy directly from farmers, availability is down this year because of monsoon failure, says D. Srinivasan, president of Coimbatore District Hoteliers Association. The volume of vegetables used cannot be reduced and there are no substitutes to replace some vegetables. Hence, hotels are finding it difficult to manage. Business is down 30 % since the implementation of GST, he says.The demand for vegetables will go up next month as the festival season starts and this might lead to further increase in prices, adds Mr. Rajendran."

The ambience is set in green and white palette with box lights hanging from the ceiling. You are most likely to be surrounded by techies and a family crowd at this restaurant that also has a pool table and couch set in the lobby.The Lamb Seek Kabab is minced well and is topped with fresh coriander, the Prawns Tempura falls on the crunchier side and the Chicken Tikka was well marianted with flavours of the charred grill in the soft meat pieces. In the vegetarian part of the starters menu, the croquette were equal parts crunchy on the outside and goeey delicious on the inside.Among cocktails, the whiskey infused in tea, served chill was an interesting combination, but did fall back on the blend and the alcohol punch. The Hot Toddy is warm and soothing, but missed a brandy punch.And now that you have read through the starters, lets take a minute to talk about the bhindi, shall we? The Bendakaya Pulusu is hands down the best bhindi with tamarind curry combination I have had so far. The tamarind based gravy has the typical Indian curry texture with the sourness of the tamarind and tomatoes. And the ladies finger pieces soaks in the spicy tamarind curry flavours and makes for a delicious bite with naan. Save butter garlic naan for the non vegetarian curry, Id say.The Murgh Musallam, a Mughlai style chicken curry in the restaurant is rich and creamy. The onion based gravy underplays the spice tadka in the dish and tastes buttery instead. No complaints though.The aromatic Mutton Rogan Josh has rich Kashmiri flavours with delicate lamb chunks. The Chicken Biriyani came in as a colourful ensemble of rice cooked well, but was served cold. The Dal Makhani on the other hand was another star on the dinner table.The red kidney beans and black gram cooked with plenty of butter and spices was really smooth, creamy on the palate and yes, I asked for a second serving of this delicious Punjabi dal that stuck true to its roots.The cheesecake served with a side of blueberries sauce has balanced flavours of cream and cheese and has a chocolate chunk topping that adds crunch to the dessert.Place: Nook - Aloft Bengaluru Cessna Business Park, BellandurCost for two: `2000"

5a0f0ba39855b76bf13d5760,‘Onion shortage for 15 more days’,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170812/jsp/odisha/story_166872.jsp,2017-08-12,"Caption There is a hue and cry over shortage of onions in the market. What is your department doing to address the issue? The states requirement of onion per annum is 5.5 lakh tonnes. We produce onion in only four districts  Nuapada, Balangir, Kalahandi and a part of Nabarangpur. We also produce some onion at Puruna Cuttack, which is located between Boudh and Phulbani. Despite all our efforts, the production of onion remains 1.5 lakh tonne per annum. We cannot preserve it for a long time. We have already exhausted our stock. To meet the shortfall of 4.5 lakh tonnes, we have to depend on Nashik in Maharashtra, Rajahmundry in Andhra Pradesh and also on Madhya Pradesh. But the damage to crops following floods in Maharashtra, onion produced in the interior parts of the state could not come. To check farmer suicides, the Maharashtra government started procuring onion at a higher price. So, only a few options are left for our traders to procure onion at a lower and competitive price. Sometimes our traders have had to buy onion at Rs 24 to Rs 26 a kg. I asked the traders and my department officials to sell onion with a profit margin of just Re 1, which will meet the transportation and preservation costs. How long will the shortage persist? It may take another 15 days. One cant store onion, as it is a perishable commodity. So there can be no hoarding. I have already sent a message to everybody that the government would take strong action if they do any mischief. Now, the businessmen have started cooperating with the department. Is it not an irony that despite the fact that we do not produce sufficient onion, our farmers had to resort to distress sale? Yes, there was distress sale. This was due to the fact that onion from neighbouring Madhya Pradesh where it was selling for Rs 2 per kg flooded our markets. The traders from Madhya Pradesh also asked our farmers to sell the onion at that price. However, we intervened and brought the onion price to Rs 7 per kg. But we cannot preserve it for long. Why dont you implement the Market Intervention System to rescue farmers? For market intervention, there has to be a consensus between the Centre and the state government as the price will be shared in the ratio of 50:50. We have already announced MIS for mung and biri dal. Two days ago, I told the officials that groundnut should be purchased at Rs 42.20 per kg. In the case of onion, they did not agree. Onion cultivation is not confined to Odisha but spread over many states. The governments failure to build a chain of cold storage may be one of the factors that has led to the distress sale... That is a wrong notion. We have nearly 42 cold stores in the private sector across the state. Besides, we have nearly seven cold stores around the capital city. A number of cold storages are there in Berhampur, my hometown. We have 24 cold stores in a bad condition. When the proposal came to me for their repair, I strongly suggested that these units be privatised. Let the private party undertake repairs and do business. The business cannot be run by the government. Every year, we face distress sale of various agricultural produce. How can this problem be solved? Everything is related to demand and supply. If suddenly there is excess supply, the prices will plummet and it becomes difficult to arrest it. Thats the time the government needs to intervene. We are doing so now. In the case of paddy, we have decided whatever the quantity of rice produced in our state, we will procure it from the farmers. Last year, we procured 56 lakh metric tonnes of rice. I have asked the primary agriculture societies to purchase paddy from the sharecroppers. What will you do with so much of surplus rice? Under the food security programme, we are giving 5 kg of rice per head. We will use up 30 lakh metric tonnes of rice under the programme. The rest of the rice will be procured by the Food Corporation of India. We also export rice to Punjab, Haryana, Jharkhand, Bihar and Karnataka. We are the third largest producer of rice in the country. You are part of a ministerial committee that discussed the issue of sharecroppers being given certain rights vis-a-vis the landowners. When will committees report be ready? Nearly 90 per cent landowners give their land to sharecroppers for farming. There is a fear among landowners that if they declare that they are leasing out land for cultivation purpose, their land will be taken away. Keeping this concern in mind, we are now emphasising on real cultivators. But as the issue is a controversial one, we have to secure the interest of the sharecroppers as well as farmers. It will take some more time to resolve the issue. You have staged a came back to the ministry. Earlier, a section of leaders from Ganjam claimed that they had lobbied for your inclusion in the government. Its the prerogative of the chief minister to pick up people for inclusion in the ministry. He also decides who he will use for party work and other purposes. When I was not in the ministry, he had used my services extensively in west Odisha and other parts of the state for the partys work. I never felt for a moment that I was out of favour with Naveen babu. Later, he brought me back to the ministry. Lobbying does not work. BJP national president Amit Shah launched his party programme Mo Booth Sabuthu Majboot (My booth is the strongest) from Ganjam. Your party must have been worried. BJP is a national party and it has formed the government at the Centre. The party has also formed governments in a number of states. Now, they are facing anti-incumbency in Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and other states. They have already lost Punjab and managed to form government in Goa. They are in alliance in Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and some other parts of the country. They are making efforts to enter newer areas. Now, they have set eyes on Odisha, Bengal and some other states. They are making all-out efforts to strengthen their organisational base. But, they will not be successful in Odisha as long as Naveen babu is here. But the anti-establishment factor also works against the BJD. No. We are taking up need-based programmes for development of the people. Naveens image is imprinted in the minds of people. Earlier, you equated Naveen babu as lord Krishna who drives the chariot (state) and Pyari Mohan Mohapatra as Arjun, who shoots the arrows. After Pyari Mohan, who is the Arjun now in the party? After the Mahabharat war was over all the Pandavas started claiming that they had defeated the Kauravas. But one Belalasena said he had seen only a wheel chopping off heads. Similarly, here Naveen babu is Krishna and there is no need for Arjuna as this war is different from the Mahabharat battle. What is the major challenge for the party in 2019? The Congress is almost a spent force. The space vacated by it is now being filled up by the BJP. Many Congress leaders are joining the BJP in the hope of getting a ticket. They are also spreading their network. Despite BJP emerging as a challenge, they will be no match for Naveen babus image and our programmes for the people. What do you consider more important: loyalty to the party leader (Naveen Patnaik) or efficiency at work? Both loyalty and hard work are required to be successful."

The hike in onion prices is burning a gaping hole in the pockets of middle class, which is forcing many to cut down consumption of onion. Prices in the wholesale and retail markets have more than doubled in just one week and are expected to increase more in the coming days.Onion prices in the city are ruling anywhere between `40 and `50 per kilo on Friday, as against `10 to `15 per kilo last week. Rythu Bazaars are selling them for `28 per kilo.Last time it was tomatoes and now it is onions, both are essential ingredients. With the rise in the prices we are forced to increase our monthly vegetable budget, Y Sujatha Reddy, a homemaker from Mehdipatnam, said. As per the data maintained by onion wholesale market in Malakpet, the city has a supply of nearly 12,000 bags ie 6,000 quintals per day. And the sudden increase in the prices can be attributed to low production and supply from Maharashtra and other neighbouring states.Almost 90 per cent supply comes from Maharashtra and 10 per cent from erstwhile Mahbubnagar district and some parts of Kurnool in Andhra Pradesh, said J Ananthaiah, selection grade officer at Malakpet wholesale market.And if wholesalers are to be believed, big traders in Maharashtra are deliberately holding up the stock for weeks in cold storage, which is resulting in the huge hike. To get more profit, traders are holding the stock and creating an artificial scarcity.Actually, compared to past years, production of onion is very high in Maharashtra this year, said a wholesale dealer in Malakpet. Meanwhile, prices of tomatoes have come down drastically compared to last few months. On Friday, tomatoes were being sold at between `43 and `50 per kilo as against `90 per kilo in July."

The Kurnool Agricultural Marketyard supplies onions to Vijayawada, Chittoor and other parts of the State and one of the reasons being cited by traders in different parts of the State for the rising prices is supply shortage from Kurnool. But the ground situation in the Kurnool Agricultural Market Yard is different.Officials and wholesale merchants Express spoke to said there were enough stocks in the marketyard to meet the demand and blamed retail stores, traders and middlemen for the sudden spurt in prices. The wholesale price of onion in the marketyard was `2,020 per quintal on Saturday. In other words it is about `20.20 a kg. However, retailers are cashing in on the demand to make a killing. They have hiked the prices so as to double their margin of profit.We have sufficient arrivals. The rates here in the market are decreasing at the moment compared to last week. Last week, the price was `3,300 per quintal and today, it is `2,020. What the retailers are doing is defaming the market, Katta Sekhar, one of the directors of the marketyard committee and an onion trader himself, told Express.He clarified that there was no possibility of a hike in prices at the Kurnool marketyard in the near future. These are all speculations. An average of 30 trucks come here everyday. It is true that the weather has destroyed nearly 50 per cent of the crop, but that has not affected the market drastically in anyway, he explained, accusing the retailers of creating an artificial shortage.The marketyard secretary G Sivaramakrishna Sastry said that on Saturday alone, as many as 360 tonnes of onions arrived in the market. As per the directions of state government, the Kurnool marketyard exported 20 tonnes to Vijayawada and 10 to Chittoor. Nearly 20 lorries of onion load are sent to Odisha, West Bengal and other states from here regularly. Even now, the exports to other states are continuing from the Kurnool marketyard. According to official records, onion crop was sown in 9,000 hectares in the district this time. The district produces nearly 14 lakh quintals of onions.However, there are vendors who offer a different take. A wholesale vegetable vendor Hanumantharao Chowdary said that in the past few days, onion has entered the race of cash crops. Onion prices hit the roof due to rains as the crop has been damaged. Anticipating the trend to continue, retailers may resort to hoarding and create a crisis situation, resulting in the demand going up and, subsequently, the prices, he explained. Chowdary felt that if the government restricts exports to other states it may help in curbing the artificial shortage. Current wholesale price is `20.20 a kg, whereas in retail it is `35 to `40.Prices touch Rs 30 in ChittoorTirupati: For the last one week, onion prices have been going up. On Saturday, onions were selling between H24 and H32 kg depending on the quality. In the district headquarters of Chittoor, the price has shot up to H30 a kg.In Tirupati also the price touched H30 mark. Merchants in Madanapalli, Chittor, Tirupati, Srikalahasthi and Pileru, who have contacts with suppliers in other stats, are getting the stocks without much difficulty. At least there is no scarcity as of now in the district. Assistant Director Marketing K Indumathi said that there is no problem in getting onions."

Onion prices in the wholesale and retail markets have doubled in the last one week. The onion prices in the city are anywhere between `30 and `35 per kg on Saturday as against Rs 12 to Rs 16 in the first week of August. The rythu bazaar is selling onions for `30 per kg. Onions were sold at `12 per kilo on July 27 in rythu bazar.We get onions from Kurnool and Maharashtra. Currently, there is no supply from Kurnool district.The rain havoc in Maharashtra has badly affected onion supply, said a trader of SN Puram Vegetable Market. M Srinivas Sastry, Estate Officer of rythu bazar, said: Usually we get around 100 quintals of onions every day. Now, the supply has come down to 30 quintals a day. He added that by the end of this month, Kurnool stock will come and prices will come down.The consumers are worried that the prices will rise in next few days. Onion shops at rythu bazar experienced huge rush on Saturday. However, the rythu bazar officials are giving only three kilos per head. As the stock is less, it is our responsibility to supply to every consumer who walks in, said the estate officer.The middle class families are affected by the unexpected hike in onion prices. The exorbitant prices are forcing them to cut down the consumption of onions.Jyothi Kshatriya, a homemaker, said: No matter what the price is, we will buy onions as it is a significant ingredient in any recipe. But, the prices will certainly affect the quantity. The consumers believe that the traders are deliberately holding up the stock to create artificial scarcity, despite there was good production in Maharashtra.No stock boards at Nellore rythu bazarsNellore:Onion prices are soaring in Nellore too just as in other parts of the State. What is causing concern among the consumers is the rate at which the price is spiking. It has almost doubled in the last couple of days. If the price hovered around R20-R25 a kg a few days back, it is now hovering around R40 a kg.Onions were being sold for Rs 40 per kg at retail shops for the last two days. We have reduced the usage of onions in our day-to-day cooking. We purchased a little quantity only for specific dishes, says N Ramadevi, a resident of Ramesh Reddy Nagar. Consumers like her are pointing accusing fingers at onion traders, alleging that the latter have been hoarding onions in huge quantities to create artificial scarcity. Normally, the district imports onions from Maharashtra and Kurnool markets as local produce is not sufficient to meet the demand."

The best quality of onions, which was available at about Rs14-Rs15 per kg in retail markets of the city's posh areas, has now touched the Rs50 mark. However, in certain markets like Vastrapur and Vejalpur, onion was available at Rs40, which was still three times higher than its prices a fortnight ago.Explaining the shortage of onions, officials said that against the requirement of about 8-10 truckloads of onions each day, the city was getting only one or two truckloads. Each truck carries about 10 tonnes of onions.Officials said that the prices of onion at the end of July was around Rs6 to Rs7 per kg in the wholesale market, and it has increased to Rs27.50 per kg. Interestingly during the same period last year, the prices of onions ranged between Rs6 to Rs8 per kg.Deepak Patel, secretary of APMC , Ahmedabad, said, ""Last year, many farmers in Maharashtra and even Gujarat did not get adequate prices against their onion crops, and hence they didn't go for onion farming this year. This has led to a shortage of the vegetable.""Patel said it was difficult to make any prediction about the next season, but prices will most likely continue to rise. ""In Shravan, people refrain from using garlic and onion in Gujarat, but once Shravan is over, there will be a spike in demand accompanied by increase in prices,"" Patel said, adding, ""We expect onion prices to stabilize by last week of October or the first week of November, when the new crop arrives.""An office-bearer of APMC, Ahmedabad said that it was not just onion prices, but all vegetable prices have increased. Brinjals, according to quality, cost between Rs40 and Rs100 per kg in wholesale. At this time last year, tomatoes cost about one-fifth of what they cost now. Officials said vegetables in the retail market usually cost double or more than those in the wholesale market.APMC officials said that a good sign was that in the last couple of days prices had stabilized to a certain extent. Tomato, which had crossed the Rs80 mark was now down to Rs50 in the wholesale market, and has plateaued out, hopefully."

Attributing the price rise to 60 per cent loss of crop in AP and damage of onions worth `100 crore in Madhya Pradesh, General Secretary of Byabasayee Mahasangha Sudkakar Panda said, the tuber is still priced `2,200 per quintal at Nashik and it is unlikely to fall till the fresh crop is harvested in November.Though we had received onions at `1600 per quintal from AP a few days ago, those were small in size and of sub-standard quality. People did not prefer to buy it even at `22 a kg. Traders also suffered loss as around 30 per cent of the stock got damaged, he said.A couple of days ago Food Supply and Consumer Welfare Minister Surya Narayan Patro had expected a fall in price owing to arrival of at least 25 truckloads of onions from both AP and Maharashtra.As AP onions have no demand in the State, Nashik is the only choice from where we can procure the commodity. We are procuring two sizes of onion - small and big which are pegged at `1800 and `2200 per quintal respectively.

With Onam hardly two weeks away, they are worried whether the crisis will hit their plans for the festival.Taking into account the current rate for export of perishables at $1.75, the country is losing foreign exchange of Rs. 16.53 lakh daily.The crisis has hit the 50 exporters and over 10,000 people, from farmers to loaders at the airport. Operating airlines and allied service providers such as the KSIE and the CIAL have taken a hit.Exporters concernInclement weather at the source markets of Valiyoor, Kalakkad, Nagercoil, and Tirunelveli and shortfall in production had jacked up the prices. The price of banana has gone up to Rs. 80, njalipoovan Rs. 115, and small onion Rs. 125 a kg. The exporters say they will have to sell the perishables at a higher price overseas.The overseas buyers are not ready to bear the price hike as the shipment from Kerala is based on long-term C&F (cost and freight) basis. Moreover, there is stiff competition from Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, South Africa, and other countries for these perishables, Secretary of the Agricultural Products and Processed Food Exporters Association (APPEXA) Dil Koshy said.A farmer-turned exporter from Valiyoor, Kanakarajan says selling the produce in the local market is more lucrative now.The GST on freight charges (on an average Rs. 52 a kg) has compounded the problems. Though refundable as there is no GST for agricultural produce and freight charges, an exporter with a freight of Rs. 2 crore a fortnight will need Rs. 36 lakh for remitting GST.The working capital has gone up and how will the exporter mobilise the funds. There is apprehension over the repayment of GST and confusion prevails, Mr. Koshy said.The APPEXA says a proper IT platform can solve the issue as the airports have the EDI-MES facility that has details of the export.The Centre and the State have to be approached for immediate solution for repayment of GST as the overseas buyer will not wait for us and we will loose the market, he added."

Their contention was that the yard barely had any facilities to support trade.Members of the Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association said they had learnt through newspaper announcements that the allotees of the new yard and some traders at the Yeswantpur ward had been asked to shift to the Dasanapura yard from Friday morning. They also said farmers who had travelled from Hassan with their produce were asked to take gate passes from Dasanapura before coming to the Yeswantpur ward.Protesting against this, hundreds of farmers and traders slept on the road outside the APMC yard to prevent vehicle movement and even dumped onions and potatoes on the road while shouting slogans against the government. The protest continued for over two hours leaving motorists stranded.Hundreds of vehicles queued up on both sides of the busy Yeswantpur Road that connects the State highway. People who went to the Dasanapura market say there is nothing there. It is 5 km away from the main road and there is not even a police station. Who will go there? Let them put these facilities in place before asking anyone to shift there, said one of the traders.The police rushed to the spot to manage traffic and asked APMC officials to redress the grievances of the protesters.

But after the centre banned the sale of poppy husk from April 2016, the entire licensing process was scrapped.But since the demand for poppy husk is still there the smugglers make small packets, which is easier to conceal and are transporting it and selling it all over the state, said Neemuch SP Tusharkant Vidyarthi.This trend came to light when Neemuch police caught two persons from Punjab who were carrying 3.15 quintal of poppy husk in a truck, packed in sacks containing onions. We have arrested Baldev Singh (43) resident of Bandiya Banur, district Banur and Ved Prakash (35) resident of Surajgarh, Patiala, Punjab, and seized the truck (PB11-BU-8315) in which they were carrying the product, the SP said, adding that the poppy husk would be worth around Rs 10 lakh in the open market.The poppy husk was concealed in onion sacks to camouflage its smell. Also since Madhya Pradesh is a major onion producer and exporter, it is quite normal for trucks carrying onion going to Punjab.Police sources said that they had received information that a consignment of poppy husk was being smuggled from Madhya Pradesh via Rajasthan to Punjab and so they kept tabs on the vehicular movement and started checking vehicles at the Nayagaon border checkpost and found the truck filled with doda chura.During questioning the two accused told police that Amzad (29) son of Noor Mohammad Mev resident of Fathegarh police station had supplied the poppy husk to them, which he had brought in his car.

5a0f51649855b76bf13d7e3f,are vegetable prices soaring?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/are-vegetable-prices-soaring/article19527329.ece,2017-08-20,"What happened in July?July saw a rise in inflation at the wholesale level to 1.88% from 0.9% in June, with the spiralling tomato prices, along with other food items, contributing significantly to this rise. Tomatoes saw a sharp inflation of over 209.5% in July against contraction of 29.4% in June, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy. Brinjal registered a rise in inflation to 21.1% in July, from Junes contraction of 3.1%. The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

The prices have shot up immensely following the recent waves of floods. A large number of citizens have alleged that some vendorsraders, taking advantage of the floods, are charging arbitrarily. Talukdar, who held a meeting with administration officials this afternoon on the issue, said a report would be submitted on the basis of the inspection and stern action would be taken against those found to have fleeced the public by overcharging them. Currently, the prices of some of the vegetables are - chilly (Rs 300/kg), brinjal (Rs 80/kg), string beans (Rs 80/kg), tomato (Rs 70/kg), ridge gourd (Rs 60/kg), cabbage, radish, eddoe (all Rs 50/kg), onion and sayote (Rs 40/kg) and potato (Rs 20/kg).

Onion is sold at Rs 34/kg in Mumbai, Rs 40/kg in Kolkata and Rs 29/kg in Chennai, as per official data.To control the prices of onion, state governments have been advised to impose stock limits for onion on traders/ wholesalers, food and consumer affairs minister Ram Vilas Paswan tweeted.A letter in this regard has been sent to state governments, who are empowered to take action against onion traders under the Essential Commodities Act.Onion prices have shot up in the last few weeks due to depleting old stocks and concerns about this years output as kharif sowing area is down by 20-30 per cent.Recently, Paswan had also written to the Commerce Ministry seeking imposition of MEP of USD 450 per tonne on onion to curb outbound shipments and withdrawal of incentives given to traders for its export.The issue was discussed at the recent meeting of the Committee of Secretaries, which too favoured imposition of MEP. A final decision is expected to be taken soon, sources said.Onion MEP was scrapped in December 2015.

Onion is sold at Rs 34/kg in Mumbai, Rs 40/kg in Kolkata and Rs 29/kg in Chennai, as per official data.""To control the prices of onion, state governments have been advised to impose stock limits for onion on traders/ wholesalers,"" Food and Consumer Affairs Minister Ram Vilas Paswan tweeted.A letter in this regard has been sent to state governments, who are empowered to take action against onion traders under the Essential Commodities Act.Onion prices have shot up in the last few weeks due to depleting old stocks and concerns about this year's output as kharif sowing area is down by 20-30 per cent.Recently, Paswan had also written to the Commerce Ministry seeking imposition of MEP of USD 450 per tonne on onion to curb outbound shipments and withdrawal of incentives given to traders for its export.The issue was discussed at the recent meeting of the Committee of Secretaries, which too favoured imposition of MEP. A final decision is expected to be taken soon, sources said.Onion MEP was scrapped in December 2015. The MEP is the minimum rate below which exports cannot be undertaken.Last fiscal, India exported 34.92 lakh tonnes of onion.Onion stock of 2016-17 is being consumed currently. The new kharif crop is expected to arrive in full swing from next month."

Onion prices have seen almost 100 per cent rise in past couple of weeks. Alarmed over the situation, Centre has directed the States to take proper measures including imposing stock limits to control the price surge.Prices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Wholesale traders in Delhi claimed that the reason is due to a shortfall in supplies from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh. These regions have seen a deficit in rainfall which affected production in these States. On the contrary, many states like Rajasthan and Gujarat witness excess rain leading to damage of crops, said Surender Goyal, a trader in Azadpur wholesale market in the national capital.Traders claimed currently supply is mainly from Maharashtra.There might be possibility of hoarding or profiteering by the traders in Maharashtra leading to the surge in price. Supply in Delhi and other parts have come down and it will remain low in coming weeks due to heavy rain in Maharashtra these days, added Goyal.Officials of the Consumer Affairs ministry said that hoardings cant be ruled out at this stage to make a profit out of the current situation.Seeing this, states have been told to keep watch on such elements and take proper action accordingly. They can also impose stock limit to avoid hoardings, said an official.Meanwhile, the traders claimed that the situation will remain similar for some days as the new crop will start arriving from September onwards.Supply will start improving only after mid-September and till then price will remain in the range of Rs 30-40 a kg, said another trader.Onion price risePrices of Onion which used to sell at Rs 20 Rs Kg or even at lesser rates have surged to Rs Rs 40 KG and more in Delhi and other cities across the country.Supply has come down due to bad weather in many parts of the country.States have been told to keep watch on hoardings and take proper action accordingly.

And it seems the airline companies have finally understood this universal truth.All the companies are scrambling their menu cards to provide their customers with the ultimate food experience as they fly towards their destinations. The cuisine being offered range from the oriental, continental etc to the local flavours.Among the airlines, Kochi-headquartered Air India Express has gone the extra mile and are giving their passengers the choicest of Malabar food, mainly Malabari poratta and chicken curry from their customised ala carte.Air India Express claims they are the only company in the country which serves complimentary snacks, both the veg and non-veg variety, in the domestic and international routes.We have added varieties like Malabar chicken, meen vattichathu, poratta and chicken to our lunch and dinner menus. These dishes can be ordered only online up to 24 hours prior to the departure of the flight. Bar snacks and starters such as chicken tangri kebab with mint chutney, chicken 65 and chicken nuggets with tomato ketchup rosemary chicken with caramelized onion in multi cereal roll and jeera rice served alongside butter paneer and aloo gobi with salad and gulab jamun are potential enough to tickle the taste buds of passengers, said the spokesperson of the AIE.AIEs inclusion of non-vegetarian dishes in its menu assumes significance considering the fact that Air India, the parent company of AIE, had recently discontinued the supply of these dishes in the economy class its domestic flights as part of cost cutting. The national carrier had also been in news a couple of times for mixing up veg and non-veg orders.According to a report tabled in the Parliament by the Civil Aviation Ministry officials, Air India had mixed up orders three times. Also, the airline had received as many as 44, 27 and 48 complaints in the last three years, regarding the quality of food and catering service. The multiple complaints forced the airline to take appropriate action against the caterer as per the contractual terms.Cost cutting measuresAir India stopped serving non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of its domestic flights as part of cost cutting measures. It also launched various cost cutting measures like a change in menu, meal schedule, rationalisation of dry stores and ancillary items as per current trends.The annual savings which are expected to be made from these measures is Rs 20 crore, said the officials while replying to a query. The annual savings from the discontinuation of non-vegetarian meals in the economy class of Air India domestic flights are expected to be around Rs 8 to Rs 10 crore, said Ministry. Apart from saving cost, it will reduce wastage, improve service and also prevent any chances of mix-ups.This doesnt mean the national carrier is dragging its feet in improvising the airline menu. The airline company has taken steps to improve its catering services by introducing new improved menu, doing away with food items not preferred by passengers, has began training chefs at its international stations on Indian cuisine, taking up passenger and crew feedbacks with the caterers aggressively and monitoring the quality or presentation of meal service closely and making surprise visits to the caterers often. Further, follow ups will be taken for rectifications if a deficiency in the caterers service is noticed, said officials.Local flavours a hitAround 95 per cent of air passengers from Kerala prefer to have local dishes onboard, said Gunasekaran Chandrasekaran, chief chef with Casino Air-caterers and Flight Services, Kochi.Today airlines are putting more emphasis on including as many deshi dishes as possible in their menu. And there has been a good feedback regarding the local cuisine. We have received orders from three major airlines to provide special Onam dishes for its flights to Kerala, he said.Though he refused to disclose the dishes since the airlines are planning the menu as a surprise for their passengers, a senior AIE officer said those flying with Air India Express will be greeted with a special Kerala sweet dish onboard the flight.Experts associated with the flight kitchens also maintain there has been a considerable increase in foreigners who visit the state and nearly all of them prefer to savour the best of the local flavour."

The truck owner was trying to change a flat tyre when the ill fated state transport corporation bus rammed into it. Around 20 passengers sustained severe injuries in the accident.Widening of Nashik-Pune Highway into a four-lane road is incomplete near Narayangaon, which might have lead to the accident, local sources said.While speaking at a function at Pune on Sunday Union transport minister Niton Gadkari had blamed the officials from his own department for causing delays in highway repairs.The accident at Narayangaon was the second accident within hours of Gadkari's public admonition of the officials. Earlier in the day another MSRTC bus had rammed into a truck near Shindewadi on Pune-Satara highway. Though there were no causalities reported in the accident, other two accidents in Nashik district were not so fortunate.In an accident on Yeola-Manmad highway in Nashik district 10 people lost lives when an SUV rammed into a Maruti Omni and a bus coming from opposite direction last evening, while Onion merchant Indar Chopra and his employee Sanjay Thube were killed when their car was hit by an unknown vehicle on the Manmad-Malegaon highway in the early hours on Monday."

Being from Odisha, my speciality naturally became Odiya cuisine. But I prefer to call myself an Indian chef because I can cook specialities across the country. I acquired my culinary education from IHM, Chennai and started my career at The Residency, Karur. Later, I worked at Accord, Puducherry and now I am at the Paprika cafe in The Courtyard by Marriot, Teynampet.I have been an Oriya speciality chef in all of these establishments. Although I make specialities from across the country, like dal makhni, rogan josh and Awadhi biriyani, I personally prefer Oriya dalma as comfort food. It is made from yellow moong dal and a melange of vegetables. I also like kakhara poi ghanto which is made from plenty of vegetables like pumpkin, spinach, raw papaya, drumstick and potatoes. Maccha besara which is made from fish and other vegetables is also my favourite.Odiya cuisine also features some unique desserts such as chenna pudo, which is a cottage cheese-based dessert sweetened with sugar syrup. Then we have goja which is maida and sugar syrup based dessert. Khassa laddu, which is black sesame seed with jaggery is served after special ceremonies in Odisha. I am against food wastage. Therefore, we cook according to the reservation. Its better to make more if necessary than to end up with excess food.Since we are a business class hotel, the guests tend to stay longer. This gives me the opportunity to build a cordial relationship with them and I try my best to go out of my way to fulfil their requests. If anybody is tired of North Indian cuisine, I make South Indian food for them. I also take custom requests on how they want their food prepared. Recently, a US navy team stayed with us and before they left, they specially asked to meet me. I was hugged and appreciated by all of them for the food and experience we provided them. This is why I love my profession. More than just pleasing peoples taste buds, its about winning their hearts.Machha BesaraIngredientsFish: Rohu or cat fishOnion: 1 big, slicedTomatoes: 2, dicedPotatoes: 1 sliced (optional)Mustard seeds: 50 gm soaked in water for 2-3 hrsGarlic: 3 clovesGinger: 1 inchRed chilli powder: 1 tspTurmeric powder: 1/2 tspSalt to tasteWater: 1.5 cupsOil: around 10 tbspDried mango (Ambula),Curd (1/4 cup)Coriander leavesOnions: 2, chopped1 tbsp cumin-coriander powder1 tsp turmeric powder1 tsp garam masala2-3 bay leaves3-4 tbsp mustard oil1 tsp panch phutana (mix of cumin+mustard+nigella+saunf+fenugreek seeds)MethodGrind mustard seeds, ginger and garlic together to a fine paste.Wash the fish and marinate for 10 mins with 1/2 tsp chilli, pinch of turmeric and pinch of salt.In a frying pan on medium heat, put 3 tbsp of oil and fry the fish until brown on each side.

The Centre will extend all help to those willing entrepreneurs towards establishing and expanding food processing industries that will provide value addition to the varied agriculture produce in the country, Union Minister for Food Processing Industries Harsimrat Kaur Badal said.Inaugurating a common food processing incubation centre for shallots at Chettikulam in Perambalur district through video conferencing from New Delhi, Ms. Badal pointed out that the facility got up under the joint auspices of the Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology (IIFPT) and the State Government would now help shallot growers avoid loss due to price variations and post harvest damages.Stating that the new facility would go a long way in helping farmers realise Prime Minister Narendra Modis dream of doubling the per capita agricultural income by 2022, Ms. Badal said that shallot growers suffered a lot due to climate, economic and market conditions in the absence of positive solutions to address their grouse. What is grown on the fields must fetch the farmers a profitable return. This facility will now show the way for onion growers not just in Tamil Nadu but also to those in Maharashtra and elsewhere in the country to get the benefits of proper value addition, she insisted.Stressing that agricultural produce must be supplemented with value addition, the Union Minister said that farmers must not just remain producers but should move ahead to become food processors and that would increase their income manifold. The Ministry of Food Processing Industries was extending all help to such agri entrepreneurs and investors through the flagship Scheme for Agro-Marine Processing and Development of Agro Processing Clusters (SAMPADA) that rains a host of benefits including sizeable subsidies, Ms. Badal underlined.In particular, she invited the farmer producer companies and food processing entrepreneurs to participate in the upcoming World Food India fair in New Delhi between November 3 and 5 where a world of opportunities awaited them.Perambalur District Collector V. Santha observed that shallots were grown on over 8,000 hectares and the production levels touched 70,000 tonnes. Stakeholders would stand to gain in times of glut when they could have a stable return while they could also benefit from the value added products they could generate through the technology dissemination by the Common Facilitation Centre.IIFPT Director C. Anandharamakrishnan said four value added shallots products were available through the centre for the farmers group to produce. The peeled onion, onion flakes, onion powder and onion paste were poised to get the farmers remarkable returns in the international and domestic markets. The IIFPT has developed onion peeler, stem and root cutter and solar assisted curing cum storage unit especially for the Chettikulam Centre. The measures would help extending the shelf life of peeled onion and other products to get better returns to the producer group, he said.Head, Department of Technology Dissemination, IIFPT, A. Amudhasurabi explained the salient features of the centre and sketched the development initiatives of the IIFPT for the benefit of farmers."

It also cut its GVA growth forecast to 6.9 per cent from the earlier 7.2 per cent.Stating that the RBI may go for a rate cut at the December review of the policy, BofAML said, ""Although inflation is turning up to 3.1 per cent in August on rising tomato and onion prices and 4.6-4.9 per cent in 1H18, it is still well within the RBI's 2-6 per cent inflation target.""HSBC said there are ""downward risks"" to its growth forecast of 7.1 per cent, while Japanese brokerage Nomura cut its calendar 2017 forecast by 0.20 per cent to 6.7 per cent.""The key question is how soon the economy will recover from the GST-led disruptions,"" Nomura said. The brokerage, however, said that the RBI will hold rates.Analysts at Morgan Stanley said they continue to see a recovery, but the data release poses downward risks to its growth forecasts.""The key risks to the outlook are the impact of weaker monsoon on agricultural output; the pace of NPL resolution, which would affect credit growth; and private capex and global trade conditions,"" it said.India's GDP grew slower at 5.7 per cent during April-June -- the lowest in three years of the Modi government while lagging China for the second straight quarter -- as manufacturing slowed ahead of the GST launch and note ban impact lingered.Gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the first quarter of 2017-18 was lower than 6.1 per cent of the preceding one and 7.9 per cent in the same period last fiscal.China recorded 6.9 per cent growth in January-March as well as April-June quarters.Expressing concern on the GDP numbers, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said manufacturing growth rate seems to have bottomed out as GST has been implemented and destocking of pre-GST stocks is almost complete."

Whenever I need directions, I stop by a rickshaw. And I get perfect directions to my destination from one of the thousands of hard working men who have left their villages to make Delhi their home.That is why, when I was on my way to Lajpat Nagar in search of a chholey bhaturey wallah that I had not visited ever, I didnt worry. I took the Metro from Rajendra Prasad Road to Lajpat Nagar, and once I walked out of the station at the Lajpat Nagar Metro Station, I jumped on to a waiting rickshaw.I am looking for some special chholey bhaturey, I said to him. Oh, Anandji, he replied, and took me right there.Its nice to know that there are still some chholey bhaturey in Delhi that I have not tried out.Seeing is believingI had been hearing about Anandji for a while, but, as it happens sometimes, I had never gone there. Last week, I thought I couldnt call myself a chhole bhatura expert if there was a much talked of place that I had not been to. So, as I said, I took the Metro.This is a 22-year-old shop in Lajpat Nagar 1. The address is Shop No 3, Krishna Market (Tel nos 011-29817406 and 41326226; owner Bittus number: 9811301302). I was quite impressed by the place  it was spic and span, and had high tables for those who wanted to stand there and have a quick meal. I was there pretty early in the day, so it was not crowded either. There were a few people there, and I was happy to see that they were all eating chholey bhaturey.I asked for four plates  each for Rs 70. The bhatureys were not enormous, as some bhatureys are. This I thought was the right size  neither too large, nor too small. The chholey was superb  and what I really enjoyed was that it wasnt dripping oil, or overwhelmed with spices. It was almost like the good chholey that you get at home, with the perfect balance of spices. There was a nice juicy piece of potato in the chholey, which came with chutney, some pickle and onion rings.The service is smooth, too. I went in, placed my order, paid up, went to the counter where I presented my receipt, and within fifteen minutes, I was out of the place, where my friendly neighbour GPS-wallah was waiting.There are quite a few other items on the menu, too  chholey poori, rajma rice, kadi rice and dal makhni rice, all for Rs. 70 a plate. There is a thali (Rs. 100) and a special thali (Rs. 130). From 4 pm to 8 pm you get aloo samosa, paneer pakora, jalebi and break pakora. They also sell a dal samosa, which I must try out one day.Anandji is also known for its lassi  sweet and salted (Rs. 60/Rs. 40). I had heard about their creamy lassi, too, but I had to hurry back with my lunch. And the food packet in my hand smelled so good that I was dying to dig my teeth into it.I wouldnt like to do a listicle on chholey bhaturey shops  those hard-to-escape lists of the ten or five top chholey bhaturey outlets in town that you see on the Net. My favourites, of course, are those places that have made us happy for years with their fare  Nagpal on the other side of the road, Chacha in Kamla Nagar, Standard in Old Rajendra Nagar and Nand in Sadar Bazaar, to name a few. And I must say Bhatia in IP Extension isnt bad either.But Anandji is somewhere right there, too. I had his chholey bhaturey for lunch and thought this was a place I could go back to. Not just for the dal samosa and the lassi, but for an encore."

With collections from residents upwards of Rs3,000, the organizing committees are making sure that donors get their fair share of fun.With menus that cater to tastes of people from all regions, the food being served every day at a township in Ganeshpeth is a mix of Sindhi, Gujarati, Rajasthani and Maharashtrian food. ""It is important that the women are given freedom from cooking during this festival so that their participation is total,"" says Sunil Chirania, a businessman residing here.The members of this township are enjoying delectable food items for the past ten days. ""There are special menus for children which include chaat, noodles and pizza,"" he says. Many of the residents have paid an extra amount of Rs1,250 to enjoy the meals. ""This includes breakfast comprising of idili sambar, vada on two Sundays,"" says Chirania.Food also increases participation of members and ensures that a large crowd gathers at the venue. Besides the meals homemade prasad is also distributed at most places. ""Residents take turns at preparing halwa puri which is distributed every day,"" says Vikas Mishra a resident of Govind City near Zingabai Takli.""Combination meals like jhunka bhakar, pav bhaaji or chola bhatura along with two varieties of sweets are also served so that members don't have to go back home to have dinner,"" says Mishra.Even the societies that are not exactly cash rich are serving dinner for the members. ""There are 50 families residing here and we ourselves volunteer to organize dinner for nearly 100 persons who are present for the aarti,"" says schoolteacher Madhumita Bannerjee who resides in Pioneer Regency in Utkarsha Nagar.""Though we have a mahaprasad on the final day of the festival, for four days we also have what we call chota prasad where full dinner is served,"" she says.The size of the gathering varies from 75 to 200 at most of the venues in residential areas. ""The meal cost for this size is usually Rs10,000 and it includes a buffet of eight to ten items,"" says caterer Ankit Upadhyaye who is providing meals at many such venues. ""Maximum orders are from localities in Jaripatka and west Nagpur and Maharashtrians food is most preferred,"" he says.The rates are heavily subsidized by caterers as its fixed business for them and gets them publicity and exposure, says Neeraj Lakhotia whose residential society near Wathoda has not changed the caterer for past ten years. All types of food ranging from Punjabi, Gujarati and Maharashtrian is served for members here.Everyday there is a special menu without onion and garlic for Jain community members who are observing ten days of paryushan during this time. ""When we started the catering bill was around Rs50,000 and today it is a little over Rs2 lakhs. But they also form a rapport and provide their services at private functions of many residents round the year,"" he says."

Celebrated in honour of Lord Vishnu, it is another occasion for friends and family to share a traditional meal.Taking this tradition to even greater lengths, the landmark 350-year-old Mhamai Kamat house near the old secretariat, Panaji, throws open its doors to over a 1,000 visitors, of every faith.More popularly known as the 'Kongyachem Fest' (for the presence of a unique right-sided conch decorated with precious ornaments in the house), people throng to 'Casa de Camotims Mhamai' not only to witness newborn children being offered in a 'pudve' as thanksgiving to God at the matoli, but to indulge in a traditional 'Mahanaivedya' Saraswat meal on that day, which falls on September 5 this year.""Though the house is over three centuries-old, the Mhamai Kamats have been celebrating Anant Chaturdashi for just 150 years. The Mhamai Kamats consist of 10 families, which are spread out, but congregate here for this festival. During the Portuguese era, the Portuguese governor would always visit us on this day. Previously, invites would go out to people, but in the last 10 years we have stopped issuing printed invites. Instead we put a small advertisement in the paper,"" says ex-director of archives and archeology S K Mhamai.Meals, which are prepared from over 14 traditional vegetables, ranging from 'khatkhatem' to 'moongagatti' and the sweet 'payasam', are cooked by chefs brought all the way from Karnataka. ""These are mostly Saraswat cooks known to us. Meals are cooked in separate, large, copper utensils, maintained by us especially for religious functions, on wood fire. On this day, additional 'chulas' are set up in the spacious family kitchen to prepare meals for the large crowd. One important aspect of preparation is that no onion or garlic (which we consider non-vegetarian) is added to the food. It is a pure Saraswat preparation. Also, as a matter of tradition, we do not take any outside donations of food or otherwise,"" says Mhamai.To prepare for the big day, women of the family, including a large group of maids, clean and dice the vegetables. Cooking commences at noon. Every preparation is then offered to the deity as 'naivedya'.In a deviation from regular practice, on Anant Chaturdashi, no lunch is served to the public at the Mhamai Kamat house. Rather, a large spread is prepared for the evening. For the first batch of people who arrive at around 5pm, servings are on traditional banana leaves on the floor. After this initial serving, a buffet is laid out. Stainless steel plates are specially rented for the occasion.""The house is packed to capacity and queues stretch right outside as well. But no one is ever turned back without a meal. Our door is never locked,"" says Mhamai. ""The cooks are constantly replenishing the food. From the richest to the poorest, everybody partakes of a meal. Serving generally goes on till 12 midnight.""The buffet is a recent development in the last four years due to the paucity of space and helping hands. The most interesting aspect of this occasion is that not only people of different faiths enjoy a meal with us, but they come from as far as Mumbai, Bengaluru and Pune. Throughout the night there are 'bhajans' and prayers offered till 'utar' puja the next day.""Close to the heritage precincts in Mala , the ancestral Mahale house has been observing a similar tradition for over 80 years. ""We have thousands of visitors,"" says Raghuvir Mahale. ""We start at 6am, when people bring offerings of milk, fruit and the like, and puja commences at 8am. Lunch is generally served in a buffet at around 1.30pm or so and goes on till 3-4pm. With the exception of the 'bhats', who are served on traditional banana leaves on the floor in front of the deity, the others eat at the buffet under a pandal outside the house. This is also an occasion to cook traditional vegetables like 'aluchi bhaji' which is a rarity these days.""We, however, do not cook mushroom as it is sometimes considered non-vegetarian. We also do not use onion or garlic in our cooking,"" says Mahale, who believes that such occasions are an opportunity for members of the various faiths that visit to witness the unique tradition of Anant Chaturdashi at both these houses."

And traders are ruing their decisions due to decline in wholesale onion prices in domestic market.""These traders from Mumbai and elsewhere in the country are lamenting their decision to import inions since the domestic wholesale price of the commodity has dipped significantly.

And the kharif plantation of onions too has been delayed due to late arrival of monsoon. Presently, the onions arriving in the market are of summer crop harvested during March and April. Since the shelf life of summer onions is much more than the kharif onions, the farmers prefer storing summer onions with a hope of getting better prices.According to APMC sources, although the prices have dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal, but it may increase further towards Rs 2,000 per quintal in next few days due to short of supply in the country although there has been enough stock in Maharashtra."

However, with the prices seeing a gradual increase, farmers have decided to use the opportunity to cultivate onion with the hope it will bring them profit this year.According to Horticulture Department officials, the sowing target for the district is 3,398 hectares, including 1,705 hectares in Basavanabagewadi, 1,071 hectares in Vijayapura, 263 hectares in Indi, and 210 hectares in Muddebihal taluk.However, officials believe that with several farmers having irrigation facilities, it would be possible to exceed that target significantly.At present, the price of onionis between Rs. 1,500 and Rs. 2,000 a quintal in the open market. Officials predict the price to remain steady in the coming days.Rudrappa Lamani, a farmer from Basavanabagewadi taluk, said that last year, several farmers kept the onion produce for a long time hoping that the prices would increase. But onion is perishable and cannot be stored for months. The farmers kept it in their sheds for around three months, but after that the produce started rotting. Having no choice, the farmers were forced to sell the crop for a meagre market price. Unfortunately, just after a month, the prices started going up, he said.He, however, expressed hope that they would get reasonable prices this season. The farmer said that while the cost of sowing is Rs. 1.25 lakh a hectare, it is expected result in a yield of around 20 tonnes."

The tobacco-to-FMCG-to-hotel-to-agri business major is likely to enter the market with fresh potato  a first-of-its-kind in India  followed by some more fresh vegetables. The company is also planning to launch fruit pulps and juices in order to become top food company in India.Devising the India First strategy for the future, CEO Sanjiv Puri (in pic) said: Currently, we rank No. 3 among the food companies in India with a total Rs 8,000-crore consumer spends and two Rs 3,000-crore plus brands  Aashirvaad and Sunfeast. ITC has always preferred to create indigenous brands for its new businesses that include foods, personal care products and stationary. The two Rs 3,000-crore plus food labels are also indigenous brands, which were created in the last decade.Puri pointed out that going forward, the focus will be on fruit, vegetables and sea foods because only 2%-3% of the perishables are now being processed in the country. We shall bring some food products in the fresh form or in shelf-life-enhancing form. Like, we are planning to introduce fresh potato soon, he added.The company is planning to launch low sugar potato and anti-oxidant potato soon. Besides potato, as indicated by Puri, ITC might come out with dehydrated onion later this year.The Kolkata-based company had created a brand called ITC Master Chef for prawn and blended spices earlier this year. The divisional chief executive of the agri business of ITC, S Sivakumar , said the dehydrated onion could come under the ITC Maser Chef brand. We are planning to launch more food products in fresh, semi-processed and in puree form. We are also launching mango pulp soon. This could be under B Natural brand, he added.The food brands of ITC include Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Candyman, Bingo, Yippee!, ITC Master chef B Natural, Aashirvaad Swasti Ghee, Mint O, Sunbean and Fabelle. Besides Sunfeast and Aashrvaad, the two other over Rs1000-crore brands are Bingo and Yippee!.Candyman has also crossed Rs 500crore mark in terms of consumer spends. Aashirvaad is alredy No. 1 in branded atta while Sunfest is among the leaders in biscuits.The ITC CEO argued that one of the main reasons to come out with semi-processed and fresh vegetables is to reduce colossal waste in fruits and vegetables in India. There is an annual loss of Rs 90,000 crore in perishables. This can be brought down by devising a proper strategy. Food is a very big opportunity for us. ITC has a very strong agro backend as well as trade marketing network, which is required for this, he added."

One, because I am from Chennai which was formerly known as Madras. Second is because back from 1994-97 I was known to make a no-wait infusion cuisine at a time when everybody was expected to follow tradition. I was always fond of making new dishes and was the first to introduce paneer tikka pizza, which was made fun of at that point only to become popular later on.If someone enters my kitchen to learn I expect them to give nothing less than 100%. When we create new dishes, it may be too early for the time but we select dishes based on a balance of feasibility and the scope for marketing. My first dish was a cheese fondue when I was five, inspired from an Asterix comic with some help from my grandmother. It came out pretty well. I have come a long way and have created my own inventions like the orange peel what the corner and white chocolate pasta.My inspiration comes from all around. I refer to the flavour wheel and keep innovating to make new dishes. Food is my calling and I have the ability to visualise what a dish will look like, even before it is made. I can smell flavors and tell if a dish is salted, just by smelling it. I consider this my superpower.I remember a funny incident from college. There was a friend who rarely attended classes. During one of the tests when we had to make pasta and kheer, he ended up putting olives in the kheer and grapes in the pasta because he couldnt make out the difference between the two and it was hilarious.My comfort food comprises of anything made at home. For example, a good meal would be curd rice with pickle. I love to cook for my family and friends and I love the food that my family cooks for me; food is all about memories. My daughter is my biggest critic. If she likes something I have made, then its definitely the best.Molecular gastronomy is neither good nor bad but its definitely fun. Food wastage is a big issue in the food industry. I am the kind of guy that finishes whats on the plate, no matter how bad or good it is. It is sad to see people load up their plates even if they cannot finish it just because they feel they have paid for it. I am connected with a couple NGOs that collect excess food and give them to the needy.To anyone who is new to cooking I would say, just go ahead and try without worrying about perfection. It will come eventually. Ensure you are able to recreate whatever you do. My latest culinary experiment includes hope beef burger with an onion marmalade and slow cooked pork ribs."

Onion has been cultivated in 10,000 hectares till date this year as against 20,000 hectares last year.The price of dry onion shot up to about Rs. 3,000 for about four days in August first week when there was no rainfall and this led to more farmers raising the crop. The present sale price of dry onion was between Rs. 1,000 and Rs. 1,500 per quintal and that of lower grades was around Rs. 500 per quintal.Rasool, an onion grower of Alwala in Gonegandla mandal, said he has been waiting in the yard for nearly a week.Officials were noting down the stocks brought by farmers and giving tokens specifying the date of auction.Another farmer, Mahabub Basha of Maramdoddi in C. Belagal mandal, said the commission agents were quoting the auction base price at Rs. 300 or Rs. 500 per quintal and it could go up to Rs. 1,000.Basha said he invested Rs. 70,000 per acre and the prevailing price would not fetch him any profit.Sunkanna of Bapana Doddi in C.

Onion prices surged a whopping 88.46 per cent in August as against a contraction of 9.50 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in manufactured products witnessed a slight increase at 2.45 per cent in August compared with 2.18 per cent in July.In the fuel and power segment, the WPI-based inflation saw a surge to a near double-digit level at 9.99 per cent against 4.37 per cent in July.Apart from vegetables, the food articles that saw a rise in prices include pulses, fruits (7.35 per cent), egg, meat and fish (3.93 per cent), cereals (0.21 per cent) and paddy (2.70 per cent).However, potato continued to see contraction at 43.82 per cent and pulses 30.16 per cent.The final print of June WPI inflation remained unchanged from the provisional estimate of 0.90 per cent.The sharp rise in wholesale and retail prices in August is likely to make the Reserve Bank of India ponder over the policy rate trajectory for the short- and medium-term. Last month, the RBI had cut the repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low."

The raids were continuing in the afternoon, said a senior I-T official. Officers of the Nashik division of the I-Tpartment are conducting the raids, he added.Among those subjected to the searches are two onion traders from Lasalgaon and one each from Chandwad, Satana, Umrane, Yeola and Pimpalgaon Baswant. The traders at Pimpalgaon Baswant is known to be the largest exporter of onion, the official said.The officials have seized documents related to transactions in the past month from the traders offices and are trying to assess the volume of their transactions in the past month. Their warehouses have been sealed and officials are seeking detailed information on storage of onion, sources said.However, the source did not reveal what triggered the raids. According to sources within the trading community, the surge in onion prices last month is being seen as the trigger for the raids. But others feel that the raids might be linked to the huge cash deposits made at the Nashik District Central Cooperative (NDCC) Bank last year after demonetisation. Over `300 crore were deposited to the NDCC bank back then."

Analyst feel the pressure on the economy is immense with retail inflation figures, released last week, showing a five-month high of 3.36 per cent in August due to costlier vegetables and fruits.Under such circumstances, experts say the Reserve Bank of India will have less elbow room to manoeuvre another rate cut following up on repo rate cut by 0.25 per cent last month. The central bank had stated it would try to keep retail inflation close to 4 per cent.There have been such episodes in the past and we need to double up our efforts to boost agri-production as well as improve the distribution and supply chains, said Pankaj Patel, president, Ficci. Led by onion prices that went up 88.46 per cent, vegetable prices increased 44.91 per cent in August, against 21.95 per cent in July, according to the Wholesale Price Index data released by the Union commerce ministry on Thursday.The prices of food articles went up by 5.75 per cent in August on a yearly basis, against 2.15 per cent in July. The localised impact of uneven distribution of rainfall on agri-production will have to be minimised through measures on the supply side including through better storage infrastructure for agri-commodities, said Patel.The data indicates the fuel inflation was high as petrol and diesel prices continued to remain high which is linked to the global crude oil rates. In addition the power tariffs also increased following lower domestic production. The fuel and power segment experienced high inflation at 9.99 per cent, against 4.37 per cent in July.A huge jump in petrol by over 24 per cent and diesel by over 20 per cent is worrisome and would prove to be cascading, Assocham stated. The industry chamber urged the government to bring fuel under the GST to save consumers from the heavy burden of taxation both at the Centre and state level. The inflation in manufactured products also was up marginally at 2.45 per cent in August, against 2.18 per cent in July, according to the data."

We will fight until this tax regime is withdrawn, Congress spokesperson Ajay Maken said.Party leaders said increase in central excise duty 11 times in the past three and half years---133.47 percent in petrol and 400.86 percent in diesel, coupled with high food prices, has hit the people hard.Due to rise in fuel prices, food inflation showed rising price trends of onion at 88.46 percent, vegetables at 44.91 percent, and fruits at 7.35 percent and milk at 3.94 percent.Maken said though the prices of international crude oil have come by over 50 percent in the past three years, the benefits have not been passed on to the consumers.This, he said, would provide an ideal situation for the Congress to oppose the government, whose way of handling economic growth too has raised several eyebrows.The Congress, which had paid dearly for first reducing the number of domestic LPG cylinders per family per year from 12 to 9 and later restoring it to 12, further said that the centres decision to hike price of such fuel by Rs 4 per month from July this year has adversely affected around 18.11 crore customers.The price of a subsidised LPG cylinder has gone up from Rs 412 in 2014 to Rs 487, said Maken adding the kerosene users too had been impacted."

But the things you cant find in Venezuela any more, like milk and sugar, means the landmark has had to close.When Manuel Da Silva first opened its welcoming yellow doors in 1981, the Heladeria Coromoto offered its clients the tried and trusted: vanilla, strawberry, chocolate and coconut flavours.Until one day, Mr. Da Silva tried out an avocado sorbet on his customers. It was a success! said Jose Ramirez, his son-in-law.He had a crazy idea and he started to invent, to try things with meat, with fish, said Mr. Ramirez.He might have stopped at chipi-chipi, a small Caribbean mollusc, but Mr. Da Silva was clearly not a man to hold back on a hunch. New flavours followed when he experimented with garlic as well as onion flavoured ice cream. Soon his imagination knew no limits and the number of wacky flavours, and his reputation, grew.People were coming to try some strange things, said Luis Marquez, a young local in the mountain town of Merida who grew up with frequent visits to the Coromoto.Set a recordIn 1991, just a decade after opening and a world away from plain old vanilla, the Heladeria Coromoto got an entry in the Guinness Book of Records for providing the most flavours of any ice cream parlour in the world  at the time, 386.But Mr. Da Silva, a Portuguese immigrant, continued to innovate and play with peoples taste buds.Black bean ice cream soon followed, chilli, beetroot.. up to a staggering 860 flavours.The shop quickly became a key attraction in Merida, an Andean city of 4,50,000 which is also known for having the worlds highest cable-car ride, 4,765 metres above sea-level.Now it comes highly recommended in tourist guides such as Lonely Planet and TripAdvisor.But Venezuelas deepening economic crisis since the collapse of crude oil prices in 2014 meant it became an ordeal to source raw materials over the last few years.On the first Monday in September, Mr. Ramirez hung up his scoops and closed Heladeria Coromoto, defeated by the impossible task of getting the essential raw materials of ice cream in any meaningful quantity in Venezuela.For years we have been suffering from shortages and we buy on the black market. We can not get products from our traditional suppliers, said Mr. Ramirez, 56.Up to now, he has always managed to scrape by. But the situation got more complicated this year....Many Venezuelans battle hunger and malnutrition because of the economic and political crisis.We made efforts, we tried to keep going to the maximum, but the time has come when I cant resist anymore, Mr. Ramirez said."

The premises of Qube Caf, Siesta Hitech Hotel, as part of its Bengali Food Festival, is decked up with cut-outs of fish, Bengali taant saris while a giant poster of Howrah Bridge adorns one of the walls. There are live counters at the restaurant for Kebab Kathi Rolls with the crisp yet soft lacchha paratha filled with chunks of kebabs, onion rings, sauce and a dash of lemon and pepper. One can choose the Bengali delights from the buffets spread.The hot Calcutta Chicken Biryani lives up to its name with fluffy fragrant granules and the chicken pieces with marinated and cooked with fragrant spices. For the starters the raw banana chops or mocha chops as they are better known in Bengal was nicely prepared and fried; the only disappointment was the mustard sauce which didnt taste as good as the typical kasundi sauce.The Khasir Shorba or mutton soup was mildly spiced, but the warmth kept the monsoon-rain chill away from my bones during the evening. To balance out the none-vegetarian palette which dominates the Bengali cuisine, we tried Radha Ballavi.The luchis filled with urad dal were soft and fried till golden making perfect pair with chholar daal or grams cooked in a gravy. It reminded me of a perfect Bengali breakfast on a Sunday. We recommend Ilish Machher Paturi: Hilsa, the monarch of fish, wrapped in a banana leaf and then cooked on the griddle. Chef Prabhakar had curated the promotion well enough. Roshogullas werent that spongy but my tastebuds welcomed them.The festival is on till September 17Charges: `777++ For lunch and dinner"

However, Delhi is getting roughly half its supply (or a little less) from Nashik and if the strike continues into the next week, we will probably see a rise in wholesale prices by Rs 5-6 per kg. In the retail market, this amounts to nothing. Furthermore, if supply from Nashik does come down, then supply from Rajasthan and UP will automatically go up,"" said Metharam Kriplani from the Azadpur Mandi Delhi gets about 100 trucks of onion every day , which could go up to a maximum of 150.At present, about 50 trucks are coming from Nashik, while the remaining are coming from Rajasthan."

Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon Agriculture Product Market Committee (APMC), confirmed to TOI that the traders had boycotted the onion auction following the searches by IT officials.The big traders purchase more than 30% of the arrivals in the market. Soon after the searches started on Thursday, wholesale onion prices crashed drastically. ""On Friday, the farmers too boycotted the onion auction and did not bring their produce to the market due to the crash in the wholesale prices,"" Holkar said. He was, however, optimistic the auction would resume from Monday.""Traders have panicked following the searches that are still going on. We were in no mood to participate in the auction,"" an onion trader said.Meanwhile, I-T sleuths continued the searches for the second day running. Around 24 teams with 150 investigating officials from Thane, Pune, Aurangabad and Nashik are conducting the searches. The average wholesale onion prices at Lasalgaon crashed by 35% after the searches at the offices, godowns and residences of the big traders in Nashik district. The prices fell to Rs 900 per quintal as against Rs 1,400 on Wednesday. The minimum and maximum wholesale onion prices were recorded at Rs 500 and Rs 1,331 per quintal respectively.The average wholesale onion prices in the domestic market had increased five times from Rs 450 per quintal on May 31 to Rs 2,450 per quintal on August 10, registering a 20-month high due to short supply.

5a1150e19855b76bf13df594,Congress lines up oil 'loot' protests,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170916/jsp/nation/story_173499.jsp,2017-09-16,"New Delhi, Sept. 15: The Congress has lined up a nationwide campaign against rising prices of petroleum products and food items, accusing Prime Minister Narendra Modi of squeezing money out of the common man's pocket to fill up government coffers. While there will be a demonstration at Jantar Mantar in Delhi on September 20, at least 10 lakh signatures will be collected for a memorandum to be submitted to the Prime Minister. The signatures will be collected from people at petrol pumps for three days from Sunday. All Congress state units have been asked to devise their own programmes against the rising prices of petroleum products and food items like onions, tomatoes, some pulses and other vegetables. While onion and tomato prices have shot past Rs 50 a kg, some pulses are selling at over Rs 100 per kg even as arhar prices crashed after crossing Rs 200 last year. Congress leader Ajay Maken said at a news conference today: ""If petrol or food items sell at higher prices because of unavoidable circumstances, we can understand. But this government indulges in profiteering by looting ordinary citizens. Petroleum products are a case in point. The domestic prices have soared as international crude oil rates have gone down."" Maken added: ""While the government has given absurd reasons like 'Hurricane Harvey and Irma' for the increase in petrol and diesel prices, it has dealt a devastating blow to the savings of the common people by increasing central excise 11 times in the past three and a half years - 133.47% on petrol and 400.86% on diesel. The government has also robbed 18.11 crore LPG consumers by increasing the prices of subsidised cylinders by Rs 75 in the past three years."" Pointing out that international crude oil prices have come down more than 52 per cent since the Modi government took over on May 26, 2014, Maken said: ""If you take petrol of Rs 100, Rs 51.78 is going to the government in the form of taxes. In diesel worth Rs 100, Rs 44.40 is tax. This is dacoity. Which government punishes citizens to make up for its own (revenue) shortfall caused by wrong economic policies? This is not only insensitive, this is loot."" Maken declared that the Congress ""shall fight this battle to reduce taxes on every available forum"". ""We dare the BJP to come out with a white paper on taxes on fuel and the total gains. The Congress demands immediate withdrawal of excessive central excise duties and other taxes."" Maken stressed that the government had adopted a devious strategy to mislead people by raising prices in small instalments. ""18.11 crore customers purchase subsidised gas cylinders every month. The government decided to increase the price of every cylinder by Rs 4 every month until the subsidy is wiped out. In the last three years, the hike on a gas cylinder was Rs 75. This is done when international price is so low. The UPA government was paying a subsidy of Rs 449 per cylinder to provide relief to the common citizen."""

The produce is brought to the city from neighbouring districts of Mahbubnagar and nearby states of Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka.The supply is so much that for the first time in the season, the market yard has received more than 27,000 bags on a single day, which has triggered a crash in the wholesale prices.The price was around `60 to `70 per kg a month back, but is started falling for the last one week and on Monday it was hovering around ` 5 to `20 per kg.The opening bids for onion started from `20 per kg (for new and top grade stock), but soon the price plummeted and by noon, it was selling for `5 or `8 per kg, depending on the quality of the stock, said a marketing official from Malakpet Gunj.The cyclical drop and rise of bulb crop might be a good news for households but they have effected farmers and wholesale traders in the capital.The reason can be attributed to steep rise in the production and surplus supply from neighbouring state and recently, the market has started importing onions from Karnataka as well, said J Venkat Reddy, Secretary Grade III, Malakpet Gunj.He said that presently the market is getting Januarys harvest from Maharashtra.It is being said in the marketyard circles that there is no chance that traders are not going to make any profit as the prices may come down again.However, farmers at the citys oldest wholesale market are now struggling to move their produce and get minimum support price from the traders.

Apart from haleem which comes to mind first, another dish in this category is Patthar Ka Gosht, where a heated stone is used to cook pieces of boneless marinated meat. A favourite from the days of Nizam Asaf Jahi VI, this dish is still much sought-after by food lovers on any visit to the city.It is said that late in the 19th century, the Nizam Asaf Jahi VI used to frequently go hunting in the forests. On one such trip, his bawarchis forgot to carry their skewers and shikanjas were required to prepare kebabs and innovated by cooking mutton on a flat granite stone heated by firewood from below. The Nizam developed a liking for the dish, and so this recipe was replicated repeatedly at the royal kitchens. More than a century later, the dish is still popular in many areas in the city.Especially during Numaish, the annual exhibition of Hyderabad, many visitors flock to their favourite Patthar Ka Gosht stalls at the exhibition grounds. However, cooking on a stone is not just a specialty of Hyderabad, it is prevalent in some Arab countries too. In India, Mumbai and Bangalore also have limited availability of street food prepared on heated stone slabs.There are few important aspects of making a perfect Patthar Ka Gosht  selection of a right granite stone is one of them. The stone should not crack under the heat, and it should not be too thick to consume extra heat, instead, it should act as a good conductor. In this recipe, slices of flattened lamb meat are marinated in garlic, ginger, chilli paste, salt and raw papaya for at least four hours and often overnight, so that the meat becomes quite tender. It is then roasted on a stone heated with charcoal below. The end result is often truly a melt in the mouth dish. The proportions of marinade, ghee, the roughness of the stone as well as the timing of flipping the meat over play a role in getting the optimum taste. One of the best places for Patthar Ka Gosht in Hyderabad is Bade Miyan Kababs, a small kiosk midway on upper tank bund near the Ramadasu statue.The shop is owned by Syed Shaji whose great-grandfather Haji Syed Ismail started this business. The outlet uses proprietary spices, and the ghee is used as a medium of cooking on the charcoal heated stone. As per Shaji, the stone used is called pahadi stone and it has to be selected very carefully. The soft Patthar Ka Gosht is served here with a little bit of onion salad and some delectable mint chutney. Rumali roti often becomes a perfect companion too.Bade Miyan has another stall at Forum Mall and sets up a temporary kiosk known as Ismail Restaurant every year at Numaish.

5b2e5c209855b72640115aca,Bosch embraces change!,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/634769/bosch-embraces-change.html,2017-09-24,"German auto components giant Bosch, which set foot on Indian soil in 1922, has now become a household name  be it in automotive components, or building and security solutions. The company, which is headquartered in Bengaluru, has constantly been in a state of evolution.From a supplier of automotive components and technologies, it has diversified into other business areas such as energy, building solutions, consumer durables and electrified solutions.Its composition is akin to an onion bulb. Every layer opens up a new facet about the Group and the environment in which it operates, Soumitra Bhattacharya, Managing Director, Bosch Limited, and President, Bosch Group India says.We have made headway from being an intelligent organisation to a connected set-up. For Bosch India, transitioning to a connected era requires a change in mindset. The decision to become a smart, and then eventually a connected company, is not an option but an imperative for long-term success. To embrace the opportunities put forth by the future, Bosch Limited needs to first understand the needs of its existing and potential customer, Bhattacharya told shareholders earlier this month.First, the company started a representative office in Kolkata, and from 1951, Bosch is present through its subsidiary Bosch Limited (then Motor Industries Company Limited or MICO).The Bosch Group operates in India through 12 companies including Bosch Limited, Bosch Chassis Systems India Private Limited, Bosch Rexroth India Private Limited and Robert Bosch Engineering and Business Solutions Private Limited.Looking forward, the company is well prepared to offer its large customer base an array of full-line solutions, diesel and gasoline included, as the nation transitions from BS-IV to BS-VI emission norms by 2020.Electrification is futureRecently, Bosch announced its plans to offer a portfolio of electrified solutions for the Indian market. The company foresees electrification as a future growth area in India.Today, the Indian supplier base is fragmented for electromobility solutions. With the current powertrain offerings from Bosch India, the company is aiming to bridge this gap and have the first mover advantage, said Peter Tyroller, Member of the Board of Management of the Bosch Group responsible for Asia Pacific, during his recent visit to Bengaluru.Currently, the company is in advanced stages of development and plans to move into series production after 2018.He emphasised three trends that Bosch sees for the future of mobility -- it is automated, connected and electrified. We especially see the small-vehicle segment driving the transition to mass electrification, as urban dwellers seek a simple and affordable alternative to conventional standards, he said, adding the powertrain of the future will be a mix of electromobility and combustion engines.Accoding to him, the Government of Indias initiative to convert the Indian automotive market into an electric vehicle nation by 2030 is another important step. We believe that electrification in India will first gain momentum via fleet operators. The pre-requisite for the same is shared and connected mobility. As for personal mobility, small vehicles will be essential for this as they make it easier to weave quickly through traffic. Bosch is ready to start its electrification journey in India, first through light vehicles. As the opportunity expands, Bosch India will foray into other segments, Tyroller added.In February 2017, Bosch India launched the Connected Vehicle solution for commercial vehicles and passenger vehicle fleets. The product allows the owner to track, trace, geofence and get custom alerts in case of any deviations.Boschs vision for 2020 entails that every product is connected via the Internet of Things (IoT). At Bosch India, several legacy assembly lines have been restructured to achieve higher efficiency and increased productivity while having a lower payback time.Towards Artificial IntelligenceArtificial Intelligence is a topic that Bosch is planning to deal with greater detail from next year onwards.Ten years from now, scarcely any Bosch product will be conceivable without artificial intelligence (AI). It will either possess that intelligence itself, or AI will have played a key role in its development or manufacture, Bosch CEO Volkmar Denner had said. Within just five years, products featuring artificial intelligence are expected to account for 10% of Bosch sales. Bosch will use AI to turn things into intelligent assistants. Products will become partners, companions, personal assistants, the CEO said.Bosch India is ramping up its AI centre in Bengaluru. Apart from this centre, the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI) is operational in Palo Alto in the US, and Renningen in Germany.The BCAI is formed to help Boschs greater aspiration to come up with future offerings in IoT, specifically in electromobility.Targeting the youthBoschs skilling programme BRIDGE (Boschs Response to Indias Development and Growth through Employability Enhancement) is targeted at employing the youth in the service industry. From the present 125 centres across the country, it plans to take it to 200 centres.Nearly 7,500 people have graduated from this (BRIDGE) skilling programme over four years. Our long-term career-oriented training offered at the Bosch Vocational Center (BVC) has been Indianised over the years, and as of December 2016, around 3,500 individuals have passed out over these years, Bhattacharya said.Also, over the past two years, the company has developed a new training programme that focuses on producing high-quality skilled artisans, such as carpenters and electricians, in India.Mentoring startupsWith many companies starting either incubator or accelerator programmes, Bosch also jumped on the bandwagon recently, with the announcement of graduation of 13 startups from its first accelerator programme - Discover, Nurture and Accelerate (DNA).It said that startups create significant value, and India is one of the crucial hotspots. A proof of that is the variety of startups the Group is partnering with: from a team which converts soot (collected from a diesel generator) to printable ink using a proprietary liquid, to another team which provides customisable home automation solutions.Taking forward its vision, in future, Bosch Indias accelerator programme will increasingly look to collaborate with those who build technology solutions in areas such as IoT, deep learning, analytics, cloud, virtual reality and block chain.Wide presence in IndiaBosch Limiteds key manufacturing facilities are located at Bengaluru, Bidadi, Nashik, Jaipur, Gangaikondan, Oragadam near Chennai and Verna (Goa). In all, it operates 18 manufacturing facilities and seven development and application centres.Today, the company maintains its presence across sectors such as mobility solutions, industrial technology, consumer goods, and building and energy technology, while manufacturing and trading products as diverse as diesel and gasoline fuel injection systems, automotive aftermarket products, special purpose machines, packaging machines, electric power tools, security systems, and industrial and consumer energy products and solutions.In 2016, Bosch earned revenues of over Rs 10,500 crore. Bosch Group employs roughly 3,90,000 associates worldwide (as of December 31, 2016).The Group in India employs over 31,000 associates, of which close to 18,500 work on areas relating to R&D."

The department had fixed Rs. 242 crore for 2016 season. But, it could not achieve the target due to failure of both South West and North East monsoons. Cooperative institutions had extended crop loans to the tune of just Rs. 90 crore in 2016.Of the current year target, the department has so far disbursed crop loan to the tune of Rs. 105 crore to the farmers, who have raised paddy in the kuruvai season in a few areas mainly in Lalgudi. Similarly, farmers, who have raised various crops such as sugarcane, tapioca, groundnut, turmeric, maize and onion in Musiri, Thuraiyur, Uppiliyapuram and Lalgudi, have also been extended crop loan.K.C. Ravichandran, Joint Registrar of Cooperatives, told The Hindu that the distribution of crop loan would gain momentum once the Stanley reservoir in Mettur was opened for delta irrigation. The increasing water level in the dam had raised the hope that it would be opened shortly.Crop loan target had been fixed for all 140 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) depending upon the coverage area. Out of Rs. 276 crore, about Rs. 170 crore would be disbursed for raising samba crop. Instructions have been given to the PACS functionaries for avoiding controversies and complaints while disbursing loan.Mr. Ravichandran said the societies would not charge interest from farmers for crop loan as the government would pay the interest to the PACS on behalf of farmers."

Finally, he abandoned paddy cultivation, but for a good reason. With failures teaching him lessons, Kalaiselvan, instead of relying on paddy crop to make ends meet, cultivated more than eight varieties of crops by adhering to mixed cropping system. To his surprise, it has fetched him an eight-fold surge in net income which includes meeting the food requirements of his family.A graduate in BSc (Physics) and an organic by profession for more than half-a-decade, Kalaiselvan has been cultivating paddy on seven acres supported by an open well for irrigation. But the young farmer failed to get lucrative returns. Realising that the mono-cropping system of paddy cultivation has become increasingly risky due to failing monsoons, he decided to change the cultivation pattern in early 2017 by experimenting with mixed cropping system.""I took less than an acre of my land to experiment mixed cropping cultivation. Groundnut was taken as the major crop inter-cropped with pulses like red gram, cowpea, and mung dal in the field. Small onion (shallot) was also cultivated on the irrigation bunds. To avoid cattle from feeding on the cultivated pulses, sesame crop was grown around the standing crops to act as fence since cattle would not consume the crop owing to its sticky nature,"" Kalaiselvan told TOI.A couple of months after the attempt, he found that the weed growth was suppressed in the mixed cropping system due to multiple cultivation occupying more space, thus resulting in the reduction of farm labour required for weeding. As Kalaiselvan found available space to cultivate other crops, he introduced cotton too. ""In mono cropping system, only paddy can be harvested for the family and other food items had to be sourced from outside. On the other hand, the mixed cropping system contributed food products such as pulses, small onions and oil extracted from groundnut and sesame for the family needs,"" Kalaiselvan adds.Besides the financial gain, the problem with pest was also said to be contained in mixed cropping system. ""In mixed cropping, if one crop fails, the loss can be compensated with other crops. But such assurance and risk reduction component are missing in the mono-cropping system,"" K Suresh Kanna, deputy director of Kudumbam , an organisation promoting organic farming, said. With this success, Kalaiselvan said that he has been planning to extend some more areas to mixed cropping method and also attract more farmers to it."

After the ceremonial lighting of the lamp, the fest was started by a French band, Lorenzo Naccarato Trio . For 25 minutes, the crowd was treated to the melodious rhythm of the piano, bass and drums. Tapping and grooving, the crowd was seen swaying to the crescendos and the diminuendos. Joining them on stage next was 4 On A Swing, a band from Kolkata. The evening was brought to a close by a jazz group from Spain, Alfonso Aroca Flamenco.Lorenzo Naccarato Trio, a band from FranceLorenzo Naccarato Trio, who performed in Chennai, Bangalore, Ahmedabad and Pune as part of their five-city maiden international tour in India, found India to be a place that is constantly moving.

Lorenzo, sharing one incident from his tour, said, ""I met this tuk-tuk driver and wanted to have real cha, on the streets. So I asked him, let's have cha together.

However, the saving grace for consumers has come in the form of tiny Bellary onions costing just Rs 12 a kg which have been flooding the markets.Dindigul district is known for its onion cultivation, predominantly shallots which are cultivated on about 3,000 to 4,000 hectares. However, drought conditions had brought down the cultivation by more than fifty per cent. Deputy director of horticulture, Dindigul, Suresh Sriram said that it would take at least another three months for the price of shallots to come down as only some farmers had taken up cultivation and it would take another two months for them to harvest their crops.Unlike millets, all vegetable crops, including onions are water-intensive and though there was rainfall this season it was insufficient to recharge the ground water for a full-fledged cultivation to take place, he said. Onion was a short-term crop of which harvesting can be done 65 days after cultivation. As some of the farmers have just sown the seeds it will take another two months to harvest, he added.A P Mahendran, a farmer and wholesale onion seller, said that the price of onion seeds had also increased many fold making it difficult for farmers. ``Onion seeds per hectare cost Rs 50,000 and there is an additional cost of Rs 50,000 for cultivation. So, Rs 1 lakh is needed to cultivate onions on an acre,'' he said. When water availability was also less, farmers were not ready to take the risk, he added.On the other hand, onion bulbs are selling at Rs 1,500 a kilogram. Since they start sprouting in 40 days and can be harvested in three months, many farmers had gone for it, he said. The price of mature big onions has been hovering over Rs 25 to Rs 30 at present."

Citing an example, she recalled, Every month, of total 50 cases, 20 turn out to be related to fight over onion or some similar trivial matters.Adding further, she said such issues were majorly found in the marriages which were arranged through matrimonial websites. This couple too came in contact with each other through a matrimonial site.Such marriages fall apart within a period of six to 12 months. It happens because couples do not compromise on their eating habits and lifestyle after their marriage, Baljeet added.Matrimonial sites a problemMandeep Kaur said, Majority of people marrying through matrimonial websites are youngsters who find it hard to adjust in joint families and want to live alone.Over 650 cases have been reported at the women cell until September this year, said a police official.

The late rains will benefit planting of rabi crops such as wheat and chana, Pattanayak said on Thursday.""We are expecting a very good rabi season, so that should make up for all the minuses which has been ascribed for kharif,"" he said. The season's total rainfall for the country is 5% below normal, but it will not make any impact on planting that will begin in a fortnight, he said.Most parts of northwest and central India received deficit rainfall, but farmers in Punjab and Haryana have access to canal irrigation that helps them plant even if rainfall is scanty.Pattanayak attributed his confidence on rabi harvest to an extended monsoon. ""It (Monsoon) is now in withdrawal phase but still not complete, as we are expecting four days of very good rain in some parts of south India,"" he said. ""That is the region where rainfall has been deficit."" A drought assessment report prepared by Mahalanobis Crop Forecast Centre under the agriculture ministry had said that as of August end more than 225 districts in 17 states had less than normal rainfall.Pattanayak, however, said, ""We have to read Mahalanobis data with actual field situation to get a clear picture.""He said the 5% deficit in monsoon rains for the season would not make any impact on food security and food production. ""The occasional dip in vegetables will be there depending on local and seasonal condition, but we are quite comfortable in onion and potato production,"" Pattanayak said.Mahalanobis data is largely dependent on satellite-based remote sensing indices, rainfall data, soil moisture estimates, crop sown area and irrigation statistics, which are used for drought warning and assessment.""We are in a very good position as far as agriculture sector is concerned, contrary to the popular impression that is being carried out that we had a deficit rainfall,"" Pattanayak said. ""This monsoon, deficit has been only 5% for the country and in parts  south peninsular, north-west and central MP  it has been more than 5%. Some parts like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Assam and east Uttar Pradesh have also been impacted due to floods, where once the water receded farmers went for replanting,"" he said."

That their protests are localized and often about apparently different issues provide adequate scope to pretend that they are making a fuss about nothing much and the problems, if there are any, only need a quick-fix solution. In Tikamgarh in Madhya Pradesh last week, around 10,000 farmers - the number, if reported correctly, is nothing to sniff at - gathered to demand that the district be declared drought-hit. It did not help their cause that they were led by the former Congress member of the legislative assembly of the area and the Opposition leader. There was trouble enough with the police in front of the district magistrate's office where the farmers were agitating, reportedly throwing stones while the police used lathis and tear gas. But when the farmers were dispersing, the police arrested some of them, and allegedly beat them up. More, pictures and video clips show that the farmers were forced to strip down to their underwear. Unnerved by these images, the Madhya Pradesh government has ordered an investigation. What will an investigation do? In June, six farmers were killed by police bullets in Mandsaur in the west of the state during an agitation demanding, among other things, a farm loan waiver as in Uttar Pradesh and better minimum support prices. Overproduction of certain items had driven prices down, without any let-up in the high input prices. Advice from government agencies had led many farmers to grow, say, onions, on a much larger scale, after which the excess of onion crop found no takers. Forty-six first information reports were filed after the incident, all of them against the protesters. No accountability was demanded of the policemen who shot them down. Why should the aftermath of Tikamgarh be different? The police's alleged actions were intended not just to intimidate the men but also to humiliate them: the farmers were being shown their place. The police represent the state government, hence the government's attitude to farmers can be inferred. The problems are not really localized or discrete. Farmers killing themselves year after year exposes how agricultural policies keep failing them. Now, it seems, models of development too are ignoring their needs. As Tikamgarh shows, the State has no wish to deal with the deep problems that underlie their grievances."

It is being sold at a rate of `40 per kg in the city as 10 per cent of the total 50 kg onions in a gunny bag often get damaged, a retailer, Harihar Barik, said. Three weeks back, onion was available for `20 per kg. Later, the price kept increasing by `4 to `5 every 4 to 5 days till it doubled, sources said.The price wouldnt turn moderate for one month, till the new onions hit the market. Even as the price has shot up, Rourkela city administration is yet to take any step towards moderating the hike.The Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department sent instructions on Thursday evening to monitor the situation. The officials will start verification of stocks with local wholesalers from Friday onwards, Rourkela-based Assistant Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) and Market Intelligence Officer R C Tudu said. The ACSO, however, attributed the rise in onion price to hike in wholesale price at the source point in Nashik. There is no shortage of onion supply, Tudu added.Meanwhile, locals have cut down on their onion consumption. I have stopped using onions for all the dishes cooked in my home due to the price hike, said Sangeeta Singh, a housewife.Earlier, the onion price had touched `28 per kg towards the end of July.

(Representational Image) Traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. (Representational Image)AS THE price of onions witnessed a steep hike in retail markets across the city this week, traders attributed it to a shortage of supply of the vegetable to the Pune Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC). In one week, the prices have risen from Rs 20 per kilogram to Rs 38 and 40. As per the traders, the price of the commodity is expected to remain high for at least a month, as the supply to the market has dried up. This, the traders said, was because the ongoing showers were creating issues in harvest of the kharif crops.Vilas Bhujbal, a trader at Market Yard, said, The markets should have received kharif crops by now but because of the ongoing showers theres difficulty in harvesting the crops. The stocks from Rabi crops have already dried up. Hence, the supply to the market is going down with every passing day. He added that the price of onions in wholesale market at Pune APMC range from Rs 2,000 to 2,200 per quintal this week. If this continues, the retail rates may even touch Rs 50 by the end of this month, he said.Traders said the shortage of supply was likely to continue till the first month of the next year. Damage of the onion crop is not restricted to Maharashtra, a similar situation is prevailing in neighbouring Karnataka, they added. Changdeo Holkar, former director of the National Agriculture Marketing co-operative Federation, said, In some of the districts, as much as 60 per cent crop has been damaged due to untimely rainfall. Farmers whose crops survived may get a great return this time. That is, if the government doesnt intervene.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"

But the country still has some distance to cover in terms of exports as post-harvest wastage of produce in India is high.In 2015, the Modi government started project CHAMAN  acronym for Coordinated Horticulture Assessment and Management using geo-informatics  to prepare a comprehensive horticultural plan. Using remote sensing technology to study soil conditions, land use, weather and cropping patter, the Centre has chosen 185 districts across the country where seven selected crops are being promoted.Once complete, the findings of the project would be shared with all states to give to boost to cultivation of horticultural crops.States put into groupsDifferent states have been divided into different groups to grow banana, mango, citrus fruits, potato, tomato, onion and chilli.Sharing the progress of the project CHAMAN at a press briefing, Mr Singh said the Centre would convene a meeting of the northeastern states by January next year as the report on horticulture development for this region was ready.This sector provides nutrient rich crops to the people and better remunerative prices to the farmers and increases their incomes, Mr. Singh said.Under CHAMAN, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Maharashtra have been identified as the major banana-growing states. Mango cultivation is being promoted in Andhra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana, while onion is the focus for Maharashtra, Gujarat, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh."

According to market sources, the prices are expected to be within this range for some time as there has been an almost 60 per cent-dip in onion production in the neighbouring Karnataka.In view of the rise in onion prices in retail markets across the country, the central government had urged the state to investigate the cause of the rise. The district deputy registrar was directed to conduct an inquiry in the matter. Accordingly, the district collector of Nashik held a meeting with the traders and representatives of the various market committees and suggested that they forgo the traditional week-long Diwali break, which is supposed to start from Monday. The move aimed at stopping the escalation of onion prices.However, farmer organisations rejected the suggestion, saying that this was intentionally done to reduce the prices. Dipak Pagar, leader of the Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana and director of the Nampur wholesale market, meanwhile warned of an agitation by farmers against the anti-farmer policies of the central government.On Monday, the average modal price of trade was Rs 2,300 in Lasalagon market, with 1,500 quintals of onions arriving for trade. In the neighbouring Pimpalgaon market, the average price of trade was Rs 2,425, with 7,500 quintals arriving for auction. Sources attributed the low arrival to the festive season, when farmers normally refrain from coming to the market.The present price trend, Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaons wholesale market, said the price trend will continue till the new crop arrives. Farmers have the bare minimum stock. However, the price rise is mainly because of the almost 60 per cent-dip reported in the kharif area from Karnataka, he said. Maharashtras kharif onion, Holkar said, will start arriving post Diwali and, till then, the price rise is expected to continue.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5a1516a49855b76bf13ead82,Food for reform,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indian-farmers-food-prices-inflation-indian-economy-food-for-reform-4898307/,2017-10-20,"Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) Price instability at the macro level is caused by supply shocks. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)EXTREME volatility in the prices of some food commodities has, in recent years, been hurting producers as well as consumers, while also disrupting certain economic activities. The reason for this appears to be the waning influence of non-price factors (technology, irrigation, extension) in driving growth, and the role of prices having become stronger. There is clear evidence at the global level to show that till mid-2000, the trend in output growth drove price trend (higher growth associated with lower price) but during the last 10 years, price trends have driven output growth. The so-called Cobweb phenomenon is becoming more apparent, leading to a price-production spiral. In this context, it is important to look at the price stabilisation policy and measures adopted by India from time to time, and draw lessons to maintain a stable price environment that benefits both producers as well as consumers.Price instability at the macro-level is caused by supply shocks. Trading and stocking up are the two options to stabilise supply and by extension, prices. India has historically relied heavily on buffer stock to maintain price stability in staple food, though this policy has come under attack from supporters of free trade, who feel stocking up is a costlier option for price stabilisation. Experience, however, shows that it is often trade that is more expensive. Take the case of wheat in which international prices rose sharply when India entered the market to import the crop and augment its domestic supply.It was due to its policy of maintaining buffer stock that India ensured remarkable price stability during the global food crisis, when almost all countries, including the developed ones, faced a steep price rise. Should India then use a similar option to achieve price stability in pulses, which have shown extreme volatility in the last three years?Some gains from the steps taken by the government to create a buffer stock of pulses are already visible. The buffer stock, mainly aimed at stabilising consumer prices, has made it possible to procure pulses. Last year, India recorded an unprecendented 40 per cent increase in total pulses production over the previous year. The increase was 87 per cent for arhar (tur) dal. This kind of spike in production would have led to a serious crash or even a collapse in prices had the government not intervened  the Central agencies procured 14.7 lakh tonnes of kharif pulses. Nevertheless, farm harvest prices of some pulses dropped well below the MSP in 2016-17, but the shortfall was similar to what has been witnessed quite often in the past, even during years of normal growth in production. For instance, the farm harvest price of arhar in 2013-14 was 14 per cent below MSP in Karnataka and 7 per cent in Maharashtra; the two states account for half of the total tur production.In some mandis, farmers received 30 per cent less than the MSP. Similarly, the five states which account for 85 per cent of gram (chickpea) production received 3 to 9 per cent lower farm harvest price than the MSP in 2013-14. This comparison shows that it is not correct to blame the government for inaction in checking prices of pulses falling below the MSP in a year of bumper production.Based on the experience of rice and wheat, the pragmatic approach appears to be to use the buffer stock option along with the trade option to stabilise the price of pulses. The level of buffer stock should be determined by technical considerations and trade opportunities.Regulation and competition in the market also affect price volatility. If there is an Essential Commodities Act with stock limits on traders, it will rule out the possibility of the private sector mopping up more than the normal marketed surplus, forcing prices to go down.When there is a glut, there is a disproportionate price spread between retail and farm. This is particularly true in the case of vegetables. Price spikes are also sometimes created by cartels of traders, especially at the local level. The reason for such price fluctuations is poor market integration across regions/states over time. This year, while onion prices in some markets in Madhya Pradesh dropped below Rs 200 per quintal in the second fortnight of May, the crop was selling at over Rs 700 per quintal in the major markets of neighbouring Uttar Pradesh. By August, the price of onion touched Rs 800 a quintal in the mandis of Madhya Pradesh and close to Rs 2,000 in the wholesale markets in Delhi. Why wasnt onion promptly taken to other states when prices crashed in MP? Why could it not be stored for just two months to take advantage of the large price increase? These questions have been haunting the country for several years and the answers are well known  remove various restrictions under the APMC Act, facilitate private sector participation and investment in agri markets, promote storage, and link the processing industry to the farm through contract farming etc.The Central government has made a lot of effort to persuade states to implement market reforms and adopt a model APMC Act. It has also urged the states to allow direct purchase by the private sector; set up mandis in the private sector; allow farmers to sell directly to consumers; ensure a single trading license; allow electronic trading; and take fruits and vegetables out of the purview of the APMC Act. These reforms have either been completely ignored or adopted partially with considerable dilution by the states. The sufferers are farmers. The failure to establish a competitive market is forcing farmers to ask for higher MSP and expand procurement to all crops to make MSP effective.In conclusion, price volatility and low and unremunerative prices for farm produce can be addressed to a large extent through competitive markets. In most cases, a competitive market will fetch the farmers higher prices than MSPs. This requires carrying out long-pending reforms in the agricultural market. Due to the delay and reluctance on the part of states to implement market reforms, it looks imperative to bring agricultural marketing into the Concurrent or Union list and implement a national-level model market act with all the required reforms. Bringing marketing under the Concurrent or Union list is also justified on the ground that a large proportion of farm produce is sold and consumed outside the states they are produced in. Still, strategic intervention by the government in the form of buffer stock will be needed in a few cases.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The trend will continue till Chhath as many people will only consume vegetarian dishes during the course of the festival.Residents, however, are feeling the pinch of the price rise - a pair of cauliflowers available for Rs 50 now costs Rs 100. Similarly, bottle gourd, which was available for Rs 20 a piece, now costs Rs 40 per kg. Even the price of onion has gone up from Rs 20 per kg to Rs 45 per kg.Be it pointed gourd, bitter gourd, sponge gourd, ladies finger, brinjal, tomato or potato, the price of all the vegetables have soared. The most expensive among them is coriander which now stands at Rs 400 per kg.On the sudden price rise, Bablu, a vegetable seller at Rajapur Pul vegetable market, said: ""The price of vegetables has increased just before Diwali and it will continue till Chhath. It is not in our hands as we are also purchasing it at higher prices so we do not have any option but to sell at higher rates to make up the margin.""People who are involved in wholesale business are responsible for charging unnecessary money as they know very well that residents have no other option but to purchase at higher rates.Residents, naturally, expressed pain over the price-rise.Richa Kumari, a housewife at the Boring Canal Road locality, said: ""Pointed gourd which was available at Rs 20 per kg now costs Rs 40 per kg. Similarly, the price of sponge gourd and ladies finger has equally jumped. In the winter season, we love coriander sauce and it is really expensive; a little bit of coriander is not enough to make sauce. God knows when the prices will come down.""Agriculture department deputy director and agriculture expert Anil Kumar Jha, however, said the reason behind the sudden rise in vegetable price is the transition period.""This is the time when summer is on its last lap and winter is approaching. Because of this, the seasonal vegetable is getting over and fresh vegetables are coming into the market. It is actually a transition period when the supply of vegetables is less. Once winter vegetables fully reach the market, the prices will automatically go down."" Jha told The Telegraph.He also admitted that the traders intentionally increase the price to make more money during the festive season specially Chhath as many people abstain from eating non-veg."

Tomatoes, onions, and coriander are costlier by Rs 5 to Rs 10 from last week, while carrots and cabbages have become dearer by Rs 20.Some vendors have blamed this rise on unseasonal rain in Maharashtra. Kolhapur, a city from which Goa sources its vegetables, was also hit, they said. ""Untimely rains have destroyed crops in Maharashtra, which has inturn led to a shortage of vegetable supplies,"" vendor Mahesh Amonkar said. ""Owing to the rain, the new onion crop has almost perished.Another greengrocer, Allaudin Negi, said, ""There is a shortage of vegetables coming into the market.

5a1544ea9855b76bf13ecbf5,The need for upending feudal markets,http://www.livemint.com/Opinion/U3MvWaOIyWNFlp0RKv2UvN/The-need-for-upending-feudal-markets.html,2017-11-05,"There is inbuilt resistance in feudal markets to innovative methods that upset the apple cart. Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintTwo common threads run through all current discussions on the Indian economy. First, growth has been rapid since economic liberalization was initiated. Second, the benefits of this growth are skewed with reference to peninsular and western India in contrast to eastern and northern India.Having seen how Andhra Pradesh in the mid-1970s and early 1980s was transformed from a backward economy to a relatively modern economy, I am persuaded to believe that there are two categories of markets: feudal markets and modern markets. Or more appropriately, markets in feudal structures and markets in modern societies. The responses of these two markets to external stimulibe it funds and investment or softer skills such as education and healthare different. Feudal markets function on relationships, hierarchy and patronage. Patron-client equations in hierarchical structures set the tone for the functioning of the economy, ruling out the possibility of structural transformation. The approach is anti-change rather than of breaking conventions in sync with economic democracy.These factors inhibit investment. There is inbuilt resistance to innovative methods that upset the apple cart, restricting the claims of equal rights of participation and of resultant gains. Modern markets, on the other hand, function on rules and transparency, and are open to innovative ideas. These factors attract investment with competition ensuring equal rights to all claimants. The implications of feudal markets and their regressive impact have not been addressed enough, perhaps on the assumption that markets are homogeneous, inanimate institutions.Market classification into feudal and modern is based on the conduct of business in these two markets. Cartels are good examples to highlight these differences. They occur in all markets. Firms collaborate to form cartels and fix prices. As a result, consumers are denied the benefit of competition. Game theoretic framework, however, shows that firms follow business strategies that result in identical price structures even in oligopolistic market structures without the need to collaborate or form cartels. In their effort to detect and break cartels, competition authorities instead look for agreements that indicate collaboration. Alternatively, they encourage whistle-blowing with appropriate incentives.In the case of feudal markets, game theoretic modelling is of no relevance. Collaboration is a non-issue. Entry is restricted with complete lack of transparency in all transactions as the Competition Commission discovered in its investigation into the onion trade cartel. Of prime significance in the onion market was the presence of strong kinship bonds among traders cemented over generations. The corollary condition of feudal markets was discernible in the patron-client relationship between peasant farmer and traders with predetermined prices and marketable stocks. The auction markets and bidding mechanisms of modern markets for competition remained a farce in the onion market. What is interesting and significant is that the commission could not break the cartel for want of evidence.Of course, it could be argued that the onion market is a one-off case typical of vegetable mandis. The intent is not to delve into a discussion on cartel busting but to highlight features of feudal markets that deter private foreign investment in modern industry. Hierarchical structures based on personal relationships as seen in the onion market or the denial of equal rights and claims of all participants are hardly conducive for attracting investment. Current data on foreign investment shows that six states and Union territoriesMaharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telanganagarnered a large portion in 2017.What could be a catalyst? The new narrative currently doing the rounds is of foreign investment flowing into activities pertaining to agriculture in economically backward states. Foreign investment is agnostic but would it usher change in a short time frame? I would root instead for investment in business that disrupts existing structures on a large scale.The Andhra Pradesh experience underlines foreign investment as a catalyst of change. Catching the tail wind of outsourcing, these investments in technology companies led to a chain of events, which, in my view, made the difference. The emergence of a host of services catering to upwardly mobile young people employed in these companies created jobs for low-skilled workers, many from rural areas, and exposed them to modern markets.Digitalization and the spread of smartphones throws up several outreach possibilities. This has demonstrated the innovative and inclusive approach of digital finance. New finance companies are selling customized financial products online to clientele outside structured financial institutions and at minimum risk. In the era of big data, digital sale of data offers unexplored opportunities to farmers. Real-time data on cropping patterns; resistance of new seeds to pests; responses to new varieties of seedits all information sought by international firms engaged in genetically modified seed technology and automation of farm equipment. This data business empowers small farmers. Negotiation with large business houses is now possible, unheard of within the feudal constricts of patron-client relations. The only hitch is resistance to rule-based modern markets ingrained in feudal societies.Geeta Gouri is a former member of the Competition Commission of India."

Onion prices have crashed.The government insisting on cash being replaced by cheque and digital payments is working against farmers and in favour of traders, the IndiaSpend survey shows. With slow digital infrastructure, cheques take 3-4 weeks to cash, delaying the buying of seed and fresh sowing operations. Often, the cheques bounce.On the night of November 8 last year, the government declared a war on the cash economy and black money. What happened, in fact, was a reasonably robust economy slowed down, and many small and medium enterprises (SMEs) got wiped out. The poor and the marginalised lost their jobs and had to spend days in queues at banks to draw a few rupees of their own hard-earned money.Little black money recoveredOn the first anniversary of notebandi, the PM is still in an aggressive mood threatening to crackdown on benami assets. There is still support for his bold move to root out the parallel economy that was funding terrorism and corruption. Some even said stone-pelting in the Kashmir Valley disappeared after the Rs 500-per-day per stone-pelter could not be sustained after the evaporation of illegal money stashes!But beyond the rhetoric, was the government able to unearth large stashes of black or unaccounted money?A Reserve Bank (RBI) report in end-August this year showed that of the Rs 15.44 lakh crore of demonetised notes circulating in November 2016, 99.96 percent or Rs 15.28 lakh crore was returned, leaving just Rs 16,000 crore unaccounted for. The government was expecting around Rs 3 lakh crore of dirty money not coming back to the system; but black money operators, traders and criminals employed armies of mules to deposit their stashes under benami names, money that became legal when withdrawn from the banks.The learning: unaccounted income is not stored in cash and under mattresses. An analysis of IT records shows that only six per cent of unaccounted wealth is kept in cash, while the bulk is parked in real estate, or abroad in a variety of instruments.Digital blunderDemonetisation was also an attempt to move towards a cashless, digital economy, but that is not easy for an economy that runs on cash. There was an initial spike in digital transactions. From November to December 2016, mobile banking and other digital payments went up from 9.6 lakh to 10.4 lakh transactions; but once more cash became available, by February 2017, digital transactions fell 16.7 percent to 8.08 lakh. A cashless economy needs a high level of digital infrastructure and financial education; and India will take some time before getting there.Pain on the groundOn the other hand, demonetisation triggered a slowdown and job losses that has meant unending pain for the common man and an embarrassment for the government. India showed a robust 7- 7.9 per cent robust gross domestic product (GDP) growth in the three quarters till the end of calendar year 2016, making it the fastest growing economy even ahead of China. Post-demonetisation, GDP growth fell to 6.1 per cent for the January-March 2017 quarter, and then further down to 5.7 per cent for the April-June quarter, making our growth rate slip behind China.Translated into real terms, it is estimated that businesses suffered losses of Rs 1.28 lakh crore for the first 50 days of demonetisation, and approximately 15 lakh people lost their jobs in the first four months after November 8.With hindsight, it is clear the government did not have its ear to the ground. The Prime Minister ignored the advice of Raghuram Rajan, former RBI governor who retired in September last year. Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramanian remained silent and was believed to have also been against the big bang reform. Perhaps, some convinced the PM that a Robin Hood attack on black money was easy to muddle through; and it would give him rich political benefits.Events have proved demonetisation was an economic disaster; but the jury is still out on whether the people perceive it so, and will punish the ruling party in the upcoming 2019 Lok Sabha elections.[The author can be contacted at gurbir1@gmail.com]"

Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor.On Saturday, when chef Sanjeev Kapoor answered Union Food Minister Harsimrat Kaur Badals call to position the khichdi as gourmet fare, he was performing a feat that many khansamas in Mughal kitchens were required to accomplish for their livelihoods. The 17th-century text, Khulasat-i-Makulat u Mashrubat notes how the one-pot rice and lentil dish had to be adapted for fine dining. Fry garlic, onion rings, cinnamon and cumin. Remove the mixture from the fire and set it aside. Fry mung dal in ghee. Add rice and mix well. Add the spice mixture along with ginger and hot water. Finally add ghee and slow cook to finish, describes a recipe in the cookbook written during Aurangzebs time. The sixth Mughal Emperor was so fond of the dish that he gave it his name  Alamgiri khichdi.There is food that marks opulence and indulgence and there are dishes that denote simplicity. Despite its association with royalty, the khichdi remained a quintessentially unostentatious fare. In the 16th and 17th century, writes food historian Lizzie Collingham, the staple food of the rural peasants and also of the urban artisans and labourers was khichdi. Every region had a variation on the recipe, according to which grain they grew. Thus millet sometimes replaced the rice or chickpeas were used instead of lentils.Historically, in much of the world, kingly kitchens set the standards of high-class cooking. The khichdi too wasnt impervious to social differentiation. But despite the embellishments by the royal chefs, it was its simplicity that made the khichdi the favourite of Mughal emperors. Aurangzeb ate frugally and the Alamgiri khichdi was in sync with the overall austere disposition of the emperor. Akbar  unlike Aurangzeb in almost every other manner  was an even more frugal eater than his great-grandson. Abul Fazl, his minister and biographer, notes that the emperor would fast on certain days, avoid eating flesh and usually eat khichdi.For Akbars son, Jahangir, the dish was almost therapeutic in his long-battles against alcoholism. It is not devoid of flavour and it suited me well. I ordered that on days of abstinence when I partake of dishes not made of flesh, they should frequently bring me this khichdi, the fourth Mughal emperor wrote in his memoir, The Tuzuk-i-Jahangiri.The food historian Colleen Taylor Sen writes that Jahangir had acquired the love for the dish during his campaigns in Gujarat. A food that is particular to the people of Gujarat is the bajra khichdi, a mixture of split peas and millet boiled together, Jahangir writes in The Tuzuk. His chefs though had to devise a more spectacular version, lazeezan  lamb, nuts and saffron were combined with rice and moong dal  when the emperor was in a mood to indulge.In modern times, Michelin-starred chefs have tried to tread the path of their predecessors in kitchens of Mughal emperors. There is a Black Olive Khichdi served with Rosemary Chilli Tikka and Chilli Pipette. There is a broccoli khichdi and a lobster khichdi. And there is a version that has almost 50 ingredients. But some dishes seem at odds with restaurants. They evoke the warmth of homes, aromas of kitchens and the fraternity of shared meals. The decorum of fine dining might not have any place for the unhinged licking of fingers after a meal of khichdi and brinjal fritters  or fried fish.It remains to be seen if the food ministrys enterprise turns the one-pot rice and lentil dish into the countrys culinary brand. But the dish may still hold its own in restaurants. After all, people eat less regularly at homes today. However, there is very little chance that the modern-day eater seeking comfort food will enjoy her rice and lentil meal like the 17th-century soldiers who the French traveller Jean Baptiste Tavernier found making khichdi more luxurious by dipping their fingers in bowls of melted ghee as they ate.kaushik.dasgupta@expressindia.comFor all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Gopal Krishan, buyer at Sec 26Traders say incessant rains in states producing these vegetables have affected the crop, increasing the prices, which are now testing the patience of city residents.A couple of weeks ago, tomato was priced at Rs 35-40 per kg. The price has now skyrocketed to anywhere between Rs 80 and Rs 100, said Deepak, a vegetable vendor at Sector 26. The wholesale price of tomato is Rs 50 per kg.Meanwhile, onion, which was priced at Rs 30 per kg a couple of weeks ago, is now being sold for Rs 45 per kg in retail.There is apparent hoarding of the stock, said Deepak. It happens every now and then to increase the gap between demand and supply. Recently there were reports that raids were carried out in Nashik, Maharashtra, after which the supply was brought back on track.However, Deepak cautioned the onion prices are likely to rise further in the coming weeks.Seeing the sudden hike in prices, which have hit the household budgets hard, residents have started buying lesser quantities of vegetables.We have stopped consuming tomato as it is being sold for Rs 100 per kg, said Gopal Krishan, who came to buy vegetables at Sector 26. The hike in onion prices has served another blow to the common man.Such high prices of vegetables used in everyday cooking is a major concern, said Rajeev Kumar, a resident of Sector 27. The government should step in and take concrete steps to bring some relief.Meanwhile, green peas, too, have seen a steady rise in prices, being sold at Rs 100 - Rs120 per kg. Carrot is available for Rs 60 per kg.Prices of carrots and green peas will come down in the coming weeks as the local stock will also pour in. Till now, the prices are high due to the fresh stock coming in from other states, said Sunil, a local vegetable vendor."
5a1588e29855b76bf13eea63,The quiet charms of Khichdi,https://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Citycitybangbang/the-quiet-charms-of-khichdi/,2017-11-06,"It now appears that there is no proposal to anoint Khichdi as the national dish of India, but regardless of whether khichdi deserves that title or not and glossing over the question of whether in a country like ours, any one dish can or should be classified as such, it certainly gives us an occasion to talk about something that has been a significant part of most of our lives.The sniffy comments about this simple dish made by assorted food snobs tell one part of the story. The experts on health and culinary tradition have other stories to tell. As someone who has grown up relishing khichdi, what follows is a very personal tribute to this humble dish.The simplest possible combination of the two major food groups, khichdi is food at its comforting best. A hot meal of khichdi shushes the senses, evens out temperamental stomachs, and satiates without leaving any residue behind; khichdi burps taste of nothing.My memories of khichdi are many. In our Gujarati household that lived outside the state most of the time, khichdi was most commonly our Sunday lunch. It was a meal that was looked forward to with quiet pleasure; it had a wholesome quality that made for hearty satisfaction.The consistency that was most preferred was wet without becoming runny, with grains just a little bit squished up. Ghee was poured in generous quantities; as children it was fun to make a mound of the khichdi dig a little hole in the centre and fill it up with ghee. Into this mixture went some spiced potatoes, a special jeera-clad onion salad, chaas, papad and some mango pickle. Together, this unfussy confluence of simple tastes came together week after week in a very precise way.The masterful simplicity of each ingredient in the meal bears reflection. Rice, dal with almost no spices, cooked without ceremony. Unlike the idea of khichdi as mish-mash (kya khichdi paka rahe ho?), an ungainly dumping together of disparate ingredients, the reality about it was the wordless harmony that existed between the two major food sects.Khichdi blended rice and dal together as if they belonged. Ghee, which makes the world feel plumper, adding a rich emulsion of pleasure to anything it is poured on, accentuated the bland fullness of the taste. Potatoes, that staple filler of blank spaces with several kinds of awesomeness, cooked with mustard seeds and left dry. Papad, the provider of crunchy service on demand, the attendant always ready to confer its crackle on a meal. Pickle, the little bite sized compression of a universe of very expressive flavours, seething naughtily in its own juices. Onion, the simple slice of a food that served as spice, an ingredient that turned any dish slightly sideways, a dash of knowing worldly wisdom added to things bland.In our house, with khichdi, and only with it, the onion was slathered in oil with jeera and salt sprinkled on it, and set off the potatoes particularly well. And to top it off, Chaas, gentle and kind, making ones stomach, and by extension the world, a calmer place.In some parts of the country, khichdi is looked down upon as the diet for those convalescing. This makes it the poor cousin of food, the stuff we make do with when our bodies are not quite ready for the real thing. I have never quite understood this view of khichdi, for it passes up on the pleasures of simplicity and confuses it with ordinariness.The idea that food must always perform, that it must necessarily transport us somewhere else, is a rigid view of its role in our lives. There is a time and place for that, indeed there must be for food is travel, and food is music, but food is also home.And the thing is, getting simple meals right is not easy. A cup of tea, scrambled eggs, nimbu-paani, coconut chutney- these everyday foods are very elusive when it comes to getting proportions just right. Khichdi is no exception, and getting the balance of the ingredients right was both very easy and extremely rare.With some people, notably mothers, getting khichdi right was effortless while in other cases, something always seemed a little off. With simple foods, it all comes down to proportion, timing, touch, restraint, love- there is no particular technique or skill involved, nothing dramatic by way of ingredients or presentation. The person cooking works with very little, and do so with instinct, as a habit. Perhaps, simple staple foods are nothing but an organic overflow of the person cooking.Khichdi derives its power from what it is not. It chooses to sidestep the flashy culinary razzle dazzle, choosing instead to let the taste come to the food, rather than the other way around. There might well be other ways of defending this noble food, perhaps from the perspective of health, perhaps even from the standpoint of culinary heritage, but personally, the truth that khichdi spoke had nothing to do with these. It held things together, it sat in the middle of everything, right at the centre with no interest in anything that lies at the edges. Khichdi is home, comfort without any reason, taste without any credentials.The stomach full with a hot meal sleeps easy. We regain an alignment with the world, things slip back into place, afternoon heat settles on us, and our eyes find it no longer useful to stay open. Slipping into khichdi-induced sleep on a hot summer Sunday, under a reluctant fan, the distant buzz of some insect, life takes on a timeless drone of inevitability. The complex, the layered and the textured can be great, but only the simple can be perfect."

In the uzhavar santhais in the district, the price remained at Rs. 90 on Sunday. The small onion was priced between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 last month.The hike is said to be due to sudden fall in the arrival of stock from the villages following the receipt of widespread rainfall in the recent past. Due to the hike in the price, there are not much takers for small onion.The uzhavar santhai in Edappadi used to have at least ten stalls marketing small onion. Due to the fall in the arrival, only one stall had small onion stock on Saturday.Instead, the consumers opt for the big onion whose price stood at Rs. 50 per kg in the open markets and Rs. 40  Rs. 45 in the uzhavar santhais.Due to the monsoon season, the price of greens has also gone up in the markets, so also brinjal which is being sold at Rs. 60 per kg in the uzhavar santhais.According to a cross section of vegetable traders, the inclement weather has affected the production of small onion and other vegetables in the villages. The villages are registering only one fourth of usual small onion production in the recent past.Due to the rainfall, the farmers are not able to harvest the small onions, leading to sharp fall in the arrival.The marriage days have further led to the increase in the price. The price of the vegetables, including small onion, is expected to register a downward trend, once the arrivals from the villages stabilised, they add."

Those arrested were identified as Kamal Kalra, a DJ, and Mahesh Goyal, who attends rave parties and supplies drugs to Kalra.The value of the seized drug is around Rs 3 lakh, police said on Monday.Digging Deep Web for drugsRajesh Deo, deputy commissioner of police (crime), said Goyal disclosed that the illegal online drug trade is done through deep web, which is the opposite term for surface web. Unlike surface web that is accessible to anyone using the Internet, the content of deep web is invisible and hidden behind HTML (hypertext markup language) forms.This illegal business works on peer group model and it spreads from one user to another by word of mouth. Goyal had first consumed ecstasy at a rave party in Chennai and learnt that it can be procured through online shopping using websites like dream market by operating in deep web accessed through browsers like tor browser and onion browser, Deo said.Bitcon for paymentsAlok Kumar, joint commissioner of police (crime) says the payment for such consignments is done through Bitcoin and the delivery is made by post and courier from countries such as the Netherlands and the US.Bitcoin is a digital currency that is not tied to a bank or government and allows users to spend money anonymously.The Delhi Police have approached the narcotic control bureau (NCB) and ministry of electronics and information technology to ensure that such online trade and transactions are stopped. They are also probing how the supply of contraband through couriers in India from other countries is going undetected and unchecked.According to Deo, Kalra was arrested on October 29 from Sector-13, Rohini with 100 pills of ecstasy, popularly known as yokes, MDMA and pills. Kalras interrogation revealed that he had procured the contraband from a man who contacted him and introduced himself with various names such as Sanjay and Utkarsh.Police collected details of the user of the mobile number and later arrested Goyal from Dwarka. Twenty grams of MDMA in raw form was seized from him, said the DCP."

In 2012, the lotus had wilted in the valley when the Virbhadra Singh-led Congress swept 10 of its 15 seats, denying Prem Kumar Dhumal the chance for a saffron rerun.The Prime Minister kicked off his campaign with a rally in Kangra valley. BJP leaders are swarming the place in an unprecedented manner, said Sudesh Chouhan, a government employee.BJP chief Amit Shah is learnt to have taken upon himself the task of ensuring that his party does not run into the ghost of 2012, when it could win just three seats in the district.In 2012, Dhumal and the Lok Sabha MP from here, Shanta Kumar, had sparred to defend their respective political turfs, which proved detrimental to the partys interests. Shah is giving due recognition to Kumar in this election, while Dhumal is promising to bring development work to this district on the lines of Hamirpur, said a local BJP functionary.However, Kangra, the most populous district of the hilly state, is humming with complaints against the Modi government at the Centre. Only a couple of days back, the price of an LPG cylinder was hiked by Rs 96. Besides, onion prices are burning holes in the kitchen budget, said Sumitra Rana, a beautician in Nagrota town. The people were unable to spell out specific grievances against the goods and services tax but claimed there was a loud negative buzz about it.In 2007, Kangra had thrown up an opposite verdict, with the BJP winning 10 of 15 seats. Panch-panch saal (five years each), said Rajesh Thakur of Dehra constituency, suggesting that people in the district liked a change in the party in power every five years. He added that Congress candidates were well known to the people.Although the Thakurs are the predominant caste accounting for roughly 30 per cent of the electorate, too many candidates from the community are threatening to split caste votes. Brahmins have been traditional BJP supporters. With two Thakurs (Virbhadra and Dhumal) slugging it out for the chief ministers chair, the caste vote will split. In many seats in Kangra, both parties have fielded Thakur candidates. This gives an advantage to the BJP, which hopes to gain sizeable Brahmin votes, said a BJP functionary.Himachal Pradesh has 68 Assembly constituencies with an electorate of 49,91,921. Kangra, which is dotted with temples, has an electorate of 11,83,468 and draws hordes of religious tourists. Foreign tourists throng Dharamshala and Mcleodgunj, mostly to seek an audience with the Dalai Lama."

Photo: Abhijit Bhatlekar/MintMumbai/Delhi: Narayan Ghawat, a 66-year-old paddy farmer in Mila village of Maharashtras Thane district, was mighty impressed with Prime Minister Narendra Modis demonetisation drive when he read about it in newspapers on 9 November 2016. One year later, Ghawat does not quite understand what demonetisation has achieved.I think the objective was good but it has not been achieved. It has not unearthed black money to the extent Modiji said it would, Ghawat says as he awaits his turn at a branch of Thane District Central Co-operative Bank. Ghawat does not have a debit card and does banking the traditional way. Before he withdraws money and leaves the bank, he helps fill up a cheque for a tribal couple, both farm labourers, from his village.Dhondu Mukne, the tribal farm labourer, remembers notebandi, as demonetisation is popularly known, as the period when his daily wages of Rs300 would not be paid in cash at the end of the day. It was paid after some days, Dhondu says. Now, Dhondu says he gets paid his wages in cash at the end of each day he puts in. Dhondu offers little on notebandi other than this impact.Ghawat grows paddy on his 3 acre farm. Extended monsoon rains have damaged his standing paddy crop, causing a nearly 25% drop in productivity compared with the 20 quintals he grew in 2016. He says he will sell the produce at a government-appointed procurement centre.Money will be transferred to my bank account if I sell rice at the government-operated procurement centre. But this would happen even before notebandi. Now even traders have to deposit money directly into farmers accounts if they have purchased farm produce from them. That is not exactly a good thing for farmers because we need some ready cash for day-to-day expenses and agriculture inputs, Ghawat says.One year after Modis demonetisation, the farm sector has somewhat recovered from the immediate impact it causeda cash crunch for buyers of farm produce, disruption in movement and supply chain of commodities leading to a steep rise in the retail prices, and loss of cash wages for millions of farm labourers across the country. But farmers, activists, other farm sector stakeholders like functionaries of the regulated markets, and experts point out the long-term damage demonetisation has done to the farm sector.Demonetisation distorted an already skewed and fragile farm sector across India. It snuffed out cash from a market which is largely cash-driven and which operates mutually on cash flows. It caused an average 20-30% fall in the prices of most commodities, a fall from which no farm produce has yet recovered, and also impacted the consumer goods in rural and semi-rural markets because farmers are the largest component of buyers in these markets, said an agriculture sector expert in Maharashtra who runs a think-tank and who did not wish to be named.In Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Telangana, states that are still recovering from the impact of drought, demonetisation contributed to a market-driven crisis by cutting down the margins that the farmers would have realized if cash was not scarce.In Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, it added fuel to the demand for farm loan waivers which, as in Maharashtra where it has been conceded, puts additional long-term stress on the state finances and takes away capital from productive investment and allocates it to non-productive.Protests in Maharashtra triggered a similar agitation in neighbouring Madhya Pradesh in June. In Mandsaur district, six protestors were killed in the police firing. In Maharashtra, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government blinked and announced a Rs34,022 crore farm loan waiver which is being implemented using online and biometric systems. Maharashtra followed another BJP-ruled state Uttar Pradesh, which had already announced a Rs36,000 crore loan waiver.While the jury is still out on the costs and benefits of demonetisation, farm sector stakeholders see little for farmers to cheer about the disruptive decision. Demonetisation was never an economic decision. It was a political decision which paid off for Modi in the Uttar Pradesh elections. In the short term after 8 November, it only compounded the systemic problems for farmers, says Vidarbha-based farmer and farm activist Vijay Jawandhia. It was in Uttar Pradesh that Modi, while campaigning for the BJP, promised a farm loan waiver, an announcement that predictably had repercussions in other BJP-ruled states.Another Maharashtra-based sector expert and former member of the Commission for Agriculture Costs and Prices (CACP), who requested anonymity, says it is the trading lobby in the farm sector which made the most of demonetisation at the cost of the most vulnerable segmentthe farmers themselves. The commodity traders exploited demonetisation as an opportunity. Since they had cash in old or banned currency, they offered it to farmers who wanted to sell their produce to get some cash. The farmer, who sold his produce to the traders for prices much lower than the market, then stood in the queues to exchange this currency. This way, traders offloaded some of their black money. Traders exploited the cash crunch created by demonetisation to bring down the prices of farm produce to such distress levels that it created a market-driven agrarian crisis in a year of record high yields, the expert said.He said demonetisation had created problems for the farmers on the input side by creating a cash crunch just ahead of the 2017 Rabi season, and the output side by allowing traders to dampen the prices, and also the farm labourers.Despite fears that demonetisation will impact the Rabi crop, overall foodgrain production at 276 million tonnes broke all records in 2016-17. Together with a bumper harvest of horticulture crops like fruits and vegetables, Indias agriculture growth rate shot up to a high of 4.9% during the year, up from a measly 0.7% the year before. The record harvest, coupled with demonetisation pulled down crop prices, especially that of perishable crops and pulses.A senior Maharashtra government official, who did not want to be named, admitted the disruptive nature of demonetisation on the farm sector but pointed out some benefits too. Traders registered across Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs) in Maharashtra started making payments to farmers through real-time gross settlement and national electronic funds transfer systems, he noted. This happened in other states as well after the initial disruption. This change not only reduced the role of middlemen and commission agents but also enabled state governments across India to digitally identify farmers, the official said.Jaydatta Holkar, president of the Lasalgaon APMC in Maharashtras Nashik district, Indias largest regulated onion market, agreed with the observation but said the change was not necessarily good for farmers. Earlier since the transactions were cash-based, both farmers and traders had enough cash and the cash flow kept the economy running. Traders would raise soft loans to pay off farmers and repay the loans when the commodities moved further in the wholesale and retail market. But the cash crunch disrupted this flow and led to drop in the prices. Another fallout of digital transfers of money is that the farmers who would come to the APMC market from smaller places would spend some of the cash they received in the local consumer market. For instance, the onion growers who sold their produce in Lasalgaon would spend some of that money in the local Lasalgaon market that same day. This is not possible with digital money and the consumer markets have suffered due to farmers withdrawal, Holkar said.Sunil Golya, a farmer in Madhya Pradeshs Harda district and founder member of Aam Kisan Union in Madhya Pradesh, said APMCs in Madhya Pradesh too had started making RTGS/NEFT payment to farmers. But if this was such a good change, why is it that chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan recently announced that traders could pay up to Rs50,000 in cash to farmers for procurement and the balance through RTGS? This means the Madhya Pradesh government has in a way admitted that the cash crunch created by demonetisation was not beneficial to farmers, Golya said.In addition to the other negative consequences like a fall in the procurement prices and cash crunch, demonetisation had also directly impacted the value of a big asset that the farmers held, Golya said. Demonetisation has drastically reduced the price of agricultural land, an asset that the farmer banks on to leverage in times of crisis. In Harda district only, an acre of irrigated land was fetching around Rs12 lakh before demonetisation but the prices are down to Rs5.5-6 lakh since November 2016, he said.With an average 20% fall in the remunerative prices and land prices getting halved, farmers in Madhya Pradesh, despite contributing to the states record high 20% agriculture growth, did not have surplus income and demonetisation was a factor in it, he added."

Manimegalai, a home maker from Puliyakulam whose family budget is dependent only on her husbands income, increase in the price of some of the vegetables has led to changes in the daily expenditure.The weekly Uzhavar Santhai used to be a boon for mid and low income families. Now, farmers who sell vegetables directly have also increased prices citing changes in retail market. Hike in the price of coconut has forced us to replace thengai chutney with sambar or thakkali chutney . Luckily, price of tomato has not increased as much as it shot up in July, said Ms. Manimegalai. Quoting some of her neighbours, she said families are buying vegetables in bulk and storing them in refrigerator when prices are low.A vendor from a neighbourhood grocery store near Sivaram Nagar said that sale of vegetables has come down as as she was, with no option left, already selling them at a few paise/rupee higher than the price of vegetables at bigger retail stores.For vegetable buyers in the city, prices of small onions, coconuts, and tomatoes have shot up during the last few days, making many reluctant to buy these. Even in the weekly markets, the prices are high. I have stopped buying small onions, says Jothimani, a resident of Ramanathapuram.Prices of small onions is expected to hover around Rs. 120-140 for another two to three months and prices of tomatoes will come down in a fortnight, said M.R. Palanisamy, Deputy Director of Agriculture Marketing here.According to M. Rajendran, president of Thyagi Kumaran Market Vegetable Merchants Association, small onion prices might touch Rs. 200 a kg in the retail market. This is mainly because of drought last year and recent heavy unseasonal rains in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka. Farmers are not benefiting from the price rise.The wholesale price of small onions is about Rs. 140. If we used to get 2,000 bags of small onions in the market a day, it has dwindled to 200 bags now. Coconut prices are up because trees dried in Pollachi area and many have cut down the trees because of drought earlier this year. It will take another three months for arrivals to pick up.Prices of most of the vegetables are above Rs. 50 a kg. It will take one or two months for the prices to stabilise. Farmers who cultivated small onions on about 950 hectares in Thondamuthur area saw a bumper crop this season. They did not get a good price last month.Traders and farmers who had stored small onions were getting good prices now, said trade and official sources.The prices were between Rs. 60 and Rs. 100 last week and increased to Rs. 115 to Rs. 120 now in the wholesale market.The retail price at Uzhavar Santhai on Wednesday was between Rs. 130 and Rs. 135. Bulk buying by the traders for exporting to Middle-East countries might also be a reason for the price rise, said Mr. Palanisamy.However, the prices of country tomato which was just about Rs. 30-a-kg last week has increased to Rs. 35- 38 per kg in Uzhavar Santhais on Wednesday. The prices of tomato is expected to come down in a fortnight, when farmers in Madukkarai block will begin harvest. Tomato was cultivated in 370 hectares in Madukkarai block and 80 hectare in other blocks in Coimbatore district, he said.Farmers Association (Tamilaga Vivasayeegal Sangam) secretary P. Kandasamy said farmers decided when to sell produce based on their needs than on market price.Most often the market intelligence reports were of little help to them as they did not, so far, factor in movement of produce from other States to the city.Having seen prices crash in local markets due to arrival of vegetables from other States, the local farmers had begun taking their needs into account to sell produce.The Government should ensure farmers get a stable price throughout the season, Mr. Rajendran said.(with inputs from R.

Photo: MintNew Delhi: With major crop prices plunging below minimum support prices (MSPs), farmers are likely to lose an estimated Rs35,968 crore in earnings for the kharif season, a coalition of farmers organizations said on Thursday.In the two weeks to 7 November, farmers have incurred a loss of Rs6,283 crore, having sold crops at lower than their support price, the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC), a coalition of over 180 farmer unions, said.The AIKSCC numbers on loss to farm incomes were arrived at after a comparison of average wholesale prices in mandis (regulated farmer markets) and MSPs announced by the centre. The analysis was done for seven major kharif (summer) cropspaddy, maize, bajra, soybean, groundnut, cotton and uradby taking into account market arrivals and a weighted average of modal prices in major growing states.After four droughts, farmers have been hit by three successive seasons of low crop prices, the coalition said in a statement. The estimates, it added, are conservative as the actual prices at which farmers are selling their produce are often lower than official wholesale prices.The coalition also said, citing data published by the agriculture ministry, that for several crops the government-fixed MSPs are lower than the cost of production as calculated by the Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices. These include crops like jowar where the support price is 19% lower than the cost of production and pulses like moong for which the MSP is 2% lower than the production cost.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had promised before the 2014 general election that MSPs will be fixed at 50% above the cost of production. However, of the 14 kharif crops, the MSPs of seven have been fixed lower than the (C2 or comprehensive) cost of production, the coalition said. Assuming an MSP at 50% over costs, farmers will lose an estimated Rs2 trillion going by current mandi prices, the coalition said.The government has set a target to double farmer incomes (by 2022), but even after successive years of normal rains their losses are mounting, said Yogendra Yadav, a farmers leader and a member of the coalition. Our estimate does not take into account losses suffered by growers of horticulture crops like potatoes and onion for which there are no MSPs but farmers are selling at a loss, Yadav added.Analysts agreed with the farmers analysis.The actual losses to farmers may be a little lower on account of government procurement of crops like paddy, but overall the analysis is fair, said Himanshu, an associate professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, Delhi, and a Mint columnist. There is little doubt that crop prices are plunging and that is due to a serious demand deflation in the economy.The coalition also unveiled a social media campaign. AIKSCC which has been at the forefront of farmer agitations across several states, also announced a farmers protest in Delhi on 20 November with demands for remunerative prices and loan waivers."

Most of the time farmers dont even recover the production cost of onions. There are instances when farmers have thrown way onions on the road and at times they have simply left the crop in the field, said Garhwal, a resident of Sikar.The 41-year-old, who is the director of Olitia Foods Pvt Ltd, said that the dehydration plant will be set up at the cost of Rs 40 crore in Sikar and a MoU has been signed with the state government during the Global Rajasthan Agritech Meet (GRAM) in Udaipur.Onions will be washed and peeled by machines at the plant and then dehydrated onions will be turned into flakes, powder, or ground into a paste.There is a huge demand for dehydrated onion in the market. Many products such as noodles, meat masala etc sold in the market contain dry onion powder. Dry onion flakes and paste are also used for preparing food.Olitia Foods will buy onions from the farmers directly and then turn them into paste, flakes and powder and sell it in the market. Onions will be bought from farmers at a rate which they will decide so that they dont suffer losses. The dehydration plant will be operational by the end of this financial year, said Garhwal.When a farmer takes his onion crop to the mandi, the commission agent knows that the farmer will sell the crop at any cost and will not take it back paying for transportation a second time. When the retail price of onions is Rs 40 per kg, farmers sell it at the mandi for Rs 2-5 per kg, he added.Garwal said that white onion, which has a higher moisture content and lower shelf life than the Nasik red onion, is grown in Rajasthan. White onions cannot be kept in cold storage and need to be sold soon.In Rajasthan, onions are generally grown in Sikar Jodhpur, Sikar, Nagaur, Alwar, Jhunjhunu, Jaipur and Churu. More than two lakh farmers are into growing onions in these districts.Setting up an onion dehydration plant in Rajasthan will prove to be a boon for the onion growers in the state. Now, farmers wont need to throw away onions on the roads, as Olitia Foods will buy them from farmers, said agriculture minister Prabhu Lal Saini.Formed in 2015, Jaipur-based Olitia Foods Pvt Ltd is into making natural food products (without any chemicals). The company sells milk and milk-based products of the indigenous breed of cows, they also make natural beverages such as sherbet by distillation of various edible items such as ajwain, jamum, tulsi, methi etc for medical purpose. They also make spices such as chole masala, sambhar masala etc and manufactures processed olive leaf tea."

With onions selling at `40 per kg, the consumers are now feeling the pinch after prices of different vegetables soared between `40 and `100 per kg.In such a scenario, officials of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare (FS&CW) department have once again linked the price rise to the problem of limited supply at the source point in Nashik in Maharashtra. There are no reports of hoarding of onions by local wholesalers. We are monitoring the situation. If needed, onions will be sold through Government fair price shops, Sundargarh Civil Supplies Officer (CSO) A Barik said. In July, when onion prices had jumped to `28 per kg, the department had opened 37 fair price shops across the city.If onions were not enough to bring tears to the eyes of locals, vegetables added to their woes. While green peas were sold at `100 per kg, capsicum and carrot were priced at `80 per kg at the markets across Rourkela on Sunday, sources said. Pointed gourd, cauliflower, bean and seam were priced at `60 per kg each. Tomatoes and spinach were priced at `50 per kg, while brinjal, plantain, ladys finger, ridge-gourd and bitter-gourd sold at `40 per kg. Ginger and garlic were selling at `100 and 60 per kg, respectively, sources said, adding that the price of green chilli came as a surprise at `80 to `100 per kg.Amid the soaring prices, sweet potatoes, cow-pea, pumpkin, radish, papaya, cucumber and some local varieties of greens were available for `20 to `30 per kg. Potatoes came as a major relief, selling at `10 per kg, sources added. Usually, by this time of the year, vegetable prices should have decreased. The crisis can be attributed to the lack of locally-grown vegetables in the markets. I hope the arrival of new vegetables to Rourkela city from Nuagaon, Bisra block, Kuarnmunda and Lathikata blocks of the district besides from adjacent pockets of neighbouring Jharkhand will bring down prices, a local vendor, Subal Barik, said."

Hawkers with stacks of attar (fragrant oil) vials call-out to passersby. Its a little over 4pm, but the citys smog and the charcoal smoke have lent the evening an odd shadow. We make our way through winding alleys, lined with flower and chaadar sellers, the homeless and the fakirs. Soon, the dimly-lit walls give way to a sprawling courtyard, which Delhiites know as Nizamuddin Dargah. On one side there is a 800-year-old mosque (believed to be built by the powerful ruler Alauddin Khilji), and on the other, the shanties of Nizamuddin Basti. Going back in time, we revisit the life, and times of Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya on his 803rd birth anniversary, today.One of the many shops in the winding alley leading to the dargah. (Shivam Saxena/Hindustan Times)Born in Badayun, Uttar Pradesh to Khwaja Syed Ahmed and Bibi Zulekha  both natives of Bukhara (present day Uzbekistan)  a boy named Muhammad became disciple of Baba Farid Ganjshakar (disciple of Qutbuddin Bakhtiyar Kaki), and was to grow up to further the Chishti silsila (spiritual lineage) of the Sufi order in India. We know him as Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya.We celebrate the day with great devotion. The qawwali programme will begin at 8pm, and go on till 5.30am the next morning. The kalaams (compositions) written by poet Amir Khusrau will be sung, along with other Sufi poetry, informs Syed Afsar Ali Nizami, chief in charge of Dargah Sharif.We will organise a langar at night with vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes, coffee and tea. At 1am, the mazaar sharif (burial place) will be opened by the family of the saint  to be cleaned and decorated. It will be shielded from outside view, and even those who are inside will not be able to see outside. We wash the darbar with kewda (flower essence) and sprinkle attar fragrances like oudh, shamama and gulab. The third rasam (ritual) is to smear sandalwood paste on the mazaar sharif. Lastly, we offer a chaadar. After the morning namaaz (fajr), devotees can offer flowers and chaadars, adds Nizami.Afsar Nizami is the 38th generation of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliyas family. He never married and our family has descended from his sisters family, says Nizami, adding, Today, there are three families, comprising 645 members, associated with the dargah. Babas father died when he was about five years old. The family shifted to Delhi when he was 16, for his higher education, says Nizami.The aura of the saint is such that it attracts people from all faiths, across all age groups and social statures. Nizami says: He never differentiated. He propagated the message of universal brotherhood and peace. He showed the path of love and respect, irrespective of age, religion and status.Devotees light incense sticks at the dargah. (Shivam Saxena/Hindustan Times)Auliya was accorded with many titles. Among them, the most famous is Mehboob-e-Ilahi (Beloved of God). Another title is Zari Zar Baksh (giver of gold). Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya believed that service is more important than ritual. He would put silver and gold coins under peoples plates. His langar was legendary; its said that just the onion peels were carried on 70 camels, says Sadia Dehlvi, author of The Sufi Courtyard: Dargahs of Delhi. She adds: He nurtured Delhis cultural landscape and made it composite. It was a coming together of Indian, Turkish, Persian and Arab cultures.Devotees offer prayers to the Sufi saint. (Shivam Saxena/Hindustan Times)During the conversation with Nizami, some helpers enter carrying deghs (cauldrons) of food. Afsar Nizami informs that every Friday, a Dubai-based Hindu family sends langar to be distributed at the dargah. Soon, the Muezzin calls to the faithful for the sunset (Maghrib) namaaz. Theres silence, followed by prayers. After the namaaz, devotees gather around the mazaar (shrine) and pray to the saint.As dusk descends, the music of the qawwals fills the air. Qawwalis have always been a part of Sufism, but became commonplace with the khanqah (spiritual retreat) of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. His disciple, poet Amir Khusrau composed several qawwalis using tabla and harmonium. He is called the Tuti-e-Hind (songbird of India), says Nizami.Khusrau is also credited with the origins of Khayal school of music and the development of Urdu. Khusrau is acknowledged as the first poet of Urdu, then called Hindvi. He created songs to provide novelty to the musical assemblies of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya. All the Chishtis were very committed to music as its the source for reaching spiritual ecstasy, says Dehlvi.Qawwalis are an intrinsic part of Sufism. (Shivam Saxena/Hindustan Times)The love of the guru and his disciple was so deep that Khusrau died six months after Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, and on the same date. When talking about saints, we never say they are dead. We use the term parda farmana. Even though the saint is not here physically, his presence will always be with us in this world, says Nizami.The burial place was chosen by Auliya, and on his birthday, it will be decked like a bride. Its said that saints define timelines, and it wouldnt be wrong to say that Delhis timeline can be classified into pre and post Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya period, says Dehlvi.Catch It Live What: 803rd birth celebrations of Hazrat Nizamuddin AuliyaWhere: Hazrat Nizamuddin DargahWhen: November 14Timings: 8pmNearest Metro Station: Jangpura on Violet LineFollow @htlifeandstyle for more"

Annual wholesale price inflation was at 2.6 per cent in September. The food inflation quickened to 3.23 per cent in October from 1.99 per cent in September. Among the food items, prices of vegetables prices were up 36.61 per cent year-on-year, potato 44 per cent and onion 127 per cent.Data released on Monday showed retail inflation picking up in October to a seven-month high, driven by faster rises in prices of food and fuel products, dampening chances of an interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) next month.

There will be a seasonal decline in food prices by next month. Therefore I believe that, now that the monsoon has also been good, the food prices may come down rather than further rise, the former governor of the RBI said.He was speaking on the sidelines of a lecture by Rathin Roy, the director of National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, organised by the ICFAI Foundation for Higher Education in Hyderabad.It (the inflation) could be close to four per cent limit is what we are talking about. It should be four per cent or slightly below that, he further said.The wholesale inflation rose to a seven-month high in October as prices of food articles, led by onion and vegetables, witnessed a sharp rise.Rangarajan, however, refused to answer whether the RBI would consider the inflation rate while determining the policy review next month. Earlier in his address, he said the governments role as producer of marketable goods is coming down. The governments role as a regulator is very important given the prevailed market conditions to ensure that the system and structure remain competitive, he said.The role of the government as producer of public goods and services has definitely increased. Whether we accept it or not there is an increasing demand on the government to provide what they call public goods which are broadly defined as primary education and primary health and so forth, Rangarajan said.Rathin Roy, who was also a member of the N.K.

Though the space allotted to the fair at Pragati Maidan has been reduced by almost half, some say this may allow them to cover more ground and stalls in a shorter period of time. Visitors will be allowed entry till 7.30pm.Some exhibitors had been worried that as the permanent state and central department pavilions had been razed for construction of an exhibition centre, visitors would not be able to find them. However, with compact space, the stalls, halls and hangars of the fair follow almost a straight line from gate number one to gate 18, allowing people to visit almost all the pavilions, food courts and stores on the way.We dont have to walk much between pavilions. You can cover almost all the pavilions in a single day now, said Mona Oberoi, North Delhi resident who said she has been visiting the trade fair religiously for years now.Tickets are not available at the gates of Pragati Maidan or the Pragati Maidan metro station this year, and daily number of visitors has been capped at 60,000. Tickets are to be bought in advance either online, or at other metro stations. The fair, which started on November 14, was open only for business visitors for the first four days.If you enter the Pragati Maidan through gate number one, your first stops will be hangars number one, two and three, where the pavilions of Delhi, Haryana, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh, UP, Punjab, and Jharkhand, among others, are set up. Food stalls serving Litti Chokha from Bihar or onion kachoris from Rajasthan are right outside on the way to hangars four and five, which have more state pavilions.The food at the fair is one of our favourite things. My kids had already said that they would want to eat chole bhature, chaat and kulfis, before we even got here, said a father visiting the fair with his two children on Friday. He did not want to share his name.Hall no 7 has khadi products, coir and jute products, and also stalls as part of the Hunar Haat of the minority affairs ministry. Outside, the Saras stalls stock handicraft from across the country. Hangar 15, which is one of the largest temporary hangars, and has 11 state pavilions including those of Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan, come up next.Right across, you find the stalls of the social justice and empowerment ministry of social justice and empowerment for more handicrafts, clothes and other trinkets.Business is going well. I just made a sale of Rs 4,000. If this keeps up, it will go well, said Ajaj Hussein, from Lucknow, who was selling chikankaari items.The foreign pavilion is at hall 18, where you will find lamps from Turkey, trinkets from Thailand, dry fruits from Afghanistan, shoes from Italy, and candies from the UK, among other things.

Rubbing salt into this wound is the onion at Rs 50-55 a kilo instead of Rs 40.Supriyo Panda, an egg dealer at Bistupur market in the steel city, explained the reason behind this kitchen catastrophe, which is also telling on hotel menus in the city.""Poultry farmers in Bengal, Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh, from where we source our supply, have jacked up prices. If we buy at a high price, we will evidently sell at a higher rate for minimum profit,"" Panda said, admitting that he was selling a dozen for Rs 80 on Sunday.Panda added that wholesalers had cut down on stocks ever since the egg price hike in neighbouring states a fortnight ago and this too was affecting retail rates.Deepak Kumar, who sells eggs at Harmu market in the capital, said he had sold a dozen eggs for Rs 70 on Saturday, but by Sunday, the rate had increased by Rs 5.Kadru homemaker Manju Kumari said she was reworking both budget and menus.

Traders fear the situation may push up prices further.A lot of importers in the city have cancelled orders from southern states because the prices were too high. Out of the total consumption of 2.5 crore eggs in the city, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana export around 1.5 crore.""The largest chunk of the eggs in the state come from the West Godavari district in Andhra Pradesh. They are pricing each egg at Rs 5.22 and that is not viable for us. We have asked them either to bring down prices or stop sending consignments,"" said Sumit Deb, a wholesaler at Sealdah market. Deb imports around 3.5 lakh eggs each day from Andhra Pradesh.""These are not isolated cases as most of the importers were feeling the heat. While calculating prices, we have to add 55p towards transportation, packing and handling charges. That comes to around Rs 5.74 for each egg. The profit margin will be calculated after we factor in breakage and wastage. It is not possible for us to sell each egg at Rs 6 if producers don't bring down prices,"" said Kajal Datta, secretary of the Kolkata Egg Merchants' Association.While the wholesalers have refrained from buying eggs at a higher price, retail markets across the city have been selling eggs at a premium. The sudden price hike has been prompted by an increase in demand at the onset of winter. At Hogg market , eggs cost Rs 6 apiece, whereas rates in Lake Market and Jagu Bazar are around Rs 6.5-Rs 7 apiece and Rs 80-Rs 84 for a dozen.Sellers in Lake Market blame the price rise on the cake season when there's a surge in demand. Even then, they said, it wasn't expected to go this high. ""The prices always go up during this time but never have we had to face this situation,"" said Rabin Haldar, a seller in Lake Market. ""Sales have come down to 20 crates per day from an average of 30-35 crates daily.""The state allows a benefit of up to Rs 8 lakh to poultry units that hatch more than 10,000 chicks per month.

(File Photo) One of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. (File Photo)Onions are, once again, in the news. Last week, retail prices touched Rs 50/kg in several markets, and wholesale prices touched Rs 30/kg in major onion markets like Lasalgaon in Maharashtra. This is not the first time that onion prices have spiked. Almost every alternate year, this roller-coaster of boom and bust in onion prices happens (see Graph). But 2017 is interesting as it saw record low prices in May-June when farmers sold onions at around Rs 2/kg in several mandis in Madhya Pradesh. This has led to grief and anger among farmers.The situation became precarious when farmers protested and police fired at them, resulting in some unfortunate deaths. The MP chief minister realised the sensitivity of the incident and quickly announced a decision to procure onions at Rs 800/quintal and state agencies procured 8.76 lakh tonnes. But in the absence of ample storage capacity in the state, onions had to be quickly disposed of through the PDS and open market operations at almost one-fifth the cost. The whole operation caused a loss of Rs 785 crore to the MP government.However, the more unusual aspect of the onion situation was that only a few months later, in August 2017, prices started shooting up (see Graph) resulting in a visit by officers of the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs to Lasalgaon, income tax raids on traders in September and the suspension of trading in Lasalgaon APMC for about a month. The prices then fell for some time but they have been rising since Diwali, prompting the government to announce the import of onions by the MMTC to bring down domestic prices.This is not the first year when government action has been so ad-hoc and puzzling within a few months. In previous years, too, we have seen the government fix the minimum export price, ban exports of onions, and even a study by the Competition Commission of India. The lesson: Income tax raids proved futile in keeping the lid on onion prices even for a few months. We need better policies.So, what is it that causes high volatility in onion prices and what could be the way out? In order to respond to these questions, one may first note that India produced 21.7 MMT of onions, which is about 20 per cent of global production in 2016-17, second only to China. India also exported 2.4 MMT in 2016-17, up from 1.2 MMT in 2014-15. About 60 per cent of onion production is in the rabi season, sown in December-January and harvested in April-May. This is the onion which is stored by farmers and traders and it meets export as well as domestic demand till the arrival of the kharif onion crop, which is sown in May-June and harvested in October-November. The late kharif crop is sown in August-September and harvested in January-February. Kharif and late kharif crops produce about 20 per cent each of the annual production. Kharif onion is of rather poor quality and cannot be stored for very long. The prices tend to rise in October-November when rabi onion stocks are almost depleted and kharif onion is yet to hit the market, or if the kharif crop is damaged, as is the case this year.One of the prime reasons behind high volatility in onion prices stems from a lack of storage facilities that have not kept pace with rising production. Also, the traditional storage practices incur losses as high as 40 per cent. While Maharashtra used the Rashtriya Krishi Vikas Yojana and National Horticulture Mission and created 42,282 low-cost onion storage structures with a capacity of 9.65 lakh tonnes, there is hardly any storage facility in MP. No wonder, MP farmers suffered most in a bumper onion crop year. However, modern cold storages, as being set up by Allround India, a subsidiary of Allround Holland, and other such companies, can bring down wastage within the 10-15 per cent range.So, the first policy action has to be to promote modern cold storages and develop a system akin to that of the warehouse receipt system for farmers. While a bulk of the storage has to be undertaken by the private sector, the state can do some stocking under a price stabilisation fund. They can hire the services of specialised private sector agencies to carry out such operations on the governments behalf.Second, use trade policy for price stabilisation. In case of a bumper crop, promote exports and in case of a deficit crop, encourage imports. This has to be done well in advance  as soon as one comes to know the advance estimates of production.Third, encourage the setting up of onion dehydrating units and promote demand for dehydrated onions amongst large consumers (restaurants, fast food chains, army, hospitals, etc). Gujarat has already emerged as the main centre for dehydration units with 85 out of 100 units located there, while Maharashtra has just five units. Dehydrated onions are being exported to Japan, Europe, Russia, US and some African countries. The Ministry of Food Processing and state governments can encourage entrepreneurs to avail grants for setting up onion dehydration and processing units. A subsidy of up to 35 per cent with a cap of Rs 5 crore is available to such units. However, the budget of the Ministry of Food Processing for this scheme is just Rs 95 crore. And MP, in its budget for 2017-18, has provided just Rs 7 crore as grants to food processing units. This needs to go up manifold if we are serious about encouraging food processing and stabilising prices even of fresh onions.Thus, instead of raiding traders or banning exports et al, the Centre and the states would do better if they promote investment in scientific storage and processing facilities, and use trade policy more judiciously.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

The prices of the states leading crops - from pepper to cardamom, rubber to nutmeg and cocoa - are on a free fall while the prices of its vegetables, eggs, chicken, and fish, which Kerala depends on the neighbouring states, are shooting through the roof. Experts said the situation is alarming, and the way out of it is key policy changes by allowing farmers the freedom to bring in capital and technology to grow a fruit/vegetable he wants in vast areas of land.Right now, the rules allow only plantation crops, especially rubber, to be grown in over five acres of land, restricting farmers the freedom to farm crops that yield better returns. While pepper prices have fallen below Rs 400/kg compared to Rs 730-735/kg in the same period last year, cardamom prices have slipped to Rs 1,000/kg from Rs 1,500/ kg in May-June this year.Nutmeg prices declined from Rs 350/kg last year to Rs 200/kg while nutmeg flower prices have come down by Rs 1,350/kg to less than Rs 1000/kg in the same period. Clove prices fell from Rs 1050/kg to Rs 600/kg and cocoa from Rs 230-235 to Rs 160/kg. The only exception to this is coconut with prices ruling at Rs 30-35/piece, a two-year high, but low production means no big gains for farmers. In contrast, the prices of vegetables, which the state relies on neighbouring states, mostly Tamil Nadu, are skyrocketing.Small onion prices have gone up from Rs 40-50/kg to Rs 130/kg, tomatoes are ruling at Rs 60/kg, doubling from Rs 30/ kg some months ago, cabbage going up from Rs 18/kg to Rs 60/kg. Renny Jacob, group chairman of Kanjirappally-based Homegrown Biotech, which is engaged in research, cultivation, and development of exotic varieties of tropic fruit trees, says the legal framework of the state is anti-farmer. You cant force anyone to farm rubber. But, the rules are doing exactly that, Renny, who sees immense potential for growing exotic fruits such as rambutan in his farm, says."

On Thursday, the modal price went up even higher to Rs3,600 per quintal, according to government data. Onions are said to have a curious connection with Indian elections in India, where a rise in their prices is a politically sensitive topic.Tell me more: Some traders say onion exports are not possible at $850 a tonne, and that this might result in an increase in key importing countries such as Bangladesh, UAE and Sri Lanka.Rs5,636 croreWhat is it? The amount the Indian Railways says it has saved in power bills between April 2015 and October 2017.Why is it important? This has been possible due to the Open Access Policy under the Electricity Act, 2003, which allows consumers with an electricity load of above 1 MW to procure power directly from markets. Over half of the total requirement of 2,000 MW for electric traction power has been accessed through this route. This has resulted in the decrease in the average cost of power to Rs5 from Rs7 in states from where electricity is procured via the open access route. The Indian Railways has seen a decline in passenger and freight traffic revenues in the last few years even as the central governments financial support has largely remained at similar levels.Tell me more: The Indian Railways says the cumulative figure can go up to Rs6,927 crore, about Rs1,000 crore higher than the stipulated target, and has projected total savings of Rs41,000 crore over the next decade.7-10%What is it? The average cut in product prices across categories that Hindustan Unilever will effect in about 600 stock keeping units (SKUs), post the recent rationalisation of tax rates under the goods and services tax (GST).Why is it important? This Hindustan Unilever action follows similar announcements by FMCG majors like Dabur, Godrej Consumer and ITC, and comes in the backdrop of the scathing critique from the government that it had done its bit to lower tax rates for many items of everyday use, but companies and service providers had not extended these tax cuts to consumers. It even threatened companies with action, and asked them to take corrective and informative steps.Tell me more: On 10 November, the government took out 178 item headings from the 28% category, leaving 50 items in that GST bracket.23What is it? The points margin that Valtteri Bottas of Mercedes needs over Sebastian Vettel of Ferrari in the last race of the 2017 Formula 1 season this weekend to finish second in the drivers championship. Effectively, Bottas would have to win and Vettel would have to score no points.Why is it important? If Bottas does manage to overtake Vettel, this will be the fourth consecutive season in which Mercedes would have finished one and two in the F1 drivers championship. It would also be a blow to Ferrari, which was leading the drivers title race till seven races ago, but saw its prospects implode after a series of driver and team errors.Tell me more: Lewis Hamilton clinched the championship two races ago, in Mexico, for the fourth title of his career. The last time a Ferrari driver finished in the top two was Fernando Alonso in the 2013 season.howindialives.com is a search engine for public data"

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."

But these days she is faced with a tough choice, whether to add onions to the food items or not. That's because the price of onions is steadily climbing the charts and has reached Rs 50/kg in the retail market, up by Rs 10 from last week. And if market insiders are to be believed, the cost could go up further.The spike in onion prices, along with the rise in the cost of vegetables are burning a hole in the pocket of the common people. Even the state government's assurance to deal with the price rise by importing onions from neighbouring states have failed to yield results.""Usually I require around 2-3 kg of onions every week to cook food for my family of five. After the price rise I am trying to manage with 1kg. I am finding it very difficult to cook non-veg food,"" said Pati, a housewife.""For the past two months onions are being sold at Rs 40 per kg and above. Last week it suddenly increased to Rs 46 and today it has gone up to Rs 50 per kg. How can a family manage with such stiff hike of essential commodities?"" asked Manisha Behera, another homemaker.On october 28, food supplies and consumer welfare minister Surya Narayan Patro had said that the prices would come down within one week after the new harvest.""The new harvest will arrive in the next one week after which the situation is likely to improve. I have also requested the Maharashtra government to supply onions to us first as our consumers are facing inconvenience,"" Patro had said.On Thursday, when asked about the prevailing situation, Patro said: ""Now procurement of all agriculture products will be made through e-procurement. So once fresh procurement orders are placed the prices are likely to drop.""Traders said the main reason behind the hike in onion prices was the loss of crop due to bad weather and the cost being high in the source states. ""On Thursday wholesale price at Nasik mandi was Rs 4,200 to Rs 4,500 per quintal. After adding transportation cost, the price in Odisha will be more than Rs 5,000 per quintal,"" said Sameer Das , a wholesale trader at Unit-I market.The prices of vegetables too are moving up. Tomato has been selling at Rs 60 per kg, broad beans at Rs 80/kg, okra for Rs 60/kg, drumsticks at Rs 200/kg and green peas for Rs 100/kg.

However, in a slight relief, vegetable prices are stabilising with new crops reaching the local markets. Retail market sources said over the past few days, egg was selling at `84 per dozen or `seven per piece, a rise of `two per piece.Rourkela Vyabasai Sangh (RVS) president Kalandi Badajena said the steel city daily requires 2 lakh eggs and the demand has increased due to fall in production. He said the cost of production has increased because of rise in cost of poultry feeds, vaccines, medicines and maintenance of farms.Sundargarh Chief District Veterinary Officer (CDVO) Dr D K Patnaik said the Sneha Layer Poultry Farm (SLPF) in Bargaon block daily produces about 50,000 eggs, while another layer farm in Kuanrmunda produces about 20,000 eggs. They cater to the bulk of the citys demand. Balangir district is the biggest supplier of eggs to Rourkela. Eggs are also supplied from Chhattisgarh and Andhra Pradesh.SLPF proprietor Ujjal Kundu said the sudden rise in price of egg is due to rise in consumption and no matching growth in production. He said the situation is gradually improving as wholesale price of egg has come down to `5.40 on Thursday and it would reduce by another 20 paise.Meanwhile, the retail prices of onion skyrocketed to `48 per kg on Thursday. After stabilising at `40 per kg for about 40 days, the onion price increased by `8 per kg, said a retailer.Rourkela Additional Civil Supplies Officer (ACSO) R C Tudu said there is no hoarding of onion. The city is receiving its daily requirement of 200 to 300 quintals. He attributed the rise in onion price to rising wholesale cost at the source point of Nashik.On the other hand, vegetable prices are moderating as green peas, selling at `100 per kg a fortnight ago, is now available for `70 per kg. Carrot and capsicum prices came down to `50-60 per kg. The price of other vegetables are also moderating."

Despite several complaints, no action had been taken against them till now, they said. Reacting to their complaints, District Revenue Officer P. Velu said the account number and name of beneficiaries did not match in some cases.We had received the fund and it would be deposited in their account after verifying their documents, he added.When Joint Director of Agriculture (in-charge) V. Manoharan advised paddy growers to insure crops on or before November 30, farmers from the Vaigai river Ayacut said that they would transplant only in December. How can we insure our crops, they asked.The JD said the rainfall for November was 30 mm, far less than the average rainfall of 168 mm. If we do not get rain before December 15, we will face acute water shortage.Small onion growers from Vedasandur and Oddanchatram appealed to Horticulture officials to import onion seeds from nearby States as the price of shallots touched Rs. 200 a kg. It was impossible to buy seeds at this rate.When officials replied that they had supplied seeds to farmers to raise 80,000 acres, farmers from Oddanchatram said no supply was made in Oddanchatram union till now.Collector T.G.

However, this year, the crop from Karnataka has almost stopped reaching the markets and now Karnataka is dependant on other States.There is hope that supply will stabilise by the new year when Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh harvest it. A good yield in these States is likely to ensure onion rates below Rs. 40 by new year.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons.

Besides the poor arrivals, marriage season added to the supply-demand gap in carrots as many consumers bought vegetables directly from the wholesale markets in bulk quantities.

The governments were neglecting the farming community and were engrossed in ensuring their political sustenance, Mr. Narayana alleged.Farmers would produce the much-needed food grains when they were extended assistance and requisite facilities rather than sanction ex gratia of Rs. 2 lakh to their kith after they committed suicide, the Lok Satta leader said.He later visited Kurnool market yard and interacted with onion and groundnut farmers who brought their produce for sale on their hardships. The farmers lamented that they were hard-hit by lack of remunerative prices and were becoming debt-ridden by not getting back their investment. Mr. Jayaprakash Narayana said the Kurnool market yard was being maintained properly by its secretary Sivaramakrishna Sastry and staff were serving the farmers. The market yard turnover was about Rs. 500 to Rs. 600 crore.Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu was claiming to have waived loans of farmers, but they got loan waiver only to the tune of Rs. 10,000 to Rs. 20,000 and most of them were securing loans at high interest rate adding to their repayment burden and were forced to sell their produce at lower prices. Government policies were leading to fall in price of crops, but not increasing the revenue of farmers, he added. Onion farmers got only half of the normal yield of 50 quintals per acre and were getting about Rs. 3,300 per quintal.Seeks cess on importsIndia was importing about Rs. 1 lakh crore worth of groundnut, pulses and edible oils, he said and suggested a levy of 30% cess on imports. The groundnut, sunflower and oilseed farmers must be given the minimum support price and a share in the import cess collected to help them flourish and increase productivity to avert the need for imports.Constructing godowns for storage of agricultural produce and processing of perishable products would help the farmers get the desired prices, the Lok Satta president said. As farmers lacked the facilities, they had no option but to sell their produce at lesser prices and become saddled with debts, he said.Mr. Jayaprakash Narayana recalled that he had taken out a padayatra in 2011 when the then government banned agricultural exports, when prices were high in other States and abroad. The protest led to permission to export and farmers got Rs. 3,600 crore additionally that year, he said.A farmer was getting Rs. 18,000 by selling his produce but the school fees of his son was Rs. 20,000, but the governments were giving temporary sops but not formulating plans to increase their revenue. While 50% were dependent on farming, farmers income was hardly 15% . Agricultural exports fell by Rs. 70,000 crore and imports fell by an equal amount after Mr. Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister, he said.Agriculture would be a gamble unless the governments chalked out policies to increase the revenue of farmers, extend health benefits and impart free and qualitative education to their children, he said and called for a debate on the issue.Lok Satta leaders Rajyalakshmi, coordinator Ranjit Kumar and others took part."

A vegetable market in Pune.By Rushikesh GawadeWHOLESALE PRICES of vegetables in Pune, which have been on the higher side for the past few weeks, are now on a downward slope. However, the change is yet to be reflected in retail market prices. As compared to the wholesale price of green vegetables last week, the rates have seen a 15 to 42 per cent dip.Vilas Bhujbal, a vegetable wholesaler at the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC), Pune, said, Following untimely rainfall last week, there has been a decline in the arrival of vegetables in the market. This had led to price rise. Now that the weather is normal, supply is also improving, which is reflecting in the change in prices.Prices of green peas have seen the most significant change, with the present price being at Rs 4,000 per quintal, as against the Rs 5,000 per quintal a week ago.Similarly, the prices of dhania (coriander) have decreased by 28 per cent, methi (fenugreek) by 42 per cent and spinach by 25 per cent. Supply of these vegetables has seen a 12 to 35 per cent rise lately, said Bhujbal.Prices of vegetables in the retail markets, however, are yet to see a change. At the Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Market, fenugreek, spinach, shepu (dill) and coriander are still being sold at Rs 10 per bunch.Meanwhile, as wholesale prices of green vegetables have decreased, prices of onion recorded an 18 per cent rise over the week.

As Mumbai welcomes its mild cold season, I discovered my nihari fix at the new BKC restaurant  Taftoon. I ate this delicate Gosht Nihari (Rs. 489) for dinner, digging into the creamy gravy and enjoying the slow-cooked meat and bone marrow. This was mopped with taftan, an oven-baked flatbread made with flour, milk and eggs. It was soft, flaky and crisp on the edges, well worthy of lending its name to the restaurant.Taftoon, from the people  Pankaj Gupta and Abhir Dhawan  that gave us Indian restaurants Oye Kake and Caf Haqq Se, brings a different concept of food to the table. We wanted to capture food from the northern belt and came up with the idea of doing food from the Grand Trunk Road, extending from Kabul to eastern part of Bangladesh. This diverse cuisine covers Persian, Afghani, Pakistani, Kashmiri, Punjabi, Awadhi, Lucknowi and Bengali food. One of the things connected these places was the taftan. The oldest name for this bread was taftoon, hence the name of the restaurant, said chef Milan Gupta.In a bid to stay true to form, Gupta is using traditional pots and pans  wide brass langdis , degchis and Lucknowi lagans . He is sticking to authentic recipes and cooking styles. The meat thats the star of the mixed platter, Taftoon pe Harissa (Rs. 529) is beaten for hours with a mallet till it achieves the required texture. The chicken or mutton (and mushrooms for vegetarians) is then spiced with cardamom and saffron, slow-cooked, and drizzled with truffle oil. A scoop of this is served on a mini taftan, making for morsels of meaty deliciousness.The kitchen has a Robatayaki grill and tavas that send out delicate kebabs and tandooris. Theres the slow-cooked Galauti Kabab (Rs. 369), the creamy Malai Broccoli and Gobi (Rs. 309) and the crunchy Lipta Jheenga (Rs. 569)  barbecued prawns wrapped in chicken salami brushed with mustard. Its the Mirza Hasnu Tikka (Rs. 389) that steals the show. An old Lucknowi recipe, the dish has boneless chicken marinated in tandoori spices, cashew and onion and slow-cooked. The result is meat thats tender, creamy and smoky with just a hint of spice.The drinks have been made using ingredients commonly used in these cuisines. Dried spice adds a sweet smokiness to the Silk Route (Rs. 489), a whiskey drink with apricot brandy, plum juice, bitters, egg white and sour mix. Rosemary and honey star in the Botanic Blend (Rs. 519), a gin and tonic with lavender and a ginger honey syrup.The Grand Trunk Cocktail (Rs. 489)  gin with orange and cucumber  helps soothe the burn from the fiery Akhrot ki Seekh (Rs. 389). A dish from the streets of Srinagar, it consists of minced lamb kebabs tossed in a stock of red chillies, mixed with garlic, onion and garam masala, and finally topped with crushed walnut. Similarly the Bharwaan Kadhai (Rs. 389) is a rich but spicy dish of bhindi, brinjal, and chillies stuffed with grated onion, ginger, and khatta masala.The Railway Khosha Chops is a dry dish of succulent mutton coated with spicy, bhunao masala. This dish was invented during the British era especially for service on long journeys. Since they didnt have refrigeration, they would roast the masalas to create a drier dish and add tamarind and lime to preserve it, shared Gupta, who dropped by after every course to explain the origins of the dishes.Taftoon is a spacious place, all pale yellow lighting, wooden flooring and blue upholstery. An open kitchen gives a view into the making of the dishes, especially the breads. Theres the Zafrani Taftoon (Rs. 109) flavoured with saffron and cardamom; Baquerkhani (Rs. 99)  thick, poppy crusted and spiced leavened bread commonly found across Kashmir; Lal Naan (Rs. 139)  Amritsari bread laced with chilli oil giving it a fiery red colour, and sesame seeds, and the Raampuri Parathy Paratha (Rs. 99)  a tandoor baked layered bread with cashew.To end the meal, theres chewy and rich Shufta (Rs. 339), a Kashmiri compote of apricot, cashews, dried coconut, pistachios and sultanas toasted in ghee and stewed with whole spices in honey. It is served with a light mango ice cream that manages to cut through some of the richness. Theres a Bengali tasting platter, a Chena Plate (Rs. 349) with bite-sized chenna sweets, from gulab jamun, sandesh, rasmalai and kheer kodom.Although the meal was heavy on Indian food, Gupta promised other dishes in the future, including a Pakistani version of haleem, and Afghani mantou.Taftoon Bar and Kitchen, Naman Centre, opposite Dena Bank, Bandra Kurla Complex, 11 a.m. to 12.30 a.m.; 65656100/26530255"

Express file Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Express fileFive major wholesale markets in the state, including Punes, are likely to see a major change in the way their board of directors are elected. Instead of elections to pick the board, the state government is likely to appoint senior officials as directors to run these markets. These five markets  the wholesale markets of Vashi, Nashik, Kolhapur and Nagpur, besides Pune  receive around 30 per cent of the commodities arriving from other states and have substantially large turnovers. Vashis is the largest wholesale market in the state and, besides Maharashtra, records arrivals from Gujarat, among other states. The move to appoint senior officials as directors is part of the new model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act circulated by the central government in March this year. The Act specifies markets with more than 30 per cent arrival from other states as markets of national importance.State governments have been asked to give their suggestions and objections to it and adopt it as they deem fit. The Act has numerous other provisions to improve the performance of wholesale markets and help farmers realise better value for their produce. The government has formed a special committee headed by the director (marketing) to study the matter and submit a report. The report, it is learnt, is in its final stages after which it will be put before the Cabinet for approval.APMCs for long have been the hub of politics. In Maharashtra, the Congress and NCP have traditionally controlled these markets with the ruling BJP having a thin presence in them. Earlier, the state government had mooted the concept of expert directors, who would be political appointees on these boards. Majority of those appointed, it is said, were close to the BJP. The present move, many say, is another government move to wrestle control of these markets.Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Meanwhile, most traders say the move will not affect the functioning of the markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the Vashi markets onion and potato traders, said trade would go on unhindered. This is purely a political move and will achieve nothing substantial, he said.Jagdish Apshunde, a director of the Nashik market, however, said the move will have its pros and cons. An upright officer will be able to run the markets better but if power is concentrated in the hands of a corrupt officer, the market will go for a toss, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Further price drop is expected as the effects of increased Minimum Export Price (MEP) and arrival of imported onions are set to kick in the market.Since June, onion prices had seen a steady rise with the wholesale market at Lasalgaon in Nashik recording average trade price of over Rs 3,000 per quintal. Drought in Karnataka and the late arrival of the kharif crop in Maharashtra were cited as the causes for the price rise. The stored rabi onion was feeding the market with Maharashtra being the only state with ample storage of onions. Onions from Maharashtra were feeding the markets and subsequently prices had crossed the Rs 3,500 per quintal mark in the wholesale markets. Retail prices had touched Rs 80 per kg.MEP and imports follow indirect tactics adopted by the government for the last two months to control onion prices. Income tax raids were conducted on traders in Nashik to look for stored onions. Reports had come in of traders being threatened by officials from the Ministry of Consumer Affairs to not raise the price in the wholesale markets. Talk of the possible raising of MEP and imports has been doing the rounds since September with traders terming this as sentiment doctoring to get the prices down. MEP has been zero since December 24, 2015 to boost exports and reduce the then glut in the market. Besides imposing an MEP of $850 per tonne, the central government has also floated tenders for importing 2,000 MT of onions. Both these moves, the government hopes, will bring down the onion prices in retail markets.This has not gone down well with the farmers. Santosh Goarde, an onion grower from the village in Talki in Niphad taluka of Nashik, said the governments move comes at a time when growers are being hounded by the power distribution companies to pay up their bills or face disconnection.The discom is demanding one time payment at a time farmers have no ready cash. When the prices were just getting right offsetting the losses of the last 18 months, the government took steps to stop it, he said. Deepak Chavan, an agro commodity analyst felt the crop has had its top run and prices will taper off slowly. Post December 15, the arrival of fresh onion will pick up momentum and prices will drop further, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"
5aeb22be9855b7179ad7197b,Give accountability a chance,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/give-accountability-a-chance-rbi-mpc-repo-rate-cpi-inflation-urijit-patel-narendra-modi-4963865/,2017-12-02,"There is no question in my mind  or in the minds of most experts  that the MPC should be completely independent in the formulation of monetary policy. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) There is no question in my mind  or in the minds of most experts  that the MPC should be completely independent in the formulation of monetary policy. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)In our previous article, Making RBI Accountable (IE, November 25), I had presented data on Indian inflation over the past year, and concluded that neither on growth nor on inflation has the RBI conformed to any known models of central bank behaviour. I had also argued that there was reasonable evidence to conclude that the RBI/MPC had not been very transparent, or consistent, in its guidance and that by allowing the real repo rate (nominal repo rate minus year-on-year CPI inflation) to triple over the last year to more than 3 per cent, its policies had hurt both growth and employment.There is no question in my mind  or in the minds of most experts  that the MPC should be completely independent in the formulation of monetary policy. Some have suggested that if some government officials believe the real repo rate should be lowered, then all Prime Minister Narendra Modi needs to do is call up Urjit Patel and tell him that he wants the rate lowered. Rarely have I heard worse nonsense than this. Most countries of the world, including India, want their central bank to be independent, warts and all.But the problem we are facing in India is rather sui generis  the central bank is going against all known models of central bank policy. Therefore the question arises, in the immortal words of Lenin, What is to be done? My simple proposal, which should both preserve independence of the central bank and make the RBI more accountable, is as follows: Change the RBI Act, if need be, to require the RBI governor (as lead representative of the MPC), to testify to Parliament twice a year. In separate testimony in both houses of Parliament, the lawmakers can ask questions of the RBI governor and the governor can respond.Though I have repeatedly asked for clarification of the RBI memo on fiscal deficits, the RBI has chosen not to respond. Just to reiterate, in my note I have stated that important results pertaining to the RBI policy on fiscal deficits causing inflation cannot be reproduced. Worse, the RBI may have cherry-picked the data to suit its (ideological?) conclusion that the government policy on loan waivers will have a large impact on the consolidated state plus centre fiscal deficits. This expansion of fiscal deficit of 1 per cent of GDP due to loan waivers (RBI estimate) will, the RBI concludes, lead to a large 0.5 per cent increase in CPI inflation. Note that at present we (including self) are in the wilderness about (i) the actual magnitude of loan waivers this fiscal year; and (ii) more importantly, the impact it would have on CPI inflation, the principal concern of MPC policy.What is the empirical evidence for the argument that an expansion of fiscal deficits leads to an increase in CPI inflation? The RBI did not use, in its estimation with quarterly data, the information contained in the data for the years 1996 to 2005 (1996 is the starting year for the quarterly GDP data series). The table shows three-year averages of the two variables of concern  fiscal deficit and CPI inflation. Looking at the period 1996 to 2004 (the data omitted by the RBI, and omitting the onion outlier year of inflation in 1998), annual inflation declined from around 6.6 per cent to 4 per cent. The fiscal deficit expanded from 8 per cent to 9.4 per cent of GDP. If the RBI had included the data from 1996 to 2005, as I show in my note, they would have found that there is no relationship between fiscal deficits and inflation for the long time-period 1996 to 2016.Now let us look at the data considered by the RBI on fiscal deficits and inflation, 2006 to 2016. During this time-period, there is a sharp increase in inflation  from around 6.5 per cent to 9.9 per cent (year ending 2013), and then a sharp decline to 4.5 per cent in 2016. The trajectory of the absolute value of the fiscal deficit in the same period follows that of inflation  from 5.7 per cent to 8.3 per cent, and then a sharp decline to 6.6 per cent in 2016.You dont need a complicated estimation procedure as the RBI has done in its note to conclude that the period 2006-2016 will likely yield to a significant statistical relationship between increases/decreases in the absolute fiscal deficit and increases/decreases in CPI inflation. Ignoring the 1996 to 2006 data is the clearest, and obvious, form of cherry-picking the data, an intellectual crime that the RBI seems to have willingly committed. Such actions will be rendered impossible if India were to introduce the policy of jawabdehi.In English, jawabdehi means accountability. The idea behind it is not new. Indeed, it is as old as 1978 when the Humphrey-Hawkins Act was introduced in the US. The Act of October 1978 states: To assert the responsibility of the Federal Government to use all practicable programs and policies to promote full employment, production, and real income, balanced growth, adequate productivity growth, proper attention to national priorities, and reasonable price stability, to improve the coordination of economic policy-making within the Federal Government. Attainment of these objectives should be facilitated by setting explicit short-term and medium-term economic goals, and by improved coordination among the President, the Congress, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (emphasis added). It is worthwhile to quote from our own Finance Act of 2016, the one that established the MPC: And whereas the primary objective of the monetary policy is to maintain price stability while keeping in mind the objective of growth. The Central Government may, if it considers necessary, convey its views in writing to the Monetary Policy Committee from time to time.Both the US FED and Indias MPC have very similar goals  price stability with full employment. By experience, the US found it fit to introduce legislation to make the FED accountable to its own objectives. Should we not do the same in India? How will the introduction of jawabdehi help? Can we trust our parliamentarians to ask relevant questions, let alone the right ones? Equivalently, can we trust the RBI/MPC to deliver honest (true to its own goals) policy? Can we trust our analytical experts not to be cowed down by the RBI and be honest in their appraisal  a point also made, in the same context, by Chief Economic Advisor Arvind Subramaniam? Three questions  answers to the latter two we know, which is No.In the US, the Humphrey Hawkins testimony is one of the most important FED events  it is televised, and both the politicians and the FED governors perform beyond expectations. No reason it will not happen in India. All we are saying is give accountability a chance. It is a win-win proposal for all, with zero downside  the country is better off, the RBI/MPC is better off, and even the follow-the-RBI analysts may begin to do some much-needed, independent, and honest analysis. At the time of writing, the RBI-MPCs decision of December 6 is not unknown. Regardless of what the MPC does (rate hike, stay pat, or rate cut), my proposal deserves consideration. The only goal of the jawabdehi proposal is to bring about accountability, not rate cuts or rate hikes.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

Wholesale prices of onions have soared up to Rs. 40 per kg against the selling price of Rs. 15- Rs. 20 per kg last year. The prices are still in control in comparison to last week, when the bulb was retailed at Rs. 80 per kg in many parts of the city.Fuctuations all weekWe dont know what the exact reason is but supply from Nashik has been very low for weeks, said 18-year-old Mohammad Saddam, a vegetable retailer based in east Delhis Kalyanpuri who procures his supply from Ghazipur.Mohan Kumar, a wholesale trader, said fluctuations of around Rs. 5 were being registered in onion prices on a daily basis since the beginning of the current week.On Thursday, the price per kg was Rs. 55 and on Friday it is Rs. 50. Hopefully the trend will continue and we will be able to procure the stock. We will be able to pass it forward at a reasonable profit margin, which is currently at its lowest per quintal, he said.Suchetna Khanna, a housewife, complained that her budget had gone haywire due to daily fluctuations in onion prices.I bought just 1 kg onions at the beginning of this week because that was all I could afford at these prices but the bulbs went bad over the next two days. Not just the supply, even the quality of onions is a problem, she claimed.Mohammad Zubair, a vegetable seller at Okhla Sabzi Mandi, said, We received only 500 bags of onions against the expected 3,000-5,000 bags. There has been significantly lower planting by farmers this year. Heavy rain compounded the problem. Some of the produce we received was wet and spoils faster but we sell it anyway.Traders pointed out that they saw more customers in the mandi due to limited supply and soaring retail prices outside but were quick to complain about the instability of the supply and the rates.Farmers in my village cried last year because the produce did not sell and what sold went for ridiculously low prices. Hence, they unanimously decided to produce a bare minimum this year. This must be the plight of the farmers across the rest of the country, said Munga Lal, a trader at the Mandi.He blamed the governments anti-farmer policies for the unpredictable vegetable prices.I purchased onions for Rs. 50 per kg some days ago. The prices have suddenly dropped now and I am forced to sell the same produce at Rs. 40 per kg. Rates and supplies become unpredictable in this chaos, said Mohammad Sahil Khan, a retail onion seller."

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik.

This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."

Consequently, the affected families have been moved to a church, a marriage hall and a school in the village.Whenever the flow in Tamirabharani is abundant, the water would enter the sea through six estuary points. As the flow had dwindled a lot due to poor rainfall over the past two years, sand had got accumulated in five points and only one point was free for the water to enter the sea. Since the river was in spate, the existing single estuary point was not sufficient to drain the water into the sea. So, the water entered our hamlet, say the villagers, who have urged the officials to remove the sand accumulated in the other five points.After the gale and rain caused serious sea erosion in their hamlet, the fishermen of Periyathaazhai have urged the district administration to extend the existing groyne by another 700 metres.The match industry in Kovilpatti has suffered a huge loss as the downpour had hit production. Owners of various units have been unable to fulfil their commitment. Finished goods worth several crores could not be sent in lorries to northern States.After a gap of two years, the Eppothumventran reservoir, in which 120 million cubic feet water can be stored, is overflowing thanks to good rainfall in Kayathar, Kadambur, Maniyaachi and Kazhugumalai areas. As the reservoir has sufficient storage, farmers of Eppothumventran, Kaattunaickenpatti, Aathanur and nearby areas can carry out farming operations on 837.78 hectares.At the same time, the rain has affected crops such as maize, cotton, black gram, green gram, onion and chilly cultivated at Keezha Vilaaththikulam, Kamalapuram, Zamin Karisalkulam, Sivagnanapuram, Jakkammalpuram, Marthandampatti, T. Subbiahpuram, Sidhavanaickenpatti, Kodangipatti, Vellaiyammalpuram, Padarnthapuli, Pudhupatti, Ramanooththu and Kazhugaasalapuram, all under Vilaaththikulam block.Since the rain lashed the entire block and water is still stagnating in the fields even as the crop had reached the fruit-bearing stage, this will seriously affect the yield, the farmers say.Though the district received intermittent rains on Saturday, no damage was reported from any part of the district.Rainfall in the district (in mm): Kaayalpattinam  84, Kulasekarapattinam  66, Tiruchendur  59, Thoothukudi  40.20, Sattankulam  37, Srivaikundam  35, Vaippar and Ettaiyapuram  29, Kayathar  28, Ottapidaaram  24, Vilaaththikulam and Vedanaththam  20, Kaadalkudi  16, Kadambur  12, Kovilpatti  11, Kazhugumalai  7, Keezha Arasadi  3 and Maniyaachi  2."

In the Hubballi retail market, the price of onion was about to cross Rs 70 per kg.Rachappa Gadagin, a farmer in Dambal village, Gadag district, said that where he gets a better price in Bengaluru. ""We need to pay commission in the local market, which is higher than the transportation charges required to send the produce to Bengaluru. We have to pay Rs 140 per quintal as transportation charges while the commission crosses Rs 170 in the local markets. So, we are all transporting our produce to Yeshwantpur market in Bengaluru,"" he explained.Nasir Hussain Attar, an onion trader in Hubballi APMC , noted that the supply from local farmers is very low in Hubballi.""As there were no rains in the beginning of the season, many farmers opted for traditional crops. The recent heavy rains destroyed onion crops. So we are depending on arrivals from neighbouring districts like Bagalkot , Belagavi and even Maharashtra,"" he stated.Another trader Suryakant Habib predicted that the arrival from Maharashtra will increase from Monday. ""Once it starts, the price will automatically come down. However, onion sowing has decreased all over the nation due to drought. Moreover, onion growers turned to other crops as prices crashed to Rs 300-500 per quintal last year. These aspects are expected to maintain average price for onion in the market,"" he said.Gonibasappa Korlahalli, president, Karnataka State Onion Growers Association, said: ""Price was in upward direction till this week and now it is coming down slowly. Cyclone in neighbouring states, arrival from Maharashtra is the reason for the decrease of price. However, there is hope of retaining average price as North Karnataka has grown small onion more this year. There is big demand for this small onion, which is tastier than its bigger counterparts from Malaysia, Singapore and Pakistan. As Maharashtra has grown bigger onion, its arrival cannot compete with our produce,"" he said.Umesha Pujar, who runs an eatery in Vidyanagar, said that he had to replace onions, which cost Rs 7-8 per piece, with cabbage."

Wholesale dealers expect the price to touch Rs. 32 to Rs. 30 a kg in the coming days. With improved production in main markets such as Nasik, Ahmednagar and Kurnool, the onion cost is likely to drop further in January, says P. Satyanarayana, a wholesale onion dealer, who received fresh stocks from Ahmednagar after a long wait.The onion supply in Visakhapatnam is largely dependent on Maharashtra and Kurnool markets. Since the crop suffered a severe blow due to unseasonal rain, local markets have to adjust with the limited stocks available for the past four weeks. With the local producers contributing only a small share to the requirement, the onion rate has increased over the past few weeks.Apparently, arrivals started picking up in the district as nearly 250 quintals were received in the first load and another 260 quintals of onions arrived as a part of the next consignment in the last one week. On Sunday, about 450 quintals of onions reached Visakhapatnam from Kurnool.RequirementThe approximate requirement of onions in 13 rythu bazaars across the district is 450 to 500 quintals a day. However, the supply crunch has increased the gap between the market requirement and arrivals for the past one month. With onion auctions resuming at the Kurnool market yard, Agriculture Marketing Department is now procuring directly from farmers by utilising a part of the revolving fund set aside for the market intervention scheme. We intend to meet the demand and supply in future,  says P.V. Sudhakar, Regional Deputy Director of Marketing, Visakhapatnam.A part of the onions sourced from Kurnool has also been supplied to Krishna, Guntur, and East Godavari along with other districts of the State.Farmers at rythu bazaars hope for an improved sale at the stalls as the onion rate is expected to touch Rs. 20 a kg next month."

The retail price, however, has remained more unchanged.While green peas prices have spiraled to Rs 40-45/kg in wholesale market from Rs 25 on Wednesday, pushing the retail price to Rs 70-80/kg from the earlier Rs 50-60, the low supply of capsicum from Palghar due to the recent unseasonal rain has pushed up the wholesale rates to Rs 30-35 a kg from 25-30. Capsicum is currently retailed at Rs 60-70/kg from Rs 50-60 earlier.However, tomato prices have dropped to Rs 20 from Rs 25-30/kg in the wholesale market, bringing down the retail price too to Rs 40-50/kg from Rs 50-60 on Wednesday.

The rates are expected rise further and then stabilize in the next couple of weeks. While red onions were retailed at Rs 45-50/kg at Andheri-Versova, old onions were sold at Rs 55-60.Experts say the recent showers may have affected the quality of onions. Even a days non-seasonal rain can cause a lot of damage to the crop that is being harvested. The quantum is yet to be ascertained; a clear picture will emerge by next week, said Manohar Totlani, a trader. The harvest may get delayed by almost a week due to wet ground conditions, where farmers avoid collecting the crop.Early this week, wholesale onion prices had dropped to Rs 25-30/kg from Rs 30-35, attributing to arrival of fresh crop armed with the Centres cap on export by raising the minimum export price. But after the unseasonal showers on Monday and Tuesday, the prices have shot up yet again. Vegetable prices will remain uncertain till this weekend. The picture will be clear by Monday when the quantum of damage crop is expected to come to fore, said Balasaheb Badade, a trader.Mumbaikars are worried about the rising prices. Kandivli resident Abhijeet Thakur said, There has been no relief from expensive vegetables for the last few months. We have reduced the quantity to adjust the kitchen budget. The prices of other vegetables have remained mostly unchanged despite only 450 truckloads arriving in the APMC compared to the usual supply of 500-600 trucks. After a spell of inflation, vegetable prices were normalizing, but rain played spoilsport. A small bundle of coriander costs Rs 20 against the earlier Rs 10, said Mahim resident Rekha Sharma."

Officials say nowhere in the world has such a large-scale micro-irrigation project been implemented in one place. The project got administrative approval from the State government in August 2012 for an estimated cost of Rs. 786.11 crore. It proposed to utilise 5.84 tmcft of water from the backwaters of the Narayanpur reservoir of the Upper Krishna Project under two stages.The government had given contract of installation and maintenance to a private agency, which has used a high-end automated centralised control system for supplying water to the fields.The government decided to implement the micro-irrigation project in order to save water, as unlike in the conventional (flood irrigation) system which needs more water, under micro irrigation a wider area can be covered with limited water, said Water Resources Minister M.B. Patil.Elaborating on the other major benefits of the project, he said micro irrigation or drip irrigation allows water to percolate and reach the root of the plant, thus improving crop quality and increasing output. As water uniformly reaches every plant, unlike in the flood irrigation system, the crop gives higher yield. Micro-irrigation projects also avoid major problems such as salinity, which has damaged thousands of acres in the State, Mr. Patil said.Calling land acquisition as one of the major challenges the government faces in implementing irrigation projects, the Minister said a micro-irrigation project does not require a large area, unlike a flood irrigation system. Besides this, micro irrigation saves precious water from seepage and evaporation as the water reaches [the plants] through pipelines, not canals, he said.Farmers happyThe farmers in the region are happy to have a micro-irrigation facility in their farms.When Channappa Budihal, 63, began working on his familys 22-acre land as a youth in Kamatagi village of Hungund taluk, the farm was rain-dependent. Despite having a large agricultural plot, owing to absence of a proper irrigation facility, the farm was not giving a high yield. But things have changed for the better with the arrival of the Ramthal project.It has changed our fate for good. Today, I am cultivating horticultural crops such as onion which we could never do in the absence of irrigation facility, he said.Mr. Budihal said now, the farmers of the taluk cultivate crops such as gherkin, soybean and coriander. Officials demonstrated to us that even agricultural crops such as toor, sunflower and jowar give a higher yield of about 40% with drip irrigation, he said.... unlike in the conventional (flood irrigation) system, under micro irrigation a wider area can be covered with limited waterM.B.

She was of a cheerful disposition. As such, she was not one to grumble about rising early, especially on a holiday when most people lazed. There was a spring in her step, a lilt in her voice as she sang to herself, and a smile hovered about her lips.Briskly, she set about getting coffee for herself, the South Indian filter variety - just the way she liked it. She switched on the motor, started the Aquaguard and filled two jugs and six bottles of water to last for the day. Then, she loaded the washing machine. While that was doing its work, the milk was boiled and the decoction ready. She made herself a cup of the rich, creamy beverage and relished every drop. She had switched on the heater earlier, and the water now hot, she went in for her bath.When she had finished, she called out to her husband who entered the bathroom obediently. Then she said to her daughter, ""Gowri, go bathe."" Gowri, clearly unhappy about being hustled, grumbled about it being like Deepavali which Devaki wisely ignored. She reminded her son Venkatesh that his turn would be next. He retorted, ""I am not having a bath today."" Devaki said, ""Suit yourself.""She then set about preparing breakfast. Sunday special was idli with onion sambar and chutney or masala dosai with chutney. Today, it was idli-sambar-chutney. Everyone assembled and the family had a hearty breakfast followed by 'degree' coffee.Devaki told her children to clear and clean the table, and summoned her husband to help with lunch. That done, she announced, ""Now all of us can relax.""All these arrangements were because of an announcement in the newspaper the previous day. ""Maintenance work by the KEB will impact power supply between 11 am and 5 pm on Sunday.""Devaki collected the newspaper to read in a leisurely fashion, lying comfortably on her bed and solve the crossword puzzle. Gowri and Venkatesh opted to watch a film and the father retired to read a book in peace. The film was a long one and Devaki cautioned, ""Once the power is cut, you must stop watching the film.""""What's the UPS for?"" asked the duo, in unison. ""For emergencies!"" replied Devaki. But even after the film ended, the power supply had not been impacted.The family had a peaceful - relatively - lunch, rested and woke up for tea. Still, they continued to have power.""Did you check the date on the newspaper, amma?"" queried Gowri, with a sly smile. ""Yes !"" replied Devaki, not rising to the bait ""All that fuss for nothing,"" grumbled Venkatesh. ""What is the harm in being prepared? I for one, had lovely, long, lazy day!""

As soon as the pan hit the heat, he added a generous portion of melted butter. Simultaneously (multitasking with much ease), he broke in a couple of eggs into a bowl, followed by an array of not-so-finely diced ingredients, and his secret ingredient black pepper. With an up-and-down as well as back-and-forth motion, he then beat the hell out of them until there was no strand of white or yellow.""This is going to be the perfect omelette,"" I thought to myself. After a long leave that I had happily sanctioned my cook, soon after which I fell sick, our kitchen had turned into a dismal wasteland. But the man of the house aimed to do something productive in the kitchen that day.But it was when the eggs produced a loud satisfying sizzle on the pan, that I critically questioned my insights. ""Wait a minute! Tell me you didn't tell me that you 'don't know how to cook'!"" I exclaimed. He smirked extravagantly wriggling his elbows and body, and then drawling to me he said, ""Don't know, yah.""After five years of sharing our lives, I had just come to terms with the fact that he's probably never going to make the kitchen a romantic place to be. And yet, here he was, regaling in harmony amid broken egg shells and inedible onion skins.Whilst I coughed away to glory, he gracefully plated up a perfect, bright-yellow, butter-doused omelette with a sprinkle of pepper and a burst of colourful veggies that looked warm, earthy and inviting.Unwittingly following the pattern of a triangle as we sat at the dining table, the three of us began consuming the omelette effectively. As my husband and I recounted the story of ""I don't know how to cook"" and laughed out loud, while also praising the newly discovered sneaky chef, it was obvious that our three-year-old daughter didn't like this kind of commotion at the table. She preferred her mother giving her the fullest attention. I then cut a perfect triangle and speared a morsel of omelette into her mouth and asked, ""Happy now?""Of course, while I can't say enough good things about our new chef's debut performance, one thing is certain.

In Chhattisgarh, too, tomato prices crashed, leaving farmers in the lurch.Not fetching more than Rs 2 per kg, farmers simply abandoned the tomato harvest. The deplorable price they get in the market is not even enough to meet the plucking and harvesting cost.This is primarily because of higher production. Whether it is cabbage, tomato, potato, onions or any other crop, the higher the production, lower is the price. A higher production enables middlemen to form cartels and manipulate prices, often to the extent of exploitation.T Rajaganesh, a farmer in Erode district, asks: ""Farmers spend at least Rs 45,000 per acre a month to cultivate cabbage. Add to it the cost of labour, maintenance and fertiliser, and the cost shoots up to more than Rs 50,000 a month.Since it takes almost three months to yield, we have to spend at least Rs 1.5 lakh per acre before harvesting. How can we realise a profit with a farmgate price of Rs 1 per kg?""In the case of tomato too, average cost of production is about Rs 90,000-1 lakh per acre for small farmers. For the big farms, the production cost is a little higher, at Rs 1.25 lakh per acre.Till the first week of January, when I travelled to meet tomato farmers in Durg, the prices were much better - about Rs 1,000 per crate of 25 kg. But, with the advent of tomato crop from Karnataka, the supplies swelled, and prices slumped.Now, let's take the case of chana. According to news reports, chana prices are ruling at about Rs 3,600 per quintal, against the Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 4,400 per quintal, a drop of 20% in the retail price.With production expected to increase to 10 million tonnes this year (from 9.33 million tonnes last year), prices are expected to dip with arrivals picking up. Even wheat price has remained below MSP by 6-8% in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, where early crop harvest hit the mandis.In February last week, market price for tur dal was ruling at Rs 4,500 per quintal, against the procurement price of Rs 5,500 at Tandur market in Telangana.Meanwhile, reports of tomato being dumped on the streets in Chhattisgarh poured in again in early March. This is the third year in a row when tomato prices have crashed to Re 1 per kg. In fact, this is the third year in a row when prices of almost all agricultural commodities have crashed across the country.Karnataka modelAfter two years of drought in 2014 and 2015, production picked up after a favourable monsoon in 2016 and 2017. While the increase in production has brought cheers to the government, the drop in prices has added to the misery of farmers.It is here that I see the relevance of a very timely suggestion made by Dr TN Prakash, chairman of the Karnataka Agricultural Prices Commission. He has called for making the Minimum Support Price of crops to be legally binding. He said: ""Consumers have legal protection if produce is sold above MRP and can approach the courts. But, even after 70 years of Independence, farmers don't have similar protection.""For the third year in a row, prices of almost all commodities are at 20-45% lower than MSP in various parts of the country. At times of glut, traders ruthlessly exploit farmers. Even the introduction of the Unified Market Platform in Karnataka, which led to the expansion of 585 eNAM (National Agricultural Market) throughout the country, farmers have not gained.The concept of model price, which is based on the average of the day's trading, is in reality a distress price and needs to be dispensed with. eNAM in reality is a nationwide platform being created to make it profitable for spot trading.In addition to 23 crops for which MSP is announced every year, state governments must work out MSP for highly perishable commodities like tomato, potato, onion and other vegetables.Many states already have a Farmers' Commission, which has more or less become retiring rooms for political appointees.The immediate need is to convert them into State Agricultural Prices Commission, with the mandate to provide higher income to farmers, similar to that in Karnataka. If Karnataka can ensure procurement of 14 crops at prices much higher than the MSP announced by the Centre, I see no reason why other states cannot."
5b5088d89855b708a7ccca2f,Veggie buyers feel price pinch,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/veggie-buyers-feel-price-pinch/articleshow/62060198.cms,2017-12-14,"BHOPAL: A steep hike in vegetables prices is leaving an unsettling effect on consumers home budget this winter. At this time of the season, a fresh and affordable stock of vegetables brings down the prices. But it does not look so for consumers this season. From traders to experts, nobody seems to have a definite answer for the spike. Some traders said monsoons played the spoilsport, some others heaped the blame on demonetisation and GST.With the onset of winter, when prices of vegetables are lower, consumers are shelling out as high as Rs 50 per kg for many vegetables. Take for example onions till the time of filing this report, the price of onion in the local markets for Rs 50-Rs 60 per kg, this when price hike has eased considerably. I purchased onions a few days ago for Rs 80, said Rajesh Kumar Saxena, a government official.Tomatoes were available at Rs 8-10 per kg last year. Till Tuesday evening, it was at steep Rs 60 per kg. On Wednesday, tomato prices somewhat cooled. Vendors say it will take at least a week to 10 days for prices to come down.WHAT THE VENDORS SAYDemonetisation effect could be the reason for this hike in tomato prices, say some vendors.Good quality tomatoes take 50-100 days to grow depending on the variety. Usually people begin sowing in May-June after the summer harvest. By winters, tomato is ready. However, this year there is less quantity of tomato this season. Small farmers who sell their produce directly in the market have been removed from the process this years, said Shri Kant, a local vegetable vendor in Bagsewani vegetable market, adding that there was a disruption in the production cycle induced by demonetisation.According to Abdul Raqib , president of Aloo Pyaaz Wholesaler Association , ill-timed monsoons resulted in wastage of many crops this year. The monsoon was unpredictable this year. There were no rains for better part of the monsoon season, but there were flash rains in the end. This lead to a crop failure in many parts which is why, there is less supply this season and more demand leading to push in prices. Raqib, however, said hike in tomato prices is likely to ease in coming days and have already seen a drop since Wednesday. The retail prices of vegetables are around 35-50% higher than the wholesale rate, due to wastage of perishable goods in winter. For example: The wholesale price of onion is Rs 30 per kg, whereas in market Rs 60.Other perishables like potatoes, cauliflower, peas, green onion, green leafy vegetable, pumpkin, brinjals are also seeing a price fluctuations because of the same. Vendors, however, say prices of seasonal vegetables will stabilise in the next two to three days.WHAT THE RESIDENTS SAYThis has been troubling Bhopalis as they have to make do without an essential vegetable in their winter platter. Tomatoes and onions are used in almost every Indian dish. These are essential products which cannot be substituted for anything else. This hike in prices upset my daily grocery budget, said Natasha Matani , an engineer, working with a private company. This pattern, however, is not limited to Bhopal alone, but is a nationwide phenomenon. According to government data, inflation based on consumer food price index rose to 4.42% from 1.90% a month ago and 2.03% a year ago, whereas vegetable prices have increased to 22.48% in November from 7.47% last month.This despite the fact that Madhya Pradesh saw a bumper onion crop this season.Some residents feel the government is also to be blamed for this. Every day we read in news that onion has been rotting in the open. In a country where people are still struggling for daily meals, government should have not let so much food get waste, said Matani. There were others who said that the administration should intervene as the prices are burning a hole in the pocket of common people. Maladministration and crop wastage lead to such a situation. The government should intervene to ensure easy distribution of vegetables in markets so that we do face loss due to poor administration, said Reeta Prakasham , an educationist.WHAT THE EXPERTS SAYAfter initial slim pickings of food crops in few months post-demonetisation, many farmers were forced to terminate their summer crop due to which there is shortage of tomato supply in the market this season. Experts say during this time last year with demonetisation, the sapped currency supply lead to sudden decrease in prices. The farmers needed money and traders did not have it, which is why they had to sell their products cheap which eventually lead to less sowing in the next season. The effect of which is becoming apparent this winter.B L Sharma, an economist in the Madhya Pradesh Planning Commission, says as the winter intensifies, prices of perishables will drop. Prices are expected to come down in coming few days after the winter intensifies. Perishables are dependent on weather and also on the demand supply gap. When demand goes up, vendors stock supplies to take advantage of it, further pushing prices.State horticulture director Satyanand said, The rise and fall in prices is due to market forces, which balance themselves on their own. When there is a gap between harvest and sowing new crop, this problem comes up, which will get solved as soon as the new stock arrives.However, there are many, who blame demonetisation and GST for the same. Indias perishable market is a cash-based mandi dependent system. Even though cash has come back in overall circulation, it is yet to be efficiently circulated in the mandis. Over a year has gone by, but payments are still being done in cashless method, which is not convenient to small and medium farmers, said an expert seeking anonymity.The surge in prices is also due to delay in reaction to the supply and demand. Due to disturbed production of perishable goods this year, the market is not very flexible to demand and supply changes this year. For example, if demand increases for a vegetable, it will take time for market forces to adjust themselves to accommodate the rise in demand with the supply, since the mandis and wholesale markets are still not running efficiently as compared to previous years, the expert said, adding that another week might give the market enough time to adjust with the demand leading to a stable rate."

While warming of a status quo till end of January, officials of the Telangana states agricultural marketing department attribute the abnormal price rise to the excessive rains in onion-growing states such as Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and West Bengal.They predict a price correction by February.Late rainfall in September and October damaged the onion kharif crop in Telangana also. Due to this, the supplies are now coming in only from Maharashtra, said Padma Harsha , deputy director of department.Predictably, J Ananthaiah, selection grade secretary, agricultural market committee at Malakpet , said that the daily procurements have dropped from nearly 40,000 bags per day to 10,000-15,000 onions bags per day, thus pushing the rates northwards.The steep jump in costs has adversely impacted traders in other markets whove stopped selling onions. We cannot purchase onions at such a rise price. Hence, we are clearing our old stock. If the situation continues, we may be forced to keep our shops shut, said Mohammed Abid , a vegetable vendor at the Erragadda Rhythu Bazaar.Not just onions, prices of other vegetables such as tomato, cabbage, carrot too have registered a more than 200 per cent rise in price rise as compared to the last winter season. While one kg of tomato cost 8 in December 2016, the price has now shot to 26 per kg. The price of carrot has increased from 16 to 50 per kg.Onions and tomato are basic vegetables. With the price rise, we are now forced to purchase these vegetables in lesser quantities, said Vijayalaxmi, a housewife from Kokapet. The steep rise in cost of vegetables has driven inflation to an eight-month high of 3.93 per cent."

More significantly, the economy clocked a growth of 6.3% in the second quarter of this year, after slowing for at least four quarters. But official data for the third quarter (October to December) so far suggest that the economy is still not entirely out of the woods and fresh headwinds, such as rising oil prices, could upset the fragile recovery. Manufacturing growth, driven by restocking by producers after the rollout of the goods and services tax, was a major factor in the second quarter growth pick-up. After two months of robust 4%-plus growth, industrial activity however slipped in October, with the Index of Industrial Production reflecting just 2.2% growth. October was a festive month but consumer durables production contracted by nearly 7%, mining was virtually stagnant, and manufacturing growth moderated to 2.5% from 3.8% last year. This coincides with exporters seeing a 1.1% slump in shipments in October, after growing at an average of over 13% in the second quarter. It is also borne out by the nearly 10% drop in GST collections that month compared to September. The IIP has now grown just 2.5% in the first seven months of 2017-18, compared to 5.5% in the same period last fiscal.If the spectre of slower growth with weak exports at a time when global trade is recovering is not worrying enough, with job creation still to pick up, the latest inflation data set too is cause for concern. Prices at the consumer level rose at the fastest pace in 15 months this November, with inflation touching 4.88%, up from 3.6% in October and just 1.5% in June. This reflects a broad-based price rise under way, although it is led by fuel inflation (at 7.2%, from 6.1% a month ago) and food inflation (4.4%, from 1.9% in October). Within food, rising onion and tomato prices pushed vegetable inflation to a 16-month high of 22.5%; inflation in egg prices quickened from 0.8% in October to 8% in November. While some of this food inflation could wane in the coming months, there is greater concern about the rise in core inflation (excluding food and fuel) and inflation imported through high global prices. On Tuesday, oil prices breached the $65 a barrel mark for the first time in over two years. The government faces difficult choices. Slashing fuel taxes could calm inflation, but it would hit revenue collections that are already uncertain owing to GST deadline extensions. Not doing so would leave less room for the central bank to lower interest rates. As the Economic Survey said, oil at $60-65 could hit consumption and public investment and dent private investment further. That is not a path to a sustained revival."

Eateries saddled with bags of the waste product can now turn them into a power source - the skin of a single onion can light up 12 green LEDs.Professor Bhanu Bhusan Khatua , his PhD scholar Sumanta Kuman Karan and their team at the Material Science Centre (MSC) have developed the green technology after a year-long research. The result has been tested and improved by scientists, led by Jin Kon Kim , at Pohang University of Science and Technology Postech ), South Korea . The paper was published in the Nano Energy journal in October.The researchers have applied for a patent on the technology which can be used in places where onions are used in bulk. ""The technology can be easily adopted at restaurants where a lot of onion peels are accumulated on a daily basis. Only, they end up in bins,"" said Khatua.His research found that only half-an-inch of an onion peel is enough to generate 20 volts. ""If you gather the peels of six onions and place them in a series, they can light-up 80 LEDs or charge your laptop or mobile phone,"" the scientist said.To make the system work, the user has to encapsulate the onion skin and fabricate the device - the size of an adhesive plaster. The device, called nanogenerator, must then be attached to mechanical or bio-mechanical energy sources to generate electricity.Nanogenerators convert kinetic energy created from vibrational and mechanical sources into electrical power, doing away with the need for external circuits or batteries. In scientific jargon, the devices are called bio-piezoelectric nanogenerators (BPNG). ""The fabricated nanogenerator will be capable of harvesting many kinds of mechanical energies, including body movements, wind flow and machine vibrations,"" said Khatua.""This is the first time that a nanogenerator has been designed using onion peel as the medium for generating electricity. Onion peels are bio-degradable and bio-waste material. Unlike other piezoelectric materials, they don't require pre-treatment or electrical polling. We just have to place the onion peel-based nanogenerator, connected with the smart electronic devices, under the mechanical or bio-mechanical energy sources,"" said Khatua.The electricity in the cellulose-based onion skin is produced as a result of structural changes in the cellulose under external mechanical stress or force, including movements as delicate as the touch of a finger or a heart pulse.""We are currently developing the technology for industrial and domestic application, and applying for its patent,"" Khatua added.""The onion skin used to fabricate the nanogenerators will keep on generating electricity until they are naturally destroyed,""he said. Since harvesting energy through human body movement (joint movement) is an emerging trend for smart applications, IIT-Kharagpur's effort to commercialize electricity generated from onion peel may go a long way in providing free power to rural India.""We look forward to the day onion skin-based bio-piezoelectric nanogenerators find applications in health care as a self-powered energy source for pacemakers or as a sensor for monitoring heart pulse,"" Khatua said."

The harvesting is underway in one section and cultivation on the other simultaneously.Farmers in Nadupatti, Ambatturai, Kathiripatti, Kurumpatti, Kalikkampatti, Perumalkovilpatti, Settiyapatti and many other villages in Athoor union in Dindigul district, have been cultivating shallots for the past 20 years. Last year the drought had deterred many from taking up the cultivation and went for alternative crops instead. The lesser production early this year resulted in the price of shallots selling at a minimum price of Rs 80 per kilogram. It went up to Rs 120 per kilogram in June this year and has remained so till now.R K Palpandi of Nadupatti who has been cultivating shallots for the past 20 years says that the changing prices of the shallots had encouraged and discouraged some farmers to cultivate it. But, this year with fairly good rainfall and the ground having sufficient moisture, most of the traditional onion cultivators have started it again. He said that they had brought a kilogram of onion seed for Rs 150 and started cultivation. About 400 kilograms of seed is needed to cultivate onion in one acre of land. Mahendran of G Nadupatti, says that under ideal conditions, a kilogram of seeds will yield, 100 kilograms of onions.They had purchased the seeds from the seed centres in Perambalur and Thuraiyoor. He added that this crop gets ready for harvesting in about 70 to 90 days, and needs a lot of tending. They have to sprinkle pesticides thrice for a crop at regular intervals.This year the yield has been good, and they have started harvesting it and encouraged by the output, farmers like Shanmugam of Kurukkampatti have started cultivation and harvesting simultaneously as the present climatic conditions are conducive for these crops."

In the wholesale market , onion is selling at Rs 500 per 20kg, or at a price of Rs 25 per kg, higher than that of last year.Farmers from Mahuva and Bhavnagar staged a protest and demanded a minimum support price for onions. Market officials in Mahuva said farmers were concerned that arrival of the new crop will pull prices down, though the current rate, Rs 25 per kg, was Rs 5 higher per kg than that of 2016.An official of APMC Mahuva said that on an average, around 10,000 kg of onions from this seasons harvest have started arriving every day and the price may drop. Farmers were expecting a minimum support price as just before the elections the government had announced that it will purchase different crops including groundnut at MSP. So, the farmers want MSP for onions.In the APMC Ahmedabad, onion was trading at Rs 25 to Rs 35 per kg depending on the quality, though in the retail market, the consumer has to buy onions at around Rs 60 per kg.J V Vaja, the secretary of the Mahuva Agriculture Produce Market said, The price was higher than last year and there was not much of a hue and cry from the farmers.

But after reaching the market, he was disappointed in the wake of the extremely low prices he got for his greens.A couple of months ago, he sold the same quantity of greens for Rs. 1,000. However, this time, he had no choice but to accept Rs. 300 for his produce.The crash in the prices of vegetables in the market here has, on the one hand, brought cheer among customers as they are buying greens and vegetables at a cheaper price, the farmers, on the other, are extremely disappointed as they are unable to retrieve even the cost of cultivation and transportation.Sunday, when the main vegetable market functions in the district, witnessed vegetable being sold at the lowest price in the last three months. While a small bunch of coriander cost Rs. 10-Rs. 15 sometime ago, on Sunday customers bought five such bunches for a mere Rs. 10 in the retail market.Other green vegetables are also being sold at such low prices allowing customers to buy more vegetables for a small price.Tomatoes, which were sold at around Rs. 60- Rs. 80 per kg till about three months ago, are now available at Rs. 7- Rs. 10 per kg.Besides the general public, hotels and restaurants owners are delighted as they are able to buy huge quantity of vegetables at small prices.The farmers believe that owing to good monsoon, many farmers have cultivated vegetables in their fields, because of which prices have sharply declined.In the summer, only those farmers who have irrigation facility cultivate vegetables; therefore, the prices go up owing to limited cultivation of vegetables.But post-monsoon, since most of the fields have adequate moisture, farmers use the opportunity to cultivate short-term vegetable crops. When most of them do the same thing, the prices obviously come down in the market, said an official in the Horticulture Department.While the prices of a majority of vegetables have dipped sharply, the onion farmers are in a good mood because of a better price their produce is fetching  Rs. 40-Rs. 50 per kg. Onion was sold at about Rs. 20 per kg a couple of months ago."

The agriculture ministry thinks so and is hunting for commercially viable proposals in 12 pre-identified areas.The Narendra Modi governments Startup India scheme, which has a Rs10,000 crore war chest managed by the Small Industries Development Bank of India (Sidbi), is seeking to incubate farm-solution startups through a contest called Agriculture Grand Challenge.I urge young entrepreneurs to participate in our newly launched Agriculture Grand Challenge and join forces to make agrarian sector technologically sound and commercially viable, farm minister Radha Mohan Singh said. The idea is to enable entrepreneurship and innovation, he said.A handful of startups for the rural economy are already a part of the growing ecosystem. India has more than 19,000 startups, led by consumer Internet and financial services apps, according to the Economic Survey 2015-16.From 220 in 2014, the number of startups funded in the first 10 months of 2017 stood at 482, according to data from Tracxn.As of December 2015, eight Indian startups belonged to the so-called Unicorn category, a club of ventures valued at $1 billion or more. Yet, fewer than 10% of these cater to the farm or social sector, according to Tracxn.A government document, which Hindustan Times has reviewed, states that private-sector startups could offer viable interventions in an array of areas, notably linking farmers to markets and offering extension services. It seeks to rev up an emerging niche area thats being dubbed as farming as a service, or FAAS.Proposals are being invited for simplified, sensor-based quick testing of soil samples as well as real-time assaying and grading of food commodities in electronically linked eNAM markets. The government has linked 470 mandis electronically but many of them lack crucial infrastructure: food labs to test samples being brought to these markets. The prospective app should preferably enable sample tests under two minutes to promote online trade.The government is interested in apps to connect food processors with agripreneurs and growers, an official said. To help price discovery, the ministry is looking at price forecast apps for pulses, oilseeds, potato, onion and tomato at the time of sowing since these crop are vulnerable to price volatility.According to the document, the success of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, Indias main farm insurance scheme, depends on accurate yield estimates at village and farm levels for which it wants to incubate digital technologies.Another priority area is custom hiring of farm machinery and cheaper disposal of crop residue that has become a major reason for pollution in the national capital from neighbouring states during winters.Under the programme, commercially viable ideas will be incubated at the governments expense for three months. The last date for applications is January 15, 2018.Given the high penetration of Internet-enabled mobile phones, this is a good idea that can drive down cultivation costs, said Ashok Duggal, one of the promoters of VentureIndia Labs.A crop of startups aimed at harnessing the rural economy has made inroads already. AgroStar, a Pune-based mobile-commerce firm, directly sells farm inputs to farmers in Maharashtra and has raised more than $4 million. Farmers need to give a missed call to access its services.EM3, another firm, offers farm-labour services at Rs 2,000 an acre of wheat, which it claims is half of what it normally costs during peak season.The government document said it would prefer solutions that are scalable and can reach small farmers.The average size of farm holdings is 1.15 hectares. This means nearly 85% farmers are small and marginal. India has 120 million agricultural land holdings."

Holidays get planned, parties are discussed and the coming new year fills hearts with hope. But before the current year is given a farewell, there is of course the last festival of the year to be celebrated  Christmas, the birth of Christ in Bethlehem centuries ago. Unlike some occasions like Thanksgiving and Halloween, which India learnt to celebrate more recently, the history of Christmas celebrations in India is perhaps as old as the arrival of Christianity in the country. And over the years, it has picked up local flavours, to become a celebration that is as Indian as it is global  songs in praise of Jesus are sung in local languages along with the usual English carols and local sweets and savouries share table space with plum pudding, cold meats and wine.In India, Christians constitute only 2.3 per cent of the population (as per Census 2011). But Christmas celebrations are not restricted to Christians. Most children, irrespective of religion, hang up stockings on Christmas Eve, and at Midnight Mass, non-Christians often outnumber Christians at churches. Bada Din (or Big Day) as Christmas is locally known  is literally bada for us. Markets are packed with Christmas trees and decorations, shop windows are decked up in Christmas colours, concerts are held, clubs organise parties, restaurants offer special menus and confectionary stores do brisk business. Read on to get a feel of how Christmas is celebrated in different parts of India, or to know what you should do if you are there this festival season.Cake & Coffee At The Cathedral Church Of RedemptionIn Delhi while people usually think of Khan Market or possibly the malls while thinking of places to buy Christmas decorations and gifts and papers etc, the best place to do ones Christmas shopping in the capital, and at a fraction of the price at Khan Market, is Sadar Bazar. There are rows of shops along the street with every kind of Christmas tree imaginable  trees with white leaves, with green ones, with tinsel on them or blinking lights  other items of decoration, tableaus or scenes from the Nativity etc. I know families from other parts of North India coming to Sadar Bazar to do their Christmas shopping. Just last week, when I was there to do my own shopping, I met a family from Bhatinda who were here for the day to make their Christmas purchases.File photo of a Christmas concert at the Cathedral Church Of Redemption in New Delhi. (Raj K Raj/HT Photo)Most confectionaries in town sell Christmas cakes and goodies  and the cake at Wengers is good, but Christian families in town do their own baking. Every family has its own recipe, handed down through the generations. The ingredients for the cake are bought from the masala market in old Delhi, Khari Baoli. The mixing is done at home and then it is taken to small, local bakeries for the baking. If you do not have friends in the city, or have not been invited to a house party, there are suppliers who can provide you some home-like cake.The Christmas Eve evening is for Midnight Mass  and one place to go to if you are in Delhi, is the Cathedral Church of Redemption. This Church in the Presidents Estate is today a heritage monument. On Christmas Eve the church is packed by both Christians and non-Christians alike and the Service is followed by cake and coffee. In Delhi, much of the festival food for Christians is inspired by whats prepared for other festivals across North India. So for example, Gujiya, which is a Holi dish, is also made for Christmas. We have two variants  keema gujiya and sweet gujiya. The syncretic Indo-Gangetic culture also translates into Mughal influence on our food. Thats how Yakhni Pulao is a common Christmas dish in Delhi., as is Zarda, a sweet dish made with saffron. We also have cold, salted meat. To sample all this though, you need an invitation to a house party, and there are a number of them in Delhi.(By Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, international publishing consultant )Mass At The Open Maidan and Waltzing Away The NightChristmases in Mumbai are warm  and not because it just doesnt get cold in this part of the world. The citys Christian community is spread across the island city and suburbs; some churches are almost 450 years old. So, wherever you live, you dont have to go far for shop windows dressed in festive red and green, the glint of tree ornaments in street markets, or the fragrance of plum cake.Merrymaking starts early. By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes.By the first week of December, Bandras Hill Road, Malads Orlem and Borivalis IC Colony neighbourhoods are overrun with stalls selling festive knick-knacks  plastic trees, Santa hats and marzipan in all shapes and sizes. (Sashi S Kashyap/HT PHOTO)The furniture store Damian, near Bandras iconic Mehboob Studio, puts so much effort into its massive window displays that the store has become a selfie spot where families from distant suburbs gather for pictures before they head to the nearby Bandstand seaside promenade. Previous displays have included winter scenes complete with castle; Santa in his sleigh, attended by elves, reindeer and fairy lights. A fake snowman too, which had to be explained to children standing outside in 18-degree temperatures.Across the city, churches set up the nativity scene on the premises  ceramic statues of Mary, Joseph, hay-stuffed empty manger (Jesus is filled in only on December 25), ox, ass, angels and the star. The three wise men arrive on January 6. Most churches also weave in a social or news theme with messages of peace, simplicity and a charitable spirit. Check out the panoramas at Mount Marys Basilica in Bandra, Holy Name Cathedral in Colaba, Gloria Church in Byculla and Our Lady of Perpetual Succour in Chembur.To join in the fun, catch carol-singing groups at churches on the evenings leading up to Christmas (dates and times vary, but tend to start after 7pm). Many choirs do renditions in Hindi, Marathi and Konkani too.On Christmas Eve, celebrations officially start after Midnight Mass. The term is a bit of a stretch  churches with large populations hold services at maidans, starting as early as 8pm to stay within the 10 pm deadline for loudspeakers. Go early. The seats fill up.On Christmas Day, churches are open through most of the morning for services. If youre not invited to a family lunch or dinner, get yourself a dancing partner, iron your best formals, and buy tickets to a night-long Christmas dance.All the clubs have them. For true Christmas spirit, though, tag along with a member to the Catholic Gymkhana on Marine Drive, Willingdon Catholic Gymkhana in Santacruz or the Bandra Gym. Their pre-Christmas events include bingo nights, festive bazaars, senior-citizen parties, Santa visits and plenty of dances. And theres everything from ham sandwiches and pulao to cookies and cake at the buffet.(By Rachel Lopez)Cake from Nahoums, Wine From Bow Barracks And Parties At Park StreetAccording to me the best thing about Christmas in Kolkata and what makes it unique  and I have heard this even from those living in UK and Australia and who come to celebrate the festival here - is how cosmopolitan the celebrations here are. About 80 per cent of those celebrating Christmas in Kolkata are non-Christians, says Barry OBrien, president-in-chief of the All India Anglo Indian Association.File photo of Christmas revellers on Park Street. (Indranil Bhoumik/Mint)The first signs of the festival in the city are the stalls selling Christmas decorations that come up in the centre of one of the citys most popular shopping hubs  New Market. From a distance, the area looks like just a colourful mass of Christmass trees, chains of Holly and mistletoe leaves, Santa Clauses of all sizes, shiny bells, stars and balls and every other kind of Christmas decoration possible. Though a number of gourmet confectionaries have opened in the city over the years, for many, Christmas shopping is incomplete without the rich plum or fruit cake from Nahoum And Sons in New Market. Many though also prefer to buy home-made Christmas cakes which is informally sold by many Christian families in Bow Barracks and other places. Other Christmas goodies which many Anglo-Indians in Kolkata continue to make are Rose Cookies and Kulkuls, but again, for these you have to be either friends with a family which makes them or get someone to sell a few to you. If in Calcutta for Christmas, do make sure to sample the home-made wine which many in Bow Barracks make and sell. Though a little on the sweet side, most Christmas home parties in the city are incomplete without wine from Bow Barracks. The colony also organises a week-long Christmas festivity, which is open to all.Most celebrations in Kolkata, like Pujo, spill out on the streets, and Christmas is no different. In Bow Barracks on the 23rd there is music and dancing on the streets, where you will find ladies in their traditional attire and high heels, dancing, says OBrien. He adds, The other thing which is feel is unique to Kolkata is the club culture here. While in most cities, the social clubs are for the affluent, in Kolkata, many clubs have members from even among the middle-class.Almost all these clubs have Christmas parties. While at most clubs the party is on Christmas Eve, at Dalhousie institute the party is on Christmas, since it continues to have many Anglo-Indian members, who are likely to attend Midnight Mass on 24th. Find a member, to take you to one of these parties to enjoy Christmas music, Yule-tide specialities like Plum Pudding and Cake, dancing and more.For the past few years, the state government is also organising a Christmas to New Year festival on Park Street. The street is lit up and old Park Street institutions, restaurants like Mocambo and Peter Cat, are packed with revelers. Flurys, also on Park Street, is a round-the-year favourite breakfast destination, but on Christmas and New Year, it is something of a ritual to be there.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Celebrate Like They Do At Goas Old, Quaint Latin QuarterMost tourists never realize it, but Goa is most beautiful and welcoming during its favourite festivals, especially Ganesh Chaturthi. Another one celebrated with tremendous joie de vivre is Christmas, when far-flung sons and daughters and grandchildren return home to gather anew, and the entire countryside wears an irrepressible festive aspect. It is a beloved time of year for locals of every religious and ethnic background, as villages bylanes fill with neighborhood children singing carols, and older aunties busily carrying sweets to distribute to the neighbours.The Christmas feeling is particularly intense in the endlessly atmospheric old neighborhoods of Panjim, which together form what is often called the Latin Quarter. Here, the narrow alleyways lined with pastel-hued 19th century houses,become lit up with paper stars, their overhanging balconies festooned with ribbons and streamers. Take a walk any time during the festival season and you are sure to come across a family reunion spilling out of tiny, hidden courtyards, with at least one guitar-bearing troubadour in the mix.Midnight Mass at the Chapel Of St Sebastian in Goa.The best way to feel like a local in this outrageously picturesque tableau vivant is to join the fun on Christmas Eve, starting with prix-fixe dinner at the gorgeous little Venite Restaurant (reservations only) where you will jam into pocket-sized tables with a view, and feast on lobster and champagne, while being serenaded by a local trio. This is the platonic ideal of famiy Christmas dinner, with warm sentiments and bonhomie shared by a like-minded crew from all around the world.But then it is time for the main event in this still-Catholic and traditional neighborhood. Almost everyone at Venite troops out down the stairs, and heads straight down the street to the 19th century Chapel of St. Sebastian, where hundreds of chairs have been assembled in the street, so that appropriately dressed visitors and locals alike can experience Midnight Mass to celebrate the momentuous birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, over two thousand years ago.After a solemn, but uplifting service, the fun starts up all over again. Everyone embraces everyone else, and greetings in Portuguese, Konkani and English fill the night air. The proud owners of the houses lining this street set out tables, and serve everyone bracing coffee and rich plum cake. Christmas has come, and Goa rejoices.(By Vivek Menezes, writer-photographer and co-founder and curator of the Goa Arts and Literature festival)Spiritual Songs In Hindi And Sadri, Rose Cakes And Christmas PicnicsChristmas in Ghatsila, though a major festival, is a quiet affair, not at all ostentatious. In the Moubhandar area, in the township of the copper factory, where I grew up, there are two churches: St. Anthonys Catholic Church, and Grace Union Protestant church. During Christmas, both these churches are beautifully decorated with colourful lights, and Christmas songs in Sadri and Hindi are played. I remember one Hindi song, Paida hua hai taaranhaara / Dekho, charni mein leta hua (The Saviour is born / He is lying in the manger), and a Sadri song, Charni ka tara tim-tim-tim-tim chamkela (The star in the manger twinkles). For visitors used to hearing Christmas songs and carols in English, this might be quite an experience.The Bengali Methodist Church in Pakur, Jharkhand. (Photo courtesy: The Facebook Page of The Bengali Methodist Church)Christmas brings back memories of cakes, rose cakes, and arsa pitha. Most of the nurses in the hospital my mother worked at were Christian Adivasis. After returning from their respective churches on the morning of December 25, they sent us tiffin boxes full of Christmas goodies they had made in their houses. But if you dont have such friends to bring you Christmas goodies, the ICC Bakery, does quite well. This iconic shop is in Mosaboni, just opposite St. Barbara Catholic Church. The oldest bakery in Ghatsila, ICC Bakery has been around since I can remember. The cakes and baked items of ICC Bakery are famous, and, for Christmas, they prepare fruit cakes and plum cakes. On special order, they prepare other Christmas dishes as well.Christmas is a holiday for most people, so picnics are organised. The Subarnarekha river bank, Burudih Dam, Dharagiri Falls, Galudih barrage, Purnapani, and the Rankini Mandir in Jadugora are popular picnic spots around Ghatsila. Visitors might consider going for one too, to join in the mood of the day, as well as enjoy Ghatsilas scenic beauty.I now work in Pakur, and Christmas in Pakur is as quiet as in Ghatsila though the enthusiasm is remarkable and infectious. The Bengali Methodist Church  a huge and impressive building in red  and the Jidato Mission campus surrounding this church need to be seen. They are as beautiful as any tourist spot. Popular picnic spots and places worth visiting in and around Pakur include Sido-Kanhu Park, Dharni Pahar, Prakriti Vihar in Amrapara, St. Lukes Mission campus in Hiranpur, the hot water springs in Maheshpur, Motijharna Falls in Sahebganj, Massanjore Dam in Dumka, and the Hazaarduaari Palace in Murshidabad.(By Hansda Sowvendra Shekhar, writer)Women Selling Holly And Christmas Songs In Garo And KhasiYou know the yuletide spirit has hit Shillong when you come across women from surrounding villages selling holly in cane baskets in the busy Motphran intersection, located at the entrance of the towns biggest traditional market. Called soh krismas in the local jargon, little bunches of the red berries will find their way into households across town, as part of the Christmas decor.Christmas is the highlight of winter in Meghalaya, which is predominantly Christian, and the entire month of December is soaked in a festive fervour. This is a season when work takes a backseat and the schools and colleges are in the middle of a long winter break.The main intersection in Shillong, lit up for Christmas.The central retail district, Police Bazaar, is flooded with a sea of people as shopping frenzy reaches its peak, with everything from clothes to consumer electronics flying off the shelves. Be there to shop, or just to see the light and decorations at the main intersection nearby. As you walk through the quieter residential neighbourhoods, you will be greeted by Christmas star lamps glowing at the entrances of houses, while Christmas trees adorn the interiors.Family is at the core of Christmas in Shillong, and festivities are intimate in nature. Many families gather around a fire on Christmas Eve, and a large majority go to the churches for the Midnight Service, as Shillong ushers in the big day. A majority of those who study and work outside the state return home for the holidays, so Christmas is a reunion for many.Food is an important part of the celebrations, and traditional delicacies include doh jem (a meat preparation), putharo (steamed rice cakes), jadoh (a rice and meat preparation), and doh sniang nei-iong (a pork and sesame preparation). You can get these at restaurants serving the local cuisine, but of course, if you can make it to a home meal, then nothing like it. Garo specialities include pork dishes like wak pura, chambil wak, and khappa are popular during Christmas. Sakin gata is a sticky rice cake preparation, a local Garo dessert that people enjoy during the festival. Cakes are plentiful during this season, and you can expect a serving of plain and fruit cake with your tea almost everywhere.Carol singing is another annual tradition followed with gusto in the towns of Meghalaya. Khasi renditions of popular English Christmas songs and originals too, are sung and played everywhere. Many local artists appear on televised Christmas performances. The Nativity scene is recreated in mini-stages across Shillong, while shops are decorated with seasonal paraphernalia.The Garo Hills have their own distinctive ways of celebrating Christmas, and community dynamics are showcased to the fullest. Each village is tasked with making a phasa, a hut-type structure. This structure is the hub of festivities, where people of the community come to sing Christmas tunes in the Garo language, usually to the beat of traditional drums. Do visit one of these, if you are here for Christmas. The people of Garo Hills take their Christmas trees very seriously, and in 2003, a record-breaking 120-foot tall tree was installed in a Tura neighbourhood.(By Silvester Phanbuh, freelance writer)A Moms And Daughters Memories Of A Family ChristmasMy mom is German and that influenced my experiences of Christmas while growing up. For me, the first sign of the approaching festival was the Christmas cookies that my grandmother used to send from Germany, says 23-year-old Ayesha Kapur, best remembered as the child actor in the 2005 film Black. I grew up in Auroville, so my Christmas memories are more from there than from Puducherry. But when I would go to town, I would see Casablanca, a departmental store run by my mom, decked up for Christmas.When my kids were younger I used to throw Christmas parties for the children in Auroville, says her mother, Jacqueline. Most of Ayeshas memories of the festival are of celebrations at home. We had this tradition of my father reading the Christmas story to us on Christmas Eve, and we were allowed to open our presents only after that, she says. I would visit the antique shops in Puducherry for Christmas gifts for my parents. There are quite a few good ones, so visitors can check them out. Also, the bakery at Auroville or the local Aurovillian food manufacturers make great Christmas cake and an assortment of other cakes, she says. Her mother adds, Since Puducherry was a French colony, there is that influence. Most French restaurants serve some special food for Christmas. Also, one gets beautiful models representative of the Nativity outside the big church in Puducherry around this time.(As told to Poulomi Banerjee)A Carnival And The Burning Of Santa ClausChristmas in Kochi is unique because it coincides with the Cochin Carnival, which begins before Christmas and culminates in the New Year. Carol singing is popular and not just in the churches. Children go carol singing in the parishes. It starts before Christmas and continues up to New Years Eve. But now for the most startling custom. Most Indians would know of the North Indian custom of burning an effigy of Ravana on Dussehra. But in Kochi, they burn Santa Claus on New Years Eve. The custom is said to signify the burning of the old and the welcoming of the new. The Carnival organisers also burn a big Santa on the beach.For a bit of nostalgia, head to the Santa Cruz Cathedral Basilica for Midnight Mass. The service here has an Indo-European feel to it. Another church where you can go for a feel of history is the St Francis Church, where the remains of Portuguese explorer Vasco Da Gama were once buried. Try to get an invitation to a family Christmas breakfast. It consists of traditional beef stew, eaten with bread or appam. The head of the family serves the stew, and everyone eats together. Most families also brew wine for Christmas, and some make extra to sell.Eating Yellow Rice And Ball Curry And Dancing To Country MusicIn Bilaspur, till the last generation, every Anglo-Indian family had some railways connection, says Andrew Clive Macfarland, secretary of the Anglo Indian Association of Bilaspur. The scenario is hardly surprising when one looks back at the number of Anglo-Indians who used to be employed in the Indian railways across the country. Thats how the old institute  or club  at Bilaspur used to be run by the Anglo-Indian Association.The old Institute in Bilaspur.It had a dance hall, facility to play billiards and snooker, and housie and cards. There were grand Christmas and New Year celebrations, says Macfarland. But some years back the Institute was taken over by the railways as office space, claims Macfarland.The Association though, continues to organise a Christmas Ball. The music is still the same  Jim Reeves and country songs  and the ladies come in dresses. The food includes old Anglo-Indian favourites such as mulligatawny soup, yellow rice and ball curry, says Macfarland. Remember the scene from the hit 1975 film Julie, where the male protagonist meets Julie at one such party at a railway colony club? This Christmas drop into an old railway colony like Bilaspur for a rewind party. You need an Anglo-Indian member to get you in though, at the nominal charge of 400.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Singing In The Lords PraiseIf you have been to any Church in India around Christmas, chances are that you would have heard choirs singing a few songs in praise of the Lord in some regional language.While for most people in India, Christmas music continues to be Silent Night, Jingle Bells and Marys Boy Child, what of those songs that we sometimes hear, but know little about? From what I have heard, most of the Indian Christmas songs are copies of the Western classics. But I would say there is very little of even that, says Neil Nongkynrih, who founded the critically acclaimed Shillong Chamber Choir in 2001.A concert of the Shillong Chamber Choir. (Photo courtesy: The Shillong Chamber Choir)The Choirs Christmas album, released in 2011, was a bestseller. But Nongkynrih says that they had stuck to the traditional carols  Rudolf, O Little Town of Bethlem, Marys Boy ChildIn churches in India that I have been to, I have heard spiritual music in the regional languages, but not Christmas songs, he repeats.Even abroad, he says, Christmas music continues to be traditional. There is a market. If some composer was to record a new album, it would probably sell. But few try. We hear the same traditional songs, he says, adding, one reason for this can be that Christmas celebrations are all about keeping up the traditions. And because it is a once-in-a-year occasion, we dont mind hearing the same songs again and again.In India, he says, some of the best Church choirs he has heard are of the Mizos and the Nagas. There is a strong Church culture in these places. The choir practises every Sunday, if not during the week too. So they are very good, he says.(By Poulomi Banerjee)Food For Celebration: The Christmas meal in India often includes local dishes and family specialities.

We have been receiving around 150-200 tonne of shallot onions for the past few days. This scenario is in contrast to the 50 tonne during November. So wholesalers have reduced prices sharply, said A Thangaraj, a wholesaler and the secretary of the Tiruchy district Shallot Commission Wholesalers Association.From the inputs, only 10 per cent is being distributed for the local trade in Tiruchy and the rest is exported. We are exporting a minimum of 30 tonne to Kerala, 40 tonne to Sri Lanka and 70 tonne to other districts such as Thanjavur, Pudukkottai and Nagapattinam, added Thangaraj.Shallot onions, otherwise known as small onions or sambar onions, saw a sharp price rise in the first week of November. First-grade shallot onion cost Rs 180 at retail outlets. Demand was attributed to the dip in procurement. More farmers in the shallot belt chose to re-cultivate their outputs as investment inputs in their own fields rather than sending shallots for procurement.To increase inputs, wholesalers started to employ more agents in villages in districts such as Perambalur and Tiruchy. Perambalur has a bulk share of 24 per cent of overall production of shallots in the State with at least 8,000 hectares under cultivation. In Perambalur district, shallots are mainly cultivated in Chettikulam, Irur and Echankadu in Kunnam taluk. They are also cultivated in Alathur, Nakkasalem, Padalur and Nattarmangalam in Alathur taluk and Chatthiramanai, Pommanapadi and Ammapalayam in Perambalur taluk.In Tiruchy district, shallots are cultivated in Thuraiyur, Marungapuri and Mannachanallur. Through the agents, wholesalers were able to convince farmers with an eight per cent commission, three per cent more than what wholesalers pay traders, who acted as middlemen.Shallot procurement mainly used to take place at the Shallot Trade Complex in Chettikulam in Perambalur district, which has an auction centre and storage godown. However, many farmers have begun to lose faith in the facility. Thus agents began to unload more shallots in the weeks that followed the November hike. Our fellow farmers in Perambalur do not mind trading with wholesalers in Tiruchy as it is more profitable for a fresh harvest. Their stocks also do not need to rot in the cold storage and refrigeration in the Shallot Trade Complex, said R Raja Chidambaram, State secretary, Tamil Nadu Vivasayigal SangamOur sales of shallot onions were down by 33 per cent as many of my consumers started opting for large onions, which were three times cheaper than shallots, said C Muhammad Eliyas, a vegetable shop retail seller.We are expecting another Rs 10 dip in all grades before Pongal, said Thangaraj.Agents at work to bring more produce to marketTo increase inputs, wholesale merchants started to employ agents in villages in districts such as Perambalur and Tiruchy.

(Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty) Each day in my school began with a prarthana sabha (prayer meeting) on the playground during which we stood in rows while a small group of teachers and students led us in singing Vande Mataram. (Express Photo by Amit Chakravarty)During the 1950s, when I was getting educated in a government-run, Hindi-medium vidyalaya in a small town of Madhya Pradesh, India had Congress governments in the centre as well as in most states. The BJP was then on the fringes, known as Jan Sangh, trying to make some headway in the so-called cow-belt of Hindi-speaking states.Each day in my school began with a prarthana sabha (prayer meeting) on the playground during which we stood in rows while a small group of teachers and students led us in singing Vande Mataram. It was the same in the girls schools where my three sisters studied. Those were the days when owning a radio set gave a family middleclass status. My family didnt own one so me and sisters got our share of film music from the radios plying film songs in full volume in some of the upmarket tea shops which we passed by on way to or return from school. We strained hard to memorize the words so that we could then amuse ourselves by singing those songs at home. Since we sang the two stanzas of Vande Mataram in the school daily, it was a song that sprung to our lips most often. We sang it with the gay abandon of children at play, with no care for what it meant or symbolized. There was also Jana Mana Gana, but it was played only at the end of school functions. At our single digit ages at that time, Jana Mana Gana was to us a signal which marked the end of all festivities.Being raised in a orthodox Muslim family, we were made to offer the full Namaaz on a regular basis, recite the Koran as often as we could, and were told that soon we should start fasting during Ramzan. But such deep commitment to Islam didnt stop our family from getting close to Mishrajis family, as any two families can.The house of the Mishras was conjoined with our house, with a common verandah. Whereas my parants were in their late thirties, Mrs and Mr Mishra were in their twenties, having married recently. They were not only pure vegetarians, but didnt even eat onion and garlic. While we offered morning namaaz, we could hear a steady drone of Sanskrit words as Mishra did his morning pooja. After breakfast Mishra would come to our part of the house seeking the blessings of my father, whom he called Bhai Saheb, and they would go off to work. Mrs Mishra, whom my parents called bahu  a term for younger brothers wife  would finish her cooking and come over to spend the day with my mother till her husband returned from work.For any food to be served to the Mishras, my mother brought over their utensils and cooked in them because the utensils of our house, in which non-veg had been cooked, would not be appropriate. My siblings and I had no such restrictions so we helped ourselves liberally with the snacks Mrs Mishra used to make.In due season the Mishras were blessed with a baby boy. He became the centre of attention of both the families. He frolicked, napped, and pee-d with as much ease in my mothers lap as he did in his own mothers lap. The Mishras were forever asking my parents to bless their son, appearing certain that my parants aasheerwaad would do him good. Not that the Abbasis and the Mishras were exceptions at the time. Everywhere around us there was similar bonding and sharing. In our town, and wherever else we went.More than 60 years have rolled by. The India of my childhood was a poor country, which had been looted by the British so comprehensively that it had been transformed into something that was portrayed by western cartoonists as an emaciated half-naked man in a torn dhoti stretching his hand with a bagging bowl. The India of the present is a massive market for luxury cars, designer goods, cosmetics and many other non-essential playthings of the rich and the wealthy. By the paradigm of development set by the World Bank, India is doing great things on the development front. At least bits and pieces of India have become the land of riches as most of India used to be before the advent of the British.But there is also an India emerging that never was. An India which wants to practice a certain form of a religion, follow a certain unsubstantiated interpretation of history, and treat everyone outside its ad-hoc definition of legitimacy as a subversive. Sometimes, here and there in the same India, Mishras and Abbasis still live together the way they used to in the 1950s, but they are rapidly losing their old spontaneity and innocence.For someone like me whose childhood was inseparable from Vande Mataram, the mere mention of it now causes unease. If I dont sing it, some fellow countryman will brand me a gaddar. If I sing it, some others will call me Uncle Tom. Foregoing lucrative jobs abroad and trading it with much lesser pay and much greater hardships, solely for the pride and satisfaction of serving India, is no longer any evidence of my loyalty to India. I could as well have migrated to the US after completing my education at IIT Bombay, 41 years ago, served my American masters and lived luxuriously on their dollars.In fact, I probably would have been deemed a true patriot today if I had posted a video of myself on Youtube, showing myself singing Vande Mataram, while partaking the pleasures of some foreign land.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

CM Manohar Lal Khattar unveiled the scheme  which will be initially extended to famers growing potato, onion, tomato and cauliflower  in Karnal.Haryana director general of horticulture Arjun Saini said the schemes aim was to help farmers in distress and ensure they recover input costs. For example, if a farmer has spent Rs 400 on producing 100kg potato, he is free to sell it at any price to reap profits. However, if he fails to recover his input cost due to drop in rates, the department will compensate for the difference, he added.Saini said the cost of horticulture produce would be determined by experts from the Haryana Agriculture University, department of horticulture and Kisan Ayog. It is different from minimum support price (MSP). With this, distressed farmers growing vegetables in Haryana will no more have to throw their produce on roads in the event of a crash in prices. The idea is to encourage them to resort to diversification of crops, he said.The department clarified that farmers would be compensated only if they registered themselves on the portal and the produce was sold through the market committees using J-forms. A separate fund would be constituted by the state government for the scheme.Speaking at the inauguration of scheme, Khattar said compensation at the rate of Rs 400 per quintal would be given for tomato and potato, and the amount would be Rs 500 per quintal for onion and cauliflower.Terming the scheme as a big sham and a huge fraud on the farmers of the state, Haryana Congress legislature party leader Kiran Choudhry said the state government should fix MSP for vegetables and procure those if it was keen to help them.She added that the scheme seeking to offer input cost for four crops  potato, onion, cabbage and tomatofrom January onwards, consciously puts the cost of growing way below the cost price so that the government was not made to pay anything."
