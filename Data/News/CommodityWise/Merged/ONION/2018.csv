5aeb24a69855b7179ad71a77,World economy: Looking up,http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/no-proof-required-world-economy-looking-up-5006371/,2018-01-01,"The IMF forecast is for AE inflation rates to stay constant at around 1.6 per cent in 2018, before inching towards 2 per cent in 2022. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The IMF forecast is for AE inflation rates to stay constant at around 1.6 per cent in 2018, before inching towards 2 per cent in 2022. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The world economy had a very successful year in 2017. Just how successful can be gleaned from the fact that GDP growth (IMF data) registered close to 3.7 per cent in 2017. Unemployment rates in the advanced economies (AE) are at multi-year, if not historical, lows. What is surprising is that (median) inflation rates in AEs, while up from near-zero levels in 2015 and 2016 (0.3 and 0.8 per cent respectively) could only register 1.6 per cent in 2017.The IMF forecast is for AE inflation rates to stay constant at around 1.6 per cent in 2018, before inching towards 2 per cent in 2022.The emerging markets (non AEs) also had a banner year in 2017, registering a mean GDP growth rate of 4.4 per cent, up from the 4 per cent levels of the previous two years. Median inflation rates also stayed low, at 3.2 per cent in 2017, up from 2.3 per cent levels the previous two years. This rather laboured presentation of basic macro-economic data is for two reasons: One, to achieve some clarity on what has happened, and two, to provide some perspective on what lies ahead.Regarding the past  emerging markets contain 85 per cent of the worlds population and have grown faster than AEs by an average of 1.35 per cent per capita per year, and done so for the past 37 years. This means that average incomes in the emerging world have gained on average incomes in the West by around 65 per cent. Still, a long gap in average incomes remains, but the journey has well and truly started.These facts put into perspective some of the extraordinary claims being made about world inequality getting worse. To be sure, income inequality in the US is at its highest level ever  while global inequality (including the US) is at its lowest levels ever, or at least since 1870.What are the likely economic downsides in 2018, and beyond? If not inequality, it must be inflation that will rise phoenix-like, around the world, and especially in inflation-prone India. Even if inflation registers a high 4.5 per cent average in each of the remaining four months of this fiscal year (December 2017 through March 2018), the average fiscal year inflation in India will still register only 3.5 per cent, a full percentage point lower than the 4.5 per cent observed in 2016-17. More to the point  this 3.5 per cent will be the second-lowest inflation level recorded in India, ever (or since 1980). Lowest inflation rate: 3.4 per cent in 1999/2000, a year after the 13.3 per cent onion inflation of 1998/99. Unless inflation hawks can tell us exactly what they are eating, and digesting, inflation levels in India are unlikely to exceed the median rate in emerging economies by much in the foreseeable future. The IMF forecasts this median rate to fall towards 3 per cent by 2019. Which means that India is unlikely to see the average headline rate above 4 per cent in 2018/19.The IMF can be wrong about its inflation forecast. If they are wrong, my forecast will also be in jeopardy. But I am unlikely to be too far in error about the inflation spread between emerging markets and India. Many (make that most) Indian experts are visualising Indian CPI inflation registering at least 4.5 per cent for the foreseeable future (next couple of years).Indian GDP growth numbers for 2017/18 are not very flattering. We had (at least) two major economic reforms in the past year  demonetisation and the beginnings of the implementation of GST. It is likely that by mid-year next year, GST will be approaching the clean two-tier tax system that most of us, and India, wants. And if GDP growth rate begins to exceed 8 per cent, we will all conclude that the slow growth pain of 2017/18 of 6.7 per cent was a price worth paying. For the year gone by, GDP growth rate in emerging markets accelerated by 0.4 per cent (over 2016-17). In India, the likely outcome is that GDP growth would have decreased by a near similar magnitude. The next few months data are eagerly awaited.I want to close this futuristic assessment with comments on a few broad trends that are likely to emerge. Oil price increases, even if they occur, are unlikely to have much of an inflationary effect in most parts of the world. Median inflation rates in advanced economies declined from 2.7 per cent in 2000 (Brent at $28/barrel) to 2.2 per cent in 2007 (Brent at $72/barrel). Global growth is likely to approach 4 per cent in 2018, and if it does so, it will be near the top of its range for the last 42 years, barring the four go-go years, 2004-2007. At the same time, a drift in global growth towards 3.5 per cent cannot be ruled out.Regardless of how transparent and effective the US corporate tax cut is, one should not underestimate its significance for the rest of the world. Likely good news for India, as Modi-Jaitley are on record that reduction in corporate tax rates is a major policy goal.Throughout this article, I have assiduously avoided talking about employment. Job creation is not just an Indian problem, it is a worldwide phenomenon. Again, and not just to plug my book The New Wealth of Nations, one of the biggest developments in 2018 might be the beginning of a new (world) welfare order, a welfare order that emphasises work-related income support, and a guaranteed cash transfer (basic income) for the bottom quarter of the population. This, along with tax cuts, increased compliance and competition-induced low inflation, may provide the world with one of its best Goldilocks years.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

How else could one describe the allegations against Health Minister K K Shylaja. What did she do? Submitted some bills and claimed reimbursement she is entitled to. Look at the mud thrown at her for that. For ages kanji or rice porridge has been the staple diet of Malayalees and this is often suggested while under Ayurveda treatment. Critics with no heart have found fault for claiming the bill for kanji and certain other health supplements like onion vada and Gobi Manchurian.They hardly stopped at that. For they didnt even spare the Ministers late mother, blaming her for claiming reimbursement from a non-existent hospital and for declaring that her husband is her dependant. She has stated only plain facts in the declaration - that her husband is solely dependent on her and that he is unemployed. What do these critics know about medical expenses and how hard it is to meet them with the pension of a retired LP School headmaster.Voices are being raised against the Ministers husband seeking treatment from a five-star hospital and a specialty clinic for diabetes. How else does one sort out lifestyle diseases. As lifestyle changes, such diseases are but natural fallouts and one has to seek solutions from the best possible facilities. The government has made provisions for the Minister to claim reimbursement for herself and family. She has done just that, and only what former Chief Ministers and ministers have done. Isnt the deafening silence of the main Opposition party explanatory! BJP leaders like Kummanam Rajasekharan and K Surendran can cry hoarse for they havent had the chance to enjoy the pie yet!But Comrade Shylaja hasnt bothered to explain something. Isnt her act of sending family members to costly private facility a classic statement of the confidence she has in facilities run by the department she rules over? Or are government hospitals only for the poor KSRTC pensioners?Well, she can still justify herself. Unlike many senior Comrades, she didnt go to Russia, Germany or USA; rather chose to endorse the quality of treatment in Keralas private hospitals.If likes were votesGet ready for the magic! The social media accounts and pages of Left ministers are going to be flooded with likes. The directive has gone down from the chief of staff M V Jayarajan. For a change, staffers of all ministers have been asked to follow the footsteps of Finance Minister Thomas Isaac who has managed maximum likes. Even the Chief Minister, with his army of advisers of all sorts, comes only second. In a meeting of personal staff of ministers, Jayarajan came armed with a stat-book of likes, according to which Isaacs official Facebook page has over 6 lakh likes whereas the CM comes a close second with 5.97 lakh. A monitoring mechanism is also reportedly being set up to review action in the pages of ministers. Dont know whether instructions have been issued to transform likes to votes in the next elections!What a transformation for a party which went on the rampage in the AGs Office and Government Secretariat against computers!"
5b15bdea9855b75cf6a8b2bf,MP to give promotion benefit for retiring & retired staff,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/bhopal/mp-to-give-promotion-benefit-for-retiring-retired-staff/articleshow/62343829.cms,2018-01-03,"BHOPAL: Sensing the simmering resentment among a section of state government employees on the controversial issue of reservation in promotions, the Madhya Pradesh government on Tuesday announced to draft a separate policy to provide promotion benefits to its employees who have reached superannuation level or retired without promotion. For retired employees, the government may also consider changes in the pension policy.Chief minister reviewed and discussed the roadmap for 2018 in a specially called meeting on his arrival from four-day vacation. It was decided that government would form a policy for employees who retired from service without promotion, as the matter is pending with the court, state public relations minister Narottam Mishra told reporters in a press conference.Sources in secretariat said that reports from the employee unions have indicated that large number of employees were unhappy over the delay in their promotions.The government has taken no clear steps to justify the delay. In view of the assembly elections scheduled later this year, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan also fixed one year task for all ministers and bureaucrats and instructed review of each task on the 5th of every month. The ministers and heads of department will have to submit the progress report every first week of the month.Mishra said that the meeting also discussed issues related to farmers, women and disabled. It was decided that the implementation of welfare schemes must be ensured within the prescribed time period.By October 2, 2018, all the villages in the state would be declared open defecation free (ODF) and the government will also fill vacant posts of tehsildars and their deputies within given time period. The government plans to involve 50 lakh people in the mass plantation drive to be held on July 2, where a target to plant more than 8 crore saplings has been set, said Mishra.Highlighting the efforts made for Dalits and tribals, he said, the government would ensure direct payment of labour and forest produce to them. It was also decided that onion would be included in Bhawantar Bhugtan Yojana from the next season, he said.A decision was also taken to encourage the state government departments to go paperless and follow file tracking system. To encourage self-help groups undertake mining projects, the government will open 250 new mines in the current year."

The wholesale rate of tomato is around Rs 10/kg and its available at Rs 15-20 in retail market, Choithram Sabjimandi Kalyan Sangh secretary Nikhil Hardiya told TOI.He said that as crops supply is expected to reduce, tomatos rate is likely to go up in next month. Wholesale rate of potato is still below Rs 10/kg as good production of the crop and farmers disinterest to keep it in the cold-storage for longtime are stated to be the reasons behind the low-price.Potato is being sold at Rs 7-8 in Choithram wholesale vegetable market while the retail price hovers around Rs 15/kg, Aaloo Pyaaj Vyapari Sangh, Indore vice-president Vijay Garg told TOI.He said that a few weeks ago, potatos wholesale price had hit a new low of the season as the rate had gone down to Rs 1/kg.Quality of the crop, which was sold around Rs 1/kg, was however not as good as what is available in the market. Most of the potato crop, sold earlier, was deteriorating in the cold-storage and to avoid further loss, the farmers sold it at the minimum rate, Garg said.Wholesale rate of garlic has also witnessed a downtrend in recent past.Excess production of the crop is the main reason behind the reduced rate Garg said. Unlike these crops, the rate of another vital commodity i.e. onion has however witnessed a rise.Few weeks ago, the wholesale rate of onion was around Rs 25/kg while the retail price was between Rs 40-45. The crop is now being sold at Rs 30-35/kg in wholesale market while the retail rate is around Rs 50-60/kg Garg said."
5b1436259855b744d63890eb,World comes to Nizamuddin for his Urs,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/delhi/world-comes-to-nizamuddin-for-his-urs/articleshow/62386648.cms,2018-01-06,"NEW DELHI: Its that time of the year when the dargah of Sufi saint Nizamuddin Auliya gets the most footfall. On Thursday, the celebration of his 714th urs began with much fanfare.Sufis are not mourned; rather, their union with God is celebrated every year by their followers. Its the return of the lover to his source, a reunion with the Almighty thats an occasion of immense happiness, said Syed Kashif Ali Nizami, head of the dargah.Its said that Nizamuddin, the patron saint of Delhi, had willed that there should be sama (musical festivities) at his funeral procession. That tradition has continued for over 700 years now.Over 1.5 lakh visitors came for last years urs, reaffirming that the shrine is at the centre of the citys multicultural ethos. We might by living in troubled times, but the numbers are steadily rising, said Bilal Nizami, a duago (a person who holds prayers) at the shrine.Hindu yogi Sahil Nath, who says he has been attending the urs for several decades, agrees. People come here when hope escapes them. There is no distinction of religion. Only the heart should be pure. All religions teach the same thing, Nath said.Faquirs, qawwals from other Sufi dargahs from across the country attend the urs.Across the marble courtyard, hundreds of people sit under a shamiyana where qawwali troupes from other dargahs come to perform. But for most visitors, the shrine of Nizamuddin, also called Mehboob-e-Ilahi, is a symbol of the pluralistic and syncretic culture of Delhi.Nicolas, a Scandinavian visitor, said to him music represents Sufism.Sanjiv Rao from Malviya Nagar said that the shrine has given him many good, and at times miraculous, experiences. Having experienced it myself, I must have brought several hundred people here. It provides peace and fulfilment to all, Rao said.Author-historian Rana Safvi said the message of love, peace and compassion towards each other continues to bring people to the shrine. Even the meals served as langar here are without onion and garlic. We have always been open to everyone. In his time, Auliya would feed all the poor first and then take his meal. He stayed away from the rulers and was a pro-poor egalitarian figure loved by the masses, said Nizami.The five-day urs would continue till late night on Sunday. Qawwalis have been starting at 6.30pm and lasting till 10pm. But since Saturday would be bada kulthe big day when Nizamuddin actually left this worldqawwalis would continue till 3am."

This debris is dangerous too, as it comprises concrete, stones, bricks sand, and even shards of glass and other, potentially injury-causing substances.A walk in the area reveals a long list of disposables scattered all over the vacant land, which has thick shrub growth. The garbage contains packets of cigarettes, food packets, plastic waste, dry leaves, and paper littered by smallscale vendors that line the pavement near the roundabout.May people working in Sector 32 converge to these makeshift, street-side shops in Sector 33 for lunch, and dump the disposable plates that come with the food in the open piece of land. We try and clean our own waste from the area. We are not responsible for this, said a food vendor, who did not wish to be name.Domestic waste and garbage from nearby sectors, including kitchen waste, vegetable residue, peels, and onion skins can also be seen in the area. The plot has an undulating appearance, with thick undergrowth stemming out in large clusters all around. Wood shavings , and other types of furniture waste have also been dumped in the plot by carpenters unwilling to locate a suitable dumping area nearby."
5b20d3999855b72f833e5b1a,Allahabad University Scientists Find 'Fisetin' Slows Down Brain Aging,https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/allahabad-university-scientists-find-fisetin-slows-down-brain-aging/story-9eSww9Cz84w4gDnnfwzYbM.html,2018-01-08,"A team of scientists at the Allahabad University has established that a natural compound called fisetin, found in strawberry, apple, onion and cucumber, can restore brain functions which deteriorate during aging.The findings of the team, led by Prof SI Rizvi from the department of biochemistry at AU, have been published in the latest issue of American research journal Life Sciences.Scientists acknowledge that oxidative stress is a major factor responsible for age-related changes in living organisms. Oxidative stress is the condition when the damage, due to the toxic form of oxygen molecules, exceeds the capacity of the body to repair such damage.It is a paradox that oxygen, which is essential for life, becomes the cause of aging, said Prof Rizvi.In human body, most of the oxygen is consumed by the brain. Therefore, it is the brain that becomes more vulnerable to oxidative stress. With increase in age, brain cells degenerate leading to diseases and loss of brain function, he said.Through experiments, the research team analysed a host of biomarkers of aging, including pro-oxidants, antioxidants, mitochondrial function, expression of genes, and apoptosis cell death.The results of the AU study conclude that fisetin can protect the brain from damage induced by aging.The study was carried out on rats of different ages and also on those which were chemically induced to age faster, said Prof Rizvi.Fisetin was given to rats of old age and the effect was compared with the younger ones. Fisetin-treated old rats were protected from brain damage.Among all anti-aging strategies being explored, caloric restriction is the most promising which, in common terms, can be defined as less food intake.Caloric restriction has been effectively tested in small organisms like fruit fly and earthworms. The strategy becomes difficult to implement in humans where several ethical issues are involved.Scientists have stumbled upon a class of compounds which mimic the effect of caloric restriction. With the use of these compounds, known as caloric restriction mimetics, the body feels like it is food restricted without the need of eating less.According to Prof Rizvi, fisetin works as a caloric restriction mimetic in showing its anti-aging effect on rats. Scientists are hopeful that compounds exhibiting caloric restriction mimetic effects will prove to be good anti-aging drugs, he said.Several experimental drugs are being tested in Prof Rizvis lab for possible anti-aging effects. Although an increase in human lifespan may not be possible, it may increase the health span, Prof Rizvi added."
5b2d9c4c9855b723c6f47498,Pazhankanji and Chayakkada are the new burger and cafe in Kerala,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kochi/pazhankanji-and-chayakkada-are-the-new-burger-and-cafe-in-kerala/articleshow/62403024.cms,2018-01-08,"There was a time when a restaurant meant something with a stylish sounding English name, with a menu full of variants of North Indian dishes or Chinese fried rice, noodles and chicken. Even the less fancy restaurants tried hard to make the ambience as posh as possible; the more western, the better was the mantra. Also, teens and 20-somethings preferred to be seen having pizzas and cold coffees, and naadan delicacies were restricted to toddy shops, which are not everyones cup of tea.Cut to 2018. Take a drive around Kochi or Thiruvananthapuram city and you can spot at least a dozen restaurants and coffee shops, nay, chayakkadas, where everything  from the restaurant name to the dishes to the dcor scream a combination of innovation, quirkiness and naadan like never before. Thaninaadan is even better than naadan is the USP, and the dishes offered would perhaps be the best and healthiest picks from the kitchens of mothers and grandmothers from across Kerala. And gorging on the kanjis, pothichorus and chutta meens (fried fish) would be the selfie generation in their 20s and 30s. We explore this new food culture which has been sweeping across Kerala:As far as the youth now are concerned, the priorities are taste, health and the ambience, apparently. Dishes like kanji and kappa were traditionally considered poor mans fare, but when offered in a funky setting with tasty accompaniments, sell like hotcakes.Idli is served with non-veg curries while there are exclusive outlets like Dhe Puttu which offer innovative puttu varieties. At Pappadavada , pazhankanji is served in a chatti, with kappa, pickle, chammanthi pulisserry, curd, onion and chilly with fish curry. Minu Pauline, who runs the hotel, says, College students arrive in groups to have pazhankanji. At times, families come in to give their children a taste of pazhankanji while those older happily have it daily. This extends to desserts as well, where ilayada, kozhukkatta and even kinnathappam have replaced ice cream and pastry in these food joints.At Cinema Caf, Kacheripady, visitors sit in a world of Malayalam cinema, literally, while they munch on aval (beaten rice) or sip guava juice. Old and rare film songs play in the background while old and new film posters fill the walls and tables. People come here to get a feel of home, says its founder Nandakumar. My family members prepare the food and so half are daily customers, who know this kind of food wont harm their stomach. Malayalam film lovers get the best of both  homely food and cinema.Anoop Anthony of Njettila Vattayila , renowned for its pazhampori-beef curry combo, agrees. Youngsters today care for the ambience along with the food. Selfie spots are in plenty here. We have also printed age-old Malayalam proverbs on table tops, many of which are new to the youngsters. They lap them all up.Foodie Jay Menon attributes it to the new food culture in the State, where people are willing to travel even long distances for good food. I come down from Mumbai every month to have beef fry in Kerala. Also, people just got tired of the same kind of tastes. The freshness and variety of naadan is lacking in fast food.Not many knew about dishes like maniputtu or Ravuthar biryani, both made exclusively in Muslim houses, until they made an entry into the naadan restaurants. There are umpteen such dishes. We have a dish called kozhi kidathi porichathu which is actually my mother-in-laws recipe. We also have kanalil chutta kozhi which is chicken cooked on charcoal, says Nidheesh, founder of Arippa.Malabari dishes, once the monopoly of Kozhikode restaurants, have made a steady inflow into the rest of Kerala with the naadan restaurants re-introducing them with idiosyncratic names like veerappan chicken fry and thinnal thoofanakunna chicken fry, both specialties of Adaminte Chayakkada There are students and youngsters who eat out almost every day, and for how long can they have greasy food? We have daily customers for pazhankanji, who come in around 10 am and order it. It keeps them energised and hydrated for the entire day. All our traditional dishes suit our climate actually, says Minu.The same is the case with Aavi, where youngsters and even celebrities are the takers for kanji, says Ranjith Menon, its general manager. Everything is cooked in steam here and people seek them out. For lunch too, our pothichoru, which has fish fry, thoran, omelette, chammanthi and rice packed in a vazhayila (banana leaf), gets sold out by 1.15 pm, he says.Nidheesh attributes the new-found love for homemade food to a basic fact  we cant be bothered to cook elaborately anymore. Think of something like appam and meen molee or kappa and meenkari. Sure, they were daily fare for our grandmothers, but who makes them at home anymore? he asks.Since cooking at home daily is not an option, restaurants are becoming a necessity, says Devan, a Kochiite and foodie. We seek out restaurants which offer home-cooked food. Many of these new joints like Binnammas are run by a family, who cook the food themselves and thats why we opt for such places, he says."
5b2d9ad19855b723c6f47436,A school that actively sows green thoughts among students,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/trichy/a-school-that-actively-sows-green-thoughts-among-students/articleshow/62407297.cms,2018-01-08,"TRICHY: Sowing green thoughts among children, a panchayat union middle school (PUMS) in Kothavasal, Perambalur, has been quietly raising vegetable crops on their campus. Maintained jointly by teachers and students from classes VI to VIII, without affecting their classroom sessions, around 50-60 kg of vegetables of nine plant varieties are harvested at the school every week and supplied to the school kitchen for the noon meal scheme.The school has classes for standards I to VIII and a student strength of 140, of which classes up to standard IV are taught both English and in Tamil medium. Vegetable cultivation being done on about 0.25 acres within the school campus.Started in September 2016 with the personal interest of 42-year-old teacher S Elavalagan and subsequent cooperation from fellow staff, the green project expanded the acreage of horticulture crops from just 5 cents to 0.25 acres. Teachers along with the students would engage in vegetable plantation and also in maintaining existing plants. It is the self-interest of 57 students studying from classes VI to VIII that allowed the acreage of horticulture crops to expand. Parents are also supportive in the move as they willingly send their wards to school even on Sundays, S Elavalagan told TOI.With seeds obtained at free of cost from Indian Institute of Horticulture Research, Bengaluru, through good Samaritans , the school has planted about 18 vegetable varieties of which nine varieties render substantial yield on daily and weekly basis.Belonging to the small onion belt of Tamil Nadu , the school last week cultivated small onions within their campus and new vegetable breeds such as carrots, beetroot, cauliflower and cabbage. For the last one year we have been cultivating and harvesting tomato, ladies finger, bitter gourd, snake gourd and broad beans. Most of the yield will go to the school kitchen for preparing noon meals for the children and the surplus, on rotational basis, would be provided free of cost to the families of students who actively maintain the crops, Elavalagan added.The school with as many as seven teachers including the headmaster perhaps could have made revenue by selling the surplus vegetables to the shops, but instead preferred to plant green thoughts among students by giving harvested vegetables to students as a pat on their backs.M Guru, a class VII student, said that the green activity in school has motivated him to pursue farming in future and said that his parents were happy about their ward spending quality time in farming. My father migrated from agriculture even though my grandfather was a farmer. Completing my studies, I will certainly take up farming since it has become my passion, said Guru, spotted watering the vegetable plants on the school campus on Sunday.Another student of the school, R Kalaiselvan said that he feels relaxed while watering the plants rather than playing cricket with his friends. On an average, each week, at least 5-10 children are taking home surplus vegetable for which feedback from their houses is positive as the vegetables are grown organically."
5b142c289855b744d6388b8f,In an organic fashion...,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/in-an-organic-fashion/article22408611.ece,2018-01-10,"For someone who embraced ikat when Indian fashion was yet to find its feet, Madhu Jain has always been looking ahead of her times  first in 1980s when only a handful of designers would rummage for raw materials in the labyrinthine bylanes of the Walled City to now when designers have no compunction of procuring imported fabrics, accessories to economise cost of their outfits.As a precocious child, Madhu was quick to appreciate the aesthetic eyes of her father, who liked dressing up in his best bib and tucker and lived in regal style in posh Aurangzeb Road. Madhu meticulously studied everything  be it dcor, lifestyle, cuisine and heritage. Years later, that would reflect on her sartorial choices.She loves figurative work of Thai ikat and that translates into her food as well. As we meet at Zing, the Asian restaurant of The Metropolitan Hotel and Spa, she observes the large vegetarian spread aesthetically. After settling down, the food connoisseur in her comes alive as she inquires about erstwhile Siams Pamelo salad and raw papaya.Madhus dietary influence has come from Rajeshwari Devi, her mother, who hailed from a traditional Jain family of Kucha Bulaki Begum in Old Delhi. At home, mother would cook onion and garlic-free food which was so sumptuous. At school in Delhi, I would take tiffin in which she packed me lip smacking chana and puri. Surprisingly, she was enlisted as a non vegetarian at Welham Girls School in Dehradun. But, right from day one, I was adamant to stick to my vegetarian palate.B.D. Meattle, her father, was fond of fashionable clothes. And would gift floral French chiffon saris to her mother. She wore it with pearls. His aesthetics could be seen in Belgian chandeliers, Persian carpets at our home. The Walled City continues to be her favourite haunt for street food.  Jo khatir nawazi wahan hoti hai, kahin nahi hoti . At my nanis house in Old Delhi, khumchewalas would send banana leaves filled with kulfi, kulle, a fast disappearing edible, from which sweet potatoes and other veggies would be scooped out.Foraying into fashionHaving taken the bold decision of working on the ancient weaving technique of ikat even though she was a student of Economics, Madhu was not perturbed by the fact that Indians then had virtually no exposure to couture.I was lucky to be around the same time as Rohit Khosla. Those days camaraderie existed between designers. Today, it is rare to find two designers on the same page, she says, while sipping her hot and sour soup.Shehas remained loyal to the indigenous handmade crafts and textiles. Foreign buyers have a lot of respect for our handmade clothes but the problem is that only a few designers are presenting Indian art and craft in their totality abroad. Like when I took Kashmiri handicrafts to the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the Americans were in awe of it. There needs to be responsible fashion and the idea of giving back to society should be pursued. That is what I believe in and follow.She is worried that blatant commercialisation by designers these days is making a dent in Indias image overseas. She laments that the finesse with which she did her crafts no longer exists now. Now it has become too commercialised, she gripes, while sipping her soup.Like she zeroed in on Kalamkari, which gave her a chance to express her creativity, one asks. It also created multiple jobs. How many designers have worked on it? We used it for the opening ceremony of the Commonwealth Games. That is when it took off, she says.Sustainability factorThe conversation shifts to how imported fabrics have penetrated across the nation and are threatening to ruin livelihood of artisans. Tamil Nadu is famous for its kanjeeverams which is staple for weavers there. However, there is influx of kanjeeverams from China at one third the price. It has become a huge issue. What is going to happen to weavers of the State?While polishing off Pamelo salad, Madhu feels the solution lies in designers following the path of ethical fashion. Indian fashion designers need to work on this. They should not alter the geographical craft index. There need to be ethics in fashion. There has to be credibility on what we showcase on the ramp. If designers are trying to work with traditional crafts, then economics is a consideration but that doesnt mean that theyforget about backward linkages.She further says that designers need to understand how much damage powerlooms are doing to handlooms. .Everybody is falling in line due to the push given by the powers that be. Our history informs us that crafts have always been protected by rulers. All it needs now is right positioning. The government has to step in to protect our identity, suggests Madhu, a strong proponent of the governments Made In India scheme.In 2018, Madhu forecasts that alternative fabrics, anti-fit silhouettes would be worn by fashionistas. We will have more eco-friendly textiles and practical silhouettes based on comfort. This is where the Ministry has to play a bigger role and I am glad that Smriti Irani is open to new ideas.As far as story of sustainability goes, Madhu is a cut above the rest of her fraternity. And this could be seen from the special award conferred on her by the FICCI.Explaining how she seeks to take the sustainability story forward, Madhu asserts that she is the first designer in the world to come up with bamboo silk ikat. Not even in the North East there is any designer who has converted bamboo, which is found in abundance into textiles. This is my gift to our industry.Sipping fresh orange juice, Madhu opens up about the secret of hard bamboo from which furniture and upholstery is made in the North East.It doesnt require much water. It doesnt take away earths resources. This is textile for the future and is completely organic. One does not require fertilizers for its growth.There need to be ethics in fashion. There has to be credibility on what we showcase on the ramp."

But four farmers from the drought-prone Govindapuram successfully utilised this method in their paddy fields, said B J Pandian, director, Water Technology Centre, Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.With 5-6mm average rainfall annually, Govindapuram was one of the drought-affected areas in the district. Since it was located at the tail end of Amaravathi river irrigation scheme, it hardly receives surface irrigation facility, Pandian said.Hence, the four utilised the available water to the maximum effect with the help of drip irrigation. They cultivate three crops a year. They take up onion cultivation in April-May, paddy in November-February and maize in between the two crops, he added.They had been effectively utilising the drip irrigation for rice for the past two year. And with this, they could conserve 30% of water. The drip irrigation consumes only 750mm-800mm water (for 110 days) against the average surface water consumption of 1,250mm. Even the yield could be enhanced from five tonnes per hectare to six tonnes.While many farmers are struggling to cultivate two crops effectively in water-rich regions, the farmers in Govindapuram have succeeded in cultivating three crops with drip irrigation, Pandian said lauding them."

Some of them were using high-water intensive vegetables as an intercrop. The vegetables being grown by the farmers are cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, onion and radish.Commissioner of Horticulture, AP, Chiranjiv Choudhary went round the fields and interacted with the farmers along with Leaf (Lawrencedale Agro Processing India Pvt. Ltd.) CEO P. Vijayraghavan, horticulture officials and Leaf representatives.The wish list of the farmers include connecting to the big markets in Visakhapatnam and other parts of the country, supply of good quality seed and supply of motors for drawing of water from the nearby stream. The Commissioner wondered as to why the farmers were producing rice as it requires a lot of water. The farmers replied that they grow it in small quantities for local consumption only. They are getting around 40 bags on two acres of land.Some of the farmers have been receiving quality seeds and inputs on scientific farming methods for the past few months from the Ooty-based Leaf, an agri-value chain major. The soil quality is good and the tribal farmers are hard working, but the returns are meagre due to unscientific farming methods. The tribal farmers here are practising only organic farming and organic products are in high demand in the market, said an agro-scientist of Leaf.Later, the Commissioner visited another village and found that turmeric crop, grown on two stretches of land, in close proximity, were looking different.While the turmeric plants in one crop looked fresh with green leaves, the leaves of the plants on the other were dried up. The villagers explained that one was the traditional variety, which could be harvested once in two years, while the other was roma variety, which would be ready for harvested in nine months."

In Chennai, the price is ruling at Rs 45/kg, as per the official data. A similar trend prevails in small cities as well.""It is a temporary phase. Traders are taking advantage of the temporary ups and downs. But the fundamentals are strong,"" Agriculture Secretary S K Pattanayak told PTI.Though the onion crop is estimated to be slightly lower in the 2017-18 crop year (July-June) but the total production would be sufficient to meet the domestic requirement, he said.As per the Agriculture Ministry's data, the country's onion production is estimated to decline by 4.5 per cent to 21.4 million tonnes in the 2017-18 crop year due to lower acreage as against 22.4 million tonnes last year.Pattanayak said the prices of onion will get corrected with the increase in arrival of the crop in the coming days.Nasik-based National Horticultural Research And Development Foundation (NHRDF) acting Director P K Gupta said, ""The arrival of the Kharif onion is less at present and therefore prices are under pressure. The arrivals are expected to improve by end of the month and the prices will accordingly get corrected."" The kharif onion output is expected to be lower as acreage was down by 20-25 per cent because of less rains during the sowing period in key growing states Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, he said.Once the kharif arrival and later rabi onion crop hits the market, the retail price situation will automatically improve, he added."

What is surprising is that the consumers are not protesting when the Government machinery has failed to control the soaring price by cracking down on unscrupulous traders, general secretary of Odisha Byabasai Mahasangha Sudhakar Panda said. Since the Government is keeping a tab on the prices of essential commodities on daily basis, it is their look out to ensure that commodities are made available to the consumers at reasonable prices at retails points.The market intelligence wing of the Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare department has the responsibility to impose stock limits on onion and crack down on hoarding. But nothing is happening for obvious reasons, he rued.Ideally, onion should be sold at Rs 40 a kg in the retail market as a margin of Rs 5 per kg is enough for the retailers to make a good profit, said Shakti Shankar Mishra, seceratry of the Aeiginia Potato Merchants Association.The source price of onion, Nasik in Maharashtra being the major supplier of the vegetable, is ruling high due to shortfall in production in Andhra Pradesh and Karanatak, the two other States which also meet Odishas demand. The onion production has fallen short by 8 to 10 per cent due to unseasonal rains in major producing States including Karanataka and Andhra Pradesh. The production of the vegetable this year is about 22 million tonne as against 24 million tonne last year, Panda said adding, the prices will cool down after arrival of the new harvest.While the daily requirement of edible bulb in the State is about 1,500 tonnes, there is a short supply of about 200-300 tonnes. Bhubaneswar, one of the major mandis of the State, is getting a normal supply of about 150 tonne every day, Mishra said."

Whereas Malabar parotta from Kerala is the most well-known among these, there are other variants like kothu, veechu, lappa and Ceylon parottas which are in demand in these places. It is said that the parotta recipes of South India did not migrate from the northern part of the country, instead, it was the Sinhalese workers in the southern part of Tamil Nadu and Kerala who brought these recipes from the island. The Arab traders visiting the coastline also had a role to play in this.Each type of parotta has its own unique style of preparation. For example, for making Veechu Parotta, a popular dish from Madurai, the dough is spun in the air to make the parotta thinner. The thin layered bread is then folded and fried in oil. This dish is popular in Southern Tamil Nadu and gets its name from veesu, which in Tamil means tossing in the air. Ceylon Paratha is a two-layered parotta usually stuffed with vegetables or meat. The parottas is normally served with a gravy known as salna as well as onion raita.Kothu Parotta is a completely different dish altogether. Roasted parottas are chopped into small pieces and sauted on a tawa with masala, and other ingredients like onions, tomatoes, chillies, egg and even meat. Beachside shacks in Sri Lanka are known for the varieties of Kothu Parottas that they rustle up. Seeing the parotta being prepared in front of you and the sound of chopping and mixing itself makes you feel hungry.Lappa is typically made with an egg filling and is widely known as muttai lappa in parts of Tamil Nadu. After preparation, the parotta is again covered with another layer of egg batter, before folding into triangular or square shapes and fried. The recipe has influences of Arabic cuisine with strong similarities with muttabaq, a popular Arabic dish.Pondy Parottas, with two outlets at Madhura Nagar and Hi-Tec City, brings all these types of parottas to Hyderabad. As per Rajasubbaiah who owns this place, the kothu parotta here is prepared in the special Karaikal style, where the masala is cooked on the tawa folded inside the parotta and then chopped into pieces. For Lappa, the stuffing is uniformly spread on the parotta directly on the tawa. They have chicken, mutton and seafood versions of the parottas, as well as kalaki, an omelette type egg delicacy popular in Tamil Nadu.Sabyasachi is a food enthusiast and blogs at www.foodaholix.in"

Bee Basket, a start-up, is all set to promote the keeping of Trigona  a special type of stingless honeybee.Bee Basket, a Pune-based start-up that is working towards the promotion and conservation of honey bees, is planning to take the sting out of the bee. Amit Godse, founder of Bee Basket, is all set to promote the keeping of Trigona  a special type of honeybee that, he says, is stingless.An avid apiarist, Godse has been at the forefront of relocating hives in urban areas without exterminating the bees. Over the years, mass extinction of bees  the most important pollinator in nature  has become a major cause of concern for agriculture. Bees carry pollen from male flowers and deposit the same into the female flowers during the course of their feed. Pollination is a crucial step in the life cycle of seed formation. Dip in the population of bees, Godse said has posed a major challenge in fruit formation of crops like onion and for fruits like mango, pomegranate etc.In the urban areas, bee hives often come up in the ledges of homes or at multi storied buildings. Such hives, often cause more concern than joy for residents, who employ professional bee keepers to take down the hives. More often than not, the relocation of the hives lead to a complete destruction of the bees, as they are either killed or smoked out.Godse added that the idea of sting-less bee keeping in urban areas came to him to during the course of his work as a hive locator. Trigona, is the most common indigenous form of bee available in the country. Such bees normally hive at cracks of buildings or other dilapidated structures, he said. Such bees do not sting. They bite but that too rarely, he added. The best part about these bees, Godse said, was that they require almost no maintenance and do not migrate from their boxes.In a single box, about 10-15,000 bees can be accommodated, which can be kept for pollination in rooftop gardens, kitchen gardens or on ledges of balcony grills. Unlike other bees, which requires tending, these bees do not require any maintenance. Once in three or four months the boxes can be opened to check population, he said. The honey production of these bees, Godse said, was low but the honey they produce is supposed to have extensive medicinal properties.Bee Basket plans to start commercial operations by mid-February. Initially, the services would be to promote bee keeping as a hobby. Various training programmes are also being organised to raise awareness about the services. Godse also plans to start hire-a-pollinator services.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Dipping his feet in warm water after the daylong walk, he spoke to Suchandana Gupta on his spiritual circumambulation and meeting with rural folk. Excerpts:We have walked more than 1,900km. I had some kind of a vision after which I decided to take the Narmada Parikrama. It is not what you see, but the experience that is important. Narmada is the only river for which Parikrama is done. No other river has so many temples on its banks. It is also considered the oldest river in the country. According to our Puranik scriptures, one acquires the same punya by bathing in the Ganges as by the mere sight or darshan of the Narmada.Whatever experience I have had will be made public once I have completed the circumambulation. It is not to be revealed right now.I dont know if it will be turbulent. But maybe, it will have some political implications.Farmers are annoyed and unhappy that the government is no longer acquiring their produce on Minimum Support Price. The dues of acquisition of pulses have not been paid for a long time and the recently introduced Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana denied MSP, which they deserve. There is a lot of discontent over the way prices fluctuate and the way Bhavantar calculations are being made. Prices of soyabean went up after Bhavantar payments were stopped. Farmers feel betrayed that the government has not stood by them. The onion crisis was also the same  prices shot-up soon after the governments acquisition from farmers was over.Gujarat is different in different constituencies. I did not pay much attention to it though the situation there is as good or as bad as Madhya Pradesh. Rural Gujarat is, of course, worse than Madhya Pradesh.Well, if Congress plays its cards right, there is a fair probability that it will form the next state government in Madhya Pradesh.I will certainly contribute in whatever way I can. I will be active in bringing all the factions of the party together.I have seen massive machines being used to extract sand from the river, which is a violation of National Green Tribunals (NGT) order. Whenever we arrive at a village, the sand mining is immediately stopped. Two or three days after we leave, it resumes. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has been formulating new mining policies and promising that sand mining will be handed over to the village panchayats. But so far, no government order has been issued to that effect.I can tell you that standard of education still remains very poor. There is a huge difference between enrolment and attendance in government schools. Teacher absenteeism is a common phenomenon.It was a hype and facade that the BJP created. At that time, state government funds from the NDAs central taxes were a pittance. They gave us just about 28% of central taxes, which now is 42%. Because of increase in the central tax collection, devolution to the states has also increased. States now have more money for power and roads. Water was never a problem during my tenure.

None of the weighing scales of the 228 hawkers on the 114 boats is working properly. Since the boats are rocking at the slightest movement or the hint of a breeze, items are showing different weight readings within seconds. This has left the buyers and sellers a harassed lot.Funnily enough, no one had taken this unexpected problem into account when the market was inaugurated. The issue with the weights became apparent only on Thursday morning, when business at the market started in full earnest. As soon as the boats swayed a bit, the reading of the scales  both manual and electric  kept changing. The greater the weight of the goods being measured, the higher the difference in reading.A couple of physics professors we spoke to explained why this was happening. The mechanics of any weighing machine works on the laws of gravity and inertia. And the weighing machines need to be levelled properly on the surface where it is standing. Since a boats surface is never still, the machine is never at the same level, said a physics professor from St Xaviers College. When the boat is bobbing up, the weight shows greater than actual, and when the boat is pitching downwards, the weight shown is lower than what it should be.This mismatch in weights soon led to some dissatisfaction among the customers on Thursday morning, with some of them even refusing to buy the goods. The weight of goods Im paying for is not right. How can I buy anything? asked Samaresh Nath, a retired government official. Bapan Sardar, a potato and onion seller was bewildered with his malfunctioning electric weighing machines. He said, I never anticipated this would happen. Now I think I will have to buy a new machine.There are three probable solutions. The first would be to place the weighing machine on the axis of the boat. If you join two pointed ends of the boat with an imaginary line, that line would be the axis and its the most static position on the rolling boat, said a physics teacher. The second would be to tie the boat as tightly as possible to stop it from moving. The third would be to use a crane scale weighing machine, the kind used on big fishing boats. Those machines give a correct reading even on a moving boat."

Over the years, tricycles have rolled their small tyres into the transport arena and developed as one of the major means of logistics of goods and associated services in Madurai that has put restrictions on heavy trucks and mini trucks to use the city roads.Madurai, with major markets located within the city, has hundreds of trucks ferrying goods to and from the city. But the restrictions on trucks come in handy for the tricycles, which take the role of filling that last link of supply. They are the preferred mode of short distance transportation for traders as the men with the vehicle do the loading and unloading, which is included in the service.Goods like food grains, pulses, fruits, onion and infrastructure materials like steel and cement are being transported in tricycles, which can easily carry around half tonne, round the clock. They are spread across various pockets in the city, including congested commercial areas like Marret and Masi Streets. They transport 1,500 tonnes of goods on any given day.While over 10,000 tri-cycles were ruling the city roads a decade back, the emergence of mechanised mini load vehicles scaled the numbers down to 4,000 at present. However, their earnings are not affected much. We earn anywhere between Rs300 to Rs1,000 a day. If luck is on our side we can earn up to Rs2,000 on certain days, said K Muruganandam , a tricycle puller. Most of the men were from drought-prone Ramanathapuram and parts of Sivaganga districts, who had shifted to Madurai at least couple of decades ago. They mostly stay in congested places like Sellur, Avaniyapuram, Jaihindpuram and Perungudi.According to M S Murugan, AITUC Madurai district general secretary, the load men and the vehicles have evolved over the years. While those who have the education to apply for a driving license graduated into mini load vehicle drivers, the illiterate stuck to the physically demanding job. It is not an easy job for a novice to take it up on a fine morning and earn like the veterans. While most of the load men own a tri-cycle, which costs Rs18,000, some take it for a rent of Rs25 a day, he said.The wages are being fixed after talks with Madurai District Load Men, Van Auto and Unorganised Workers Welfare Association and Tamil Nadu Food Grains Merchant Association. Association secretary S V S S Velshankar says, We prefer tricycles for short trips, since the charge for motorised vehicle would be higher. Mini trucks are given a thought only if the distance is more than 15 km.President of Madurai Groceries and Retail Dealers Association G Palraj said that it is a crucial mode of transportation for grocery shops in the city, since most of them require only a few bags of stocks on day-to-day basis. The trucks are useful only if the goods weigh more than half tonne.Since the vehicles cause traffic congestion in the city, police banned tricycles 17 years ago. The load men protested, which led the police to change their stand and instead streamlined them, says Murugan. The tricycle pullers were issued licenses and specific parking places were allocated to them so that it did not affect the parking of other vehicles, he said."

Civil works to club the 500 shops on the ground floor into 250 shops are under way. Earlier, the traders were hesitant to move to the new facility citing inadequate space. Authorities said that they were expecting at least 100-150 traders initially to occupy the integrated market.The over century -old Gandhi Market, which is a commercial hub of at least 10 districts in the central zone, was expanded last during the pre-Independence era. Situated in the heart of the city, the market also happens to the epicentre of frequent traffic congestion. Earlier, to decongest the market, Trichy district administration, at an estimated cost of Rs65 crore, took up the construction of an integrated vegetable and fruit market on 9.7 acres on the city outskirts at Kallikudi in 2014. The works were apparently completed in mid-2017. Even though the facility was formally inaugurated last year, it was lying unoccupied owing to the resistance from traders in the existing market to shift their business. Authorities said that the agriculture marketing department recently obtained the administrative sanction form agriculture department to make the required structural modification in Kallikudi integrated vegetable market to address the demand of the traders for more space.""After completing the ongoing works, we would invite traders to occupy the facility. We expect 100-150 traders who are operating on rental space, will make use of the modified facility,"" an official source with agriculture marketing department said. Sources added that the structural modification works are expected to conclude in a month.Traders alleged that they were not consulted during the construction works of the integrated vegetable market complex. Stating that the whole episode, including expenditure incurred to modify the facility would have been avoided, if they were assured of adequate space in the new facility. ""We do not have any issues in moving to the new market. Our concern is that we need adequate facilities for shifting our base. Traders who are operating from rental shops in Gandhi Market may shift to the new place. It has also got practical difficulty, our sales and profit would remain intact only if all of us stay nearby,"" N Saravanan , secretary of Onion and Potato wholesale dealers association in Gandhi Market told TOI.It seems that even the traders do not have many options as the efforts made by the traders to construct their own market went in vain owing to the high cost of land in city. Authorities claimed that making a few wholesale traders to occupy the refurbished integrated vegetable market post completion of the works would invite other traders in Gandhi Market to shift to the new facility."

I did bump into Chef Alex Moser at some food do, but we never got to speak with him. Then, when a persistent young publicist invited me to try out the chefs fare, I agreed.The chef is at a restaurant called Hong Kong at Hotel Andaz Delhi  a concept by Hyatt, as it says  in Aerocity. I met the chef, discussed food, had a great Chinese meal and came home happily sated.Glitzy placeHong Kong is truly a glitzy place. The restaurant is huge, with a ground floor that seems specially designed for the young, and a first-floor area which is more suited to families and those who like to eat their food in peace. There is a king-sized bar, around which the young sat, drinks in hand, and not the least bit troubled by the loud music that was being played. I sat on the ground level, but wished it was better lit. I like to see what I eat.But what I ate was excellent. The food is essentially Cantonese which is not very hot, like, say Sichuan food. The dishes are light and flavoured with fresh herbs. And chef Moser tells me that his focus is always on fresh ingredients. He makes the most of what is seasonal, substituting some Chinese vegetables with Indian cousins freshly plucked from organic farms.We started with a warm roasted duck salad, with pomelo, pine nuts and shallots, which was very nice, indeed. Then there was some crunchy pickled radish with chilli and soya, and a dumpling with chicken  that was all right.Melt in the mouthWhat I loved was the crispy pork belly with a kasundi mustard sauce. The thick cubes of pork were crisp on the top, and incredibly soft below. I actually didnt have to chew it at all  it just vanished once I popped a piece into my mouth. And, of course, it went deliciously well with the mustard-kasundi sauce, the latter giving a somewhat bitter-and-sour flavour to it.Another dish that I really enjoyed was the Hong Kong style duck, served with a homemade barbecue sauce and mini baos. I took a bao, filled it with some of the roasted duck pieces, added the sauce and some greens, folded it, and took a nice juicy bite. It was delicious  the greens were crunchy, the duck was tender, and the sauce, piquant.The main meal consisted of a delightful wok-fried rice dish, and some free-range chicken, cooked with black bean, bell pepper and scallions. The rice was a mix of textures and flavours, for it had been cooked with three kinds of rice  red rice, bamboo rice and jasmine rice. The rice had been flavoured with preserved olive leaves, which gave it a tart flavour. Together, they did a neat number.The dessert consisted of an almond tapioca pudding (okay), passion fruit jelly (good) and bitter chocolate tart (very good).The chef likes to give a tweak to traditional Cantonese cuisine keeping regional produce in mind. And he adds a spice like onion seeds to his stir fried vegetables, to give it a little twist that is familiar  yet inspiring. And a lot of the taste in the dishes is linked to the fact that he doesnt use powders in his kitchen.It was a great meal, and I was happy to be able to catch up with the chef. I hope Ill get to see more of him this year."

PeriasamyM_PeriasamyThe State Government is expected to come up with a policy on tapping Neera and how to market it in an effort to double the income of farmers, said S.J. Chiru, Principal Secretary, Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business.Speaking at the inaugural of two-day Coconut Festival 2018, organised here by Confederation of Indian Industry (CII)- Coimbatore, he said that in tune with Niti Aayog and Central Governments reforms, Tamil Nadu has joined the National Agriculture Market. The State Government is in the process of formalising a separate processing policy. The Tamil Nadu Government managed 278 regulated markets but what they got was mostly copra, he added.Coir Board Chairman C.P. Radhakrishnan said the industry and farmers will benefit if the board related to coconut functioned as a combined unit.The Coir Board had been working on developing coir plywoods. It would soon replace other plywoods, as enough research had gone into it in the past two years. The Board recently managed to bag the E1 certification for export to the European Union and was in the process of getting the E0 certification for export to the United States market.Mr. Radhakrishnan said though value addition per coconut was low in India compared to the Philippines, Thailand and a few other South East Asian countries, the former had managed to double its export. Since his taking over, annual coir exports had gone up from Rs. 1,600 crore to Rs. 3,000 crore. He also appealed to the coconut farmers and entrepreneurs to make use of the various schemes offered by the Coir Board to set up coconut-based value added products. Tamil Nadu Agricultural University Vice Chancellor K. Ramasamy said though production of various agriculture crops had doubled in the State, the objective of doubling farmers income still remained unfulfilled.The Indian Institute of Food Processing Technology Director C. Anandharamakrishnan said the institution had taken up coconut as its crop for the year to develop various technologies for tapping and processing coconut. Last year it had taken up small onion and was able to make an impact, especially at a time when farmers faced fall in value.India was among the top three coconut producers in the world but the value it was able to extract per coconut was only around Rs. 30. Indonesia, the Philippines and a few other countries were able to extract up to Rs. 180 a nut because of going in for value added products, said P. Ravichandran, Chairman, CII, Tamil Nadu State Council. This showed that there was huge potential in taking up developing added products and generating employment as well, he added.If the full potential of coconut was exploited, it would be a business around Rs. 35,000 crore, said S. Senthilnathan, Convenor, Agri Business and Food Processing Panel, CII, Coimbatore Zone.S. Narayanan, Chairman, Coimbatore Zone welcomed the gathering."

Price of sambar onion has fallen from Rs 160/kg to Rs 35/kg since November, while the price of tomato reduced from Rs 20/kg to Rs 8/kg. Traders at the market said that the fall in price will persist for three more weeks till the second crop of the year comes along.Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association president M Thyagarajan , who is a tomato trader, said, Usually, we receive 400-450 loads of vegetables daily. But now we are getting nearly 550 loads. Yield from the first crop of the year (December  January) is usually the highest due to cold weather and availability of excess water. Price of vegetables is set to gradually rise with the arrival of the second crop from February 20.Water-rich vegetables like turnip (nookal), radish (mullangi), chayote (chow chow), beetroot, okra (vendakkai), snake gourd (pudalangai) and white pumpkin (poosanikkai) are now priced at Rs 5- Rs 10. Koyambedu vegetables, fruits and flowers traders welfare association treasurer P G M Sukumar said, Foreign (non-indigenous) vegetables like cabbage, carrot, and capsicum require a greater amount of water to grow as compared to the local varieties. Price of these vegetables has fallen thanks to an excess rainfall.According to traders, the first crop yield is 100kg per acre while second crop (February-March) yield is only 50kg/acre. The wholesale price of vegetables like nookal and mullangi was Rs 5, while their retail price was Rs 10 on Monday.The price of tomato fell gradually since November 2017. Sukumar said, In November, the price of tomato was Rs 20/kg. It fell to Rs 15 in early December and by the end of the month, it was Rs 10. Now the price is Rs 8. Only the price of drumstick (Rs 50- Rs 60/kg) has remained stable since November 2017."

Picture: Prem SinghNew Delhi, Feb. 1 (Agencies): The government will focus on strengthening agriculture and rural economy, finance minister Arun Jaitley said while presenting the Union budget for 2018-19 in Parliament on Thursday.For decades, the agricultural policy had been production centric, he said. We had sought to effect a paradigm shift, Jaitley said.Our emphasis is on generating higher income for farmers. We consider agriculture as an enterprise, and want to help the farmers produce more from the same land parcel at lesser cost and simultaneously realise higher prices for their produce, he said.To this end, one initiative will be a food processing thrust called Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to promote tomato, onion and potato cultivation and availability around the year.Operation Green shall promote farmer-producer organisations, agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional managements.I propose to allocate Rs 500 crore for this purpose, Jaitley said, pointing out that seasonal and regional production of these commodities make it difficult to connect farmers and consumers.Among other measures: Rs 10,000 crore corpus for animal husbandry infrastructure fund, and an aquaculture infrastructure fund. Kisan credit cards to be extended to animal husbandry and fisheries sector. National bamboo mission to be restructured, with outlay of Rs 1290 crore. Institutional credit to agriculture to be raised to Rs 11 lakh crore in 2018-19. 22,000 rural haats to be upgraded to grameen agricultural markets.

Retail onion prices in most major cities in India were hovering between Rs 40-50 per kg during the later part of 2017 as well as during the start of the new year.From Rs 3,150 per quintal at the start of the month, onion prices in Lasalgaon, Indias largest wholesale onion market, have come down by nearly 50 per cent to sell at Rs 1,650 per quintal on Wednesday.The steep fall in prices, which has affected farmers, is being blamed on the glut in the market from major onion producing centres as well as the $ 700 Minimum Export Price stipulated by the government which has made exports unviable.Retail onion prices in most major cities in India were hovering between Rs 40-50 per kg during the later part of 2017 as well as during the start of the new year. The government, in order to regulate the domestic market, decided to set up a Minimum Export Price of $ 850 per tonne to ensure that the bulk of the crop was diverted to the domestic market.However, with an increased supply in the domestic market, prices began to flounder. During the start of January, the modal price for onion in Lasalgaon was Rs 3,150 per quintal. It has since been on the decline and hit its lowest mark for the month on Wednesday.While this price is substantially higher than the Rs 600 per quintal witnessed during the same period last year, farmers had been complaining that the government was trying to regulate prices when they had a chance to earn money.Earlier this month, a delegation from the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) had met Minister for Marketing Subhash Deshmukh asking him to lobby with the centre for removal of MEP. Their contention was that the MEP, which is the benchmark price below which no shipments can take place, and is meant to increase domestic supplies, was making exports unviable and would pinch farmers as excess production of onion would hit the local markets this year.The Central government on January 10 brought down the MEP to $ 700. Farmers, however, continue to be angry.The government has moved in when it is our time to make some money, Keshav Kakad, an onion farmer from Niphad, said.Maharashtra, which contributes nearly 35 per cent of the total onion in the country, harvests onions thrice a year from October to May. The kharif and the late kharif crop called Pol and Rangda is harvested from December to March. However its yield and storage quality are not very good, forcing farmers to dispose the crop quickly, creating a huge glut in the market in January and February. The high-quality rabi product marked by a higher yield and longer storage capacity is harvested in April -May and can be sold at a relatively easy pace till October.Due to seasonal variation in production the months of October, November, December and January are known to be the time when onion prices reach a high, while in March, April, May and June, the prices dip. However, due to the recent climatic changes in Maharashtra, prices appear to have been thrown out of gear. The farmers and traders of Lasalgaon believe that the rule of free market should be applicable with demand and supply dynamics determining the prices of agricultural commodities.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5aeae8af9855b73f522c4a90,Budget 2018: Jaitley Promises Farmers 50% Returns over Cultivation Costs,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budget-2018-jaitley-promises-farmers-50-returns-over-cultivation-costs/story-C5oo7V5HT9c9vRjF5CrNlM.html,2018-02-02,"Kicking off with a burst of announcements for the farm sector, finance minister Arun Jaitley on Thursday said the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government would deliver on its promise of ensuring 50% returns for farmers, seeking to address rural angst due to collapsing prices.In his budget speech, Jaitley said federally determined minimum support prices (MSPs) for summer-sown (kharif) crops this year would be set at 1.5 times the cost of cultivation, which translates to 50% returns.This has been a key demand by protesting farmers in several agriculturally developed states, such as Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh.Jaitley surprised critics by declaring that his government had already adhered to this pricing benchmark for most crops in the ongoing rabi-sown (winter) season. He said this would be henceforth applied for the rest of crops. The government has decided to keep MSP for the all unannounced crops of kharif at least at one and half times of their production cost, he said.The finance minister did not announce any specific price-deficit payment scheme to compensate farmers directly for market losses when prices dip below MSPs, as was widely anticipated. Such a scheme is already being implemented in Madhya Pradesh. He, instead, said that Niti Ayog would soon come out with a foolproof mechanism on how to compensate farmers when prices crash.The budget announcement comes amid a rough patch in the agriculture sector, forecast to grow just 2.1% in 2017-18, as against 4.9% in the previous year. The announcement of 50% returns over costs set off a flurry of debate on the fine print, with farm leaders wondering which of the two measures of cultivation costs  the so-called C2 or A2 + FL  the government would adopt. Jaitley did not specify the measure that will be used.C2 is a more comprehensive measure of a farmers cultivation costs, which includes imputed rental value of land, depreciation and interests on capital. These are not part of the A2+FL, a narrower measure that includes input costs and imputed value of only family labour.The crux of the battle on prices boils down to the governments definition on cost of productionThe government seems to have chosen a lower cost measure so that it can declare that it is already providing cost + 50% in this rabi, said Kiran Vissa of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika, part of a platform of farmer organisations. He said when PM Narendra Modi had promised 50% returns in his election campaign, MSPs were already giving higher returns than under Modis tenure.In 2007, the MS Swaminathan Committee had recommended 50% returns for crops, which the BJPs 2014 poll manifesto adopted. In the para containing the specific recommendation, the Swaminathan report said MSP should be 50% over costs of cultivation, not specifying which measure. But in its annexure, the report used C2 costs to calculate net farmer returns.Economist Ashok Gulati told HT that for rabi crops, the MSP was closer towards 50% of costs. In wheat, it is in the region of 44%-45%, but in other crops it is just 20%-30%. The real challenge is for kharif crops. In paddy, MSPs and returns are not more than 10%-12%, he said. If the government actually sets MSPs at 1.5 times the C2 costs, then it would also mean a huge jump in the food subsidy bill and make Indias produce expensive in the exports market, he said.The budget announced a new scheme called Operation Greens to promote value addition for tomato, onion and potato. This would be similar to Operation Flood that revolutionsed the dairy sector, Jaitley said. Two funds to boost fisheries and animal husbandry were allotted Rs10,000.The budget also set a target of Rs11 lakh crore for agriculture credit in 2018-19, a 10% rise. Jaitley said 22,000 new and existing rural marketplaces would be developed to give farmers access to buyers. Tenant farmers would be made eligible for farm loans under a new policy, he said, adding a liberalised farm-exports regime was in the works. Various ministries will have Rs14.34 lakh crore in all to create rural jobs and infrastructure.With a view to boost food processing, which can improve commodity prices, allocation to the food processing ministry was being doubled from Rs715 crore in 2017-18 to Rs1,400 crore in 2018-19, Jaitley said."

At that time, it was reduced to 25 % for business houses having a turnover up to Rs 50 crore, benefiting the MSME sector.But in the union budget for 2018-19, the tax benefit has been extended to larger business units having an annual turnover up to Rs 250 crore.Vaish also said, It has been announced that bank loans to the MSMEs will be sanctioned online. Yet, the MSME sector is doubtful in view of the attitude of banks towards it.Moreover, the online systems are not reliable at present as is being experienced in the case of the GST, he said.Today, reports have come in from various chapters of the IIA that the online e-way bill system is not properly operational, he added.Vaish, however, said the decision to set up mega food park and provide incentives for the apparel and leather sector will give a boost to the MSME sector.Manmohan Agarwal, the IIA vice-president, said the emphasis on road and health infrastructure and improvement in the education system would indirectly help the MSME sector.CONSUMER DEMAND TO GET A BOOST: ASSOCHAM PRESIDENTSandeep Jajodia, the Assocham president, said the finance minister had placed much emphasis on agriculture and rural India, allocating bulk of resources to interior landscape, while helping the middle class salaried employees along with giving relief to senior citizens. These measures will boost consumer demand and help revive economic growth, he said.The budget is on expected lines and provides support to sections of the society where it was needed the most. The agriculture and rural landscape were in some kind of distress and provision of over Rs 14.34 lakh crore on rural infrastructure should also add to employment generation, especially in the farm sector, Jajodia added.Relief to salaried employees by way of Rs 40,000 per annum standard deduction in lieu of transport allowance and medical reimbursement will leave more disposable income in the hands of the middle class and boost consumer demand, he said.Initiatives like Operation Green to stabilise prices of onion and potato will help ease retail inflation and help the RBI in keeping interest rates on the lower side, Jajodia said.MANY MEASURES IN LINE WITH CII RECOMMENDATIONSChandrajit Banerjee, director general of the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII), said: Many of the measures in the budget are in line with the CIIs recommendations such as incentives for new jobs, extending fixed term employment, enhancing quality of education including teacher training and addressing healthcare access.Overall, this is a balanced and prudent budget that sets the foundation for future growth in the economy, he said."

The Economic Survey points out that farm income may decline by more than 4% in a year. Heavy rainfall reduces income by 13.7% and 5.5% for kharif and rabi crops respectively.The budget provides for greater use of clean and renewable energy sources but does not deal with the management of climate change in relation to farming. It is important to set up climate risk management R&D centres at the block level. Such centres should be supported by trained climate risk managers. Climate change could become a mega catastrophe and there is need for immediate steps both in the areas of mitigation and adaptation The budget has provisions which can insulate farmers from distress sale and poor income . The finance minister has announced minimum support price (MSP) for all unannounced crops of kharif at one-and-a-half times of their production cost. If income is less than the support price, the government has said that it will make efforts to buy the surplus produce of the farmers.More allocation will be made for building warehouses and for upgrading 22,000 rural haats into grameen agricultural markets. The budget sets apart 2,000 crore for an agricultural market and infrastructure fund. Several steps have been proposed for promoting sustainable agriculture such as organic farming. Horticulture will be promoted with greater attention to the marketing of tomato, potato and onion and similar perishable commodities through operation greens with 500 crore allocation.Another welcome feature is to integrate attention to fisheries and animal husbandry with kissan credit cards.The national bamboo mission will be restructured in order to enhance the cultivation and consumption of bamboo products. The emphasis placed on self help group formation, cooperatives and other organisational methods which can provide the power of scale to the small scale producers is welcome.The priority given to rural infrastructure and irrigation will help impart stability of income and employment. Malnutrition is another serious problem and we need to promote symbiotic linkages among agriculture, nutrition and health.On the whole, the budget addresses some of the hotspots in the field of farming, the most important being the management of the monsoon and the market."

He has made a budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme.'Operation Greens shall aim at promoting Farmer Producers Organizations (FPOs), agri-logistics, processing facilities and professional management.The announcement of this scheme comes at a time when onion farmers of Nashik, the largest onion growing district in the country, are at the receiving end as they are not getting the right prices for their produce in the market.The scheme, insisted experts and farmers, will go a long way in preventing financial losses to onion growers following crash in wholesale onion prices that they often have to cope up with.According National Horticulture Research & Development Foundation (NHRDF) sources, the average production cost for growing onions is around Rs 900 per quintal and farmers incur losses if they get the price below that.But there have been several occasions in the past when the wholesale onion prices had crashed increasing the woes of the onion farmers of the district. And they had restored to agitations by organising protests like road roko demanding redressal of their grievances.Some onion farmers still recalled the huge crash of onion about two years back forcing 1.94 lakh onion farmers of the district to sell around 28 lakh quintals of onions at Rs 300-400 per quintal in just two months in 2016. They incurred financial losses of Rs 150 cr during that time.A major onion grower of the district Nivrutti Nyaharkar said that for long the onion farmers of Nashik have been demanding a scheme like Operation Greens to tackle the problem of onion price volatility."

In Anna Karenina, only if a person is satisfied on all counts will she be happy. The allocations in the budget cover every sector, with umpteen implications, and no persons expectations can be fulfilled on all counts. While every expectation cant be met, it must be acknowledged that Finance Minister (FM) Arun Jaitley has presented a budget which focuses on rural India and is a great leap forward for the policy-battered farm sector. According to Article 112 of the Constitution, the Union Budget is simply a statement of the estimated receipts and expenditures of the government for a particular year.Rather than the budget being an annual jamboree for announcing policies, the prime minister should address the nation with his ideas for the coming year, based on which the FM should subsequently present the budget. The first step towards atonement and for penance is to acknowledge past failure. As the Economic Survey rightly states, real incomes of farmers have been stagnant. The next step is to take corrective measures and redeem the situation. An effort has been initiated in that direction in this budget.Assurance of purchase of all crops for which MSP is declared is a positive step. If the governments promise is of A2+50 per cent profit, then it is half-baked. It should have simultaneously announced acceptance of the Ramesh Chand Committees recommendations on the calculation of MSP, which it has not. The Niti Aayog is finally evolving into the credible policy think-tank we had been hoping for. It is also supposed to come out with a suitable mechanism to enable institutional credit access to lessee farmers.The Agri-Market Infrastructure Fund, with a corpus of Rs 2,000 crore, is to be set up for developing and upgrading agricultural marketing infrastructure in the 22,000 Gramin Agricultural Markets and 585 Agricultural Produce Market Committees (APMCs). This will enable farmers in remote locations who are devoid of any institutional mechanism to connect to markets. Operation Green on the lines of Operation Flood to tackle the volatility of tomato, onion and potato prices is a positive development. The long-standing demand of income tax exemption for farmer producer organisations has been fulfilled. A Rs 10,000 crore fund to finance the infrastructure requirements of fisheries, aquaculture and animal husbandry will generate rural employment and supplement farmer incomes.The intent to mitigate the air pollution woes of Delhi-NCR by subsidising the machinery required for in-situ management of crop residue has now been addressed. Targeted programmes like those under the Prime Minister Krishi Sinchai Yojna for 96 irrigation-deprived districts, where less than 30 per cent of the land holdings get assured irrigation, is the way forward. The focus on horticulture clusters and converting cattle dung and solid waste in farms to compost, fertiliser, biogas and bio-CNG is also commendable.Read | Budget 2018 explained: Arun Jaitleys budget has no creative incrementalism on showThe flagship National Health Protection Scheme to cover over 50 crore poor and vulnerable beneficiaries providing coverage upto Rs 5 lakh per family per year for hospitalisation is outstanding. But the fund allocation for the programme is insignificant. I wonder if it will suffer the fate of many of last years budget announcements which have not materialised due to lack of allocations. In Davos, there was a general scepticism regarding the data presented to project the Indian growth story. A similar apprehension persists regarding the fund allocations in this budget.Climate change worries have not been addressed as agriculture R&D has been ignored. Nor is there a mention of the balanced use of fertilisers. The magic-bullet demand for changing the Centre-state funding ratio from 60:40 to 90:10 for agriculture-related schemes has unfortunately been overlooked.A constant red thread running uniformly through the budgets of the past 10 years, presented by three finance ministers of India, is that farmer suicides have not abated. In the last three years, over 36,000 farmers have committed suicide.Power is the capacity to change the lives of people. The prime minister must direct his immense power to bring the sorry saga of farmer suicides to an end. Budget allocations serve as the perfect instrument to change the narrative of resentment to one of hope. He must quickly solve farmers crises or heed the warning, given in different circumstances, by Benjamin Franklin: We must all hang together or most assuredly we will all hang separately.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

MEP is the minimum price below which exporters cant export onions.The step would help in arresting crash in wholesale onion prices, which has a detrimental effect on the prices that farmers get from selling their product. The notification issued by the director general of foreign trade of Union ministry of commerce, Alok Vardhan Chaturvedi , said that MEP on all varieties of onions stands removed and can be exported without MEP.A copy of the notification is in possession of TOI. Experts said that removal of MEP is the first step towards tackling the volatility in onion prices.The Union government in its budget presented on Thursday had announced launching of Operation Greens scheme to address price fluctuations in onions, potato and tomato for benefit of farmers and consumers with budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore for the scheme for the fiscal 2018-19.For two years since December 24, 2015 there was no MEP of on onions.However Centre re-imposed MEP on onions on November 23 last year at USD 850 per tonne. Thereafter on January 19, Centre had also reduced the MEP on onions to USD 700 per tonne.The sources from the ministry of agriculture said, During the recent meeting with the officials from the ministry of commerce, it had already been decided to remove the MEP on onions if the average wholesale onion prices dropped below Rs 2,000 per quintal. Now, the average wholesale onion prices have already dropped to Rs 1,500 per quintal. Hence, it had been immediately decided to remove the MEP of onions."

As for the Operation Green for onion and potato, the entire institutional mechanism would have to be worked out by the NITI Aayog along with the states. So is the situation with regard to the MSP for several other agri commodities. While the NITI Aayog and the states would bear in mind the farmers' interest, the institutional mechanism would surely strike a balance between remuneration to the growers as also the impact on the retail prices. So, the immediate fear may be an over-reaction and the RBI should not get influenced while fixing the REPO (policy lending) rates in the coming week.""In so far as the stock market is concerned, it is a healthy correction which was overdue.""A lot of froth and unnecessary exuberance had gathered around the stocks, particularly in the mid-cap space and there was no justification while matched against the corporate earnings. In fact, one of our earlier papers had cautioned about wild fluctuations in the market in 2018 in the backdrop of head winds like rising crude oil prices, revenue implications of the Goods and Services Tax (GST) roll out and other pressures on the fisc,"" said ASSOCHAM Secretary General D S Rawat.The paper said, as is well recognised by the Union Budget, creation of jobs on a massive scale is the need of the hour.""While the government has realised this fact, it is time the RBI joined the initiative by ensuring that the growth which seems visible, should be encouraged by at least not revising the interest rates upward, if at all the present macro situation does not favor any reduction."""

However, economists expect that the central bank would move to a more hawkish stance from the current neutral stance in the wake of growth bottoming out.We continue to expect the RBI to persist with its slightly hawkish pause in its Wednesday policy, from February, to err on the side of caution. That said, falling onion prices, after tomatoes, support our call that inflation risks are overdone, said Indranil Sen Gupta, economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch . According to Gupta, the MPC will see through the coming jump in inflation, growth and credit in mid-2018 as they are driven by base effects.Even without the central bank raising rates, lenders cost of funds has inched up as deposits slowed down and credit grew at a one-year high. Several large lenders, including State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have hiked their bulk deposit rates. Private lender Axis Bank has also hiked its marginal cost of lending rate ( MCLR ) following an increase in cost of funds.According to DBS Bank chief economist Taimur Baig, growth has largely bottomed out, but India has yet to benefit from the synchronised pickup in global demand. The combination of fiscal challenges and rising oil prices would make the RBIs policy path a tricky one this year, in our view. Given Indias high debt and fiscal deficit, it may not be prudent to be on the sideline until inflation pressure becomes excessively high which, in turn, means the balance of risk is beginning to shift toward eventual policy tightening, he said.One of the factors that strengthen the case for a more hawkish regime has been the Union Budget , which unveiled a wider than expected fiscal deficit for the next year. But economists feel that the slippage is not enough to warrant a move to higher interest rates.Nomura economist Sonal Varma said, While the Budget is a slight disappointment relative to our expectations, it is not a game-changer in either direction  positive or negative. We expect a prolonged pause on monetary policy, including at the upcoming February 7 meeting, although the RBI may flag upside risks to inflation. She added that Nomura is yet to assess the impact of the government decision to hike minimum support prices (MSPs) on inflation and monetary policy outlook. The government has promised to increase the MSPs for crops by 1.5 times in the Budget.Benchmark 10-year bond yields have risen more than 80 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) since July  the biggest move since the 2013 rupee crisis, due in large part to worries about a more hawkish RBI."

Several large lenders, including State Bank of India and Punjab National Bank have hiked their bulk deposit rates. Private lender Axis Bank has also hiked its marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) following an increase in cost of funds."

It can only be accessed using The Onion Router (Tor), a software that allows for anonymous communication. On this site, users get password-protected or dynamic pages to surf encrypted networks.The ANC learnt about the web after interrogation of five students who were arrested in May last year in connection with the seizure of 1,400 LSD dots worth Rs70 lakh. They had an Indian friend settled in the United States. They used to send money using Bitcoin to him. This man would then place an order for drugs on the dark web and would get the drugs delivered to the youngsters delivery address, said DCP (ANC) Shivdeep Lande.A police source said the man in the US placed orders with the drug syndicates in Western Europe. Mumbai youths got the drugs from Holland. Not only LSD, they also ordered MDMA (Ecstasy) with help from the friend, said the source.Another police source said many high-end expensive party drugs found in Goa, and rave parties in other parts of the country were sourced through the dark web, as it offers absolute anonymity and encrypted data making tracking of users tough. After getting payment through Bitcoin or other crypto currencies, the suppliers send the consignments, mainly through shipping or couriers. In Mumbais case, LSD dots were concealed in some documents, a police officer said.Usually, global suppliers dont cheat the buyers, as they want to grow. Also, the customers alert others about cheater on chat rooms in the dark web. The cheaters are then blocked, said cyber expert advocate Prashant Mali.In the US there is a parallel world, notorious for drug trafficking and other illegal practices, on the Dark Net. The Indian enforcement agencies need to form a Cyber Spy Force, which will keep a close watch on the trend in the virtual world and take measures to check it, said Mali.Deputy Director General (NCB) Mutha Ashok Jain said in the present scenario, one cannot deny that Dark Net is a big challenge. Dark web hides the source, forcing us to rely on human intelligence or keep an eye on overseas couriers, DCP Lande said.Another senior Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) official from New Delhi said, The dark web is only a mechanism to hide identity. Once an order is placed, its needs to be executed and that needs a physical presence. And to switch to dark net mechanism one has to somewhere get linked to the existing system and this link leaves a trail for enforcers."

Vehicular movement often gets choked in this street as onions are spread for sales, occupying the road. As the road becomes narrower, vehicles are forced to move in snails pace, creating bottleneck for traffic movement.The corporation has been trying to shift the market to Mattuthavani vegetable market, but the traders are showing stiff resistance to vacate the place. The vegetable market too was functioning near Meenakshi Amman Temple before it was shifted to Mattuthavani.A civic body official said that the traders are reluctant and do not even turn up when they are invited by higher officials for talks. TOI had carried a story on 11th February on the delay in shifting various markets to the outskirts of the city and highlighting the problems due to them.On Tuesday, Madurai city corporation commissioner Aneesh Sekhar visited onion market and conducted an inspection. He found large quantities of onions encroaching upon the road, which was then cleared by corporation officials. Sekhar strictly warned the traders to restrict the sales to inside the shops. The commissioner also instructed his sub-ordinates to keep an eye on the market and not to allow traders on the road.Honorary president of Onion Merchants Association PMK Selvaraj said that corporation authorities have been urging them to not to hinder traffic movement, which most of their members are following. They have been also asked to get licenses for the trade. The traders will discuss it with other members of the association, he added.Earlier, Aneesh Sekhar inspected Mattuthavani vegetable market and took stock of encroachment and solid waste management. He urged the sellers to limit themselves to the space earmarked to each of them, as many of them were found to be encroaching public space. The sellers were also asked to chop the vegetable remains, so that it can decay quickly.The commissioner also visited New Bangajam Colony, a residential locality in Zone Three of Madurai Corporation."

They also generate a feel-good-factor as the taste lingers long after consuming their delicacies . Little wonder, the duo brought the best of herbs, cheese, fish, white wine, olive oil and other veggies all the way from their homeland to conduct a special masterclass at Hotel Imperial.The two have contrasting cooking styles but share a common passion for creating magic with traditional Italian recipes. Both Chef Attilio and Executive Chef Roberto, working at Belmond Villa San Michele, Florence, and Belmond Hotel Cipriani respectively, unveiled their secrets of Italian cuisine at the masterclass as part of an ongoing two-week festival at San Gimignano restaurant of the hotel which culminates on February 11.The guests were treated to a traditional Italian lunch eaten by families and young couples during summers. It comprised parma ham aesthetically decorated with cut slices of water melon, fish cooked in white wine and risotto. I found the meal hearty and wholesome/ The flavours came in with every bite, and Tuscan fish, rich in Omega-3 fatty acids, ensured that cholesterol level didnt shoot up.The flamboyant Robertosays he gets irritated when he sees fusion which has gone horribly wrong. Fusion is confusion. I become angry when I see this. In Europe, Indian cuisine is incorrectly represented. They try qorma but it is nothing like what is made here.Giving his take on Indian food, he says, I want to master Indian cuisine. One of the most popular dishes in my restaurant is a curry dish.  He has plans to explore the spice market in Old Delhi and try local delicacies.Offering a piece of advise for those who cook Italian at home, he says: People should use seasonal vegetables and not imported ones. Roberto pitched in for Make in India when it came to veggies like aubergine, which is available round the year even while supporting Italian cheese and ham.Meanwhile, Chef Attilio, who makes tasty Tuscan food, started off with elementary tips like how yolk can easily be separated from the egg white without spilling it on the table. It is necessary for binding it with flour, he said, while mixing it with his hands.Garlic was virtually worshipped by the chefs as it plays a significant role in almost every Italian dish. They ensured that it was roasted and looked brownish. They emphasised that a balance is essential between different ingredients.Chef Attilio says: The key to good cooking lies in the fact that our ingredients are fresh and healthy and are combined in such a way that the taste of chicken would not be overpowered by any other ingredient. If it is a seafood dish, its taste should not be overpowered by garlic or any other ingredient.Noting that ham with water melon is eaten during summers, Chef Attilio says: In Italy, we have different kinds of ham which are eaten with fresh melons. Tuscan people eat mostly meat but slowly we are substituting that with fish as it is lighter to digest, is healthy and keeps the constitution well balanced.Advocating wannabe chefs to focus on the main ingredient, he says: If Italians prepare a sea food dish, then fish has to be the protagonist. Italian food is all about balancing ingredients.For the duo, the trip is helpful as it is not just about cooking and interacting with foodies but also about sharing of knowledge with Imperials Executive Chef Prem Kumar Pogakula, who plans to take them to Khari Baoli for spices and trying Mughlai delicacies.Chef Pogakula, who hails from Andhra Pradesh, and is cooking along with the two chefs, says in Delhi, people get to eat only Indo-Italian. Like we put garam masala, they dont use spices at all. Even pepper is not used in Tuscan region. Technically, there are flavours of Parmeson, thyme, rosemary and parsley.He underlines the importance of white wine in Italian cooking. It is used in risotto for de-glazing. When you put butter in onion for saut, the sugar in onion gets caramelised. That is the base which sticks on the pan. So the wine elevates the flavour.Summing up, Chef Pogakula, who will travel to Italy this year to promote Indian cuisine as part of a cultural exchange programme between The Imperial and Belmond Hotels, says India lacks in quality of ingredients because of logistical issues. Italian hotels run their own farms. Freshness of ingredients is an aspect where we need to focus on."

To add a dash of spice to the battle, revenue minister Umashankar Gupta shot back that he, too, sold pakodas before joining politics and doesnt see anything wrong in it.At 11 am on Wednesday, state Youth Congress president Kunal Choudhary sat in front of the state PCC office in Bhopal alongside a statue of former PM Indira Gandhi to fry pakodas as his supporters flavoured it with slogans. Educated youth asking for employment, Youth Congress activists shouted.Before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, PM Narendra Modi and BJP chief Amit Shah promised to generate 2 crore jobs a year for the youth. Now, after four years of his government, the Prime Minister is asking us to fry pakodas. There is no shame in frying pakodas, but it is shameless to make promises and fail to deliver, Choudhary told TOI.The Youth Congress sold palak (spinach), potato and onion pakoras to passersby saying, The educated youth has been insulted. Have parents given education to their children so they have no dreams? Have students toiled to get engineering and MBA degrees to start a pakoda enterprise?Since Tuesday, the Youth Congress has held such pakoda protests in 90 towns and cities across MP, including Sehore, Rewa, Panna, Chhattarpur, Indore and Bhopal.Senior BJP leader Umashankar Gupta hit back at Congress, saying: There is no shame is making and selling pakodas. I used to sell pakodas and fried snacks to earn my livelihood before joining politics. I have seen qualified engineers working as labourers. There is no shame in generating self-employment.BJP MLA from Bhopal Madhya, Surendra Nath Singh, said that Congress and some pseudo-intellectuals failed to understand PMs pakoda example. The PM never asked engineers to sell pakoda. It was for unemployed youths who have no way to earn. It was a motivation for generating self-employment but some pseudo intellectuals, politicians and media twisted the debate, alleged Singh.BJP leaders felicitated pakoda sellers in Bhopal, Sehore and Ashta to blunt Congress protests."
5b1665bc9855b75cf6a8d529,Choked city must shift all markets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/madurai/choked-city-must-shift-all-markets/articleshow/62868010.cms,2018-02-11,"MADURAI: Almost all cities are as a rule congested during peak hours in the morning and evening. However, Madurai is unique in that it is congested round-the- clock, even at midnight. Majormarkets and commercial hubs operating in the heart of the city keep it humming with traffic all through the day, leaving the city congested. Madurai is the market for the entire southern Tamil Nadu and neighbouring Kerala. In fact, some of the markets are over a century old -- the central vegetable market was started 115 years ago -- and so were the other markets for fruits, flowers, onion and provisions like foodgrains. A century ago, they were started on a small scale with just a couple of shops which quickly grew in proportion.Markets apart, commercial establishments mushroomed in the city over the period, turning every street into a hub of some product or other. One would find serene residential buildings used as shops or for stocking the products. For instance, the famous house at West Masi Street, where Mahatma Gandhi changed his attire to that of a common Indian peasant during his visit in September 1921 is an outlet of a handloom store, and most of this house now lies in a dilapidated condition.The popular demand is that the markets must go out of the city and be stationed on the outskirts. As the demand grew louder, there were efforts to move out major markets, and some really materialised. The central vegetable market, which used to operate near Meenakshi temple on the old prison premises for over 115 years, was moved to Mattuthavani during 2010-11. Ahead of the shift, the flower market which was operating close by was moved to Agricultural Marketing Committee campus in 2006.However, Madurai still reels under congestion because other major markets like fruit market at Yanaikal, fish market at Karimedu and the onion traders at East Marret Street are yet to be moved out of city. ""The wholesale markets have to move out of the city. Most of the wholesale traders stock their goods inside the city. For instance, 80 trucks come inside the city to transact sugar alone"", says Madurai Lorry Owners Association president C Sathiah.Some of the associations have moved their establishments anticipating this situation. The grains market at Sikkantharchavadi by was established by Tamil Nadu Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2012. ""Though most of the grain merchants moved their warehouses numbering 250 to the outskirts, the sales happen here because traders feel that they may lose business if they go out. When the entire market moves out, the business too will move out eventually. The issue here is, there is little pressure from authorities to move the markets outside the city"", opined the chambers senior president, S Rethinavelu.The proposals to move fruit market and fish market are in the pipeline with places identified at Mattuthavani and Virattipathu respectively. Most of the works have been completed for fruit market but the fish market ran into trouble. ""Local people are opposing the proposal to move the fish market"", quipped L Sundaram, president of Karimedu Commission Fish Vendors Association. Though the vendors who moved out of the city have no big complaints, they feel that staying inside city has got its own benefits. ""The retail sale of customers buying flowers at dawn or dusk dwindled because they have to come a long distance. We used to enjoy this last leg of sales, when customers pick flowers on their way home"", said A V E Kesavan, a flower merchant.There is also pressing demand from traders to create adequate facilities on these market premises which were moved out. ""We still dont have any cold storage to preserve vegetables and adequate room for maneuvering trucks. The original lot of 27 acres allotted by former chief minister J Jayalalithaa when she assumed charge first in 1991, is yet to be put to use"", said P S Murugan , president of Mattuthavani Wholesale Vegetable Traders Association.For the common commuters inside the city, it will be a great relief if markets are moved out. ""It is very difficult to negotiate the traffic congestion in Madurai because we have to traverse through these markets and commercial hubs. ,"" B Rabikraja from Ismai lpuram added."

Nearly 40% of the teachers believed smelling an onion or a chappal was a key first-aid measure . Merely 11% had thought of summoning an ambulance.The eight-month long study covering across 42 schools bares the lack of awareness about epilepsy . Only one in five teachers knew that laying a person on a flat surface and turning him/her to one side was one of the first things to be done when someone is convulsing. What makes the ignorance more worrying is that the first-aid measures for epilepsy and regular fainting, something routinely seen in schools, is the same.The idea for the study stemmed from the widespread reluctance of schools to accommodate epileptic children. We found out two main things during treating children with epilepsy; their parents were hesitant to tell the schools, and secondly, even reputed schools were unwilling to accept such children, said Dr Pradnya Gadgil, consultant paediatric neurologist at Kokilaben Hospital, Andheri, which carried out the study with Samman Foundation, the Indian Epilepsy Associations Mumbai chapter.Epilepsy is the fourth commonest brain disorder, yet its shrouded in stigma. Gadgil said that one in 100 in the population will get a seizure once in lifetime, while one in 200 have epilepsy. Due to the ignorance, people can be scared of seizures as they don't understand what happens and what to do. Children, therefore, are often deprived of a normal life, say going to a picnic or participating in some common activity, she said.Pooja Nandi of Samman said, If a teacher discriminates against an epileptic child, it would make the childs life miserable. Seizures can manifest in different ways such as the child blanking out for few seconds in class. Such cases even end up getting labelled as learning disability, she said. The silver lining was that after awareness sessions, 94% of teachers said an epileptic child could go to a normal school."

Since there was a delay in disbursal of crop insurance benefits due for 2016-17, the farmers, who largely relied on it, did not have enough money and struggled to pay the premium.If the insurance company had released the insurance benefits to eligible farmers, they could have paid the premium, A. Varadharajan, a farmer from Vadamalapuram, Ettayapuram taluk, and MDMKs State deputy secretary of Farmers Wing, told The Hindu here on Sunday.Citing these problems, he demanded that the authorities extend the deadline to February 28. Further, he said, it required a sum of Rs. 1,800 towards insuring a hectare of onion crop and Rs. 950 for a hectare of chillies. Among other crops, high premium was notified for onion and chillies. Several farmers in Ettayapuram, Vilathikulam and its surroundings were depressed by monsoon failure last season, which saw only 40% of cultivation.Lack of informationMoreover, he said some crop insurers felt that there was not enough information about the insurance company on acknowledgement slips. Except for the companys name, columns meant for address, website and email were blank, whereas all details of crop insurers, including cell phone numbers, were added. If such details were mentioned in the acknowledgement slips, farmers could get their doubts clarified."

It also resulted in heavy losses of the standing crops of grapes, wheat, jawar and seeds of onion among others.Though the meteorological department had issued the advisory about the unseasonal rainfall and the hailstorm earlier, the farmers said they could do nothing to save their standing crops.Two farmers, Mandodari and Rama Shelke, lost their grape crops of about 200 quintal. They claimed to have sustained losses of about Rs8 lakh.Though only a few grapes are damaged, the entire bunch of grapes is damaged due to the fungus and infection it will develop in the following days. Against the production cost of Rs4.5 lakh, we were expecting Rs8 lakh from our sale. We could not even get our crop insured as the grape orchards in our village do not qualify for the cover due to less area under cultivation, said Mandodari. According to officials from the divisional commissioner of Marathwada, the hailstorm was reported in Parbhani on Sunday evening and in parts of Aurangabad on Sunday morning. According to preliminary reports, losses in Jalna were highest. Agriculture minister Pandurang Fundkar has directed his department to begin conducting the panchnamas of the losses.We have taken a review of the situation. The panchnama and the disbursement of the compensation may take few more days, said Rajesh Joshi, resident district collector of Jalna. Villagers said the losses would have been more had it been a working day.Bhaiyyasaheb Shinde from Vanjary Umrad village said Marathwada had been witnessing hailstorm regularly in last few years but the size of hail stones that poured on Sunday caused more damage."

(Express photo by Kevin DSouza) A foodie, Ankita Raina has shed her calorific intemperance to improve her fitness. (Express photo by Kevin DSouza)The delicately delicious onion-tomato orgy on mutton for the Rogan Josh, was the biggest sacrifice Ankita Raina remembers making at the altar of tennis success. Olive oil drizzled salads and the bland pasta staple replaced the waft of a wonder memory of that Kashmiri kernel.Ankitas journey will continue from a strong showing at the Fed Cup in Delhi to the next port of call as she tries to better her ranking beyond 222the highest she reached around the time the last Fed Cup was played in India at Hyderabad in 2015. Indias No 1 takes flights mostly now, but recalled the train journey she undertook alone in 2012 as a 19-year-old finding her perfect Rogan Josh. I was playing a tournament in Delhi and realised itd been long since I visited my grandparents in Kashmir. First, all the cousins had planned to go, but then everyone else chickened out. There is a lot of strife there, but Kashmir is really heaven on earth, I found a lot of sukoon (peace) there at that time, she had said, speaking in the summer of 2015. Also, I really like mutton cooked in our Kashmiri stylewith lots of onion and tomatoes. That impulsive train journey was memorable, shed added with a sigh.Ankita is accustomed to long, meandering journeys in tennisand not just matches that last 2 hours-24 minutes, and 2 hours-53 the next day to beat Chieh-Yu Hsu incidentally Indias longest Fed Cup tie over the last weekend in Delhi. I always loved travelling by train as a child, and hated returning home. Tennis took me to places like Kavali in Andhra, Gulbarga and Mandya and I started travelling alone at 14. It used to be scary sometimes  new places, new culture, but I realised I dont panic immediately. Also you cant stop trains by pulling chains in Morocco! she laughs retelling her pet tale.Ankita Rainas oft-told Casablanca story involves a miss and a sigh. Followed by some shrill, hysterical cries of Pull it again, man! as she tried to stop a train she was travelling in, by cranking repeatedly at the first thing resembling a chain, with a friend screaming nearby.The pair of them, teenaged tennis players from India, had landed at Casablanca and were to take a connecting train from the basement of the airport to Rabat in Morocco for a junior tournament. The two misheard announcements alternating in Arabic and French and would miss their station just as Ankita  an accomplished train traveller back home owing to her India-wide criss-crossing for ITF juniors meets, immediately scanned around for a chain to pull and bring the train to a halt. Its when she rushed to the door pressing frantically at the buttons  that the chaos reached a crescendo. The pair were slapped a fine of 6000 dirhams. This opened the floodgates of the bawling friend. When the TC came, I told him how we were headed for a tennis tournament, and were traveling alone. We were very little and howling, and they finally understood and put us on the train back, she recalled.Indias top singles player at World No 253 has had a different graph than the countrys high-achieving predecessor in singlesSania Mirza. At 25, the results havent come in a bunch and she continues to battle to climb every step of the rankings ladder. The turbulence on the flight up hasnt quite stopped. My first flight alone was to Hyderabad and I told people I was 15. I was actually carrying a note from parents that said I was 12 and needed supervision, she recalled. Other adventures include winning a meet in Muzaffarnagar, watched by a ring of phlegmatic policemen guarding the tournament in the crime-infested area.When you dont hit the double digits of rankings early in tennis, theres a lot of unglamorous detours and wrong trains where life inadvertently takes you. Remaining undefeated in singles through a zonal Fed Cup week in your national capital has taken time to happen, with the double-fisted backhand and the serve variations for speed and placement, still being work in progress.Though her father accompanied her to meets in her pre-teens, it was her mum who nudged her into tennis. I started at 4. My mother was a sports enthusiast who did athletics and TT. Travelling with a parent though means double the cost so I had to learn to fend for myself very early, she added. The family had first watched Tim Henman play a Satellite Challenger at Ahmedabad where young Ankita chased the Brit for autographs, and it was from watching Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi that the girl started falling for the game.After some male players from Ahmedabad started training at Hemant Bendres academy in Pune, Ankita would shift too. Though her favourite surface for her aggressive game remains grass, shed do well on hard courts even while practicing on clay taking her time to learn the proper clay game of slices and slugging. Ankita favoured the chip and charge and took a liking for the drop shotsomething she used when downing Yulia Putintseva, the 81-ranked combustible Kazakh. As a kid, Ankita started loving smacking the ball and didnt hold back even if they kept landing long and thumping against fences at Ahmedabad.The forehand was developing into a weapon, but in 2012 shed run into a Chinese at a meet to secure a wildcard for the Australian Open who kept banging the ball with such menace that rallying at that speed got impossible. She would double her gym work to gain that kind of power, and though she detested running rounds, weight training soon became the favourite part of her workout. I have puked during running sessions though to try and get to that level of stamina, she recalled. 2013 would see her change her diet after extensive travel and oily food gave her acidity and sore throats during matches. I was a foodie. Then suddenly my dietician was telling me about olive oil and eating right, she said.All the time she would be wracked by the perennial dilemmawhether to chase titles at smaller events that fetched her headlines to woo the sponsors, or whether to play the higher graded meets of WTA and push for ranking points. All my time was spent making decisionstaking gambles on meets and balancing risks, one eye at the entry date, the other at withdrawals. Retreating from Japan, going to Marrakesh. After the last Fed Cup, Sania advised me on which tournaments to pick. When she was coming up, she was an inspiration and it was a dream to try play like her. Everyone used to say, Indians are not that strong, and we dont have the genes for tennis. Its difficult but Sania proved its possible, she added.On rough days, the family including brother Ankur, would be rushing from embassy to airportwith Ankita taking in her stride different cities and time zonesjust trying to get to the venue, tired and spent and losing in the first round as a result. There are times when Id feel low and not confident. But Id think that when I succeed all the praise will be for me, while my family is doing it all selflessly, she said.Her transition from juniors to seniors was typically protracted, and shed seek help of a psychologist. Ankita frequently started using the drop shot in stiff tie breakers. After a point, finishing the crunch matches is all mental, she had said, after a few close matches at the Fed Cup went the other way.From 2015 to now, Raina seems to have sorted out her end-game and won all her singles matches this time. Her parents whod watched Sharapova win the Wimbledon in 2004, would chip in with advice: how Cibulkova was always on her toes and jumping on court, how Ivanovic picked everything on the rise, how Federer stayed calm and Nadal covered the court. I went through a phase where I used to be confused  I wanted to be calm and aggressive also at the same time, she chuckled, adding that though she used to be shy off-court, she could pull out the fangs when playing.Ankita, meanwhile faced problems that tennis divinity rarely does.

He was expecting to earn Rs1.40 lakh from his yield of 35 quintals of wheat from the standing crops. The hailstorm, that lasted for just 10 minutes, ruined all his hopes as the crop was smashed to ground. Days before, his cotton was attacked by the pink bollworm that resulted in the loss of Rs3.50 lakh that he was expecting from the crop. He says he has been hit by natural calamities consecutively for past few years.With satisfactory rains in past two years, I was expecting to make up for the losses I incurred during the drought years. For last two years, it has been either unseasonal rains or hailstorm that has been destroying our standing crops. Delayed rains last year had damaged Kharip and rabi crops of soyabean, pulses, and wheat, among others. The insurance cover given by the state does not work, as many farmers have not taken cover due to the bad experience over past few years. Few crops such as grape are not eligible for the insurance cover, as its area under cultivation at the block level is below the average of the insurance parameter, said Raghunath Golde, a farmer from Revgaon in Jalna district.Malhari Pathade, a farmer from Thar village in Jalna, sustained heavy losses as his grape orchard on 10 acres was destroyed. He had sold his orchard with about 2,400 quintal grapes against the advance money of Rs15,000 from a trader. He was expecting to earn at least Rs50 lakh. I will now end up getting a compensation of about Rs50,000 from the government, he says.Tryambak Jadhav, a social worker who is involved in counselling the farmers in Jalna, said, Hailstorm is a common phenomena in Marathwada over past few years. But the hail stones that poured in February were bigger in size - around 20 mm - against the 6-mm stones in May or June. Secondly, the hailstorm in February proves disastrous as it destroys crops ready for harvesting. It is time to adopt technology to minimise the effect of the hailstorm. China has done it effectively.Almost a fourth of the tehsils in Marathwada have been affected by the hailstorm and unseasonal rainfall over the past three days. Standing crops on about two lakh hectares of land has been damaged, which has led to loss of crops of thousands of crores of rupees. The standing crops of wheat, jowar and grapes have been badly-hit in almost all the districts of Marathwada.The farmers have also complained of huge losses to the seed plants of onion and cotton in villages of Waghrul and Revgaon in Jalna.Eight districts have reported three deaths and injuries to 17 farmers in the hailstorm in three days in Marathwada. 46 cattle have reportedly died, while thousands of chickens have also been killed.The district administration has begun conducting the punchnamas of the losses to the farmers in all the eight districts. We expect the punchnamas to be completed in next few days. Our village and tehsil level officials have been on the field from Sunday, assessing the losses. The reports in the villages with higher losses may take some more time. The final decision about the compensation has to be taken by the state government, said a top level officer from the divisional commissioner office."

Pictures by Shubham PaulSouth Indian food is just idli and dosa. All South Indian food is vegetarian. All South Indian food is cooked in coconut oil. Kurry n Kebab, a cosy restaurant next to GD Market, claims to bust these myths with their Kerala food festival from February 26 to March 4.Idli and dosa are only snacks. For main course we have enough fish and mutton dishes to make Bengalis ask for more, promises Rajesh Menon, a Malayali who is a partner at Kurry n Kebab.But the owners were sceptical about introducing Kerala fare in Salt Lake and so decided to keep the tried-and-tested Mughlai cuisine on their menu too  hence the word kebab on their name.Nonetheless the upcoming festival focuses only on Kerala food, that you probably have not tasted before.Unniappam for dessert (top), (above) butter milk for startersKerala Mutton Ishtu (Rs 295), a mild, coconut milk-based stew, is unmissable. Chicken lovers can try the spicy Chicken Chettinad (Rs 280). Strictly speaking, Chettinad is a region in Tamil Nadu but it borders Kerala so were taking liberties. It goes very well with Malabari Paratha, says Menon.As an accompaniment, its the appam that is unique in look, taste and texture. The white round staple is soft and fluffy in the centre but has a crispy skirt on the edges. A dosa batter is made of rice and lentil but appam uses only rice. It uses no oil and is cooked on a kadai, which gives it the wholesome shape.Fish lovers must try Aiyla Fry (mackerel) or Naimeen Pollichada (Rs 260), a grill-cum-paturi take on the Surmai fish. Bengalis are partial towards river fish but sea fish like Surmai are very popular in Kerala, says Menon, adding that its not easy to procure the fish. You dont get it in Salt Lake. We have to fetch it from Park Circus, says the resident of New Towns Eastern High.While south Indian food is usually cooked in coconut oil, the Calcutta crowd would not enjoy it, says K. Surendran Nair, the head chef with over 30 years of experience. So were using refined oil. Coconut oil is used rarely, only in dishes such as Potato Stew.As for dessert, try the southern take on payesh or a rice-jaggery-banana fried item called Unniappam (Rs 150). The pellets are served hot over a bed of cold rabri, which is a twist we have added, says the chef.Kerala Mutton IshtuIngredients (serves one) Mutton with bone 500g (5 pieces) Potato half Coconut milk 100ml Green chilli 2 Ginger 5g Onion 100g Cloves, cardamom and cinnamon- total 5g Curry leaves 2gMethodBoil the mutton in a pressure cooker.

At Perambur in Chennai, where he grew up, he used to go scouting for eateries offering these dishes. After completing a catering course two decades ago, he decided to open an eatery in Trichy , his hometown, to serve the unbeatable idli-vadacurry combo.Over the years, he set up eateries at different places in the city. But it was only last year that he got a real breakthrough. Aanand Catering , which he opened at Periya Kadai Street , is now a big draw in the locality. Though my eatery had a slow start, customers loved what I served and through word of mouth the dishes became popular, Aanand said.The idli-vadacurry combo was the most sought after. Some people even come to my place from other areas for takeaways, he said. One idli costs `5, while vadacurry costs `15 if eaten there and `25 for takeaway.Apart from that, onion adai, mushroom biryani and millet khichdis are also popular among customers.I am very particular about serving hygienic and healthy food, said Aanand, who is now 43. This is why he does not serve parottas. I decided against serving parottas even though I know it isnt the smartest of business moves. I dont want people to eat food items that can be harmful to them, he said.Between 50 and 70 people visit Aanand Catering daily. On weekends, there are extra customers because I serve mushroom biryani on Saturdays and vegetable dosai on Sundays, he stated.Aanand, who also did a stint as a football coach at Campion Anglo-Indian Higher Secondary School a few years ago, said it was with a heavy heart that he stopped serving adai aviyal at his eatery. It was one item that was as popular as vadacurry over here. But as coconut prices increased, I wasnt able to afford aviyal  this remains a big regret, he said.On his future plans, Aanand says, I want to rent a place out and start a restaurant soon  Im confident that I will be able to achieve this dream by the end of this year."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) The country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)The finance minister announced Operation Greens, on the lines of Operation Flood, with a seed capital of Rs 500 crore in his speech on February 1. Three days later, the Prime Minister backed the scheme at a parivartan rally in Bengaluru. He said farmers are his TOP priority  T is for tomatoes, O for onions, and P for potatoes.Operation Flood changed the face of milk production in India, making the country the largest producer of milk in the world  in 2016-2017, the country produced 164 million metric tonnes (MMT). But its important to note that Operation Flood was driven largely by smallholders and the AMUL model has ensured that 75-80 per cent of the price paid by milk consumers goes to the farmers. Operation Greens wants to replicate that success story in fruit and vegetables, starting with tomatoes, onions and potatoes.The main objective of this project, according to the finance ministry, is to reduce price volatility in these commodities, thereby helping farmers augment incomes on a sustainable basis. It also aims to provide these vegetables to consumers at affordable prices. The litmus test of this scheme would be in containing the booms and busts in prices. It will need to avert situations where farmers have been forced to dump potatoes and tomatoes on roads. Also, checking the prices from going through the roof has compelled the government to ban exports. It has resorted to de-stocking and conducted income tax raids on traders  the raids on onion traders in September last year is a case in point.India is the second largest producer of vegetables in the world with about 180 MMT. But China produces four times more vegetables than India. The accompanying graph shows a structural break in Indias vegetable production around 2003-2004. Although not as revolutionary as the Green Revolution in wheat, or the White Revolution in milk, yields of potatoes, onions and tomatoes  which constitute almost half of the countrys vegetable production  have shown a healthy growth. For example, between 2003-2004 and 2017-2018, potato production increased from 28 MMT to 49 MMT while onion yields went up from 6.3 MMT to 21 MMT and tomato production increased from 8.1 MMT to 22 MMT.However, the problem with these commodities is that their prices collapse when their production rises sharply. This is because the country lacks modern storage facilities and the links between processing and organised retailing are very weak. As a result, farmers often end up receiving less than a fourth of what consumers pay in major cities. This must change. Operation Greens needs to ensure that farmers receive at least 60 per cent of what consumers pay. In the case of milk, the producers get more than 75 per cent of what consumers pay. The basic principles of Operation Flood would be useful to operationalise Operation Greens as well.What are these principles? First, link major consumption centres to major production centres with a minimal number of intermediaries. As Verghese Kurien wrote in his book, I too had a Dream, organising farmers and increasing production is an easier job. The real challenge is to find the right markets that can give them remunerative prices on a sustainable basis. So, one needs to map mega consuming centres and link their retail networks with the producing centres of each commodity. Farmers can be organised in farmer producer organisations (FPOs). NABARD and SFAC (Small farmers agribusiness consortium) together have about 3,000 FPOs, which could be the starting points for the aggregation of commodities, assaying, sorting, grading, and even packing with bar codes, reflecting their traceability.The Agricultural Produce Market Committee Act will have to be changed to allow direct buying from FPOs, and giving incentives to these organisations, private companies and NGOs to build back end infrastructure as was done in the case of milk. The announcement of tax concessions to FPOs for five years is a welcome step in that direction, if it encourages building such critical infrastructure.Second is the investment in logistics, starting with modern warehouses, that can minimise wastage. An example is of cold storage for onions, where wastage is reduced to less than 10 per cent, compared to the 25-30 per cent wastage in traditional storage facilities on farmers fields. Such storage facilities have to be cost effective. A potato cold storage in UP, for example, that buys power at almost Rs 10/kwh from SEBs, can become efficient by generating solar power at less than Rs 4/kwh. Large-scale investments in storage will require tweaking of the Essential Commodities Act.Third is linking the processing industry with organised retailing. On an average, about one-fourth of the produce must be processed. India is way behind on this curve compared to most Southeast Asian countries. Dehydrated onions, tomato puree and potato chips should become cheap, so that an average household can use them. Processing industry adds value and absorbs surpluses. Seen this way, the finance ministers announcement of increasing the allocation for the food processing industry by 100 per cent is a welcome step. The food processing ministry will have to coordinate with Operation Greens.By developing such forward and backward linkages, the government can ease large price fluctuations, raise farmers share in the price paid by the consumer and at the same time, ensure lower prices for the consumers  a win-win situation for all.However, Operation Greens would need a champion to implement this vision and strategy with honesty, another Kurien, for at least three to five years. A babu will not work. Can the government locate another Kurien?For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

(Photo for representation) Tur continues to trade much below the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. (Photo for representation)There is no respite for tur growers from the vicious cycle of low prices this year as the pulse continues to trade much below the government declared Minimum Support Price (MSP) of Rs 5,400 per quintal. Huge carry-forward stock and absence of price parity in the export market, analysts said, would almost kill any chances of prices firming up later in the year. Like tur, chana whose harvest has started also faces a dim price prospect because of a bumper crop.Tur, a major kharif crop in the arid regions of Marathwada and Vidarbha, had slid way below its MSP last year because of a bumper yield. While the central and state government had waded in the procure tur at the MSP, the process was riddled with allegations of corruption at various levels. The price of the pulse has been well below MSP levels even before it started arriving in the markets. This despite a 20 per cent reduction in area of tur in the state for the kharif season of 2017-18.Maharashtra has reported 12.19 lakh hectares of tur cultivation in 2017-18 as compared to 15.32 lakh hectares in 2016-17. State government estimates say Maharashtra will produce around 9.83 lakh tonnes of tur this year. In view of the continuing low prices, Nafed through its agencies  the Maharashtra State Cooperative Marketing Federation and the Vidarbha Cooperative Marketing Federation (VCMF)  has started more than 180 procurement centres.Till about last week, the State Cooperative Marketing Federation had reported procurement of over 1 lakh quintals of tur. This year, the state is set to see more than 4.8 lakh tonnes of procurement under the Price Support Scheme (PSS). However, prices in the wholesale markets continue to be much lower than the declared MSP. At Laturs wholesale market, which sets the national trend for the pulse, the price is hovering between Rs 4,385-4,400 a quintal.Trade sources said chances of prices rising in the future were remote as the country has already 9 lakh tonnes of tur procured last year. To add to this stock, around 80,000 quintals of imported tur is lying unutilised in the godowns of importers. The state marketing federation has over 1 lakh tonnes of tur it procured last year. This the government is now releasing into the market for milling and offloading the daal in the open market.Traders said this would keep prices low in the months to come. Chances of export, market sources said, are dim given the Indian produce lacks price parity in the international market. Nitin Kalantri, CEO of Latur-based Kalantri Foods, called for steps to increase the demand for pulses. The government should include pulses in the mid-day meals and also take up campaigns to increase consumption of pulses by people, he said.An increase in demand will create newer avenues for the commodity and thus help firm up prices in the wholesale market. Similarly agro-analyst Deepak Chavan called for a five-point programme to increase consumption of pulses and help farmers get assured returns. Chavan suggested the inclusion of the old stock in the public distribution system as well as other government-run schemes like mid-day meals. Chavan too called for a campaign to help increase the consumption of pulses among the general public.At the farm gate-level, the government should take up projects to build small pulses godowns which will allow the farmer to store his produce, he said. Such on-field storage structures, Chavan said, has helped onion growers in Nashik to store their produce and offload it at better prices. Banks should provide finance for such structures, he said.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

Pests like Gram pod borer or Helicoverpa and other diseases have struck the gram crop in as many as 11 villages across Dhule, Nandurbar, and Jalgaon. The incidence of pests and diseases on gram has also crossed the economic threshold level (ETL) here. Crops like wheat, gram, jowar, maize have been affected by diseases and pests in this division.An economic threshold is the insects population level or extent of crop damage at which the value of the crop destroyed exceeds the cost of controlling the pest.In Pune division, gram crop in 32 villages across Ahmednagar and Solapur has been attacked by such pests currently. Here too, the incidence has crossed the economic threshold level. Crops such as wheat, gram, sugar cane and maize are expected to cause financial losses to growers due to pest attacks, the report said.Various rabi crops in as many as 19 villages in Latur, seven in Amravati and 41 in Nagpur, among others, are facing a similar situation due to the rain and hailstorm, with the incidence of pests and diseases crossing the threshold at these locations as well.Director of MAHA Farmers Producer Company Limited Amit Naphade , told TOI that whenever there is a variation in weather  sudden change from cold to warm, unseasonal rain, or no rain in the monsoon months  the incidence of pests and diseases on crops increases.Such changes are ideal for pests and diseases to flourish, since the crops weaken at these times and become susceptible to pest attacks. Most districts in Vidarbha, Marathwada, and some in north Maharashtra, are facing increased pest attacks following the recent unseasonal rain, with between 30% and 60% wheat crop getting destroyed not just because of rain but pest attack and diseases, said Naphde.Farmer Purushottam Mangte Patil from Vyala village in Balapur district of Akola said that had the unseasonal rain and hail not affected the region, crop health and production would have been 100% this rabi season. But now, various pests are hounding the crops, he said.Buldhana farmer Milind Pachpande said that between 25% to 50% of onion crop in his field is facing pest attacks. The onion crop is close to rotting in many areas, he said."

The farms floor is iridescent-green and spongy as you walk it. Its actually a month-old black gram or channa crop. Ram risks losing this bucolic haven measuring 3.72 hectares to his creditors.A loan of Rs 3 lakh taken on Kisan Credit Card from the Punjab National Banks Badalwas branch in Sikar district turned into a Rs 4.5 lakh monster after repeated defaults.It was like a noose around my neck, he says, showing off a notice issued on February 9, 2017 from a local official in Dhod tehsil to auction his land to the highest bidder. An auction fee of 5% was also added to the outstanding. Then, the bidding took place.One-third of the total land holding  which is Rams share in the family property -- was auctioned at Rs 18 lakh to the highest bidder, Nandlal Chawla from a neighbouring town.Just as the auction proceedings were being closed, Ram showed up to pay the debt. He had collected the outstanding by begging and borrowing from everyone he could ask for help. Effectively, that was a loan to repay another loan. At the behest of local elders, the auction was reversed, he says.Ram isnt off the hook yet. Now, I worry about paying all these creditors who helped me save my land from Punjab National Bank, he says.Farmers in many states have got into precisely these sorts of debt traps  a generic problem caused by high costs of cultivation and falling returns from agriculture. In state after state, governments have succumbed to pressure and waived off farm loans or are considering doing so. Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, and Karnataka have waived off loans, or partially written off loans, or part of the interests.On February 12, Rajasthan announced it would partially write off loans owed by small and marginal farmers worth Rs 8000 crore. Its decision was forced by an 11-day protest by farmers in Sikar, 200 km from capital Jaipur from September 1-13 2017, last year.History shows that an agitation launched from Sikar never fails. It has always spelt trouble for governments. It is a revolutionary place, says Amra Ram, the leader of All-India Kisan Sabha, who led the agitation. The siege was intense. Highways were blocked. Traders shuttered shops and transactions in the Sikar farmers market ground to a halt. Thousands from all over the politically influential Shekhawati region  comprising the three big districts of Churu, Sikar and Jhunjhunu  joined in. Amra Ram says the loan waiver will cover only 2% of the farmers caught in debt traps.In 2000, the Kisan Sabha forced the government to release more power to farms. In 2015, it forced the then government to roll back electricity tariff hike after a 15-day protest, just like it forced the current government to defer a decision to raise rural electrify prices in 2016.What made last years agitation successful was that everybody joined us, even local DJs, with their fan following, says Ram Ratan, a prominent farm leader from Sikar. DJs bring to mind hip jockeys in city nightclubs, but in the Shekhawati region, they are local Jat youth who play ear-numbing music in local marriages, religious festivals, birthdays and other rural events from atop specially modified pickup trucks. When harvests are good, they make good money. When onion prices crashed in Sikar  the biggest growing district in Rajasthan  even DJs were without business.The Rajasthan governments loan waiver, limited to small and marginal farmers, is a follow up on an agreement it had signed with protesting Sikar farmers.It promises to pay off Rs 50,000 of each small farmers total outstanding on short-duration loans taken from cooperative banks. The first test of whether this has managed to placate farmers took place on February 22. The main farmers body that staged the massive agitation last year, forcing the government to accept its demands, called for a similar agitation on that day. It believed the waiver wasnt enough because it takes care of just 1 of its 11 demands. Its major demands were a total loan waiver, not partial, of all categories of farmers and a complete freeing up of cattle trade in the state.Despite a loan waiver, hundreds of farmers blocked the Bikaner-Agra national highway 52 near Sikar town on Thursday. Two days ago, the government arrested the national secretary of Kisan Sabha, Amra Ram and his colleague Pema Ram, to pre-empt the protests. Our leaders were arrested when they were on a padyatra (protest march) in Jaipur, Ratan, their colleague said.With elections due later this year in the state, the government is watching the farm sector closely.We need to understand that Rajasthan is neither Gujarat, nor Maharashtra. Rajasthans economy is mostly about tourism, mines and agriculture. I dont think disruption from policies such as the Goods and Services Tax is an issue here unlike in Gujarat, which is a textile hub, says Prof. Sanjay Lodha of Udaipurs Mohanlal Sukhadia University. The plight of farmers is because they havent been getting good prices, Lodha says.Just a few years ago, things were smooth-sailing. The rough patch in Rajasthans agriculture began roughly four years ago. Incredibly, a fracking boom in faraway US -- which saw a surge in natural gas production to offset rising oil prices -- brought prosperity to Rajasthans poorest farmers.Fracking is a method of extracting shale gas by pumping high-pressured gas into the ground, which requires a processed powder called guar gum made from guar (cluster beans). Rajasthan is Indias largest gaur producer, with a share of 84% in national output. At its peak, the total export value of Indias guar gum  most of it from Rajasthan  rose to Rs 21,287 crore from about Rs 121 crore in 2003-04. In 2016-17, this came down to just Rs 3,106.62, an 85% fall.The boom ended but farmers got used to better lifestyles. They bought cars, tractors and jewellery. The boom was over in 2012-13. What followed were two years of drought beginning 2014-15. Farmers were already in distress. They got angry when they heard the government was going to increase power tariffs, says retired bureaucrat Shankarlal Choudhury.The pastoral economy has also been hit by self-styled cow vigilantes.Laxman Singh, a livestock farmer in Dujod village, says income from cattle trade has dwindled because of cow vigilantism. Milch cattle were like ATMs. If I need money, I just sell them. Theres hardly any buyer now, he said. The government has tried to do its bit. Agriculture minister Prabhulal Saini says the government procured pulses, soyabean and peanuts worth Rs 2,800 crore at minimum support prices.Rajasthan has also promised 6 months of free cow feed to cow shelters worth Rs 50 crore and help set up biogas plants in 25 identified large gaushalas with a subsidy of Rs 40 lakh for each. It is banking on these measures ahead of the crucial poll that will decide the fate of the Vasundhara Raje-led government.The farmers are still unhappy lot. There are stuck on a demand for a total loan waiver. Ratan says he and others have forcibly put off auctioning of 122 land-holdings in Sikar, none of which will be benefit from the current loan waiver because they arent small farmers."

Picture by Animesh SenguptaJamshedpur: Potato prices in the steel city rose sharply from Rs 10/kg on Saturday to Rs 15/kg on Sunday registering a 50 per cent hike in a single day. In Ranchi, tuber rates went up marginally from Rs 10 to Rs 12.""I have been buying potato at Rs 10 per kg for the past one year. Its price remained the same even when onion was selling at Rs 50/kg around four months ago. I was quite surprised by the sudden hike,"" said Subodh Chaudhury, a Tata Steel employee who stays at Bistupur.Sonari resident Rita Sharma said she was also taken aback by the hike. ""Every year, some factor or the other causes potato prices to go up gradually. This was for the first time that its rate jumped from Rs 10 to Rs 15 in a day,"" said Sharma.Shopkeepers are, however, selling the new variety at Rs 12/kg to Rs 13/kg since it's demand is much less compared to the old variety.While the hike has pinched the pockets of consumers, potato sellers justified the rise. Shopkeeper Awadhesh Kumar Shao said they had no option since the price of the item at the wholesale market had spiralled. ""Customers prefer the old variety of potatoes which was in short-supply. Sensing this, the wholesalers raised the price of a 50kg packet from Rs 300 to Rs 450. We had no option but to increase the rate,"" Shao, who runs a shop in Bistupur market, said.On an average, 10 truckloads of potatoes come to the steel city from Bengal every day. On Saturday, only five trucks came. On Sunday, only four truckloads of the tuber were unloaded at Krishi Utpad Bazar Samiti at Parsudih from where its sold to city retailers.Wholesaler Rajkumar Shah said prices have gone up because traders have started stocking the item in cold storages having bought it directly from farmers. ""The stock of the old variety in cold storages has finished and traders are now filling the cold storages with the new produce. They would soon release the fresh stocks and sell it at higher prices,"" said Shah. He hinted that prices would spiral further in coming months.In Ranchi, the wholesale rate of the new variety ( laal aaloo), which was priced between Rs 700 and Rs 850 per quintal on Friday, is now selling at Rs 800-Rs 1000. Similarly, the old variety (sada aaloo), which was priced between Rs 500 and Rs 600 per quintal, is now selling at Rs 700 to Rs 800.In the retail market, prices have gone up by Rs 2 for both the variants. ""I am selling the old variety at Rs 12 compared to Rs 10 last week. Lal aaloo, which was Rs 10, is now being sold at Rs 12 to Rs 13,"" said Vijay Kumar, a prominent seller at Harmu market."

Banks should look to lend to the sector, where investments are required by both individuals and institutions to strengthen the infrastructure, Collector K. Rajamani said.Food processing industry is another area of focus and the district has already initiated measures such as collective farming, procuring, sorting, grading, storing and transporting perishable commodities such as banana and onion with financial support of Rs. 30 crore from NABARD for supply chain management, he said and suggested that bankers step up lending taking advantage of the emerging opportunities in the district.Mr. Rajamani was speaking after releasing the Potential Linked Credit Plan for 2018-19, prepared by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD), here recently. The NABARD has assessed the credit flow potential of the district at Rs. 8259.20 crore, a growth of 10% over the projections for the current year.Mini textile parkDwelling on the potential for industrial growth in the district, Mr. Rajamani said a mini textile park is likely to come up soon on an area of about 10 acres in the district. The textile industry, he observed, is bound to grow rapidly in the district. About 1,000 acres has been earmarked for an SIPCOT industrial park at Manapparai. Opportunities are likely to emerge in ancillary activities supporting Defence and Railway sectors in the district.A trade centre would come up at Panjapur and it would serve as a facilitator for MSME growth. With the Tiruchi airport poised for expansion with Rs. 900 crore investment, it is expected that exports in agri and other sectors would grow, he said. The focus should also be on improving the skills of the work force to seize the advantages, he said.Highlighting the importance of dry land farming, he emphasised the need for improving production and productivity of millets, pulses and oilseeds.Education loansBankers should be considerate and extend education loans to needy people without delay, as it will serve as a catalyst to uplift a generation, he said.S.

5b1786489855b75db2e7a0aa,Onion prices dive on heavy influx,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/onion-prices-dive-on-heavy-influx/articleshow/63084518.cms,2018-02-27,"RAJKOT: Heavy arrival of onions before Holi festival triggered a drastic fall in the price of the commodity leading to shutdown of Bhavnagar Market Yard, considered to be one of the largest market in the country after Nashik in Maharashtra. Onion price on Monday nearly halved to Rs 150-170 per 20kg from Saturdays rate of Rs 350-300 per 20kg. Farmers refused to sell their produce at such a low rate.The average daily arrival in Bhavnagar market is 1.5 lakh bags (50kg each). During the November to April season, an average of 25 lakh bags to 30 lakh bags come for auction at the marketing yard. This season, onion was cultivated in 24,800 hectare against 27,000 hectare last year.D S Royla, secretary of Bhavnagar marketing yard, said, One of the main reasons for the drastic fall is heavy influx of onions from Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh in the domestic market. Earlier, onions from Gujarat were going to southern and northern states but now southern states get onions from Maharashtra, while northern states are covered by the onions from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan.According to market yard authorities, on Saturday, there were 1 lakh unsold bags and on Monday 80,000 more bags arrived for auction creating an imbalance in demand and supply. G Ramani , former secretary of Mahuva market yard in Bhavnagar, said, Sudden arrival of huge stock in the market led to drastic fall. Till last week, because of marriage season farmers did not get labourers to bring the commodity to the market yard. Also, with the Holi festival during the weekend followed by marriage season again, farmers want to sell off their produce to get more cash ahead of the festival. This has led to fall in prices.However, former chairman of Bhavnagar Market Yard Bhikhabhai Zazadia feels the fall was a mere correction in prices. The price was very high even after the season started in November. Price of Rs 300 to 400 per 20kg is the price for Diwali season. When the new season starts in November, price falls, but this year it remained high till February. So, there was a sudden fall which was bound to happen.Farmers, however, disagreed with Zazadias argument. Ramji Mangukia, a farmer of Tana village of Shihor Taluka in Bhavnagar, said, Considering the input cost of seeds, pesticides and labour we cant afford to sell onions at this low price. He had come with 98 bags (20kg each) of onion.Deepak Malani, chairman of Amreli APMC, said, Even white onion price was down because of fall in export demand. There are few dehydration plants which have the monopoly in deciding price of white onions as it is mainly for export, while red onions are for local consumption."

Eggs Kejriwal acquired its name because one of the members, a Mr Kejriwal, was not allowed eggs at home and would relish them cooked in his favourite style at the Club.Other members would describe the dish to the stewards as get me eggs the same way as Kejriwal likes them, informs foodie and funny man Kunal Vijayakar, a veteran of many club meals. The Bombay Gym had a dish named after Jean Manekshaw, a Parsi-French member; and one of the most popular dishes on the menu of Ambassadors Society was its Steak Fernandes, named after its famous chef.What dish would Vijayakar like to have named after himself given the chance? Going by my favourite, it would have to be a Bhujne Kunal Vijayakar. It is fish prepared in garlic and onion, with haldi, chilly and garam masala in the Pathare Prabhu style, says the scion of the traditional Maharashtrian clan, known for its nuanced cuisine.Kunal Vijaykar (HT File )Incidentally, friends of Mehta were bemused that the charismatic conductor had been ascribed with the pomfret preparation. As far as I know, he never spent time at the club during his Mumbai days and his favourite dishes are Goan fish curry and eggs Akuri, said one.Which is what makes this a fishy tale.True LiesStories of corruption amongst the high and mighty often make ones skin crawl, but none comes close to the alleged brazenness of this once-powerful CM, now enjoying just desserts in prison.A visiting American former head of a large MNC recently in India narrated this incident: A deal and an MoU was signed almost a decade ago between his firm and the CMs government. It was known that the firm would earn huge profits from this. The executive was flown down to ink the deal and get a photo op with the CM.When his plane stopped in Dubai for a layover, an Indian bureaucrat boarded and sat next to him, introducing himself as one of the CMs aides, and wasted no time before asking for a bribe. When the exec said his firm did not entertain such deals, the aide told him he had two hours before they landed in India to come up with an offer or the deal was off. Not taking it seriously, the exec proceeded the next day for the signing, only to find the state representatives hadnt showed up.He was told the deal was off and was asked to take the next flight back to the US. The story doesnt end there; so enraged were his principals back home that a few months later he was sacked. And to think all this might not have ended so badly if hed taken the company jet!Modern DictionaryHappy (adjective): Deeply sad, downcast, miserable (eg: That Pharrell Williams looked downright happy playing Holi in India didnt he?)Diamonds in the sunLisa Haydon and Nirav Modi (HT File )Her tanned, lissome beauty, dwarfing beleaguered jeweller Nirav Modi, has been part of the breaking news loop ever since the fraud came to light, but his one-time brand ambassador model and actress, the London-based Lisa Haydon, has moved on quite emphatically with marriage and motherhood.But this week was witness to Haydon returning to India, this time en famille with son Zack and husband Dino Lalwani for a celebration in Goa. The entire family has gathered to celebrate Dads birthday, she said, of her father-in-law, the tech and lifestyle tycoon, Phuket-based, Gulu Lalwani.The gathering will also celebrate the birthday of Dinos aunt, entrepreneur and gypsetter Bina Ramani, which also falls this week.

There is demand for 20 tonnes per day in Kaleswara Rao market, and we only received seven tonnes till the third week of February.Arrival of onion from Kurnool has increased recently, and prices are falling, he said. On Monday, some 12 stalls at Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazaar sold onions, as against three earlier.M Samatha, a homemaker, said, Quality of onions at Rythu bazaar is very poor, and we are forced to buy them considering the cheaper price. Price of onion got stagnated at Rs 30 for more than three months, and now we can buy them for half the price.Prices of vegetables have also come down. Tomatoes are available for Rs 9 per kg. Green chillies cost only Rs 15 a kg, she said.Officials of agriculture marketing department said the fall in veggie prices is because of huge supply from local yards. Swaraj Maidan Rythu Bazar Estate officer Ajay Kumar , said, There is a chance of further fall in onion prices as supply increases However, cost of tomatoes, eggplant, and green and leafy vegetables, will increase with rise in temperatures."

It is estimated that it will cost Rs. 1.95 lakh for establishing a low-cost onion storage unit. Eligible farmers will be given 50% subsidy.A shed opened at Marudhur near Lalgudi under the NHM is all set to store shallots raised on the field of A. Sebastian. The shed can store 250 tonnes of shallots. Provisions have been made to protect them from rain. The facility for free aeration enables the farmers to store onions for at least four months. The sufficient air flow protects the shallots from hot weather conditions too.We have so far followed the method of storing onion in our fields by covering them with thatches. We have now realised that it is unscientific. We hope that the low-cost onion storage units will serve the purpose of selling shallots when it is in high demand, Mr. Sebastian says.R. Krishnamoorthy, Deputy Director, Horticulture, Tiruchi district, said all 67 beneficiaries had been identified for 2017-18. Most of them had set up storage units. Most of the beneficiaries were from Thuraiyur, Uppiliapuram, Thathaiyargarpettai, Mannachanallur and Thottiam blocks, which were considered as onion belt in Tiruchi district."

The arrival of summer onions has increased to 40% of the total arrivals. Also, there has been an increase in arrival of onions in other markets. This has led to a drop in demand from Nashik .The price trend is expected to be downwards for the next two-three weeks considering the huge arrival of onions. Farmers cant store kharif crop as its shelf life is less than a month. Hence, the prices are expected to drop to Rs 750 per quintal, said an APMC official.The minimum and maximum wholesale prices were Rs 700 and Rs 1,080 per quintal, respectively, on Wednesday, when around 20,000 quintals of onions were auctioned.The drop in the wholesale prices reflected in the retail market where the prices have dropped from Rs 40 a kg to Rs 20 a kg in a month.In a bid to stop the fall in prices, the Union government had removed the minimum export price on onion last month. However, the prices continued to decline.Meanwhile, the harvest of summer onions is expected to pick up in the next two weeks.

But an audience with the 75-year-old farmer of T Kalathur in Perambalur district reveals that it is his singular effort undertaken with a lot of passion in the face of acute water shortage.Mohanakrishnans feat is that he has been growing and selling nearly a thousand varieties of herbs, medicinal plants and trees, many of them rare, on 15 acres of his ancestral land for the past 40 years. While most of these are organically grown, he has also been cultivating onion and cotton for livelihood.Here is a list of the trees he has been growing  Ven Naval, Aathi, Thiruvodu, Vengai, Karungali (used for making temple caskets), Kadukai, DEDE tree (for making natural colour), Mattipal (making frankincense) and Laxmitharu (medicine for diabetic). The herbs include Aathandai, Kundumani, Athi Mathuram, Thaya plant (for sugar), Insulin plant, Ranakalli (for kidney ailments), Milakarani (medicine for poisonous bites), Arockya Patchai, Onan Kodi, Melkathikgai, Mul Nangai, Poonai Meesai, Thazhuthalai (knee pain). ll of them are on the verge of extinction, says Mohanakrishnan.Since his ancestors were practising Ayurveda, he had initially thought of following the tradition. However, he changed his mind later and decided to grow the herbs for commercial purpose. My grandfather as well as my father practised Ayurvedic medicine. When I was thinking of becoming an Ayurveda doctor, I realised that it will not help me earn a decent income. That changed my mind and I started concentrating on nurturing all types of medicinal plants, herbs and trees. My sons M Mahendran and M Muralikrishnan are helping me out, he added.He has spent several days crisscrossing the state in search of rare medicinal plants and herbs and on the foothills of Pachamalai and Kolli hills. He had also visited these hills many times with college students to help them identify rare herbs. Mohanakrishnan has also addressed many workshops conducted at Agriculture University in Coimbatore and several colleges across the state to create awareness on the importance of herbs, rare medicinal plants and trees and how those should be safeguarded.On the business front, many people do visit his farm at T Kalathur to buy rare varieties for the preparation of medicines. However, he says his dreams to make it big have been hampered by water shortage. He had donated an acre of land to the government to establish a farm pond, which was now providing water to many farmers. Water is the main constraint for nurturing plants. If the state government extends a helping hand, I can grow more plants which would ultimately benefit our people. If I get a loan to establish water sources or to market the plants commercially I will be able to expand the farm in a big way, he said."

But the delicious snacks the shop has been serving all these years have won a lot of admirers for the 55-year-old woman. The eatery which has many loyal customers is located on West Adaiyavalanjan Street in Srirangam.Ask one of her regular snackers what they love to pick first from the shop and the answer is likely to be Tirumaal vadai. That is one item which my customers never get tired of. Within minutes of preparing the vadais, they get sold out. Most of those who come to my eatery tell me that ours is the best vadai they have ever tasted, says Shagunthala proudly. The specialty vadai is made of black gram and pepper. Besides this sought-after snack, the eatery also has a dedicated following for mint and onion pakoda.Asked how she learnt to make Tirumaal vadai, she said, It kind of tastes like vadais that we get as prasad in temples. I just made my own version of it. According to her, at least 500 customers come to her eatery every day. This is the reason why I make sure I dont take leave and my shop is open throughout the year, she said.Open from 4.30 pm to 8.30 pm, the other snack varieties at Shagunthalas shop include medhu vadai, masala vadai, potato bonda, chilli bajji, plantain bajji apart from the sweets adhirasam and boli. While adhirasam and boli cost Rs 5 apiece, four pieces of the rest of the items are available at Rs 10.Shagunthala credited much of her eaterys success to her husband. Though I run it, my husband helps me a lot. Hes the one who prepares the dough for all the items. He never gets tired, she said. The Srirangam-resident said she was immensely satisfied with the fact that the prime reason to start the eatery had been fulfilled. I started it so that I could provide good education to my children. My son is now working abroad and my daughter is leading a happy married life. This is all I wanted, she said.When asked if she had any plans to expand her business, she said, No, not at all. Its tough to manage this place itself. If I get greedy, Ill ultimately be the sufferer in the end, she said."

They forgot that it was the two youth leaders Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani who brought the foot soldiers which compensated for the lack of cadres in the Congress. (Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal New Delhi) The showing in Gujarat made the Congress complacent. They forgot that it was the two youth leaders Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani who brought the foot soldiers which compensated for the lack of cadres in the Congress. (Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal New Delhi)The interesting fact about the BJPs victory in Tripura is not that the CPM lost one of its last two bases of power. It was the annihilation of the Congress which gave a decisive signal. Rahul Gandhi must have known the game was up. That is probably why he was with his naani in Italy rather than facing the music in person in the Northeast.The excuses given by the Opposition for the BJPs victory were the usual ones. That the BJP threw money around, were communalist etc. The facts are much more mundane. Rahul finds it difficult to focus on any political chore for a week at a time. Amit Shah, on the other hand, is relentlessly active, fighting election after election. In elections, you need cadres that can work around the clock and leadership which gives them important guidance. The contrast between the two party presidents is telling.The showing in Gujarat made the Congress complacent. They forgot that it was the two youth leaders Hardik Patel and Jignesh Mevani who brought the foot soldiers which compensated for the lack of cadres in the Congress. People join the Congress to get tickets, not to work hard at the grassroots to spread the political message.The penny may have dropped for the other parties that the Congress is not reliable. With its new Hindutva ideology, many opposition parties will be wary before joining it in a coalition. The Trinamool Congresss Mamata Banerjee has already signalled that she wants a Third Front. This would be a coalition that someone like Mr Asaduddin Owaisi can join with a clean conscience. He will not be comfortable with a party boasting of its pucca Brahmin leadership.This may also be the attitude of Mayawati and the BSP, as well as the Yadav parties.It is a whole year till the general elections. One should never take any election for granted. The one loss the BJP suffered was in Rajasthan. In Madhya Pradesh bypolls, the Congress retained its seats; the BJP did not lose any. Add to that the triumph in the Northeast even as the Opposition was trying to connect the Nirav Modi scandal with the Prime Minister because of the similar name. The public is not that stupid. It ignored the bank fraud.For the government, the economic news will improve as the year goes by. The GDP growth rate is already above 7 per cent. Inflation is under control, but you never know whether another onion crisis would break out. The big challenge is jobs. As I have argued before, there can only be few formal desk jobs. There are other opportunities to earn livelihoods  roji. The pakodawala does not have a job but he earns a livelihood. The government has to show that opportunities to earn livelihoods are being created. As the economy is largely informal and services-oriented, most livelihood opportunities will be informal. NITI Aayog needs to clarify the situation.The things that could go wrong for the government is the behaviour of its MLAs and MPs. Power may or may not corrupt. It definitely makes politicians in power arrogant. The attacks on the statues of Ambedkar and Periyar show that while Narendra Modi wants sabka saath, many BJP members are still stuck in a Brahminical state of mind.

Potato crop is also likely to remain down to stagnant this sowing season, horticulture departments senior official said.The official said, Heavy losses suffered by onion and tomato farmers in the past months has discouraged sowing.In June 2017, farmers staged protest in the entire state after onion prices slid to Rs 2 per kg. Tomato prices have also tumbled this season to Rs 5 per kg-Rs 8 per kg in the wholesale market on increased arrivals.Agriculture experts said, even the soil moisture remained less during the sowing period owing to less rains.Farmers shifted to chana as it gave better returns to farmers last season. Also chana requires less water making it the preferred choice of farmers when rains are not sufficient, said Kailash Agrawal , an agriculture expert.Chana and wheat are the leading winter sown crops of the region.Agriculture departments statistics stated that farmers have sown wheat on over 5.75 lakh hectare while chana was sown on 4.75 lakh hectare in Indore division.Horticulture department expects yield of potato to remain lower this season hitting output due to lower soil moisture.Mohan Pandey, a wholesaler of vegetables in Choithram market said, Prices of onions and tomatoes are unlikely to pick up from the current levels in near term as supplies from the old stocks and neighbouring states are sufficient to meet the demand."

Onion prices have recorded a correction at a time when the central government has announced a special initiative for the crop along with tomato and potato.Onion prices have dipped again in the wholesale markets with the bulb trading below Rs 1,000 per quintal. A bumper crop in Maharashtra as well as early arrival of rabi onions in the wholesale markets of states like Gujarat and Rajasthan led to a steep price correction which traders say is likely to remain for the rest of the season. On Wednesday, the average price of onions at Lasalagon wholesale market in Nashik was Rs 788 per quintal  one third of the price it fetched in January. Onion prices have been showing a downward trend since the beginning of March. In most wholesale markets, average traded price was below Rs 1,000 per quintal.This is in sharp contrast to the price trend a few weeks back when prices were hovering between Rs 1,500-2,000 per quintal. Prices had crossed the Rs 3,000 mark in November, December and January which spiked the prices in the retail markets as well. The eight-month bull run, farmers had said, had come after almost a 15 month slump which saw farmers selling onions at throw away prices of Rs 300-5,00 quintals. The price slump is due a bumper summer or rabi crop which has started arriving in the markets. Maharashtra has reported around 3.5 lakh hectares under summer onion this year as against the 3 lakh hectares last year. Also onion crop area has increased in neighbouring states of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra accounts for almost 60 per cent of the summer crop.Farmers normally store their produce in moisture and heat proof structures called Kanda chawl to dispose them of later in the season. Rabi onions normally feed the market from March till the arrival of the new kharif crop later in September.Jaydutt Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaons wholesale market, said that the bumper arrivals have brought down prices.

Grocery shop owners in the city cashed in on the huge demand by selling the small onion variety for Rs. 150 a kg in May, June and July last year. In fact, the government had to step in and sell them in farm fresh outlets at cost price in order to stabilise the market rate.This time of the year, however, it is a different story. The prices of shallot have crashed in Tiruchi market due to copious influx from major onion production centres. They are now for the taking for Rs. 18 and Rs. 24 per kg.On Wednesday, a kg of high quality onion sold at Rs. 24 and the Mysore variety at Rs. 18.Traders attribute heavy arrivals from production centres to the steep drop in prices.

But it has increased to 25 to 30 loads during the last two weeks.Onion production in the State seems to be on average scale. But heavy arrival of shallot from Karnataka is the main reason for the price slash, says P. Chandru, a wholesale trader at Gandhi Market.Traders say there are chances of the prices coming down further in the days to come."

The WPI data showed prices of pulses contracted an annual 24.3%, while those of vegetables rose 15.4% during the month, slower than the 36.7% rise in the previous month. Onion prices remained stubborn, increasing nearly 80% in February but lower than 127% in the previous month.Available trends suggest a pick-up in prices of some cereals, edible oils and milk was offset by a continued correction in prices of onions and tomatoes in the current month. Moreover, average crude oil prices so far in March 2018 remain lower than the trend for the previous month. However, an unfavourable base effect for crude petroleum and natural gas, and fuel and power is likely to push up the WPI inflation in March 2018. At present, we expect the average WPI inflation to rise to 3.9% in FY2019 from around 2.9% in FY2018, said Aditi Nayar, principal economist at credit rating agency ICRA.With both retail and wholesale inflation recording a decline in February 2018, the MPC is likely to keep the repo rate unchanged in the upcoming policy review in April 2018, she added."

He incorporated Vikram Global Commodities Private Limited with its headquarters at APMC Yard, on January 25, 2011. He and his wife, Sunitha Acharya, were directors of the firm, which had an authorized capital of Rs 5 crore and paid up capital of Rs 3.96 crore.A civil engineering graduate from BMS College of Engineering, Bengaluru, Srinath claimed that he learnt the rudiments of the commodities business in Singapore, where he worked for some time. He returned to India in early 2000 and began dabbling in agri produce exports.Srinath was born and brought up in Mysuru. His father Rama Rao , originally from Doddaballapur, 40km from Bengaluru, shifted to Mysuru and later to Bengaluru, a police officer said.A chance meeting with a distant relative, LIC agent and JP Nagar resident Narasimha Murthy, provided Srinath an opportunity to scale up his business. Impressed by Srinaths presentation of his agri produce export business, Murthy invested some money and got huge returns. Murthy immediately got his friends and relatives to invest in Srinaths business.Police said the other two accused  Sutram Suresh, a former sports journalist and resident of Malleswaram, and KC Nagaraj, a resident of Dommalur  are LIC agents who were introduced to Srinath by Murthy. Prahlad, a classmate of Srinath and resident of AGS Layout, too joined them.Srinath designated his four fellow accused as Wealth Managers. Police said Murthy targeted middle class people to invest in the firm, while Sutram brought in high-profile individuals, including sports personalities, doctors and engineers. The investments mobilized by these two run into several hundreds of crores. Prahlad and Nagaraj could only get investments of Rs 5 crore and Rs 4 crore, respectively, a police officer who is part of the investigation said.As investments grew, Srinath opened his firms branches at Yelahanka New Town and Banashankari in Bengaluru, and also in Chennai. A friend, Ashokan Vaithilingam, helped him run the commodities trading business from Chennai.Srinath floated Cargo & Logistics Management (India) Private Limited, which was incorporated with the Registrar of Companies in Chennai on May 25, 2012. The firm is headquartered at Dr Natesan Salai Extension, Ashok Nagar, Chennai. We are verifying the details of the Chennai firm, a police officer said."

He found the man haggling with an ambulance driver to get his dead childs body to the graveyard. Pasha saw the father send the body off and then head in his direction. He wanted to know if there was a canteen nearby where he could have a meal. The man hadnt eaten all day, he said, hoping to save the money for his childs treatment. It was that encounter that led to the initiative Doh Roti  started by Pasha and his friend Fayaz Ahmed about two months ago.Along with a group of volunteers and help from well-wishers, they make and distribute 400 meals (rice and dal) and 300 rotis to relatives of patients atHospital,Cancer Hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center.The duo first began distributing meals to about 300 people every day near IGICH. Later, they met Mysurus Body Miyan Ayub Ahmed (who has been performing the last rites for unclaimed bodies, for the last twenty years in Mysuru), and Azhar Maqsudi (who feeds the hungry in Hyderabad in a similar initiative). With help and advice from them, Pasha and Ahmed scaled up and Doh Roti was started.(BM wrote about Ayub Ahmed on Feb 13, 2017 - Call him Body Miyan.)Pasha, who runs a hotel in, says: We took a room in Bilal Masjid to cook the food. Now we are a group of 25 volunteers. Every day, we cook between 10 am and 1 pm. After prayers, we begin the distribution. In the first round, relatives of patients at Jayadeva hospital and Al Bilal Diagnostic Center get the meals. Then, we go toand distribute there.The groups aim, he says, is to ensure that nobody sleeps hungry. Hunger has no religion, he adds.Arul Subramani, who runs an NGO for those infected with HIV, volunteers with this group.Weve been friends for a long time so it was easy to make this possible. We cook about 35 kg of rice every day. We also need about 12 kg of onion and tomato, 3 kg of other vegetables; this we usually get through contributions. A small food company here gives the 300 rotis. Each meal costs us Rs22, he explains.Sometimes, demand overshoots supply, and they have to replenish before heading for Kidwai, but its all taken care of.Ahmed, who co-founded the initiative, saysis a hospital hub. Patients come from various parts of the state and country for treatment and they stay on. While the government provides free food for patients, their caretakers have to fend for themselves. Not everybody can afford to eat out three meals. This is why we want to help, he explains.Luckily for them, theres plenty of help available. Their initiative has inspired others to open their hearts too. Ansar Khan, also a volunteer, tells how. I buy the vegetables from a shop in Madiwala. One day, the woman from whom I buy in bulk got curious and asked me why I needed so much every day and I explained to her our work. From then on, she has refused to take money for the vegetables, says Khan.Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have benefited from the teams dedicated efforts already.Anjanappa Nayka, whose son is being treated at Jayadeva Hospital, has come to the city from Raichur. I came here seven days ago. It is really hard to afford the food here; it is three times more expensive. A person at the hospital told me about the free food in the afternoon. It has been a relief; there are others like me too who have benefited from this, he said.The initiative is such a hit now that Ayub Ahmed has started it in Mysuru at. And team has also finalised the plan to start this in Tumakuru."

Nearly 20,000 tons of white onion is lying at farmers end.White onion is dehydrated and exported in European countries. Out of the nearly 100 dehydration plants in Mahuva, 70 are in dysfunctional condition. Currently, farmers get Rs 60 to 70 per 20 kg, however, their production cost is Rs 140. According to farmers, they are booking losses in the prices for the last three years as a result of which the production this year has reduced by 25% compared to last year. This year, the production of white onion is nearly 45,000 ton, which was 60,000 ton last year.Chairman of Mahua market yard Ghanshyam Patel said, White onion is only exported and there is very little domestic consumption. The owners of dehydration plants compete with each other and sell onions at lowest price in the international market, which is US $900 to US $1200 per ton. However, the onions from other countries fetch between US $1,500 and US $1,800. We want government to fix minimum export price (MEP) for onion for the benefit of farmers.India exports 40% of worlds requirement of onion and its the second biggest exporter of onion after America, which sends out 45% of its produce. The export business of onion is centralized in Mahuva and white onion of Nashik also come to dehydration plants here.Former president of All India Dehydration Vegetables Association Vitthal Koradia said, We export 50,000 to 60,000 tons per year, but since last 2-3 years, we have over stocked because the prices are low. Last years stock is also lying in the cold storage and nearly 25,000 tons is unsold for which we are searching market. Our 70% plants are non-functional because they have no capacity to bear more loss.Traders wants government to implement pre-Goods and Service Tax (GST) policy for export. Before the implementation of GST, we used to get 7% transportation assistance, which has now been reduced to 3%. As a result, the transportation cost is increased. Traders who have huge stock are also paying interest on finance, rent and electricity bill of cold storage. We are also facing tough competition from China and America."

(Image used for representational purpose) Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. (Image used for representational purpose)A little over a month since the Union Budget declared a special Operation Green for tomato, onion and potato growers, prices of at least the first two produces seem to be touching an all-time low in the state. With wholesale prices of both the commodities going down to single digits, most farmers are staring at major agrarian distress. In Maharashtra, the wholesale markets of Junnar in Pune and Pimpalgaon in Nashik are major hubs of tomato trade.On Friday, the Pimpalgaons market had recorded the arrival of 695 crates of tomatoes, and the average traded price per crate was Rs 61. With a crate containing 20 kg of tomato, the average price per kg works out to be Rs 3 at the wholesale markets. Similarly, at the Narayangaon wholesale market, 6,330 crates of the produce had arrived, and the average traded price of a crate was Rs 60, which also translates to Rs 3 per kg. Junnar is normally the hub of summer tomatoes, while Pimpalgaon mostly gets the the winter crop.Onions, which till recently, were trading above the Rs 20 per kg mark, has also started trading below the Rs 10 per kg at most wholesale markets. At Lasalgaons wholesale market in Nashiks Niphad taluka, the average traded price of onion was Rs 7.54 per kg, with the market recording the arrival of 15,140 quintals of the bulb. Just about a month ago, onions were trading at Rs 15.50 per kg at this market, a steady fall of over 50 per cent.Maharashtra has seen a 10-15 per cent rise in area under cultivation for both onions and tomatoes. Shriram Ghadhave, president of the Vegetable Growers Association of India (VGAI), attributed this growth to the good rainfall received in the state last year. As against the 2.5 lakh hectares of tomato area, this year, we have about 3 lakh hectares under the crop. Even places like Beed, Aurangabad and Parbhani, which normally do not see cultivation of summer tomatoes, have planted the crop, he said.A similar situation has resulted in the steep price fall in case of onions also. Ghadhave added that inter-state trade has almost stopped with traders from north India absent from the market.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The farmers demanded crop loan waiver and purchase of crops at minimum support price, among others. The state government later waived farm loans up to Rs 50,000, and started the process to procure crops at MSP.Sikar district is a hub of onion cultivation in Rajasthan and this year the production is expected to be about 4.50 to 5 lakh metric tonnes as against states total output of 12.80 lakh metric tonnes. There are about 50,000 onion growers in the region.With farmers not getting reasonable prices for onion, many of them have dumped the produce at Sikar mandi as they await buyers, AIKS leaders said.As against the price of Rs 10-12 per kg two weeks ago, the farmers are now getting Rs 3-4 per kg at the krishi upaj mandi, AIKS leader Amra Ram said. At times, there are no buyers at even these prices. The input cost for growing onions is about Rs 8 per kg.Officials said prices crash whenever there is a glut in the market and will pick up soon. This year the onion cultivation area in Sikar district is estimated at 13,000 to 14,000 hectares while the yield is 350 quintals per hectare. The prices crash whenever there is a glut, but will recover when the supply to other states pick up, said B S Yadav, Sikar assistant director, horticulture.Onion production in Rajasthan in 2017-18 has been estimated at 1.28 million tonnes. The state contributes about 6% of Indias onion production estimated at 21.4 million tonnes in 2017-18.Only a few days ago, onions were selling at Rs 10 kg and then fell to Rs 7, and now to Rs 5. We are not able to recover our input cost that is about Rs 8 per kg, said Satyajit Bithare, a farmer in Rasidpura village.The governments move to build an exclusive onion mandi at Rasidpura village in Sikar has been delayed. The other major onion hub in the state is Nagaur where the onion prices have also crashed.Prices at Maharashtras Lasalgaon mandi near Nashik, have also crashed with rising arrivals, but are ruling higher than what the farmers are getting in Sikar.Prices rose after last August, with delay in kharif crop arrivals and estimates of lower production in 2017-18 by one million tonne. After peaking in January first week, the prices have fallen since."

So for four weeks now they will be serving cuisines of four different Rajasthani cities.The cuisine of every city has evolved based on the ingredients that are readily available and the preferences of its people, says Neha.Till Saturday its Jaipur week. So try the Pyaaz Ki Kachori, Sogri Ki Bhujji (a dry item made of the grated radish flower) and Bajre ki Khichdi. Despite its name, this khichdi is no shade of yellow. The bajra (pearl millet) gives it a greyish-white colour and the watery dish tastes even better with ghee and jaggery.The Jaipur thali.The star attractions of all cities (clockwise from above left)- Pyaaz Ki Kachori of Jaipur, Mirchi Vada of Jodhpur, Bharwan Alu Gravy of Jaisalmer and Sohan Halwa of Udaipur. Pictures by Shubham PaulOn Sunday will start Udaipur week, says Neha. This is a city that has many Jains, so the food will be sans onion and garlic. Save the Khasta Kachori Chaat in the starter section, all dishes here are quite light. Even the Rajasthani stapleDal Baati Churma has been replaced with Dal Gajra Ro Baati Sang Churma that uses the lighter grain gajra instead of wheat. The star dish of Udaipur however is the sticky dessert Sohan Halwa.Jodhpur is a spicy city so brace yourself for Mirchi Vada, says Neha, whose ancestors are from the Jodhpur-Udaipur region. The vada is made of stuffed big green chillies and relished with Lehsoon Ri Chutney (garlic sauce) or Keri Ri Lungi (a green mango puree). Also save space for Bajre Ka Khichdo and mind you, khichdo is not khichdi.Unlike khichdi, khichdo is not watery. Its dry and youll feel granules of bajra in your mouth, says Neha.The fourth city Jaisalmer is known for its tandoor items and so the must-have is the spicy tandoori dish Bharwan Aloo Gravy. Every menu gets a customised drink along with the meals and Jaisalmer gets Kairi Ro Pani, a sweet-and-sour mango and tamarind drink that also helps digestion.The four weeks will offer various kinds of rotis along with the main course such as Missi and Jowar Roti. Made of corn, the crispy, yellow Missi Roti has a sweetish tinge and so goes well with sour curd-based items like Gatte Ki Sabji.Jowar Roti on the other hand is a light and healthy option and goes well with pulses.While one can pick dishes from the a la carte menu one can also go for the thali, that includes every item on offer for a particular city.

Those who have registered for Bhavantar will get the benefit, too.Officials said the decision to exclude these three crops from Bhavantar was taken after the Centre announced benefits under the scheme for Kharif crops. The Centre is yet to decide whether to include Rabi crops, barring wheat and paddy, under Bhavantar. As per the formula, the Centre will have to bear expensesof Rs12,000crore under Bhavantar and after thorough discussion, Delhi will take the decision to include gram, lentil and mustard under Bhavantar, said Rajesh Rajora, principal secretary of agriculture department.Chouhan is hopeful that Bhavantar will get countrywide acceptance after the Centres approval. On Sunday, I will address farmers of MP and inform them about government welfare schemes. Niti Ayog is also working on Bhavantar and we are hopeful that farmers will soon get an appropriate plan to help them financially, said Chouhan."

Even two NITI Aayog meetings over three schemes were held on March 1 and 9, but it could not happen at the last moment, highly-placed government sources said.The BBY was launched in kharif 2017 as a pilot project and the government wanted to replicate it as a full-fledged scheme in rabi this year, which is why the CM had announced it in a major farmers rally in Bhopal at Jamboree maidan in Bhopal on February 12 this year, they said.It was beyond the means of the state to bear Centres share of around Rs 1,000 crore to Rs 1,500 crore, sources said.And the last, but an equally significant reason, sources explained, was disenchantment of farmers with Bhawantar at many places . A large number of farmers were not able to sell their produce under BBY under the criteria of FAQ (fair average quality) of grains. Lower price for the produce if grains were inferior than FAQ triggered resentment, sources said.The government was panicky as three rabi crops  lentil (masoor), gram (chana ) and mustard (sarson)  arrived in markets and the Centre was not issuing notification, the chief minister visited Delhi on March 23 only to be told that the three schemes would not be rolled out, sources claimed.After a delayed cabinet meeting the same day late in evening, the CM announced his decision in a hurriedly-convened press conference.But he insisted garlic and onion would continue to be in BBY. Besides, the government has already declared to procure poppy husk from farmers. It would require about Rs 40 to Rs 50 crore and the husk would be burnt to destroy it.By adding garlic in BBY and announcement of poppy husk, the government would be targeting farmers especially the powerful Patidars of Mandsaur, Neemuch, Ratlam, Ujjain and other parts of western MP, sources said.Farmers associations criticised the government for withdrawing the BBY. Shivkumar Sharma alias Kakkaji of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, said, This is 16th amendment in BBY by the government. It should stop befooling farmers. It should also compensate farmers for losses incurred in BBY in last kharif season.Anil Yadav of Bhartiya Kisan Sangh , said, We always demanded to withdraw the scheme, which was against the interest of the farmers.Bhopal: When chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced withdrawal of three Rabi crops from Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana on Friday evening, it took many by surprise.Highly placed sources said the CM was banking on the Centre for funds, hoping Delhi would roll out Bhavantar as one of the three nationwide schemes to procure farm produce. The other two being Market Assurance Scheme (MAS) and a subsidy scheme for corporate houses (they would procure directly from farmers and government would provide subsidy to corporates).We were sure of these schemes for a long time. Two NITI Aayog meetings were held for these schemes on March 1 and 9, but things didnt materialise at the last moment, a source said.Bhavantar was launched in kharif 2017 as a pilot project. The government aimed to turn it into a full-fledged scheme in rabi this year, which is why the CM had announced it at a major farmers rally in Bhopal at Jamboree maidan on February 12 this year, they said.However, financially it was beyond the means of the state to bear the Centres share of around Rs 1,000-1,500 crore, sources said. And the last, but equally significant reason, was reported disenchantment among a section of farmers with Bhavantar, sources said.A large number of farmers were not able to sell their produce under Bhavantar under the criteria of FAQ (fair average quality) of grains. Lower price for the produce if grains were inferior than FAQ triggered resentment, sources said.The governments worry rose as three rabi crops  lentil (masoor), gram (chana ) and mustard (sarson)  arrived in markets and the Centre hadnt issued the notification that MP was hoping for.The chief minister visited Delhi on March 23 only to be told that the three schemes would not be rolled out, an official said. After a delayed cabinet meeting the same day late in evening, the CM announced at a hurriedly-convened press conference that masoor, chana and sarson will be under MSP.But garlic and onion would continue to be in Bhavantar, he assured. Besides, the government has already declared to procure poppy husk from farmers and destroy it. It will cost the state Rs 40-50 crore.By adding garlic in Bhavantar and the poopy husk sop, the government is wooing the powerful Patidars of Mandsaur, Neemuch, Ratlam, Ujjain and other parts of western MP, sources said.Farmer associations criticised the government for withdrawing the three crops from Bhavantar. Shivkumar Sharma aka Kakkaji of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Sangh, said, This is the 16th amendment in Bhavantar. The government should stop fooling farmers.

5b149ad79855b72ada07d8b4,Why do farmers go marching?,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/why-do-farmers-go-marching/article23351136.ece,2018-03-26,"Why are Indian farmers perpetually in revolt? The question has been raised by many after the recent farmers march to Mumbai and simmering rebellions across the States in recent years.No doubt, agriculture is one segment of the economy on which vote-conscious governments havent skimped on outlays. Over the years, Central governments have allocated ever-rising sums towards procurement, input subsidies and rural employment schemes, while States have periodically announced loan waivers.But that farmer protests have persisted, and even intensified, perhaps shows that many of these schemes arent addressing the right set of problems. The reasons for agricultural distress have changed quite dramatically in recent years.From shortage to plentyA few years ago, farmers seeking to register their protest used to do so beside wilted crops and parched farmlands.But in the last couple of years, farmers from Mandsaur to Salem have given vent to their angst by dumping vast quantities of unsold produce  tomatoes, grapes, onions and milk  on lakebeds and national highways.Historically, agricultural distress in India has been linked to truant monsoons, input shortages and lacklustre yields which frequently put growers on the road to penury.In recent years though, it is surplus output and unremunerative prices that have decimated farm incomes more often.Trends in Indias agricultural output over the last twenty years present an eye-opener to this problem of plenty.For an extended period from 1998-99 to 2009-10, Indias rice output stayed stuck at 85 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes, with drought years such as 2002 and 2004 seeing sharp downward blips.As consumption hovered at 80 to 90 million tonnes in this period, shortages were more frequent than surpluses.But after climbing to 105 million tonnes in 2011-12, Indias rice production has stayed well above the 100 million-tonne mark for the last six years, even scaling110 million tonnes in 2016-17. With offtake still stuck at about 90 million tonnes, theres been persisting excess stock in the market. As a result, in the last five years, wholesale prices of paddy have crept up at a 2.4% annual rate.The wheat story is similar. From a yearly average of about 75 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, wheat output leapfrogged to average 94 million tonnes in the last six years. Output, now at 97-98 million tonnes, is now neck-and-neck with domestic demand (about 100 million tonnes) and it may only be a matter of time before it overshoots it. With rising supplies, wholesale wheat prices have inched up at a 2% yearly rate in the last five years.Not too long ago, India was facing a severe shortage of pulses, with output struggling to keep up with the rising protein intake of the masses. But farmers have dramatically ramped up pulses production too. From an annual average of 14 million tonnes in the decade to 2010-11, it has averaged 18 lakh tonnes in the last six years. India harvested a record pulses crop of 23 million tonnes in 2017, matching the official demand estimate, thus dampening once-high market prices for a range of dals. This script of galloping surpluses dampening prices has played out in commercial crops such as sugarcane and tea too.If unremunerative prices have dogged other crops, fruit and vegetable farmers have been up against the high perishability of their produce. In the last fifteen years, India has doubled its potato output, trebled its tomato harvest and managed a fourfold increase in onion output. But poor storage facilities and State laws that keep farmers bound to their local mandis, have exposed farmers to wild swings in prices.Driving the outputIt is noteworthy that agricultural output has held up at relatively high levels in recent years, despite erratic monsoons. This could be because the droughts in 2014 and 2015 have been far less severe than those in 2009 or 2002.In 2014, a drought year, the country still harvested 105 million tonnes of rice, 86 million tonnes of wheat and 17 million tonnes of pulses. Hefty hikes in the Centres Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) have also had a big role to play in farmers ratcheting up output. In the last ten years, the support prices for wheat and paddy have risen 73% and 108% and those on pulses have trebled. In recent years, State governments have also competed furiously with the Centre, announcing bonuses and their own support prices for crops such as onions, tomatoes, potatoes and even green chillies.Illusory profitsIt is early days yet to say if recent improvements in Indias farm output are here to stay. But after responding enthusiastically to signals from MSPs for many years, farmers have lately found the mechanism failing them. Market prices for many crops have tended to plunge and stay below their official MSPs for extended periods.For one, though the Centre announces MSPs for 24 crops, the bulk of its procurement operations (via FCI) are restricted to just two  rice and wheat, with NAFED chipping in on pulses.State-level procurement operations are even more adhoc, lacking both direction and funding. Therefore, while a farmer may plant mustard, grapes or onions in any given year based on the MSP promise, theres really no guarantee that he will get that price when he visits the mandi.Two, even in crops where the Centre or State agencies are active, their market interventions tend to be too selective and sporadic to make any real difference to a majority of farmers. Despite the Centre doubling down on procurement in 2017-18, it will mop up only about a third of Indias rice and wheat output and a tenth of the pulses harvest. So, if good monsoons result in more crops moving into surplus zone, market forces will continue to prevail over MSPs.Three, given that the Centres market interventions on rice and wheat have proved so ineffectual despite large spends, it is unclear how the Centre or copycat States will fund MSPs in a host of other crops.New fixesTo be fair, the NDA has been trying out new policy fixes to address such problems. It is piloting price deficiency payments in place of MSPs to compensate farmers for price-related losses.It plans to replace input subsidies with direct cash transfers. It has kick-started a national electronic market for produce and is nudging States to repeal their APMC Acts, which prevent farmers from selling in markets of their choice.But its aggressive inflation-fighting efforts and on-off trade policies still work to the detriment of farmers. In the last couple of years, despite supply gluts, the Centre has continued with sizeable imports of wheat and pulses at low tariffs.Handling of spikesSeasonal spikes in prices of sugar, atta or rice are often met with export taxes, minimum export prices or even outright export bans.States, on their part, continue to be quite adamant about levying high taxes and hanging on to the draconian mandis, which force farmers to rely heavily on middlemen.This puts the Indian farmer in a Heads I win, tails you lose situation. If market prices of crops hit rock-bottom, the government is helpless to rescue them. But if prices soar, the government prevents them from making hay by clamping down.All this makes it clear why Indian farmers are seething. Its for the same reason that salaried employees are often unhappy. Who would like being rewarded peanuts, after being highly productive?"

Rajasthan farmers are facing financial difficulties as they are not getting fair price for their produce  gram, mustard, wheat and garlic.In the last four years, the BJP government in Rajasthan stopped additional bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat, started by the previous Congress government, Gehlot said. Our government in 2012-13 for the first time gave Rs 100 per quintal bonus to farmers on purchase of wheat; for this, a grant of Rs 200 crore was given. In 2013-14, additional bonus of Rs 150 per quintal was given on wheat purchase.There has been a bumper production of gram in Kota division, which the farmers want to sell on support price, Gehlot said. In the absence of adequate arrangements to purchase gram on support price, farmers have to sell gram at Rs 3500 per quintal and mustard at Rs 3600 per quintal. The support price of gram is Rs 4400 and of mustard is Rs 4000.Farmers who sold moong (green gram) on support price are waiting for payment and making rounds of the Rajasthan state cooperative federation and banks, Gehlot alleged.After Maharashtra, Rajasthan produces maximum onion. Farmers are already in debt and fall in prices of onion and garlic has added to their worry. In view of farmers interest, the state government should purchase onion on fair price, Gehlot said."

Bangalore Times spoke to some of them to find out what Easter means to them, the traditions they follow on this particular day and what the lavish feast consists ofFor actress Sharmiela Mandre , Easter brings back a lot of childhood memories. Since my mothers side of the family is Catholic, we begin the day by going to church. After that, we visit family members and usually end up at my grandmothers house for a traditional Easter lunch, which is a mix of dishes like Roast Chicken and Turkey , and desserts made by my grandmother. My favourite is the Banofee Pie, says Sharmiela.* 250g digestive biscuits, crushed* 100g butter, melted* 4 small bananas* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* Grated chocolate to garnish* Caramel (can be made from scratch or bought from the store)* 2 tablespoon of brown sugar for the cream* Put the crushed biscuit into a bowl with melted butter. Mix it together thoroughly. Press the mixture into the base and sides of the tin. Chill for 10 minutes. This will form the base of the pie.* Now, spread the caramel over the base with the help of a spoon.* Slice the bananas and scatter them on top. Now, put the cream on top (beaten previously for about 15 minutes with brown sugar) and decorate with grated chocolate.* Store it in the refrigerator until youre ready to eat it.Easter is all about getting together with the family. There arent any traditions that we follow in particular but its a big get-together and we eat till we drop. There are a lot of traditional Kerala dishes that are prepared on Easter by my wife, that I love to eat, says Bruce. His favourite- appam and chicken stew.* 1 kg chicken pieces* 20 cardamon pods* 6 inch cinnamon stick* 7 cloves* 2 large onions* 4 inch ginger piece finely chopped* 10 medium size green chillies (or less if you prefer a milder stew)* 1/4 teaspoon pepper* 1 tablespoon coriander powder* 1/2 teaspoon garam masala powder* 1/4 teaspoon turmeric powder* 2 large potatoes  diced* 1 cup thick coconut milk* 5 tablespoon oil* Curry leaves* Salt* Heat oil, then add the mustard seeds. Once the mustard seeds crackle, add cardamom, cinnamon, cloves and mix well.* Add ginger, chopped onions, green chilli and curry leaves.

(If using fresh coconut, add its thick extract first and then the thinner extract of coconut milk. If using processed coconut milk, add some water or milk to thin it and bring to the desired consistency.)On Easter, there is one tradition that we have been following for years and thats an Easter egg hunt. Its mostly for the kids but we have been doing it every year. In addition to this, there is a lavish lunch that the family feasts on. Personally, I look forward to the desserts the most, prepared by my sister- in-law, says Rohit.* 200 grams of semi-sweet chocolate (you can use cooking chocolate as well)* 2 tablespoons unsalted butter* 1 teaspoon of instant coffee ( in 1 teaspoon of hot water)* 300ml carton whipping cream, whipped* 500 grams of whipping cream or thick cream*  teaspoon of vanilla extract* Chop the chocolate into small pieces and save a small piece for the garnish.* Place chocolate and butter into a microwave safe bowl, and heat for 30 seconds at a time until the chocolate has melted.* Remove from microwave and add the coffee syrup.* Whisk for a few minutes until totally combined and slightly cool.

Shetti, a two-time MP from Kolhapurs Hatkhanagale constituency, spoke to Partha Sarathi Biswas about ongoing efforts towards building a farmers vote bankWhat is the significance of the whole opposition coming together for farmers causes, and is this the first time such a mobilisation has happened?Attempts to create a political consensus around agrarian issues have been made in the past, but such efforts were not successful. The creation of a vote bank, or even political dialogue, around the subject is difficult for many reasons. In India, the fragmentation of farmers is myriad, and it is difficult for them to come together. Taking advantage of this, political parties have, so far, refused to address farmers as a single unit or a vote bank, and instead, kept them divided on the lines of caste, creed and region, among others.For the political leadership, the angst of the consumer is more important than the distress of the farmer for the simple reason that the former is united. For example, if prices of onions cross a certain threshold, then consumers from Kashmir to Kanyakumari will be united, but the same will not be the case if wholesale prices of onions fall. Then, only the onion grower would become vocal. This lack of cohesion between the growers is a major hurdle for the formation of a farmers vote bank, or for political parties to take up agrarian issues at the national level. So, this would be the first time that all farmers leaders have come together on the same platform and compelled political parties to listen. In the run-up to the 2014 general elections, issues like black money and corruption were on the agenda, but the 2019 elections will be fought on farmers issues.How was this unity achieved? What were the common causes that made the farmers unite?Under the banner of AIKSCC, farmers leaders have been working towards getting all farmers together on common issues. The task was challenging, given the deep and often rigid differences. Our committee had representation from groups who were opposed to globalisation, as well as from groups that welcomed it. During discussions, two points emerged on which all of us agreed: The demand for complete loan waiver for farmers and the implementation of the M S Swaminathan Commissions recommendations, which assured remunerations equal to 1.5 times the production cost. During discussions, farmer leaders came to the conclusion that the present indebtedness was due to poor prices. So, till remunerative returns are assured, we will not be free of the vicious cycle of unending loans. The incidents of farmers being shot dead at Mandsaur, Madhya Pradesh, had also acted as a clarion call for all farmers leaders to forget their differences and join forces. We understood that if we remained fragmented, we would not be able to get justice for our cause.Our demand for loan waiver is based on facts. Recently, the government has announced the Seventh Pay Commission, and government servants were to get arrears as well. In our case, the farmers are in debt as they have not been able to get remunerative prices. The recommendations of the Swaminathan Commission were given in 2005, but not a single government has implemented them. So, farmers are asking for a complete loan waiver.Why were only opposition leaders invited for the discussions? What is the next step?Our movement is for farmers, and we will go with any political party which assures us of meeting our two main demands. In a democratic set up, the present day opposition party is the future government, and thus, we need to maintain a dialogue with them to ensure our demands are met. The present government has, unfortunately, let farmers down, and we cannot believe them till they directly implement our suggestions.How will you keep the momentum of the movement going till the elections?In Maharashtra, I will soon embark on a state-wide yatra to raise awareness amongst farmers. With prices of each and every commodity at an all-time low, we will be talking to farmers and telling them not to get disheartened. We will tell our farmers that we are trying to create a viable alternative to the BJP, and that they should support us. At this hour of need, we will tell them to be with us and not to take the extreme step of committing suicide.Farmers leaders have realised that while we are not strong enough to form a government, we can play the crucial role of a pivot, and swing the balance of power. All our efforts will now be directed towards strengthening that role.For all the latest Mumbai News, download Indian Express App"
5aeaa6d19855b73f522c1af3,Why a Farm Loan Waiver Is the Holy Grail,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-a-farm-loan-waiver-is-the-holy-grail/story-bvEFNmVfHL1MpdqQzkIGSJ.html,2018-04-03,"On an October afternoon in 1988, Mahendra Singh Tikait, a rustic and hardy farm leader from western Uttar Pradesh, stormed Delhi with his men. They came in a fleet of lumbering tractors, around 80,000 peasants, cattle, hay to be used as bedding and foodgrains to see them through an unrelenting protest.It was the scene of a spectacular rural takeover of Delhi. Tens of thousands of farmers erected tents, slept, cooked food and ate in the open as well as defecated there, laying siege to the Boat Club lawns, a stones throw from Parliament. They vowed to not budge until their demands for higher sugarcane prices and a waiver of electricity charges were met.Tikaits Bhartiya Kisan Union successfully extracted key concessions from the then Rajiv Gandhi-led government.Farm protests have seldom been so strong, but in Maharashtra in March, 35,000 farmers walked 180 km on a long march to reach Mumbai from the states Nashik district seeking loan waivers  a turnout not seen since the days of Tikaits agitation.Farm loan waivers have now become the new rallying point for farmers movement because there are just losses, losses everywhere, says Amra Ram, a leader of the All-India Kisan Sabha, the organisation that led the long march.Under the NDA government, farmers havent fared too well due to a combination of factors, including two successive droughts and a slump in global food prices. This has led farmers groups and lobbies to re-energise themselves around two key demands  loan waivers and profitable prices.Dont call it a protest. Ours is a political movement of farmers, says Kedar Sirohi, the Indore-based social-media savvy leader of the Aam Kisan Union (General Farmers Union).Before Tikait, there was another tall peasant leader in Chaudhary Charan Singh, a former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh (UP). His biographer Paul Brass, a professor at the University of Washington, writes in An Indian Political Life that Charan Singh was devoted throughout his political career to the interests of the peasantry.According to Brass, Singh, a known detractor of Nehru, sowed the seeds of a strong farmers lobby in north India by first dissenting against the Congress 1959 Nagpur Resolution on Agriculture, which advocated collectivisation and a cooperative model for the farm sector.The Nagpur Resolution was the most significant agrarian programme formulated by the Congress since the abolition of zamindari in several States, wrote Walter Hauser in a January 1959 piece in The Economic and Political Weekly, analysing Singhs role. Singh contended that cooperatives will lead to bigness and that this, with mechanized agriculture, would result in a decrease in per capita production rather than an increase, Hauser writes.Building on his peasant support base, Charan Singh went on to become prime minister.Read: Agriculture not always a dead end: Here are young, successful farmers who made the cutThe green revolution of 1960s saw farmers prosper and emerge as a class of bullock capitalists, a term coined by American political scientists Lloyd I. Rudolph and Susan Rudolph to describe the empowered Indian agrarian class. Bullock capitalists were well-to-do enough to raise their voice politically, but werent fully capitalist farmers, the Rudolphs logic went.This was followed by the rise of powerful farmer organisations. These included Rajya Ryot Sangha in Karnataka, the Bharatiya Kisan Union in UP and Punjab as well as the Tamil Nadu Agriculturists Association in Tamil Nadu and the Shetkari Sanghatana in Maharashtra.A new era of social-media-enabled farm movement has now taken over.As it heads into a crucial general election due next year, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has promised a slew of measures to quell farmer protests, including prices that are at least 50% over production costs.The Congress has promised a fresh loan waiver if voted to power like the one it announced in 2008 (and which played a part in its return to power in 2009).The BJP-ruled states of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, UP and Congress-ruled Punjab have already announced loan waivers, forced by protests.Maharashtra (also ruled by the BJP) did so too.Loan waivers are a pressing demand because the single biggest cause of agrarian distress is indebtedness. Farmers take loans to buy inputs such as seeds and irrigation machinery. Many of these farmers get into debt traps when crops fail or prices fall.The Situation Assessment Surveys of the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO, 2013) has reconfirmed the situation analysed in 2003 by the NSSOs 59th round of indebtedness of farm households. It showed that 52% of farm households in India are in debt.Loan waivers could have a bearing on the combined fiscal deficit of states. According to India Ratings and Research, farm debt waivers announced by five states together are likely to widen the combined fiscal deficit of states by ?107700 crore. Bankers have argued against farm loan waivers because they are no panacea and could affect credit growth.According to Reserve Bank of India data, bad loans in agriculture have increased by ?11,400-crore in 2017 to over ?60,000 crore, a jump of 23%, from 2016.From 2012-13, the year before the BJP government took office, till 2016-17, bad loans in the agriculture sector have increased 142.74%. The biggest defaults were during in 2016-17, suggesting a worsening of agrarian distress.RBI data further shows that compared to 20.83% defaults by corporate borrowers, defaults by farmers stood at only 6% of their total outstanding.This shows that farmers dont willfully default. Why dont they catch the bigger thieves? asks Ram of the All India Kisan Sabha.Agricultural economist AV Manjunatha of the Bangalore-based Institute of Social and Economic Change, who carried out an all-India study on farmer suicides, says farmers in real distress do need some sort of system to report distress. They also need facilities to negotiate loan restructuring. These could be adopted as policy solutions, he said.A new phase of farmers mobilisation has put both state and central governments on a tight leash. Reforms in markets and other structural measures for a better farming future dont appeal as much as loan waivers.They put my land on notice for auction. Its the only thing I have. Only a loan waiver can save me, says Tulchha Ram, an onion grower from Rajasthan Sikars district."
5b17828f9855b7604256bf52,‘I avoid creating one-dimensional characters’,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/i-avoid-creating-one-dimensional-characters/article23429294.ece,2018-04-04,"A book usually gives a fair idea about its author even if one never gets to meet him face-to-face. There may be exceptions but it holds true for Perumal Murugan, the Tamil writer, several of whose books have been translated into English. The latest being Poonachi or The story of a black goat (Context).We meet at The Parks Mist restaurant for lunch. Asking the staff to suggest South Indian cuisine, Murugan quickly settles for onion uttapam. I can never say no to onion uttapam; its my favourite, he says with a genial smile. Meanwhile, fresh watermelon juice is served providing a perfect start to our chat.With a collection of poems and short stories and now Poonachi , Murugan seems to have gotten over the controversy created over his book Madhorubhagan or One Part Woman . Referring to it, he observes, I do not hold any grudge or hard feelings. What I am very sorrowful about is that peoplewho did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me. It must have been hard giving up writing? No, on the contrary, I got enough time to spend with my family, grow potted plants and devote time to academics, says Murugan with the help of an interpretor.For Murugan, writing has been a second nature since he was eight. There was a childrens programme on Trichy radio station in which poems written by kids were read out. I used to regularly contribute for that. I wrote everyday because I am introvert, retiring and shy by nature. I did not talk a lot, and always avoided crowds. So, writing poems and stories substituted social interaction. Believe it or not, I managed to fill up 30 notebooks, he recalls.Writing short stories commenced from Class IX. I was inspired after reading graphic tales in magazines which I could not afford but my aunt used to buy. Gradually, my teachers came to know and encouraged me to participate in local school contests. Thus set in motion was Murugans life long passion for chiselling words.Pursuing Ph.D., Murugans first novel Eru Veyyil (The Rising Heat) was published in 1991 which he wrote during his summer vacations. I was 25 then and wrote it staying with my mother in a thatched hut with no electricity. My mother would be busy with the livestock while I lost sense of time adhering to my own clock. I used to only sleep, eat and write, never going out. This got her worried with many suggesting that I had lost my mind. So before returning to Chennai, she made me wear a holy thread blessed by a pujari around the waist. Every time I returned home I had to show it to her, he jests. As a child he loved sitting on a village boulder scribbling in his notebooks. My neighbours would tell me that one day I will get stuck to the boulder and would have to be surgically separated from it.Having lost his father early, Murugan was very close to his mother. I was called a mamas boy even after I got married. In a certain sense I narrate my mothers story through Poonachi. Like the goat, she too was the seventh child who lost her mother at birth; was a loner with her father being rarely at home. Their filial bond is so strong that even today Murugan has kept his mothers cell phone and SIM card as a memory.So is Murugan like his mother, a staunch believer of God? In my early years I was, visiting Kali and Murugan temples regularly. Later, studying Marxism and Periyars works, I started questioning, with the intensity of worship coming down. Those days, I argued with my mother on several occasions. Over the years reading more on these issues, I have come to the conclusion that whether God exists or not is not important but what is pertinent is whether He is necessary or not. For those He is, they must believe in Him without being criticised. Espousing live and let live, his belief sounds fair. Continuing, he adds, I do like to spend time at some of my favourite temples and tend to embrace the spiritual component of religion.The staff brings in sizzling onion uttapam with different chutneys, the coconut and its mint and tomato flavoured versions. Trying each of them, Murugan, gestures his appreciation. The uttapam is crisp and well made and the chutneys delicious. Not averse to trying local cuisine, the writer generally prefers South Indian dishes. I relish idlis, ragi dosa made with palm sugar, rice and paruppu kuzhambu; dishes made of country chicken but staying in Korea for a writers residency I had local preparation for a month without any fuss. Hailing from a rural region, Murugan has a weakness for vegetables. I love bitter gourd, suraikai (bottle gourd), lady finger, podalangai (snake gourd), brinjal and peerkangai (ridge gourd). The joke at home is whenever I am sent to buy vegetables these are bound to figure. Murugan does miss some preparations of his native place like kachayam, made of rice flour and jaggery and soiyang, a steamed pulse based dish kneaded with palm sugar. With passage of time, people have stopped making them.Calling himself a reasonable cook, Murugan reveals that like writing, he embraced cooking very early in life. With my parents leaving early to work on fields, my brother and I used to prepare and eat breakfast and walk five kilometres to school. We simply learnt by observing mother and helping her. He counts arisi paruppa, milagai (black pepper) and herbal rasams as his best preparation. The ridge gourd subzi I whip up, is relished by my wife so much that on returning home after holidays she always asks me to make it.Murugans felicity with cooking comes across in some of his works too. Yes, it does, but not deliberately, only on demand of the narrative. For example, in Arthanari and Aalavayan , sequels to the One Part Woman , I talk about how to grow and prepare a local variety of egg plant as mother used to. In Poonachi, I write about rice gruel and how to make dry salted meat pieces for future use. Likewise, in Seasons of the Palm there is description of ragi porridge.Drawing parallelsHaving learnt to wield the pen and cooking spud since childhood, Murugan says one can draw a lot of parallels between the two arts. For cooking and writing, passion, perseverance and persistence are must. Also to excel in their craft, the cook and writer must get out of their comfort zone and try something new. And eventually, both food and a work of literature must satisfy people.Reflecting on the making of a writer, Murugan states, The command over language and the content selection comes with experience. The foundation of good writing is the ability to get past ones own value system because that is what holds us from absorbing a lot of things. A good writer has to suspend his own value system and assimilate experiences. Did this come to him naturally? No, in many of my early works, for example, my short story collection, Thiruchengodu , I was heavily biased. Later I got over them and started writing on issues considered taboo by society. Examples of these are Pee Kadaigal (tales about shit) and Kethavarthe Pesarae (I speak bad words).Talking about keeping aside biases, Murugan is remarkable for etching characters which are neither black nor white. I avoid creating one dimensional characters. I believe all humans are a mix of both. In Poonachi, the old lady who is very caring to the goat becomes selfish when it comes to her survival. In her early years, her love is pure and selfless while later when she faces financial crunch, her kindness becomes conditional but that does not make her an villain. That is the way humans are, he remarks as we wind up our interaction.What I am very sorrowful about is that people who did not read my book protested against it. That is what dismayed me"
5aea9e289855b73f522c1496,"Farmers Want Assured Prices, Not Waivers",https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-want-assured-prices-not-waivers/story-mc1gXHel11gHcaIbzhlyKK.html,2018-04-04,"Sudam Khandbahale, a 46-year-old farmer from Mahirawani village in Maharashtras Nasik district, 167 km from Mumbai, hacked down his one-acre grape vineyard this month, frustrated that the plantation hadnt borne fruit for the second year in a row.Khandbahales vineyard was hit by cyclone Ockhi last year, turning his Rs 3 lakh investment to dust. He says he will harvest the last crop tomatoes planted over an acrein April and then quit farming. Year after year, we are struggling against falling market prices, vagaries of climate, an apathetic government and indebtedness. Farming is all that I know but it is no longer viable. I will put up a shop, sell tea or lease out my land, but I wont farm anymore, said Khandbahale, who owns three acres of land.In June last year, Khandbahale was one of the thousands of farmers in Maharashtra who took to the streets to protest against the agrarian crisis the state is battling. One of the central demands of the protesters was a complete loan waiver.As supply of vegetables and milk to the cities stopped, the two-day strike forced chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to announce a farm loan waiver worth Rs 34,000 crore, a demand he had resisted since 2014.Less than a year after the strike and the waiver  up to Rs 1.50 lakh per family  farmers remain unimpressed. In Nasik and Ahmednagar districts, which bore the brunt of the protests, farmers say the waiver hasnt helped ease their struggle.Bowing to pressure The Maharashtra govt announced a loan waiver last June. Farmers say it hasnt helped ease their struggle so far Rs 34,000 cr farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017 Rs 1.5 lakh per family cap has been put on the loan waiver. This includes principal and interest amount, crop loans as well as mid-term loans from 2009 to June 2016 The scheme had three components  besides the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver, it offered a one-time settlement option for those whose loans were farm loan waiver was announced by the state government after protests by farmers in June 2017per family cap has been put on the loan waiver.

Out of these, 3.038 million have applied for a full waiver and remaining for the incentive cash amount. Another Rs 10,000 crore has been budgeted for the waiver.Khandbahale owes Rs 8.5 lakh to a bank in Nasik. He can benefit from the Rs 1.5 lakh waiver only after he pays the remaining amount he owes. I dont have Rs 7 lakh in hand, why would I keep incurring more debt if I had the money? I may have to sell off some of my land to make that last payment to the bank. We dont need waivers. We can repay our loans if we get assured prices for our produce, he said.In Putamba village of Ahmednagar district, ground zero of the last years strike, farmers remain disaffected.The loan waiver helps banks more than us. So, the government should stop pretending they have done something big for farmers. If they want to help, then they should increase minimum support prices (MSP), procure the produce from us, said Salim Shaikh, an onion farmer from the village, who may not be able to take advantage of the waiver. This year, his income from soyabean and onion has been minimal. He owes a nationalised bank Rs 3.5 lakh he borrowed as a mid-term loan and Rs 2 lakh as a crop loanThe governments list of beneficiaries shows Maharashtra has 1 million farmers like Khandbahale and Shaikh who owe more than Rs 1.50 lakh to banks. Such farmers have been offered a one-time settlement (OTS)pay off the remaining amount to the bank and get a Rs 1.50 lakh waiver. Not many farmers are in a position to take up this offer.Shaikhs neighbour Rajendra Dhakchaule, a marginal farmer with just two acres of cultivable land, can repay most of his Rs 1.70 lakh debt with the waiver. But his worries dont end with this.I had taken a loan of Rs 3.5 lakh for a tractor and under pressure collected money from a money lender to pay off this loan. I may get some respite due to the loan waiver but thats fleeting help. The ground situation for farmers like me is unsustainable, he says, breaking down.This year, the Dhakchaules spent Rs 56,000 to cultivate onion over an acre of land, but the family of six may not recover even the cultivation costs as onion prices have dropped to Rs 700 per quintal from Rs 3000 per quintal this January. This is an eight-month low for onions.In neighbouring Pimpalgaon village, Vijay Waghchowre, a marginal farmer who owns four acres of land, is still waiting for confirmation of the waiver from his bank.The waiver may help us marginally this year. But I still owe another Rs 2 lakh to a moneylender. If the government wants to help farmers, let it give us subsidies or offer assured prices for our produce.The BJP-led state government is counting on the goodwill of marginal farmers like Dhakchaule to help it tide over the rural discontent.The directives of the chief minister were to ensure a system whereby the loan waiver would be transparent, inclusive and swift. We were careful to learn from the mistakes of the past loan waiver, said Kaustubh Dhavse, officer on special duty at the chief ministers office, who was involved in devising the online system for the loan waiver. There had been connivance at the level of banks, government and farmers earlier to give benefits to ineligible farmers. In our case, there is no room for such connivance because the online system does not allow for it. The waiver has offered benefit to maximum genuine farmers.Goodwill for the government isnt visible on the ground.A section of farmers leaders is continuing protests for a complete loan waiver. This month, as nearly 30,000 largely tribal cultivators marched from Nasik to Mumbai, the leaders put the demand back on their agenda. This was despite a majority of the protestors demanding their rights over forest lands and not a waiver as they have no access to banks.As a temporary relief to farmers to overcome the current distress, a complete loan waiver is essential. Thats why we continue to flag it whenever possible. A hike in MSP is one of our main demands and the state has failed to deliver on that too, said Ajit Navale, general secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, involved in both the farmers protests.The loan waiver has a limited scope. Consider this, the total crop loan debt on the states farmers is Rs 1.13 lakh crore; the government so far has spent only Rs 13,580 crore on the loan waiver, he said."

Raje arrived in Sikar Firday on a four-day visit.The farmers in Rajasthan are up in arms against the government over its failure to procure Rabi crops at minimum support price (MSP). While the state government has made arrangements to procure major crops, including wheat, at MSP, farmers union have alleged that the designated centers for wheat were too less and it was not possible for those living in remote villages to access them.Apart from wheat, farmers are also being forced to sell other crops such as mustard and chana (gram/ chick pea) at below MSP, according to the union leaders.As against MSP of 4,000 per quintal, farmers are selling mustard at Rs 3,500. The situation is worse for chana. It is being sold at Rs 3,000-Rs 3,500 per quintal while the MSP was set at Rs 4,400. The MSP for wheat is Rs 1,735 per quintal, but at most mandis farmers are selling it for Rs 1,500, Kisan Mahapanchayat leader Rampal Jat said. We plan to gherao the chief minister during her visit to Sri Madhopur on April 9, he added.On April 3, police had detained Jat along with about 50 other farmers when they were trying to march to chief ministers residence in Civil Lines area.The farmers affiliated to All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) are holding demonstrations at mandis in Kota district to protest steep fall in the prices of garlic. In Sikar, farmers are holding protest against steep fall in onion prices.Wheat is being purchased at MSP by Food Corporation of India (FCI) at 207 designated centers in Rajasthan. It is up to the farmers to sell the wheat at designated centers, a state agriculture department official said requesting anonymity.Jat, however, said that FCI procures crops during a 90-day period and it was not possible for farmers from more than 45,000 villages across Rajasthan to access 207 centers. So they are forced to sell their produce below the MSP at nearby mandis. In addition, farmers are getting only Rs 1,200 for jowar against the MSP of 1,425, he said.Other farmer unions are also unhappy. In February, AIKS leader Amra Ram had spent four days in jail after he attempted to lead a farmers protest march to the Rajasthan assembly. On February 22, Rajasthan Police had arrested 179 farmers from different locations and detained around another 2,000 who were marching to Jaipur to stage a sit-in outside the assembly that was in session."

Some airlines are embracing the idea of healthier flying, offering calorie-conscious menus and new exercise videos.According to Beth McGroarty, research director for The Global Wellness Institute, a non-profit organisation for the wellness industry, even as seats shrink and flights get more crowded, many carriers want air travel to be more bearable (and even enjoyable). They believe wellness is the way to do that. Its part of the larger wellness movement happening in the travel industry, she says.More democraticAnd, unlike the usual trend of ramping up onboard amenities for only their first- and business-class customers and stripping them away for passengers in economy, Ms. McGroarty says that no passengers are left out in this recent wellness push. Wellness in the air, in many instances, is more democratic.All customers on United Airlines and JetBlue have access to the popular digital meditation service Headspace as a part of their in-flight entertainment. JetBlues Headspace content includes videos that address travel topics such as fear of flying and difficulty sleeping upright.Among international carriers, Swiss Air offers Headspace onboard long-haul flights, and British Airways has a Well Being channel on its in-flight entertainment systems that includes meditation and stretching exercises. Hong Kong-based carrier Cathay Pacific recently launched six in-flight videos, called Travel Well With Yoga, in a partnership with Pure Yoga, the popular yoga studio chain. Videos are between five and 20 minutes, and feature yoga and meditation exercises such as hip and back stretches and deep breathing.Passenger surveysAmerican Airlines started prioritising wellness after conducting customer surveys and running focus groups with fliers about what they want. We learned that our passengers care a lot about their well-being, says Nick Richards, the companys director of customer experience.According to Americans research, travellers wanted to sleep more soundly in the skies, and to that end, the airline recently tapped mattress and bedding brand Casper to design pillows, blankets and other products that are supposed to help with a more comfortable sleep. Premium economy passengers receive a lumbar pillow and a soft cotton blanket while the Casper amenities for international first- and business-class passengers include mattress pads, pillows, blankets and pyjamas.Tucking inMental well-being and sleep aside, airlines are also incorporating wellness onboard by offering healthier food and drink options.Turkish Airlines, for instance, has a new Fly Good Feel Good campaign that includes a menu of herbal teas such as one with rooibos, sage and lavender to help relieve stress and promote sleep. Another is an energising blend with mate, mint and ginger. Children are offered a traditional Turkish drink with milk, carob powder and date syrup thats meant to strengthen the bones.In January, TAP Air Portugal tapped five Michelin-starred Portuguese chefs to create low-calorie Portuguese-influenced entrees for its business-class passengers. Those entrees will also be offered to economy passengers starting this summer, says Joel Fragata, head of the airlines in-flight products.Jos Avillez, of the two Michelin-starred Lisbon restaurant Belcanto, crafted a stone bass in tomato and onion stew, along with coriander and basil potatoes for TAPs flyers while Henrique S Pessoa, of the Michelin-starred Alma, also in Lisbon, came up with a lemongrass and ginger chicken curry.A handful of domestic, American carriers, too, are encouraging mindful eating. Dr. Charles Platkin, a nutrition and public health advocate, and the director of the Hunter College NYC Food Policy Center, conducts an annual airline food study where he analyses the economy food of every domestic carrier.NY Times"

Subsequently, we identified a godown where the goods were stored and kept a vigil, he said.Soon after the truck laden with the syrup bottles came out, the narcotics team stopped and searched it, the ADG added.The printed price on the syrup bottles led to an estimate that consignment was valued at Rs 61.44 lakh. But each syrup bottle is sold at Rs 300 in black market, thus escalating its value to Rs 1.92 crore, Kapoor said.The narcotics police also found 145 sacks of onions and seven sacks of potatoes in the truck.Truck driver Mohanlal Pathak, 54, a resident of Ravidas Nagar, was booked under Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act.The driver told the interrogators that the he was paid a meagre sum to transport the consignment to Siliguri in West Bengal.We are in the process of ascertaining modus operandi of smugglers. Prima facie, it appears that the branded syrup was procured at godown through legal channels from Himachal Pradesh based manufacturing company. But they were being pushed into the back channels, Kapoor said.The cough syrup, which is often misused by addicts to get high due to the codeine content, is believed to be supplied by the dummy firms in the state through back-channels to Kolkata and Bangladesh , where the demand is high.In September 2017, Madhya Pradesh's drug controller's office had suspended licences of eight pharmaceutical wholesalers of Ujjain for a brief period, after a probe revealed that over six lakh bottles of codeine based cough syrups were sold by them to a dummy firm in Bhopal.According to United Nations Office of Drug and Crime (UNODC), codeine is a narcotic drug and causes addiction when used in large quantities over a period of time. Cough preparation containing chlorpheniramine maleate, an anti-histaminic, in addition to codeine phosphate, have been widely abused in certain areas of east and north-eastern states.Empty bottles of codeine phosphate cough syrups of different brands are often found in public and touristy places, a UNODC report said."

Venkatram Reddy. But, he said the farmers were impatient and sold off the produce.Mr. Reddy said the farmers could take up storage of onion in fields in naturally ventilated godowns made of sticks to allow air pass through freely.The higher grade onion which was big in size arrived from Lasalgaon where the climate and alluvial soil was conducive to the crop. Also, the water used for irrigating the crop had less electro conductivity and balanced chloride and flouride.

Drumsticks are among the few seasonal vegetables that are cheaper.P. Sukumar, treasurer, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flowers Merchants Welfare Association, said the prices of vegetables begin to increase in April as yield would be less due to depleting groundwater sources. Even vegetables like chayote (chow chow) that are priced within Rs. 15 a kg are costly as the market did not receive its share from Karnataka. The demand for cucumber and lime has also pushed the prices up this week.The Koyambedu market receives 320 truckloads of produce daily, which is nearly 80 trucks less compared to March.We dont expect a steep hike like last March as there is sporadic rainfall across the State now and also in Karnataka.

It is one of the desired destinations for food enthusiasts for five decades.At least 250 people visit the eatery every day for their samosas and vaazhai poo vadai. The snacks are aptly served with tasty mint chutney. In fact, the vadais and samosas are prepared non-stop at the cart since they are immediately sold out once placed on the tray. Both vadai and samosa are priced at Rs 5 per piece.Mohamed is the third generation owner of the food cart, which was launched by his grandfather 50 years ago. ""Once I was handed over the cart, my first target was to experiment with the snack items that were served. I brought a twist to the conventional samosas by using vaazhai poo and onion as stuffing instead of the normal potato and onion,"" Mohamed said, adding that he chose vaazhai poo because of its health benefits.Since both wheat and maida flours are mixed in equal proportions for making the dough, the crispiness is very good, said the 50-year-old. ""The mint chutney, which is served with the snacks, is loved by everyone,"" he said.Though the cart is operates only from 5 pm to 8.30 pm in the evenings, work starts at 5 am for Mohamed. ""I go to Gandhi Market and purchase vegetables since I use only fresh ingredients and never use leftovers,"" he said. The preparation for the stuffing begins at 10 am and goes on up to 3 pm.When asked on why he restricted the menu to only two varieties of snack items, Mohamed said that he didnt want to take the risk and compromise on quality. ""I have only one helper and if I get greedy and add more snack items, to increase profit, I would end up losing my customers since it is impossible to maintain the same quality,"" he stated.The cart owner also said that he had no plans of expanding his business. ""I believe in minimalistic lifestyle. And its no different when it comes to my business too,"" he said with a philosophical note."

This mango season treat yourself to the ongoing mango festival 'Aamlicious' at Khandani Rajdhani chain of restaurants spread over 27 cities in India and one in the Middle East. Rajdhani is known for its king size thali of Guajarati cuisine that they serve to their customers. This mango season, be ready to witness the riot of flavours, spices and celebration of senses that lingers for days. The Aamlicious festival will end on May 31, across the country.I was lucky enough to witness and enjoy their Aamlicious thali at Indiranagar branch. As welcome drinks, they served us with two refreshing drinks, one being the kairi panna, a raw mango based tangy drink. It was sweet, savour and salty and had a touch of Jeera, which was very well balanced. The other one being the mango thandai, a concoction of riped mango, a handful of rich Pista and badam. This drink was more on a heavier side and truly rich in flavours. Next up, they started with serving four varieties of chutney - kairi onion chutney, kairi coconut chutney, green chutney and chunda mango chutney. The chutney had a sour yet tangy taste to it.The waiters then quickly kept filling the thali with a number of items. The mango corn bhel and kacchi kairi khichiya chat were a relish to eat and the crispy bhel and tangy mango syrup was also a delight. After this, they started to serve the main dishes, which consisted of 20 varieties of items. One of their speciality is the aam dal dhokli, which was prepared with normal dal, with a touch of raw mango and the special Gujarat dhokli. It had the correct amount of spice with a touch of tanginess from the raw mango. The special roti they had prepared was the kairi maithi thelpa. It wasnt the regular thepla which is usually prepared, but it had a taste of raw mango in it, with dollops of butter and pure ghee. Fajito khadi was another dish that grabbed my attention instantly, khadi as we eat is the normal khadi with pakoda, but this particular one had riped mango flavour which made it a sweet khadi.The thali consisted of not only mango based dishes but were accompanied with their regular dishes like, parwal ki subji, paneer ki subji and the Gujarati dal. Their aim was not to make the whole platter mango-based, as that would stop the customer from eating more. Hence, they stayed with the idea of keeping regular dishes. The dhoklas werent as exciting as the other items, as it did not stand up to the mango flavour.No meal can be complete without desserts. One more brilliant surprise was waiting to be tasted which was the hapus jalebi. This was nothing like the regular round jalebi. It was prepared by dipping small pieces of mango into the jalebi batter and deep fried until golden brown. As you take your first bite, the concoction of mango and sugar syrup takes you to another world of satisfaction.

In the citys famed Chala market, vegetables prices are at a low  cabbage - Rs. 18, carrot - Rs. 26, thundan green chilli  Rs. 20, brinjal - Rs. 20, nendran  Rs. 44, Rasa kadali - Rs. 30, snake gourd - Rs. 30, onion - Rs. 20.The price of Thundan mulagu , which had climbed to more than Rs. 400 a few months ago, was Rs. 25 on Saturday, while shallots was available for Rs. 36, down from Rs. 120 to Rs. 140 sometime ago. A wholesale vegetable trader said there was indeed a slight increase in prices owing to the hike in transportation charges, but there was no discernible impact in the market, as vegetable prices were very low owing to good production. If the transportation cost earlier was Rs. 2.5, today it is Rs. 3, he said.Prices were unlikely to increase for a month or two, but would go up again if farmers did not get the desired returns and failed to grow another round of vegetables. A retail trader in the market said provision prices too were stable. Tuvar dal ( sambar parippu ) cost Rs. 80 a kg and sugar Rs. 37, down Rs. 1 from Friday.A wholesale provision dealer said rise in fuel prices was usually reflected in the cost of provisions, but it was perhaps a bit too early to say the prices would not rise. We may be able to know how things go when the next truckload arrives, in a couple of days.Mohammed Rafeek, president of the Chala main unit of the Kerala Vyapari Vyavasayi Ekopana Samithi, said petrol did not matter much but diesel price hike was hurting the traders badly. Vegetable prices were stable, but those trading in other commodities were absorbing this increase in cost. Even parcel services will increase their charges now.Mr. Rafeek said price revision by oil retailers was being met without much protests because it was not a festival or wedding season and families were focussing on school reopening. Had that not been the case, there would have a been a huge brouhaha and the authorities would have taken a lot of heat."

The farmers are apparently betting big on floriculture in view of growing demand for cut flowers in the country and abroad.The farmers, who used to cultivate capsicum, British cucumber, onion shallots etc, are diversifying to floriculture with a view to improve their earnings. The farmers in the district used to cultivate capsicum and other exotic vegetables in 37 acre. The farmers used to earn Rs. 8 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh per acre when capsicum was being cultivated. But, of late, they found that prices of capsicum would fall if there was a bumper crop in neighbouring Karnataka.Farmers like Akbar Basha felt that floriculture is an alternative way to tide over the problem and switched over to cultivation of cut roses. He began cultivation of hybrid roses in 2.17 acre land. Thanks to the poly house technique employed for floriculture, now, 10 to 15 acre is under hybrid roses and gerberas are being cultivated.Integrated pack housesWhen contacted, Deputy Director (Horticulture) B.A. Subba Rayudu says the floriculture is picking up in places like Penugonda and Konduru village in Lepakshi mandal of the district. The firms like Kusalav Organics have also began cultivation of the roses. The farmers are setting up integrated pack houses which include cold rooms, grading and packing facilities. Rose bud nets were also being used to ensure that the flower blossoms after reaching the destination, he says.Mr. Rayudu says that the government was giving a subsidy of Rs. 12 lakh per acre to construct the poly houses. Each farmer may spend between Rs. 34 lakh and Rs. 35 lakh per acre to develop the poly house.The farmers were harvesting about 2 lakh flowers per acre. They get around Rs. 8 lakh to Rs. 10 lakh per acre. Each flower costs at least Rs. 5, he explains."

Cooking is like yoga, it gives me peace of mind, says Prema mami, as she is fondly called. It is this dedicated hobby and love for food that has turned into a full-time profession. And Prema mami has a specific mission too. People should know that there is lot to offer in vegetarian Tamil cuisine, too,she says.Premas husband is also a chef. He used to work as a senior chef at a five-star hotel in Dubai. My husbands way of thinking is different from mine.

Her daughters too draw inspiration from their mothers cooking, and continue to experiment interesting varieties on a daily basis, with her inputs.Prema cooked her first dish, the humble onion uthappam, when she was 10. For the last four years, Prema has been catering food in the US, and in Muscat for three years. Recollecting these experiences, Prema shares, Cooking for international crowd was special. They love homemade food. So they crave for anything fresh and not preheated.

It would also help us realise Prime Minister Narendra Modi's goal to double farmers' income by 2022.""The minister's letter also mentioned that Bihar happened to be the third largest vegetable producer and fifth largest fruit producer in the country. It also says that 80 per cent of the Makhana in the world is produced in Bihar.It is not the first time that a demand to include more items in the agriculture export promotion policy has been made. Earlier this month, the Bihar Chamber of Commerce and Industries, too, had come up with a similar demand. The BCCI too had sent a letter to the Union minister sharing details of various products and their speciality on the basis of which the request was made."

(Representational Image) Hansraj Patil, youth president of farmers body Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana, said what was a necessity during the cash crunch has now become a common instrument of duping farmers. (Representational Image)The district deputy registrar (DDR) has issued showcause notices for suspension to directors of five wholesale market committees in Nashik for allegedly failing to pay onion farmers. The notices were issued after an investigation by Nilkanth Karhe, DDR, Nashik, revealed that about 20 traders operating in the markets had allegedly duped 1,500 farmers to the tune of Rs 5 crore.Karhe said, in all the cases, traders had paid farmers through cheques. However, when deposited for encashment, the cheques bounced. It was revealed that the traders did not have sufficient balance in their accounts, he said. Further investigation revealed that the traders in question were operating without depositing the mandatory security deposits, while the market committees had turned a blind eye, added Karhe.The notices were issued to the board of directors of the market committees of Manmad, Malegaon, Yewala, Umrane and Devala for their alleged role in the scam. The final order will be passed after a hearing on May 11, he said.Payment through post-dated cheques have become a norm in almost all wholesale markets of Nashik, since demonetisation, in 2016. Infact, the district collector of Nashik had talked about setting up special branches of public sector banks to help farmers encash the cheques faster.Traders, while issuing the cheques, ask farmers to deposit them after 15 to 30 days. Only a handful of traders prefer to transfer money through electronic means and even that faces technical roadblocks like bad network etc. Almost two years have passed since demonetisation, yet most of the traders in wholesale markets still prefer to deal in cheques.Hansraj Patil, youth president of farmers body Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana, said what was a necessity during the cash crunch has now become a common instrument of duping farmers. Over the last two months, most of the traders have issued post-dated cheques, which have bounced. They say they have faced losses in business and hence could not maintain necessary credit in their banks, he said. Patil added that the farmers body had received numerous complaints about such incidents and took it up with the DDRs office.Patil, demanding compulsory cash or same day electronic transfer of funds, said necessary instructions should be issued to market committees to make preparations for the same.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

5b1b443e9855b76d57038bf9,Here’s how night soil improved yield,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/pune/heres-how-night-soil-improved-yield/articleshow/64039638.cms,2018-05-05,"Sometime in November last year, a tempo drove into the Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research (DOGR) campus on Pune-Nashik Highway. To the surprise of researchers at this centre, it was carrying sacks filled with a kind of manure that they had never worked with before. Over the next few weeks, this substance was tested for efficacy; eventually, four six square metre plots were readied on this massive campus, with the idea of growing onions using different manures available with the institute, including the one that had just arrived.A good hundred days later, on Friday, May 4, 2018, the researchers harvested the plots to find startling results. The newly acquired manure had given the highest yield of the lot, beating both organic compost and chemical fertiliser. The material that won is night soil  or human faeces  excavated from two separate toilet pits in Ambegaon and Khed.The plot with organic manure gave an output of 18.22 kg, while the one enriched by chemical fertiliser generated 24.7 kg of onions. Another plot  which contained a mix of fertiliser, organic manure and night soil  gave out 21.81kg. But the plot pumped with only night soil plot yielded 26.87 kg of onions, beating all the other three. Boosted by the success of this newfound material, the premier research institute run by the Central government will now carry out several tests on soil, onions and the manure itself, to ensure that it is safe in all aspects for further usage.The idea, according to Dr Major Singh, director of DOGR, came from Ayush Prasad, an IAS officer who is posted as sub-divisional magistrate in Khed, located 50 km from Pune. The bureaucrat was posted in Osmanabad during his first stint, which was when he thought of the idea of making use of human waste.In Osmanabad, we were faced with the challenge of building toilets under the governments open defecation free (ODF) programme. While we were convincing people to build toilets, yet another issue was at hand  making them use the loos that were already completed. There was also some inertia among locals about using toilets, said the 29-year-old bureaucrat. Prasad explained that faced with multiple challenges, he came up with the idea of incentivising the use of toilets, by utilising the night soil collected in pits connected to the latrines. However, he had no way to formalise the plan back then.In October 2017, when he was transferred to Khed, Prasad got in touch with DOGR scientists, who carry out extensive research on onion and garlic crops. He had already teamed up with Jayant Deshpande, state coordinator of UNICEF, who had done extensive research on the subject as well. First, Prasad got the district administration to identify toilet pits that were full and needed to be emptied. Next, he got the night soil picked up and delivered to DOGR, where scientists picked it up for tests.Ayush Prasad (second from left) is spearheading the effortScientists at DOGR explained that while this was their first experiment with night soil  and also that of any government body in the country  the results are very encouraging. This is very first time in India that scientific research is being done with night soil. Its yield seems to be far better than other manures. In the next few weeks, we will carry out further tests to ensure that the produce is safe for consumption, as also test the soil for the effect the manure has on it, among other checks, said Dr Singh. His team members, Dr Amar Jeet Gupta and Dr A Thangasamy, are equally confident that the night soil is by far the best manure they have come across so far.While scientists at DOGR are back at work to establish that the produce grown using night soil is safe for consumption, the state coordinator for UNICEF has already compiled data to start collecting the manure from toilets across the state. From the data we have compiled so far, there are around 1.44 crore toilet pits in Maharashtra, most of which have been dug up to build toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. It takes around seven years for a pit to get filled up if the toilet is used by a family of five. Going by this, we will be able to take out night soil from 5,636 pits every day. A single pit gives out some 70 kg of manure. This way, we will be able to generate 1,400 tonnes of night soil every year, said Deshpande.Deshpande explained that the process of getting night soil is quite simple. Once a pit is full, most families start using the second pit built along with the toilet. The full pit needs to lie idle for about a year, and get exposed to the atmosphere for a few days after that. Nature takes care of the rest. What you end up getting after all this is fine material that resembles tea powder. It has no foul stench, as most would think. All one has to do is use it as any manure on crops, Deshpande elaborated.With everything looking good so far, Prasad has already pinned his hopes on commercially exploiting this material, which is readily available in droves. Since he also holds charge of the tribal development department for Pune district, Prasad feels that the new manure will generate employment for the underprivileged. We are working on the idea of forming selfhelp groups that can identify pits in their areas. The pits can be emptied and manure packaged after some basic treatment, said Prasad, who on Friday presented the concept to Adhalrao Patil, a Member of Parliament (MP) from Shirur.Prasad believes that once the material gets a green light from DOGR, it will not only help the government promote the use of toilets under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, but will also arrest the degradation of soil and ground water due to rampant use of chemical fertilisers. It will further address the issue of faecal management that the government is working on next, under the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, as all the pits will get emptied and the material in them will get used entirely. Most importantly, if we can restrict the use of chemical fertilisers and use night soil instead, we will end up saving a lot of foreign exchange that goes in purchasing fuel to manufacture them, said Prasad.MP Patil, who saw that night soil harvest was the best as compared to other manures, has asked Prasad and his team to make a detailed presentation. I can take it up in the Parliamentary standing committee, of which I am a member, which can then make representations to the agriculture ministry. I am certain that the concept will succeed. The only challenge I foresee is getting public participation, considering the stigma around the night soil. But, we can always work on this, Patil concluded."

Thangaraj, general secretary, Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association.The onion market complex has been built at a site purchased by the Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association as early as 1991. However, the association began construction of the complex only three years back.We started construction after we came to know that the shops at Kallikudi market, which was then under construction, will not meet our requirements. Our new market is much closer to the existing onion market and customers will not be affected, Mr.Thangaraj told The Hindu .The new onion market has 90 shops and modern amenities. The project has been executed at a cost of about Rs. 15 crore, including about Rs. 5 crore raised as loan from bank, Mr. Thangaraj said. The shops would be owned by about 75 members of the associationThe complex has all necessary amenities and infrastructure for traders, public and farmers visiting the market. The market includes rest rooms for traders and farmers. We have ample two-wheeler parking area, adequate toilets and water supply. We have also wide internal roads to ensure smooth loading and unloading from the 20-tonne capacity trucks, he said.The wholesale onion market is an important part of the Gandhi Market in the city. The market is the hub for Bellary and small onions trade in the region and caters to retail traders from Tiruchi and neighbouring districts.The market largely functions along the Sub-Jail Road outside Gandhi Market and traders process the onion on roadsides. Over 75 shops are situated along the narrow Sub-Jail Road. The road remained closed for traffic for several decades before the former City Police Commissioner Karuna Sagar ordered its reopening for traffic in August 2009.Yet, traffic congestion remains a perennial problem on Sub-Jail Road and Vellamandi Road intersections as loading and unloading of onions take place right on the road. The congestion is expected to ease to a large extent once the onion traders shift to their own market."
5b1538d29855b76a5f1a07e1,Contemporary  but much too crammed,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-kerala/contemporary-but-much-too-crammed/article23790070.ece,2018-05-06,"In one of the few sequences where the characters of Aabhasam speak directly to the audience, the character played by Mamukkoya talks about people who dare to think differently. The comparison is to an onion which refuses to take the fixed path from the sack to the basket to the bowl, and instead jumps out to follow an independent path. The camera closely follows the onion which, before long, gets crushed under the wheels of a police vehicle.That happens to be one of the messages that the film wants to convey mostly through allegories, some of them subtle, and some others in-your-face. Jubith Namradath, in his debut film, attempts a satirical take on contemporary society through a bus journey from Bengaluru to Thiruvananthapuram. The story happens inside the bus named Gandhi which belongs to Democracy Travels, with Ambedkar, Marx, Jinnah and Godse being their other buses.Inside the bus is a cross-section of our society, from a young woman who has been tricked by her parents to agree to an arranged marriage and a little girl who is dreading the advances from her uncle at her ancestral home, to a sexually frustrated man, and a young man who always tends to stand up for what is right.As the title Aabhasam (which stands for Aarsha Bharatha Samskaram ) suggests, the satire points at the self-appointed moral guardians, who are shown to be using their twisted understanding of culture as a veil to cover up their own perversions. We see the same persons who get uncomfortable at open expressions of love making lewd remarks and behaving inappropriately with single women travellers. In between, the film takes detours to other issues, including beef politics.Yet, half-way through the journey, the narrative continues to still meander along aimlessly, like a bus without a definite destination. Too many issues are taken up and crammed into the available screen time.Some of the individual stories pique your interest, like the one involving Indrans. But, the script needlessly refrains from giving us a little more background of some of the more interesting characters. The dialogues are either too obvious or too weak.In some of its rather bleak phases, the film springs small surprises, especially the scene where some of the passengers, without a second thought, hop on to the Godse bus, when the Gandhi bus gets stuck. But, these scenes are few and far between. The film itself is almost like the overnight bus journey that it uses as a tool for its messages. All darkness outside the window, with a few bright spots.S.R. Praveen"

The selling price of garlic was between Rs 50 and Rs 80 per kg in January this year, said Suryabahnu Singh, a farmer from Darukheda village.The Shyamgarh mandi saw nearly 100 farmers gherao the market committees office on Friday evening, forcing committee authorities to call the police.The Malwa region in western MP had witnessed a violent farmers protest demanding higher prices for produce in June 2017. Six farmers from Neemuch and Mandsaur died during the violence as police opened fire.A garlic glut in Rajasthan, the countrys second largest producer after MP, has caused prices of the commodity to decline in wholesale markets. The downside pressure on garlic prices comes amid Indias subdued wholesale price inflation, which eased to an eight-month low of 2.47% in March, compared with a 2.48% rise in February. This was led largely by a 0.4% decline in food prices alone.The Hataudi region of Rajasthan comprising divisions such as Kota and Jahawar, is the states prime garlic belt. Oversupply has been the key reason why prices have been depressed this season. Rajasthan garlic is sold in major markets of neighbouring states such as Indore, Ahmedabad and Nasik, said Digvijay Singh, a state marketing board official. The area under garlic in Rajasthan has increased to about 13 million hectare in 2017-18 from about 70,000 hectare in the previous year, while production has doubled from 0.37 million tonne in 2016-17 to 0.77 million tonnes this year.While Madhya Pradesh is the largest grower, accounting for 31% of the total output, Rajasthans share is 24%.Sensing a glut, the Rajasthan government had intimated the Union agriculture ministry last month on a proposal to intervene in the market by launching a limited-period procurement scheme of garlic.After the approval from the Cente, the Rajasthan government has started buying garlic at a state-determined price. The official pegged daily arrivals from the Kota region at around 12,000 tonne.MP, where elections are expected this year (the assembly tenure ends on January 7, 2019), too has a programme, Bhavantar Bhugtan Yojana, to pay for farm produce, but farmers such as Suryabahnu Singh are not convinced that is enough.Former Neemuch mandi president and garlic farmer Umrao Gurjar explains why. Under Bhavantar, the government is going to give Rs 800 per quintal to a farmer. As the government has fixed 15 quintal as average production per bigha, a farmer is going to get only Rs 12,000 per bigha, while the actual input cost comes to Rs 20,000 per bigha. No wonder the farmers are angry.Farmer leader Shiv Kumar Sharma said the pricing has repeatedly hurt food growers of Malwa region, which accounts for a majority of the garlic production in the state. Malwas farmers lost out last year when they produced onion and the prices crashed to as low as 50 paise per kg. Many shifted to garlic and its price too has crashed.(With inputs from HTC, Delhi )"

Though the production figure of 127.95 lakh tonnes during 2014-15 remains the best for the State, performance during 2017-18 was significant as it signalled the stabilisation of the foodgrain production at about 110 lakh tonnes. Since 2011-12, this has become the pattern, except in two years (2012-13 and 2016-17) when the State was in the grip of acute drought.During the northeast monsoon (October-December) last year, the State received 40 cm rainfall against the expected 44 cm, recording a deviation of 9%, which, in meteorological parlance, was considered normal. As for the receipt of Cauvery water, the deficit was around 72 thousand million cubic feet (TMC) till the end of April. Against the overall due of 189.5 TMC, the State realised about 117 TMC.In recent years, a discernible pattern in the foodgrain production of the State has been the increasing share of millets in the total production. Ten years ago, millets accounted for not more than 25% of the overall production. But, now, they constitute at least 33%K. Ramasamy, Vice-Chancellor of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University, attributes the farmers performance to adoption of technology and growing awareness of crop diversification. No longer do many farmers in the Cauvery delta want to raise paddy alone, Prof. Ramasamy points out.Also, there is the tendency of some farmers in the delta, who own pumpsets, to share groundwater with needy ones, of course for a charge, the Vice-Chancellor says.In the western region of the State, agriculturists in the belt from Palladam to Udumalpet have a flexible approach. When they get water through the Parambikulam-Aliyar canal, they use it for raising paddy. On other occasions, they switch to drip irrigation for producing onion and maize.Acknowledging that the State does not any longer struggle to touch the 100-lakh-tonne-mark in foodgrain production, S. Ranganathan, general secretary of the Cauvery Delta Farmers Welfare Association, cites a host of reasons including the governments schemes of subsidy and incentives. In the last few years, the allocation for micro-irrigation has gone up manifold.He emphasises that the authorities should intensify their steps towards weaning the farmers in the new delta areas away from their paddy-centric approach, which was an offshoot of the commissioning of the Mettur dam in the mid-1930s.Expressing concern over the fast-depleting groundwater in the region which covers Pudukottai district and parts of Thanjavur and Tiruvarur, Mr. Ranganathan wants the government to educate and motivate the farmers to opt for two crops of pulses and one crop of cotton."

Farmers are getting a price of Rs. 12 or below as businessmen getting cold feet about purchasing as the demand dropped. The average price for onion in the local market in the State is Rs. 25 to 30.Why the sudden drop in the prices of onion which reached Rs. 160 in the middle of last year? Arrival of large quantities of onion during the harvesting season is said to be the reason for the drop.Manikandan, an onion farmer in Cumbom valley, said that he had left with no option but to sell it at the market prices. If not sold it now, large quantity would be lost as the rains would cause rotting.He said that lack of storage facilities and the possibility of rotting prompted him to sell the produce at the low prices which would not cover the production cost. The main reason is the tendency of vegetable farmers to cultivate a particular crop which got high price in the last harvesting season.All the farmers preferred onion cultivation as its prices were at a high during the last harvesting season. The farmers fearing further price drop brought the produce to the market. This caused the prices to drop further.However, marketing sources said the prices would pick up slowly once the market is flooded with onion."

This year, farmers of 60 villages of Reamal, Tinkbir, Malehipada, Taranga, Tuhilamal, Budhido and Naulipada gram panchayats of Reamal block had taken up onion cultivation.As the climate was favourable, farmers had taken seeds from the agriculture department and used timely compost. The production was good and the time was fast approaching for a good yield. But, the repeated unseasonal rain and hailstorms played spoilsport.""We are forced to sell onion at Rs 4 to Rs 5 per kg.

Now, the distress sale of it is making the cultivators cry in our state,"" said a 75-year-old farmer, Jogendra Barik of Tinkabir village.Deogarh collector Purna Chandra Pathy said: ""The agriculture department would conduct field study to assess the loss, and it is also making efforts to purchase onion from the farmers at a reasonable price through the Odisha Rural Products Marketing Society to sell it in Sambalpur and Bhubaneswar."""

One part of the mission states that officials must make effective use of waste from farmers markets (uzhavar sandhais) by establishing small compost bins on their premises.Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar on November 26 had spoken to private hoteliers, owners of restaurants and marriage halls urging them to compost their own waste. In the subsequent week, he said that compost bins and pits would be established in farmers markets across the city at Bibikulam, Anna Nagar, Anaiyur and Palanganatham.Although compost bins were placed in three locations and a compost pit in one, agricultural officers say that they have barely been used.At Bibikulam farmers market, an official at the managerial position said that they had dug a vermi compost pit in 2012 as part of the National Agricultural Development Programme. After a few months, we realised that maintenance was difficult. Officials from the corporation said two months ago that we had to compost our waste. Compost pits cause an unpleasant stench preventing customers from coming to the market. He said farmers who come to sell their produce here usually have livestock. When the market closes at 3 p.m., they take leftovers back home and feed their animals. Nothing but onion peels are left behind.The compost bin at Anna Nagar farmers market lays in a corner, away from the eyes of visitors in an unused state.The Agricultural Officer handling the affairs there said that there was little or no waste getting accumulated everyday. Hoteliers come right before closing time and buy vegetables that are not fresh. The price is cheaper thus being more profitable to them. So, there is no too much waste, he said. He said that the leftover strewn around the premises is cleared each day and dumped into the garbage truck.The usage at Palanganatham and Anaiyur too is erratic. An officer says that there are a few takers for the end product - compost.Corporation Commissioner S. Aneesh Sekhar says that all items classified under bio-degradable waste must be composted by bulk waste generators. He said that a monitoring mechanism would be in place to check the use of bins."

Earlier, all the trade unions had locked horns with the district administration over the move to shift the congested market to the integrated vegetable market complex in Kallikudi.The agriculture marketing and agriculture business department has been distributing applications to allot shops for wholesale traders in the newly-built integrated market. As announced, the district administration will be implementing the ban on entry of heavy vehicles carrying vegetables to the Gandhi market area from June 1.On Thursday, three major trade unions, DMKs Labour Progressive Front (LPF), VCKs Labour Liberation Front (LLF) and CPMs Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), erected their respective flag masts at the integrated market signifying their indirect approval for the relocation. Establishing a flag mast of a trade union in the integrated market locality is like labourers giving No Objection Certificate (NOC) for Gandhi Market relocation. Labourers may have felt job insecurity since their reluctance to move to the new market facility may push the traders to employ local people at the new market, K Suresh, district secretary, Communist Party of India (CPI), said. Peeved at the traffic congestion recurring in the Gandhi market, local people have for long been demanding the relocation.Being a major trade union with most labourers enrolled in the onion market, the flag mast of LPF in Kallikudi integrated market was seen by officials as a positive development. Our intention behind establishing a flag mast at Kallikudi vegetable market is to ensure employment for existing labourers of Gandhi market even after the relocation, R Sampath, district secretary, CITU, told TOI. Most of the trade unions, including the communist-backed ones, had been protesting the relocation of Gandhi market since early 2016."

However, this could take time as they have to identify and purchase a suitable site to build their own market.With the district administration announcing that heavy vehicles carrying vegetables and fruits would not be allowed to enter the Gandhi Market in the city from June, time is fast running out for the wholesale traders. Meanwhile, retail traders of the market have grown apprehensive over the hints being dropped by the district administration that the wholesale traders are being shifted in the first phase, thereby implying that retail traders too may have to move over to the new market in course of time. Besides, a recent statement from Collector K.Rajamani also indicated that the Gandhi Market is to be redeveloped under the Smart City project, though it is not clear whether it would be retained as a market.Retail traders argue that they have been operating out of the market for decades in the Gandhi Market, established in 1940. The market has over 1,000 permanent and pavement shops on about 6.5 acres of land. Different wholesale sections such as the vengaiya mandi, vazhakai mandi, vellamandi and the pazha mandi spill over to Madurai Road, Thanjavur Road, Nelpettai Road, East Boulevard Road and Sub-Jail Road and only these shops created traffic congestion. Once they are shifted, the traffic problems would be solved. If necessary, the market could be renovated and modernised to retain the retail market, they contend.There is a lot of confusion. There is no reason to shift traders who are functioning inside the market and so far we have not been given any notice or intimation by the authorities. Retail traders function within the four walls of Gandhi Market and do not cause any disturbance to traffic around the market. The city needs a retail market that is accessible and offers vegetables, fruits and flowers at affordable prices.Big trucks need not enter the market to transport goods for us, said U.S.Karuppiah, president, Gandhi Market United Corporation Approved Platform and Permanent Shopkeepers Association. There are about 780 approved shop keepers functioning inside the market who are paying rent to the Corporation, he points out and claims that the Corporation was getting annual revenue of over Rs. 10 crore from the market. He contends that the Kallikudi market was essentially meant to cater to wholesale market and does not meet the requirement of retail traders.If the retail market is shifted hundreds of traders, farmers and labourers will be affected, he said. Representatives of a few other associations were in favour of retaining the market at Gandhi Market. We want retail traders to be retained. We held a meeting recently and our members expressed strong opposition to any move to shift retail shops to the new market, said M.K.Kamalakannan, president, Tiruchi Gandhi Market Vyaparigal Munnetra Sangam."

The kids from the shanties nearby are often seen playing on this narrow road which struggles to even make space for two cars when they pass each other.The residents in the area say they often have to speed up their vehicles to avoid sliding to a side.Natasha, an engineering student living in a nearby housing society, said, It is quite common that the side mirrors often brush past when two cars pass each other on this narrow road. There have been minor accidents too. The people residing in the housing societies nearby are of the view that to widen the road, the Zirakpur municipal council (MC) needs to acquire land from the person owning the fields on both sides.The MC has to pay him, to widen this narrow stretch that runs till Bollywood Heights housing society, said Vinod Raina, a resident of Vrindavan Gardens housing society. The road was dark back then and it is still so, he rued. We have approached the MC a number of times but to no avail.Natasha too expressed concern about going out for a walk in the evening. Not only does it seem unsafe for women, it is actually dangerous for anyone in any age group, she said.Things have not improved due to absence of any strong RWA in the area. Residents of a few nearby housing societies have also been involved in disputes with their builders, thus leading to neglect of other issues. The executive officer at Zirakpur municipal corporation, Manbir Singh Gill , said, The electricity poles will soon be fitted with advanced LED lights. The procedure is in progress.

However, the farmers are upset as they say that the input cost is Rs 8-9 per kg (Rs 800-900 per quintal).The announcement of purchasing onion by the government was nothing but a sham. As against the input cost of Rs 8-9 per kg, the farmers are getting about Rs 6 per kg in the mandi, All India Kisan Sabha (AIKS) president Amra Ram said.Sikar district is a hub of onion cultivation in Rajasthan and this year the production is expected to be about 4.50 to 5 lakh metric tonnes as against states total output of 12.80 lakh metric tonnes. There are about 50,000 onion growers in the region.Onion prices rose after last August, with delay in kharif crop arrivals and estimates of lower production in 2017-18 by one million tonne. After peaking in January first week, the prices have fallen since.The government has extended the date of purchase of garlic under MIS that is being bought at Rs 3,257 per quintal. The date has been extended to May 18 and will be extended further, if required, Lochan said.The government has so far purchased 2,865 metric tonnes garlic as against target of 1.54 lakh metric tonne. This translates into just about 1.8% of the target.In case of garlic, the MIS was launched on April 26 and government had announced to procure 1.54 lakh metric tonne garlic. It had set up 10 purchase centres and procured garlic at 3,257 per quintal or 32.57 per kg.The net area under garlic in Rajasthan has increased from 69,000 hectare to 1.32 lakh hectare and the production has also doubled from 3.77 lakh MT to 7.7 lakh MT this year.The Hadauti region comprising Kota, Bundi, Jahawar and Baran, accounts for about 90% of the states production.The farmers and farmer organizations in the Hadauti region are now demanding that government must extend the dates for garlic procurement.The garlic crop had started arriving in the market more than six weeks ago, but the prices crashed due to a bumper production.Two years back, garlic prices were ruling between  60 and 90 per kg at the mandis. Farmers have been dejected due to steep fall in the prices."

It was later taken over by Khed Sinnar Expressway Limited (KSEL). While work on nearly 109 km stretch has been completed between Nagar and Nashik, non-completion of work on the Pune stretch for over 57 km has delayed opening of the highway.Delayed compensation to farmers and unwillingness of villagers to hand over land for construction of bypasses are the reasons for the work being carried out at a snail's pace since 2014, stated officials. The project is likely to be completed only by 2019.With disbursement of funds delayed in Pune district, the work on 28.5 km stretch out of the 57.5 km is pending, according to NHAI officials.The Pune-Nashik stretch consists of five bypasses -- Khed, Manchar, Kalamb, Narayangaon and Alephata -- and Khed ghat realignment, which is yet to be completed, the officials said.The state government has disbursed compensation amount of Rs 721.56 crore to the land acquisition officer. However, only Rs 540.37 crore has been actually disbursed. Farmers are not allowing construction work due to non-disbursement of full compensation amount, said National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) officials. The issue was discussed at a highway review meeting attended by Union Mminister for road transport Nitin Gadkari recently.Another amount of Rs 53 crore, disbursed by the government, was deposited by the land acquisition officer in court due to various litigations. Due to the delay in disbursement of the amount, villagers have opposed the acquisition.It was decided that the amount will be disbursed within a month as directed by Pune guardian minister Girish Bapat,the official said.Another sore point has been the issue of transfer of land from Directorate of Onion And Garlic Research (DOGR), Rajgurunagar, to NHAI.The delay in transfer of land is hampering construction of grade separator at Khed. Recently, the institute had requested for shifting of the alignment of highway in front of ICAR institute but it was denied on grounds of safety. While DOGR has sought compensation for the said land, NHAI stated that if the land belongs to the Central government, no compensation will be paid."

Many eateries in the city provided them early morning (sehri) and evening meals (iftaar) before and after the fast (roza) on Thursday.Eateries in areas like Sabzibagh and Ramna Road prepared variety of dishes, including chana, pakoda, potato and egg cutlet, bread pakoda, onion and brinjal fries, imarti, fruit salad, for devotees to break their fast in the evening.We began preparing the meal from 3.30pm on Thursday and continued till the time of sehri in the wee hours on Friday. We are open 24X7 during the holy month to serve those who live alone in the city, Md Mokhtar, the staff of a small hotel on Ramna Road, said and added mostly boys and girls living in hostels came to eat food at the hotel during Ramzan.Another restaurant owner at Sabzibagh said, I start preparing sehri from 2am so that the food gets prepared on time. I make sure the ingredients used in the process are pure and healthy. Items made of milk like shaahi tukda, doodh lacchha and sewai are popular among customers as they make them feel energetic for the rest of the day.While some devotees are trying to eat healthy by consuming food cooked at home, those staying away from home are finding it difficult to look for healthy food options to break their fast.Gulfashan Ehsan, a postgraduate student of a Pune-based college, said, I am glad my summer break has started during the month of Ramzan. It is important to have healthy food after breaking the fast, but my hostel canteen does not provide hygienic food.Working professionals rued that they did not get much time in office to have proper meal during iftaar. According to Anam Ahsan, a dentist by profession, My patients are my first priority. I break the fast with a khajoor (date) and some water and take my meal once I reach home.Imbesat Imam, a working mother, told TOI, I keep my food simple and conserve energy as much as possible. As my sons school is shut, it is easier for me to manage everything at home."

Onion is selling for between Rs 3.50 and Rs 8 a kg at the Ahmedabad agriculture produce market committee (APMC), but is fetching Rs 20 to Rs 25 a kg in retail.At the Mahuva APMC , the biggest market yard for onion trading in the state, the price is between Rs 6.5 and Rs 15 per kg. However, at APMCs far from Mahuva, the situation is much worse. For example, at Visavadar APMC, onion is selling at Rs 1.25 to Rs 2 a kg.Farmers are forced to give their produce to villagers for free. Gordhan Paghdal, the sarpanch of Kuba (Ravani) village in Visavadar, said, On Thursday, Gordhan Dobariya, a farmer from the village announced that the onion crop in his field would be available for free. Many villagers went to his field and took as much as they could carry.The sarpanch said Dobariya was not even getting the cost of labour invested, which was around Rs 2 per kg. He thus decided to give it away for free. The Paghdal said several farmers in the village who were growing onions earlier have stopped doing so.Pratap Sardasiya, a farmer, says, Apart from the sowing cost, we have to pay for labour to harvest it, which is around Rs 2 per kg. We also need gunny bags, which cost Rs 30 for a 50-kg bag. The farmer also has to take his crop to Mahuva, and pay Rs 4 per kg for transport. If the farmer gets Rs 6.25 per kg, he is incurring a loss.Ghyanshyam Patel, chairman of Mahuva APMC, said, Onions that can be stored for five or six months are selling at a premium and only poor quality onions, which are wet, are selling for cheap. Low-quality onion cant be kept for more than 10 days.Ramesh Dhameliya, a farmer from near Mahuva who has 30 bigahs of land, said he has stopped sowing onion because he doesnt get a remunerative price. We are not even getting Rs 5 per kg but retailers are selling the crop for more than Rs 30 per kg. The government should regulate the price and ensure that farmers get good prices, he said."
5b13a64a9855b762ecebe0a5,Onion Prices Crash in MP,https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onion-prices-crash-in-madhya-pradesh/story-EqcNci52m7jjzGOBpjXBXM.html,2018-05-20,"Onion prices dropped to a low of 30 paise per kilogram in some markets of Madhya Pradesh this week, showing up shortcoming in the state governments much-touted Bhavantar scheme.Under the scheme, the government pays farmers part of the difference between the average wholesale price and minimum support price (MSP) to cushion the farmers from huge financial losses. Last year, the farmers agitation in the state had started at the same time over the price of onions, which sold at the lowest price of 50 paisa per kilogram, eventually leading to police firing in Mandsaur that left six persons dead. In some Mandis of Rajgarh and Neemuch, the lowest price of onion was 30 paisa to 50 paisa per kg since farmers started selling onion under the Bhavantar scheme. The maximum price was reported to be Rs 5-Rs 6 per kg.In the past two years, the state government purchased onion on MSP  first at Rs 6 per kg and then Rs 8 per kg  but this year it was brought under the Bhavantar scheme, under which the traders will purchase onion from farmers at mandis and the government will pay farmers the difference between the MSP and the average wholesale price. The MSP rate this year is again Rs 8 per kg.Mandi secretary at Narsinghgarh in Rajgarh RK Jain said the price didnt fall that much but admitted that Rs 1 per kg was the lowest price of onion of poor quality. Kedar Sirohi, a farmers leader from Harda, said Bhavantar had hit the farmers hard. Traders have joined hands to purchase onion at a throwaway price and convinced farmers that the government would pay them the difference between the MSP and sale price, he said. The fact is that farmers would get the difference between the MSP and average wholesale price, not sale price.Tarun Baheti, a farmers leader in Neemuch, said a farmer, whom he identified as Shaukin Patidar, was being forced to sell onion at 50 paisa per kg on Friday despite the fact that his crop was of good quality. When he requested Mandi president Rajkumar Tiwari to intervene he got Rs 1 per kg. But even with that price he was not able to recover even the transport cost he had born, said Baheti. Mahesh Patidar, leader of the Patidar Samaj in Malwa region, said the average price of onion in the markets was Rs 1.50 to Rs 2 per kg. Traders who buy onion will store it and later sell at Rs 20-Rs 25 per kg, he said, adding that middlemen and traders stand to benefit the most.Steep fall in prices of garlic and onion has given a shot in the arm to the Opposition, which has said it will raise issues of farmers in the run-up to state polls later this year. State Congress president Kamal Nath said, Congress has been saying right from the beginning that Bhavantar scheme is meant for the benefit of BJP- supported traders, not farmers. But Shivraj (Singh Chouhan) government is not willing to listen. After garlic, price of onion has also fallen after being included in Bhavantar scheme. State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said the government included onion in Bhavantar to ensure the farmers didnt suffer losses."

Incredible that the Rohingya Muslim refugee should express such optimism when all that he had in his claustrophobic shack as the iftar meal were slices of water melon for himself, his wife and three children to quench their thirst, and afterward a humble meal of rice and vegetables and a cucumber and onion salad.At iftar on the first Friday of the holy month of Ramzan, the family ate in silence under the glow of the white light that highlighted the claustrophobic interiors of their plastic and bamboo shelter. As the sun went down, the same scene played out in the other tents at Kalindi Kunj, where 48 Rohingya families were trying to come to terms with their already burdened lives facing, on April 15, another trial by fire, literally, when their huts were destroyed by a blaze.Some time earlier, around 6pm, men, women and children had all gathered at the new camps lone tap near the entrance, some to wash pots and pans, others to freshen up after a hot, harsh day of fasting. Mohammad Salimullah, who used to run a small shop at the camp that was lost to fire, surveyed the crowd. We have just one water tap for so many families. There always are queues here and the water is not enough for everyones use, he said.On Friday, TOI could sense during its visit to the new camp that amid the trauma of the fire and the financial losses, the families were stoically forgetting their overwhelming challenges and injecting some degree of normalcy in their lives through fasting and praying as if life was routine. The dismal camp site with its wild growth of shrubs and muddy ditches seemed to reflect their fate, but then the refugees seem to have accepted that uncertainty has become a part of their life since they fled Myanmar to escape persecution.There are 25-odd tents in the camp now, each home to three-four families and there is a constant fight for space. The recent storms have added to the misery of the families, leaving them holding dearly on to their possession in their tented home  perhaps wondering how much more they would have to suffer.Their most precious possession appeared to be their refugee document. Ahmed, who works at a graveyard in the vicinity, told TOI that when the fire burnt his shack to the ground, his biggest anxiety was the loss of the UNHCR document establishing his refugee identity. But relief showing on his face, he flashed a brand new card given by the UN body for refugees, and said he hoped to get back on his feet soon. A few houses away, Saida Begum remembered her home in Rakhine in Myanmar, of how they were forced to flee to Bangladesh first and then travel to India.After their simple iftar meals, the men headed for the makeshift mosque  a bamboo, tarpaulin and tin structure where the only relief came from a single desert cooler in the corner  while the women began preparing dinner. As night fell, the air grew thick with mosquitoes. The families would eat and sleep early to wake up before dawn in preparation of another day of fasting  and another day of struggle."

Petrol , too, has reached an all-time high of Rs 78.91 a litre in Kolkata and is inching towards breaching the Rs-80-a-litre mark, but it is the hike in diesel price that has the transport sector more worried.I have tracked diesel prices since the last three decades and not seen anything like this, West Bengal Petroleum Dealers Association president Tushar Kanti Sen said. On Sunday, diesel price in the city increased 26 paise to hit Rs 70.12 per litre.This may have a direct impact on inflation in the short term, economist Abhirup Sarkar said. The worry is that the price of essentials may see a sudden spike, he added.Economists fears are not unfounded. Bus operators have barely waited for the panchayat poll results to be declared before pressing for a hike in fares again.Truck operators have called an emergency meeting for an imminent strike as they will be hit the hardest by the diesel price hike. Subhas Bose, general secretary of West Bengal Truck Operators Welfare Association, said: All India Motor Congress is scheduled go for an indefinite strike from June. But we might need to call the strike much earlier.Tapan Bandyopadhyay of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates said, Operating buses have become completely unviable. If the government does not raise fares immediately, the private bus trade will go into a coma. Fares were last revised in September 2014 when diesel price was Rs 54/lt. Now, the situation is such that we dont even need to call a strike for our demands, he added.The diesel price hike is expected to have a direct impact on the prices of food items. Bengal imports coconut from Kerala, medicines from Mumbai, onion from Nasik and textile from Gujarat and Punjab . The fare for a 12-wheel trucks Kolkata-Mumbai round trip is Rs 1.5 lakh. The diesel price rise this May alone will increase that amount by Rs 12,000. It will obviously have a ripple effect on everything, said Bose.Oil PSUs are estimated to have lost about Rs 500 crore on absorbing higher cost resulting from the spike in international oil rates and fall in rupee against the US dollar during the nearly-three-week hiatus because of the Karnataka assembly polls. The bad news is that diesel prices will travel north further to match current international prices. The benchmark international diesel rates during this period have climbed from US$ 84.68 per barrel to US$ 90.28 per barrel. Also, the rupee has weakened to Rs 67.27 per US dollar from Rs 66.62, making imports costlier, explained transport economist Tarit Dasgupta.There is also a strong demand for bringing petrol and diesel under the purview of GST. This would have reduced the fuel price considerably. But the governments have treated fuel price as the biggest source of revenue. This is why a number of cess and taxes are imposed on the fuel to make it costlier than what it should be, said a logistics farm official."

(Express) Over thee crore toilets have been constructed across the country. (Express)As crores of toilet blocks are constructed across India as part of Swachh Bharat Abhiyan, making toilet usage a sustainable solution in the long run has been a challenge for authorities. There have been several reports about the newly-constructed toilets being used for other purposes, including for storing grains. Now, a pilot project in Pune aims to resolve this issue, by offering an incentive to local residents to use the toilets.Explaining the project, Assistant Collector of Khed taluka, Ayush Prasad, said it was based on harvesting the decomposed night soil from twin pit toilets and using it as manure. In rural areas, the Abhiyan promotes construction of twin pit toilets, which allow complete decomposition of night soil into manure. Our project will involve commercial usage of this manure and paying the householder to harvest the same, he said.In the preliminary stage, the manure was tested in a field owned by the Rajgurunagar-based Directorate of Onion and Garlic Research and the results showed a nine-fold increase in yields. Scientists of the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) are now trying to devise means to improve the quality of the manure, said Prasad.Under the project, a farmer producer company will be entrusted with the work of harvesting the manure, treating it and selling it to floriculturists. Surveys are being undertaken to identify twin pit toilets that were constructed and in use between 2010-2013. In the first phase, we will harvest the manure from these pits, said Prasad. The pilot project is expected to be rolled out in October.Jayant Deshpande, state sanitation consultant of UNICEF, said the scheme will incentivise the usage of toilets. If a monetary incentive is provided, the households will continue using the toilets and take care of its upkeep, he said.Under the flagship programme of the central government, district administrations provide both household as well as community toilets in urban and rural areas.Government figures reveal that the total number of toilets constructed across the nation is more than 3 crore. Maharashtra was recently declared open-defecation free (ODF), with almost 70 per cent toilet usage being reported. The National Rural Sanitation Survey has put the toilet usage across the country at around 93.4 per cent.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The prices have decreased from Rs 1,700 a quintal on February 21 to Rs 600 per quintal on May 21.In the retail market, onions are being sold at Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg following the fall in wholesale prices.The minimum and maximum prices at Lasalgaon APMC on Monday were Rs 400 and Rs 861 per quintal, respectively, when around 8,000 quintals of onions were auctioned.The harvest of summer onions is in full swing and that has led to rise in supply. Also, the demand for onions have reduced because of the ongoing holy month of Ramzan. All this has led to decline in prices, APMC officials said.Usually, farmers prefer storing summer onions, as it has a shelf life of five to six months, with a hope of getting better price later. But there is a vast section of farmers who need money and are bringing their produce to the APMCs, the official added.Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of Lasalgaon APMC, said, Onions with inferior quality or which cant be stored are being brought to the APMCs. The poor quality onions are fetching low rates. This is the major reason behind the fall in prices.Holkar said the wholesale prices would either prevail at the present rate or will slide further till June 15, after which the prices would increase.Last month, the central government roped in the National Agricultural Co-operative Marketing Federation of India Ltd to procure onions in a bid to stabilise prices. But the prices continued to drop."

But since the fuel prices have gone up, the costs of farming activities have increased.Diesel prices have shot up by 39% in the past two-and-a-half years  from Rs 51.40 per litre on September 30, 2015 to Rs 71.45 per litre on May 21, 2018. And what has compounded the woes of the farmers is that the transportation cost of carrying the produce to the markets has also gone up.The farmers lamented that the cost of production has already increased due to rise in fuel prices and it is bound to increase more if the fuel prices rise further.There is no alternate to diesel motors for cultivation during power failure. At present, 85% of the farmers in the district use tractors for ploughing the fields. The ploughing rates of tractors have increased by 30% from Rs 1,200 per acre last year to Rs 1,600 per acre this year due to rise in fuel prices, Nivrutti Nyaharkar , an onion grower, said.According to him, the transporters have hiked their rates to transport their agriculture produce to Agriculture Produce Market Committees (APMCs) by tractors and other vehicles.Transport cost increases if fuel prices go up. This also affects the production cost of the farm produce. Kharif season is now around the corner and the rise in fuel prices may also lead to rise in the cost of fertilizers, seeds, pesticides, fungicides, among others, Manik Patil , divisional president of a grape-growers association, said."

A state-level convention will be held from June 15-17, where a strategy will be chalked out, BKS leaders said.A five-member representation of BKS told the collectors that natural calamities and pests damaging crops leave farmers in distress, and absence of minimum support price and unavailability of crop insurance add to their sufferings.BKS has from time to time held protests as well as talks with the government to highlight the plight of farmers. The government improved the power policy, provided MSP to farmers and short-term cooperative loan waiver, but policy changes are required to redress farmers grievances, said Kailash Gandoliya, state general secretary of the RSS-affiliated organisation.He suggested that policy measures be introduced to provide profitable prices to farmers based on the production cost of the crops.The government should announce profitable prices for crops, vegetables and milk, and ensure their purchase throughout the year. Buying and selling crops below minimum support price should be made an offence, Gandoliya said.He called for a kisan corpus fund with the insurance premium amounts payable by the Centre, state and farmers, and demanded that crop producers be ensured the benefits of the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana.In Rajasthan mustard, gram, wheat, garlic and onion have been registered for buying through MSP. In the absence of purchase, the farmers should be given difference between market price and MSP, Gandoliya said.Farmers should be provided places in the mandis for selling organic products; farmers platforms should be freed from encroachments by middle men, he said, seeking funds to farmers for maintenance of cows.Last year, BKS had joined an agitation, spearheaded by other farmers organisations, demanding waiver of agriculture loans and remunerative price to farm produce."

Where is profit? I think I will not even earn the cost of cultivation, he said in dismay.Onion farmers in the district have been facing the same problem for the last three years as they are unable to get any profit from their produce in the open market.With the hope of getting some profits at least this year, farmers cultivated onion in over 2,950 hectares of land during the rabi season, while they had cultivated the crop on 2,651 hectares of land during the kharif season.Though onion is arriving in the APMC yards, owing to falling prices farmers are unable to earn any profit.The prices have come down to Rs. 600 a quintal in the open market, while in retail it is being sold at Rs. 15-Rs. 20 a kg.At this rate, farmers will not recover even the cost of cultivation. Surely, lower prices will make consumers happy but certainly not the cultivators who have been incurring loss for the last three years, said Arvind Kulkarni, district general secretary of Akhanda Karnataka Raita Sangha.Meanwhile, officials of the Horticulture Department also said that a specific policy should have been framed to help onion farmers.When cultivation dips, prices shoot up causing inconvenience to consumers and when prices fall, it becomes a burden for farmers.

(Express photo by Arul Horizon) The increased arrival has subdued the price of onions, which are trading at Rs 6-7 per kg in mandis. (Express photo by Arul Horizon)The central government has announced a 5 per cent incentive on onion exports to boost the roots flagging prices, said Pasha Patel, chairman of the state governments committee for agricultural prices. Patel said he had met Union Minister of commerce Suresh Prabhu to discuss the matter. The minister has agreed to extend 5 per cent incentive for onion under the Merchandise Export from India Scheme, Patel told The Indian Express on Thursday.Onion prices have crashed in the wholesale markets of Maharashtra due to the bumper crop in the state. This year, Maharashtra reported plantation of over 3.5 lakh hectares of land, instead of the usual 3 lakh hectares. The increased arrival has subdued the price of onions, which are trading at Rs 6-7 per kg in mandis. The price drop comes after an eight month bull run for the bulb in wholesale markets. From June last year till early March, average prices of the bulb hovered between Rs 25 per kg and 30 per kg.The price rise was mainly due to the drought in Karnataka, which had resulted in the failure of Karnatakas rabi crop last year. Rabi or summer onion is planted late December and harvested post March-April. This onion is the only one which is amenable for storage and feeds the market from April till September before the arrival of kharif onions. Farmers in Maharashtra store these onions moisture proof storage structures called kanda chawls and offload them when prices are right.Last year, due to the scarcity of onions, prices were high. The government took several steps to reduce the prices, such as importing at least 20,000 tonnes of onion while income tax officials raided the premises of seven traders who were allegedly storing onions. Also, the Minimum Export Price (MEP), which was kept at zero since December 2015, was raised to $850 per tonne. Between April 2017 and February 2018, the country had seen exports of 21,35,421.57 tonnes of the bulb  a record high.Since March, onion prices have been on the wane as arrival has increased in wholesale markets. The governments decision to free exports by removing the MEP slab in February had failed to boost the market sentiments. Similarly, the decision of Nafed to wade in the market and procure 25,000 tonnes of the bulb at Maharashtras Lasalgoan mandi had failed to firm up the prices. It is expected that the price of the bulb will increase in the days to come. Agri-commodity analyst Dipak Chavan also welcomed the move, saying this will be beneficial for domestic markets. Our currency is at an all time low, so this incentive will have a positive effect on the markets and firm up the prices, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Add black pepper powder and three drops of lime juice. Consume the mixture thrice or four times a day; consume honey with onion extract regularly. This is one of the home remedies against the deadly Nipah virus (NiV) doing the rounds on social media While researchers are yet to find a cure for the virus, messages on the power of Indian herbs has caught the attention of social media users, especially those on WhatsApp.These home remedies should be condemned outright, said Dr Srinivas Kakkilaya, a consultant physician. Nipah is a serious infection involving the brain and it causes encephalitis. Such patients need immediate hospitalisation and intensive care. Most patients require artificial ventilation until the virus subsides.Kakkilaya revealed only one antiviral drug has proven effective so far. According to newspaper reports, the Kerala government has procured 2,000 such tablets and has placed orders for another 8,000 tablets.Dr Edmond Fernandes, CEO, CHD Group, also rubbished the home remedies. Let alone any home remedy, there is no treatment for NiV, he said. He urged the public not to believe such messages and refrain from circulating them.The messages circulating on social media, especially WhatsApp and promotion of alternative forms of medicine to cure NiV must be ignored, Fernandes said. Any development of illness during such times is best attended to by the medical community only.Ayurvedic doctors , too, claim there is no treatment as yet for NiV. Any medicine has to satisfy certain criteria to be released in the market. There is no treatment for NiV in Ayurveda as yet, Dr Gautham Alva of Alvas Ayur Care said.The first known case of Nipah transmission to human was reported in the late 1990s. So far, around 600 such cases have been reported across the world. The previous two outbreaks reported in the country  Siliguri in 2001 and Nadia in 2007  saw a fatality rate of 68% and 100% respectively. The average mortality rate in these 600-odd cases is between 50% and 70%.According to the Union ministry of health, 11 of the 13 confirmed cases of Nipah in Kerala have died."

A time when the devout fast from pre-dawn to sunset. It is also when the citys quaint areas  the bylanes off Mohammed Ali Road Bhendi Bazar and the heart of Bohri Mohalla  come to life with mouth-watering foods. BT went to the most popular of these spots  the bustling and beautiful Minara Masjid gully. Head here by 7 pm to catch the buzz, sights and sounds that it is so known for. And take your appetites along. The brightly-lit lane has little stalls on either side dishing up rolls, kebabs, baida roti, rich haleem and khichda , chilled firnis and, of course, piping hot malpuas, drizzled with thick cream. Heres more...Right at the entrance of the lane is a little makeshift stall with a huge handi or cauldron of khichda. This is a specialty  made of delicious, slow-cooked meat and lentils and garnished with thin slices of garlic, birasta (fried onion), mint leaves, a pinch of salt and a squeeze of lemon. Its said to infuse energy in those who are fasting to last through the day! You will also find a lighter and creamier version of the dish  the Hyderbadi badaami haleem  here.There are several finger foods to tuck into. Try the Chicken 65 (a fiery import from Andhra Pradesh), garam samosas, masala aloo, and more, with some naan.When youre here, reserve your appetite for kebabs, kheema, boti, bheja fry and other skewered fare, hot off the sigdi and made on a large, iron tawa. These dishes must be had steaming hot, with dollops of tangy mint chutney, onion and mint leaves.An unmissable part of your gastronomic trail is the malpua and it deserves special mention. It is essentially a large pancake-like sweet, made of egg, maida, sugar, saffron and milk. The round, sweet malpua is best had hot, straight from the kadhai, with a lavish dollop of thick cream or malai. Making it is also quite an art! First the eggs are beaten and charoli nuts, sugar and saffron are added to this. The malupa maker then swirls a generous portion into the smoking kadhai and deep fries it in ghee. If you want to have a small portion, ask for a single or then have the double and rabdi varieties.You cant leave here without a round or two of cold firni . You can also end your repast with sandan  the steamed sweet that looks like an idli, soft shahi tukda, cold fruity milkshakes, black currant and dudhi halwa and the mithai-centred flaky phool khaja."

My father was in this business and I grew up watching him cook. And when my husband needed financial help, I decided that I would open the eatery on my own and earn well through it, Saraswathi said.She stated that even before opening the eatery, she was clear that she wouldnt try anything fancy but only stick to preparing food items that shes known for. I know Im a good cook, but it doesnt mean every item I prepare would be good. Hence I decided to focus predominantly on only four dishes -- ravai dosai, adai, idli and dosai -- and customers proved that variety is not the only thing they are after, Saraswathi stated.Adai, which is provided along with aviyal, is the in-demand food item at the shop, while rava dosai is the second in the preference list of the customers. Both are served with sambar and two types of chutneys. Most of the compliments I get from the customers are that the food tastes similar to how their mother would prepare  this is the one which gives me immense satisfaction, she added ecstatically.While adai and onion adai are priced at Rs 25 and Rs 35 respectively, rava dosai and special rava dosai cost Rs 30 and Rs 35 respectively. Though the shop is usually open from 6 pm to 11 pm every day, sometimes, it gets closed earlier due to the food getting over soon due to heavy demand. For business sake, I could prepare more dough and increase the quantity, but it cant be done without compromising on the quality which I would never allow, claimed the Srirangam resident.She also said that idli, which is available at Rs 5/ per piece, is a hit among children especially because podi is given as an accompaniment. Saraswathi said, Even podi is prepared at my house. I sometimes feel I could earn even more if I sell podi packets alone because they in huge demand at my eatery.Saraswathis son, R Vedanarayanan , has been taking care of the logistics at the eatery, while one cook and two waiters are there to assist the mother-son duo."

Customers flock to his shop for the special delicacy keeping it busy all day.For 15 years the shop has been selling a range of savouries like sattur sevu, regular mixture, seeval and murukku. But the shop came to be known for its pakoda and was christened as Therku Vaasal Pakoda Kadai.The proprietor of the shop G Devakumar , a graduate, who took over his fathers business, says they make pakodas with same combination of ingredients like any other shop. But what makes it special is the way it is prepared. We do not buy gram flour in the market, instead we purchase quality Bengal gram and prepare the flour. To add up taste and make it healthy, we use only groundnut oil, he says. They also add cumin seeds and pepper while making the flour and while preparing the pakoda, a little ginger and chili paste is added to make it spicy and enhance the taste.One more reason for the popularity of the delicacy is that it is kept hot. They do not prepare and store it in heaps the entire day, although several kilograms of pakoda are sold every day. The delicacy is prepared fresh in small quantities and served hot from 7 am to 10 pm on any given day.One kilogram is sold at Rs180 and the sales starts from as minimum as 50 grams at Rs9. People who pass by, especially the elderly, would ask the pakodas for Rs5. We cannot say no to them, so we happily serve all types of customers, says Devakumar.His uncle D Thangaiah was the first to start a snack shop 30 years ago under NMR Subburaman Bridge at South Gate junction. Then, he went to start a separate shop in Vilangudi. Two of Devakumars relatives too run similar shops in the same locality.G Senthilkumar from Villapuram, a regular to the shop says his children love the pakoda from the shop. The pakoda can retain its crispiness and taste for at least one week, when kept in air tight container. But he prefers to buy it regularly as soon as it is taken out of the pan. It is our regular side dish with lunch. It goes well with any kind of kuzhambu. I also buy it whenever I visits my relatives settled outside Madurai, he said.Not only locals, but people who have settled abroad also get his snacks parcelled when they are in town. It is convenient too as the shop is located on the way to airport, says Devakumar."

The processing centres would have all necessary facilities for handling, processing and storage of banana and onions.The primary processing centres for banana are being established at Lalgudi, Manachanallur, Arasalur, Pidaramangalam and Thiruchendurai and for onion at Manachanallur, P. K. Agaram, Uppilliyappuram (South), Thuraiyur and Thathaiyengarpet. Construction of these centres is underway and is expected to be completed by August.Though cold storages can be established as part of the initiative, onions and the banana variety raised in the identified villages do not require them, officials in the Department of Agricultural Marketing and Agri Business told The Hindu . Marketing linkages would be established between farmers and farmers producers companies or big traders, entrepreneurs or exporters to ensure that the farmers got good returns. The SCM programme is being implemented at a total investment of Rs. 398.75 crore in 10 districts. In Tiruchi district, Rs. 28.66 crore has been allotted for the establishment of the 10 primary processing centres.Collector K. Rajamani, accompanied by R. Kailasapathy and other officials, inspected the works and the construction of the storage godown for agriculture produce at the Thathaiyengarpet Regulated Market. The 1000 tonne capacity godown is being constructed at a cost of Rs. 2.35 crore. Farmers can store their produce and also obtain credit by pledging them."

As India wades into the election battlefield next year, it will be governance that decides the mandate and not mudslinging. Indian voters have usually voted out non-performing leaders to bring in ones who promised better governance or Achche Din. Last week, almost the entire Opposition descended on Bengaluru to forge the blueprint of an alliance which will try to dislodge Prime Minister Narendra Modi in 2019.They had little in common except a venomous dislike for him. The optics of Mamata Banerjee and Mayawati, Sitaram Yechury and Siddaramaiah, Sonia Gandhi and Sharad Pawar, Rahul Gandhi and Akhilesh Yadav and others preening on a festive stage erected as a launching pad for HD Kumaraswamys ascension to the chief ministership of Karnataka was a political anagram spelling a warning to Modi. Beware! Our phalanx is ready to demolish your juggernaut.Not one of them put forth an alternative agenda for governance, and refrained from attacking each other, as they had done before arriving in Bengaluru and did soon after landing back home. But the message from Bengaluru was loud and clear: Battle 2019 would be fought between the Mighty Dozen and Crafty Modi. Once again, history is repeating itself.In 1977, it was Indira vs the Rest. In 1989, it was Rajiv vs United Enemies. The choices were between one opportunistic coalition and an unprincipled alliance. In 2018, Modi finds himself in the unenviable position of facing the entire regiment of Opposition leaders who cannot individually defeat him in nearly any major state. Rajiv Gandhis Congress was trounced by his own former minister VP Singh, who launched the Janata Dal from Bengaluru in 1988, supported by the BJP and the Communists. For Modi, 2019 is a greater challenge than 2014, when he was pitted against a defamed government and tainted leadership. Since then he has almost fulfilled his promise of achieving a Congress-mukt Bharat. What next?Though the Congress is just a ghost now, the BJP and its partners rule 22 states while regional satraps control the remaining states where the BJP is weak; some of them were once part of the NDA. The challenge for the Congress and other non-BJP Opposition parties is to snatch Lok Sabha seats away from the saffron sultan. Analysis of data shows that the electorate rejects over 65 per cent of sitting lawmakers in every state in every poll.This means the probability of sitting BJP MPs losing is higher than that of Opposition legislators, who together hold only 225 seats in the current Parliament. Hence, the Opposition has joined hands to take advantage of the anti-incumbency factor in Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Rajasthan, Haryana and other states where the BJP has been in power for one or more than two terms. Various opinion polls also indicate its vote share may shrink.While Modi remains the voters top choice, his personal popularity has shown a significant fall. However, it is not impossible for him to win a second mandate by making a course correction in the next nine months. Having created an admirable climate of economic stability and GDP growth, the prime minister will need to convince the voters that he has provided a government which works by adopting the Mantra of Reform, Perform and Transform. For that he must:*Improve perception. Modis promise of delivering Maximum Governance with Minimum Government seduced peoples high expectations. He correctly thought of right-sizing or downsizing the government. But four years later, its mass has bloated further. There are more secretaries and higher level officials now than in 2014. Bureaucracy is like a wildfire that has spread in favourable winds across the corridors of power. Taking advantage of the PMs trust in honest officers, babus have created innumerable tribunals, commissions and expert groups to accommodate retired colleagues.*Tame inflation: Modi had promised to reduce prices and provide more employment. Though the job market has shown recovery, it is less than expected. The wholesale price index is either stagnant or stuck, though within tolerable limits. Yet the perception created by the record spurt in petroleum product prices should be a major concern.The BJP made gas prices one of its major election issues in 2014. In 2018, consumers are paying more to fill fuel tanks, though the average cost of imported crude is down 40 per cent. Public perception that the government is squeezing the middle class is gaining ground. Modi should perhaps note that the BJP lost many elections in the late 1990s due to a rise in onion prices. Any hike in petroleum prices devastates the domestic budgets of the middle and lower classes. It has a spiralling effect on the cost of other goods and services. Providing affordable housing to the middle class is still a dream. Healthcare costs are exorbitant and the quality has plummeted in most of India.*Increase his Indian footprint. Modi has left his imprint on international diplomacy through inimitable Modihuplomacy. During the past four years he has travelled to a record number of countries and exhibited his popularity and innovative skills to numerous global leaders. But now he needs to reconnect himself with the electorate more. The BJP has wrested all the states from the Congress thanks to his magnetism. Modi is bigger than the BJP; the voters plump for him and not for his party. His domestic travel should be aimed at connecting with his core constituency and not just official events.Former deputy prime minister LK Advanis political relevance may have diminished in New India, but Modi should take his cue from a statement he made after the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, that the BJP lost because it had ignored its core constituencythe middle class and the committed Sangh Parivaris.*Forget Rahul and Sonia Gandhi. The prime minister is committing the cardinal mistake of attacking the Gandhi Parivar more frequently than politically required.Both mother and son had almost hit the political bottom after the Congress won just 44 seats in 2014 and lost in all the states it ruled between 2014 and 2018. Gandhi bashing paid dividends in 2014 since they remote-controlled the Manmohan Singh government and were punished by the electorate. Double jeopardy does not work. Indira Gandhi was defeated in 1977 for imposing the Emergency, but staged a triumphant return in 1980. The Atal Bihari Vajpayee-led NDA lost in 2004 despite an admirable performance.During the run-up to the 2019 elections, Modis oratorical skills and charisma would face the real test. He will have to convince India that he is not a leader who makes promises which are forgotten soon after the election, and that he has actually delivered more than what was promised in 2014."

This price is recovered from the farmers.As fuel prices rise by the day, experts have hinted that a similar upward trend is likely to be seen in the prices of everyday essentials. Prices of vegetables, which have remained steady throughout the summer, might see a 20-25 per cent rise if fuel price rise continues.At Pune and Pimpris wholesale markets, most of the vegetables have remained between the price range of Rs 10 and 40 per kg. A glut in production, as a result of almost 10 per cent increase in the area of production across the state, has resulted in the collapse of prices.Vegetables such as green peas, cauliflower, cabbage, carrot, et cetera are mostly trading in the range of Rs 10-15 per kg, which, traders said, is because of healthy arrivals. Tomato, in most wholesale markets, is trading at Rs 5-8 per kg, while in the retail markets the prices are about Rs 10-15 per kg. Onion prices, too, are at an all-time low, as a production glut has tilted the demand-supply ratio. However, as diesel prices are touching an all-time high, traders fear an imminent rise in the prices of vegetables.Vilas Bhujbal, president of the Traders and Commission Agents Association of Punes Gultekdi market, said the transporters have not taken the decision to increase prices as they were hopeful of a quick correction in the prices. However, if the present trend continues, a sharp increase in prices is likely, he said. Transporters act as a conduit between farmers and wholesale markets like Pune, to ferry perishable commodities like vegetables. Normally, these are village-level entrepreneurs who charge farmers per crate or per kg to transport their ware. For a market like Pune, transporters bring produce from neighbouring districts as well as from states like Karnataka, Kerala etc.At present, transport charges range between Rs 10 and 40 per kg, depending on the distance. This price is recovered from the farmers. Bhujbal said if fuel prices continue to rise, the transport charges may increase by 10-15 per cent immediately. This will effect the prices in the wholesale markets and, subsequently, the retail customer will get vegetables at a higher rate, he said. However, many growers said transporters have already effected a rise at their end.Deepak Bhise, president of the Tomato Growers Association of Junnar taluka in Pune district, said wholesale prices have but collapsed. As farmers, we have to use diesel for our tractors, our machines run on diesel. So, this is pinching us hard, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Many are also selling them within the villages, said Balbir Singh Rajewal, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU). Today is only the first day, so urban markets are still able to sell what was supplied earlier. Wait and see; by day after tomorrow, prices will shoot up in cities.Ramandeep Sangh Mann, a farmer leader associated with the KEM  an umbrella body of 62 farmer groups  said, According to local reports, 40% of milk supply in Punjab is affected.Extending support to the farmers campaign, Punjab Minister Navjot Singh Sidhu visited Patto village in Fatehgarh Sahib and purchased milk and vegetables directly from a farmer.In Haryana, arrival of farm produce at urban centres was down by 70 to 80%, BKU leader Rakesh Bains told The Hindu .Mr. Bains said implementing the Swaminathan Commissions recommendation on Minimum Support Price (MSP) for crops, complete farm loan waiver and fixation of minimum income for farmers are the key demands that the government should address immediately.We also want the government to fix MSP for milk and vegetables, he added.Supplies hit in RajasthanAlthough the agitation did not affect normal life in Rajasthan, supply of milk, vegetables and other farm produce was hit in Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Jhunjhunu districts.We will continue this for the next 10 days and the protest will intensify, said Santveer Singh, a member of the core committee of RKMM in Rajasthan. He said protests were held in Bikaner, Sikar and Nagaur.As the strike began, police in Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh have kept a close vigil as the anniversary of the June 6 farmers agitation approaches.

Its opening will help decongest the crowded Gandhi market. At the same time concerns are being raised over the traffic woes and safety on the Trichy-Chennai national highway service road where the new market is located.Onion traders at the Gandhi market supply small and big onions to as many as 10 central and northern districts of the state. The Trichy Onion Traders Association in June 2015 began construction works for the private market in Palpannai on 4 acres of land at an estimated cost of Rs 15 crores. As many as 101 shops will be available at the private onion market having 40ft roads, toilets and retiring rooms for loadmen inside the complex.Gandhi market has been a burden for us in unloading the onion produce and divert the same to other districts. Since we had adequate land registered with our association, we established the private market on our own with various facilities, said S Vellayappan , president, Trichy Onion Traders Association.As the construction works were completed a few months ago, onion traders planned to open the market on Sunday. The relocation of onion traders currently occupying corporation shops on Sub Jail road will be completed in a week.The shifting by 78 onion traders will be a huge relief to the district administration to decongest the Gandhi market. However, the private market which will be occupied exclusively by onion traders has raised concerns among road safety activists.The private market with a narrow entrance is situated on the service road. The district administration as well as the onion traders should ensure that the vehicles visiting market are parked inside the complex and not on the service road, said M Sekaran, member, road safety council. Since the private market is situated close to the Palpannai junction where the Trichy-Thanjavur and Trichy-Chennai national highways meet, Sekaran had also sought the traffic wing to not entertain heavy vehicles approaching the service road in the wrong direction.As the private market set to commence operation from next week, both the traffic police department and the onion traders have assured that heavy vehicles would be strictly made to park in the private market so vehicle movement is not disrupted."

But there is an unlikely candidate this time, mangoes. Several factors seem to have ganged up to create such a situation.The APMC yard here has turned into a virtual trash bin as the fruits are rotting, but there are hardly any buyers. The furious growers are throwing the mangoes into the drains and on the roads. Among the reasons for the price crash are excess production and fall in demand from the middlemen.The rates have fallen to as little as Rs 10-12 a kilo for the Badami variety. The other varieties of mangoes are priced at Rs 4-5 a kg, down from Rs 100 a few days ago.Varieties like Sendur, Rasapuri and Neelam have no takers. Buyers purchased 240 quintals of Badami mangoes at Rs 900 to Rs 1,000 per quintal. Other varieties (740 quintals) sold at Rs 500-600 per quintal. Even tomato is commanding a better price than mangoes, say the growers.Many lorry loads of mango are returning to the market as some buyers are sending them back due to excesssupply. Earlier, these buyers, mostly juice producers, used to fall over each other to buy both ripe and raw mangoes. However, this time, the buyers are imposing conditions on what they want.Nipah scareThe scare of the spread of Nipah virus through mangoes has discouraged retail consumers from buying them and so, the demand has crashed. Besides, there is a glut in production in Kolar, another major production centre.Many growers have left the mangoes to rot on the trees as they dont want to spend on the labour for plucking in the current situation."

He said the situation could worsen if the farmers boycott continued for a week or so. Another wholesale vegetable seller Balwinder Kumar said that vegetables, including cauliflower, tomato, cabbage, spinach and peas, have registered a rise between Rs 7 and 11 per kg.Meanwhile, supply of green fodder for animals have also been severely affected in Amritsar district, forcing dairy owners to give wheat straw mixed with choker (powdered animal feed) to the cattle.

Sections of the traders have been opposed to moving over to Kallikudi.The market complex has been built at a site purchased by the Tiruchi Onion Commission Mandi Traders Association as early as 1991. However, the association began construction of the complex only about three years back. In fact, the association expedited the construction process after it became clear that they would have to move out as the market at Kallikudi was coming up. The complex has 90 shops and modern amenities including parking areas for lorries and visitors.Association members indicated the onion traders would move over to the new market over the next few days.The wholesale onion market in the city is a hub for Bellary and small onions trade in the region and caters to retail traders from Tiruchi and neighbouring districts. Over 75 shops are situated along the narrow Sub-Jail Road, which was opened for traffic in 2009 after being closed for several decades. The shifting of the shops is expected to ease traffic congestion on the Sub-Jail Road and the Vellamandi Road and Thanjavur Road intersections.The complex was declared open by State Ministers Vellamandi N.Natarajan and S.Valarmathi in the presence of A.M.Vikramaraja and Ve.Govindarajalu, president and general secretary, respectively, of the Tamil Nadu Vanigar Sangankalin Peramaippu.Meanwhile, the Federation of Consumer and Service Organisations has urged the city police to ensure that the lorries transporting goods and vehicles of visitors coming to the new commercial complex at Ariyamanglam were not parked on the narrow service lane leading to it. M. Sekaran, president of the federation, also urged the police to ensure that the lorries did not go in the wrong direction towards Ariyamangalam junction while returning from the complex. The vehicles should necessarily go up to Senthaneerpuram to take the U-turn and should not go on the wrong side in the service lane to avoid the detour, he said."

The construction work was taken up in 2015 and was completed a few months ago, S Vellayappan, president, Trichy Wholesale Onion Traders Association, said.The land was said to be bought by the association in the 1990s. While only 78 wholesale onion traders are functioning in the corporation-run shops on the Sub Jail Road in Gandhi Market, the private market has 101 shops with facilities to stock large and small onions. Though the market is spacious and furnished with basic amenities, the approach road merging with Chennai-Trichy bypass apparently has a narrow entry which could cause a bottleneck on the stretch. Close to 145 heavy vehicles, including from Maharashtra, Perambalur, Namakkal, and Thuraiyur, will come to the facility to trade large and small onions. The market will supply onions to as many as 10 central districts here.After state ministers Vellamandi N Natarajan and S Valarmathi opened the facility in the presence of traders representatives on Sunday, wholesale onion traders said that around 78 wholesale onion traders operating from Gandhi market for now will be relocated to the private market in a months time. With the market being opened, the public has sought the traffic police department to ensure that heavy vehicles are not parked over the Chennai-Trichy NH service road causing bottleneck at the Palpannai junction where two national highways merge."

According to market sources, the retail onion prices are likely to increase to Rs 20/kg in a couple of days if the auction continues to take the hit due to the strike.The crash in the wholesale onion prices and farmers strike have altogether led to a drop in supply at Lasalgaon APMC, said Jaydatta Holkar, chairman of the APMC.Earlier, the average wholesale onion prices had crashed by almost 65% from Rs 1,700 a quintal on February 21 to Rs 600 per quintal on May 18.A farmer spends Rs 900 for a quintal on onions as cost of cultivation and if the produce fetches anything below this means huge loss.Presently, onions arriving in the market are of summer crop, having a shelf life of five months. Harvesting of summer onions was over in April and most of the farmers have stored their produce with the hope of getting better prices. The onions stored by farmers cater to the market until the arrival of fresh kharif crop in the second half of October."

After purchasing the land earmarked for stone quarrying, the individual, who had obtained permission for stone quarrying, had started the preliminary works for mining stone from the land.If stone quarrying is started in this land, it will seriously affect the 150 acres of cultivable lands surrounding the upcoming quarry and the adjacent Aayakaranthai irrigation channel. Since these cultivable lands are feeding the families of more than 500 farmhands now, stone quarrying should not be allowed. Hence, the permission given for stone quarrying should be cancelled, said Mr. Gurusamy.The petitioners also alleged that the individual had encroached upon the adjoining road, connecting Pambukovil Sandhai, for establishing the stone quarry in his land without getting mandatory permission from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board.Free house sites soughtA group of people from Gunaramanallur near Tenkasi, all daily wages labourers, submitted a petition to the Collector seeking free house sites as all of them are living in either rented house or in thatched houses built temporarily on poramboke lands.

A private shop agreed to help us monitor Thanneerpandhal spot to identify people dumping waste and penalise them heavily. Subsequently, we erected a hoarding mentioning that the spot was brought under CCTV surveillance, an official with the Ariyamangalam zone of the corporation said.After installing the hoarding, officials claimed that no waste was dumped in Thanneerpandhal locality.

Despite being one-way, the stretch is prone to traffic congestion. While haphazard halting of city buses on the road is stated as one of the reasons, the other was cited as encroachment by placing machinery and metal rods by welding and metal shops.

The aroma of sambar was all-pervasive. Everyone was in raptures over the pan-fresh, paper-thin, crisp dosas, served with onion sambar, coconut chutney and chutney powder. Chandra went home and profusely praised the food she had eaten. Her daughter asked, Why dont you get the recipe from Sneha aunty?Promptly, Chandra phoned Sneha and asked for the recipes. First, the sambar, said the master chef and went on to explain how it is made. Evidently, Chandra was sitting down at her end with notepad and pen. Just to be sure I have all the ingredients I need... And reeled them off. So far, so good, averred Sneha. Be sure to get the special small variety onions as they make the sambar more flavourful, she cautioned. Remember to garnish with coriander last and season with mustard seeds, a pinch of asafoetida, and curry leaves.Now the chutney. Grated coconut, fried gram dal...Is that right? Perfect! was the encouraging reply. Ill let you know how I fare, said Chandra. Blithely, she set off on her dosa expedition.True to her word, she called Sneha a day or two later. How did everything turn out? What about the sambar and chutney? Sneha wanted to know.(She had packed some chutney powder for Chandra earlier.) The sambar and coconut chutney tasted different, said a despondent Chandra. Why? What went wrong? Sneha wanted to know.I dont know! Did you follow my instructions about the onions, garnishing and seasoning? Yes, and I even added ginger and garlic to the sambar.Did I instruct you to add ginger and garlic to the sambar? Sneha sounded aghast. No, you didnt. I thought you forgot to mention it. The expert was rendered speechless. And you said the chutney needed just ginger. But I thought adding garlic would improvethe taste. And did it? Sneha couldnt keep the sarcasm out of her voice.Then she relented and asked, What about the dosas? They were fine. You didnt add ginger-garlic to the batter? Sneha teased. Keep things simple.That is the secret of good cooking, she advised."

It can be consumed raw, cooked, dried or roasted. Besides being used as a food, it has a variety of medicinal properties too.Onions have been known to mankind since prehistoric times and have found mention in religious books like The Bible and The Koran. The medicinal properties of the herb have been described by the early Ayurveda exponents like Charak (in Charak Samhita) and Sushruta.In Chinese medicine, Onions have been used to treat cough, bacterial infection and breathing problems. Ancient Americans used wild Onions to treat cold, cough, asthma and to repel insects. In modern medicine, it is used to lower blood sugar, tackle cardiovascular problems, prevent hair loss, urinary disorders, tooth ache etc.In India, the largest Onion-producing state is Maharashtra, all though it is also grown widely in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.In Bengal the production of Onions is not encouraging. The total cultivable area for Onions here is 0.3 lakh ha and production is 5.4 lakh tonnes whereas in Maharashtra the total cultivable land is 5.2 lakh ha and production is 65.3 lakh tonnes.However, realising the importance of Onions, Bengal has now started research and development at various agricultural science centres and universities to try and increase production.A full-grown bulbCultivationClimate and soil: The Onion is basically a cool season crop. But it can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions such as tropical, sub-tropical and temperate climates. The best performance can be expected in mild weather, without extreme cold, heat or excessive rainfall.In order to meet consumers rising demand, to minimise import from other states and to stabilise the price of Onions, Bengal is now cultivating the herb during rainy season (kharif) as well as during rabi season. For this, various new varieties of Onions are being developed.Onions can be grown in all types of soil such as sandy loam, silt loam, clay loam and heavy soil. But the best soil for it is sandy loam with good drainage and moisture-holding capacity. It cannot be grown in alkaline or low lying marshy land.Varieties: Onions can be broadly divided into two groups  Common Onion and Multiplier Onion. The Common Onion group includes the typical bulb Onion whereas the multiplier Onion forms smaller bulbs. In this article we shall focus on growing Common Onions.It is important to select the right variety of Onion as per the season. Varieties suitable in the kharif season are Bhima Dark Red, Bhima Super, Bhima Raj, Bhima Red and Bhima Shubhra. For the rabi season Bhima Shakti, Bhima Kiran and Bhima Light are more suitable.Planting: Common Onions can be grown by raising seedlings in a nursery bed, by broadcasting (sprinkling seeds) or drilling seeds directly in the field. It can also be grown by planting bulbs directly in the field. As Onions are mainly planted using the transplanting method, production of healthy seedlings require a well-maintained nursery. This will ensure better seedlings.Prepare a nursery bed of 3m length and 0.6m breadth and raise it to a height of 15-25cm. Spare a distance of 70cm between the beds as you would need it eventually for deweeding. Generally a well-drained, fertile, loam to sandy loam, loose and friable soil, rich in organic matter is preferred for such a nursery bed.Onions, peeled and choppedSeeds are sown in lines, 4-5cm apart, in rabi, and 5-7cm apart in kharif settings. Sowing should not be done more than 2-3cm deep and after sowing, the beds should be mulched with dry grass or straw to maintain and preserve the required soil moisture.As and when there is lack of moisture in the bed, water it using a sprinkling can. After germination, the mulching material should be removed and when required, the nursery should be protected from heavy rains during kharif season.To protect seedlings from direct sun rays, partial shade should be provided. The seedlings will be ready for transplanting in six to seven weeks in kharif and eight to nine weeks in rabi seasons. Two to three days before uprooting the seedlings, ensure light irrigation. Onions can also be grown by direct seeding.In the next edition we shall discuss methods of irrigation and harvesting the herb. Onions are prone to attacks by weeds and so weed management shall be discussed too. To be continued"

KarthikeyanThe prices of shallots (small onion) shot up in the wholesale onion market in Dindigul  one of the biggest in the State  on Friday due to poor arrivals and slump in production.Continuous rain in major shallot producing centres in Karantaka has damaged the standing crop, leading to a fall in production.The wholesale price of shallot shot up to Rs. 50 a kg from Rs. 20 a kg in the last 48 hours. In retail markets, the price of shallot hovers around Rs. 60 to Rs. 65 a kg, depending on quality and size. The arrivals slumped to less than half of normal quantity, said traders.Any short supply automatically leads to a jump in the price of shallots, said V. Rajendran, a wholesale trader. If the trend continues, the price will go up further.Arrivals from Theni, Pollachi, Coimbatore, and Mysuru in Karnataka is almost nil due to heavy downpour during the last week. At present, onion farmers at Sengurichi, Gujiliamparai, Vedasandur and Iyyalur in Dindigul district and Thuraiyur in Tiruchi district alone are supplying to the wholesale market.Normally, the market gets regular supplies from Andipatti and Cumbum in Theni district, Udumalpet in Tirupur district, Tiruchi and Mysuru in Karnataka. Now, the entire market is dependent on arrivals from nearby villages.Several areas of Mysuru, Kollegal and adjoining places in Karnataka, which are popular for shallot cultivation, have been receiving heavy rain this month.At present, Dindigul market receives less than 2,000 bags, each weighing 80 kg, a day against 5,000 bags last week. Arrivals are around 5,000 to 8,000 bags a day and three to four truckloads during peak season.Several godowns in the wholesale market are empty. Exporters too have stayed away due to high procurement price. Above all, the fresh shallots are wet and, hence, they have limited shelf life and unfit for exports. However, traders hope to sell them domestically.Heavy rain in western parts of the region will certainly affect arrivals to the market in the days come, they fear. Increase in arrivals of domestically grown shallot alone will stabilise supply and price, they say."

The government's fiscal deficit target for the current financial year, at 3.3 percent of GDP, is already under pressure due to high oil prices.""With funding under stress, the government can't widen the scope of agri purchases,"" said Sanjay Mookim, India equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""And even if it does, there is no storage available and you can't build storage in two-three months.""The ministries of agriculture and food did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The government said its limited purchases could cost it Rs 150 billion this year, although industry officials say it is difficult to estimate actual spending, which depends on the quantity procured.MSPs typically dictate crops that most farmers opt for, often leading to a glut of certain commodities, millions of tonnes of which have to be sold into a depressed local market at well below the cost of production, sparking angry farmer protests across the country.""What's the use of a hike when we did not even get last year's MSP?"" asked Purshotam Sontakke from a village in Wardha district in Maharashtra, who sold soybean at Rs 2,700 per 100 kg in 2017, 11 percent below the state-set price.A crash in farm commodity prices over the past few months has led to a waning of PM Modi's popularity in the countryside - where more than two-thirds of India's 1.3 billion people live - prompting the premier to invite a group of farmers to his residence last week and promise MSPs at 1.5 times of input cost.He called the latest hike historic and said he was committed to do more for farmers. His stated goal is to double farmer's income by 2022.LACK OF STORAGEState agencies bought only 71 million tonnes of wheat and rice in 2017/18 out of 210 million tonnes produced. In the same year, the country produced hundreds of millions of tonnes of oilseeds and horticulture crops like onion and potatoes, which are not typically procured by the government.The food ministry told parliament in March that the peak storage demand for food grains like rice and wheat was 60 million tonnes for the central pool, compared with a capacity of 73.5 million tonnes, 17 percent of which was open storage covered by plastic or other material.The ministry says on its website that the government will add more storage capacity by 2020.""Higher MSPs are welcome but there is inadequate public procurement at MSP, except in the case of wheat and rice,"" said M.S. Swaminathan, an renowned agriculture scientist.""This is clear from the experience of farmers who cultivated more pulses, on the expectation of procurement but were let down by a crash in market prices.""ELECTION PLEDGEDuring election campaigning in 2014, PM Modi promised steep hikes in MSPs and the doubling of farmers' income soon after becoming prime minister.But double-digit food inflation and a higher fiscal deficit forced him to raise MSPs only by low single digits over the past four years. This year's hefty hike marked a major shift in the government's approach.But Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives & Commodities in Mumbai, said farmers sold below MSP even last year and were likely to do so again given piles of grains and sugar lying in private warehouses.The below-MSP rates, however, are as much as 30 percent higher than global prices for some commodities like pulses, making exports uncompetitive, Galipelli added.The latest hike will only widen the difference and hit India's farm exports, which fell to $33 billion in 2016/17 from $42.6 billion in 2013/14, said the India head of a global trading firm who declined to be named citing company policy.""The glut will only increase in the country with higher MSPs,"" he said.

Nightclub",https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/stormy-daniels-to-visit-washington-dc-this-week-for-a-strip-club-show-1880168,2018-07-09,"Stormy Daniels is scheduled to be here for the club's ""Official Grand Opening.""Adult-film actress Stormy Daniels is scheduled to visit downtown Washington, D.C., on Monday night, bringing her strip show to the Cloakroom, a nightclub located about midway between the Capitol and the White House.It's not the first time Daniels has promised to perform in Washington, near the high-profile subject of her alleged 2006 affair and the man she has sued, first to void their hush agreement and then for defamation: President Donald Trump. A much anticipated June visit was canceled because of a ""scheduling conflict,"" according to Cloakroom owner Andre de Moya, who gave a brief tour of his club on a recent weekday night.Daniels is scheduled to be here for the club's ""Official Grand Opening."" Four years ago, the Cloakroom's building - then on one of K Street's seedier blocks - collapsed, sending customers and nearly nude performers into the streets, and the club shut down. It reopened this spring and now sits among high-priced condominiums and trendy restaurants.A touch of class appears to be what de Moya is banking on. The club website makes no mention of the ""Make America Horny Again"" tour that Daniels launched in January in South Carolina, days after news reports surfaced that Trump's longtime lawyer Michael Cohen paid $130,000 to silence her during the 2016 presidential campaign - an attempt to keep her from talking about her alleged relationship with Trump. (Trump has acknowledged the payment but has denied the affair.) For its Washington, D.C., audience, the Cloakroom teases a show more tastefully titled ""All Things Revealed.""Which is just what audiences anticipate from a woman who has made her living performing, writing and directing pornographic films. De Moya was coy, though, about what to expect when Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, shows up to perform two shows each night on Monday and Tuesday.De Moya declined to say whether there would be any special arrangements when the country's most polarizing pole dancer takes the stage. It would be like ""any old night,"" he said, but they ""just happen to have Stormy Daniels here.""Though ""here,"" as de Moya added, is ""pretty close to the White House.""Tickets for the shows have been on sale on the club's website: general admission is $50 for entry to the main floor, and comfy leather VIP-level seating is $100. As for the 12-guest skyboxes, which offer aerial views of dancers turning somersaults on poles below? For $3,500 per show, they come with added enticements such as bottles of champagne, truffle popcorn and ""Dark and Stormy Shots.""The Cloakroom - which bills itself as a multilevel adult entertainment venue - is, by all appearances, more upscale than the last place Daniels performed when she visited the area, at Fantasies Nightclub and Sports Bar in Baltimore, a squat concrete building about 15 minutes from the airport.The cover charge at that event in April was $15 for early arrivals. The menu offered deep-fried fish nuggets and chicken wings served with ""G-string onion straws."" And while the Cloakroom has scheduled a 6 p.m. Daniels performance to accommodate summer work hours, on her first night in Baltimore, Daniels didn't appear onstage until after 10:30 p.m.A succession of house dancers entertained a restive audience of regulars, strip-club first-timers and journalists until Daniels sashayed onstage as a sequined Little Red Riding Hood.She performed in heels that were modest by the standards of the night - a reminder, like the 1980s dance music, that Daniels, at 39, is a senior figure among strippers. As the crowd broke into chants of ""Stormy! Stormy! Stormy!"" and some showered her with bills, all things were revealed, as Cloakroom promises they will be this week.It was all over in about 10 minutes.Or so it seemed, until Daniels crawled along the bar with a man carrying a purple bucket walking beside her. Strip-club newcomers were transfixed, tucking bills into her thong. One man pressed Daniels to join him on his bar stool. She declined. ""I'm not doing lap dances tonight,"" Daniels told him.Is that what visitors should expect when Daniels comes to Washington, D.C.?""No,"" said de Moya, who was willing to offer some idea of what not to expect: At the Cloakroom, performers are not allowed on the bar.""This is a high-class gentlemen's club,"" de Moya said as neon-blue lights shone on a topless dancer nearby. ""You can quote me on that."""

All chef Mithilesh Tembe had to serve his guru, chef Ranveer Brar, was some finger-licking food.Tembe, executive chef at the 1BHK restaurant in Oshiwara, Mumbai, faced his toughest challenge ever when he had to prepare a meal for Brar, who has taught and honed his culinary skills.Memories, laughter and, of course, food filled 1BHK on Sunday evening as Brar arrived to celebrate International Chefs Day.Tembe started out as an expert in French cuisine, but he began trying his hand at Indian food after being trained by Brar. The food he served Brar, though, was not geographically limited. And it was a spread that would make the guru proud.Charred brocolli with rose harissa, Thai style sweet and sour fish, chickpea hummus with green chilli theecha and poi, prawns chil pil with steam bao, Goan fish curry with red boiled rice and chicken dhansak with brown onion pilaf. For dessert, Brar had creme brulee.Brar was well impressed by his student. The food created by Mithilesh was very expressive. The idea of adding a thecha to the hummus was very interesting, as was serving garlic prawns with poi bread. It was boundary-less and bold food, something that I always stand for, he said.In particular I loved how the Goan fish curry came out, nice consistency. The dish that stood out for me the most was the charred broccoli with rose harissa, he added.Recalling the beautiful evening, Tembe thanked Brar for visiting his restaurant. He said Brar had taught him the mantra of being a chef, which is not just making beautiful food ...its about the humility that you carry it with.Theres one thing, though, Tembe need not be so humble about  the creme brulee he made on Sunday night.

This year, due to the carry forward stock and tough competition in international market, onion dehydration plants are also not giving the farmers adequate prices.Mahua Market Yard in Bhavnagar district is the biggest trading centre for white onion after Lasalgaon in Nashik. Nearly 90% white onion grown by farmers in Bhavnagar and some parts of Amreli is exported.In 2016-17, nearly 60,000 tonnes white onion was produced, which reduced to 45,000 tonnes in 2017-18. This year, the yield is expected to remain between 30,000 to 35,000 tonnes.Former president of All India Dehydration Vegetables Association, Vitthal Koradia, said, Last year, farmers got Rs 100 per 20 kg, but this year, the price will be nearly Rs 160 per 20 kg. But still they would be booking losess as the production cost is around Rs 140 per 20 kg. We have last years 10,000 tonne stock. Ten dehydration plants have declared bankruptcy because they had purchased huge quantity of stock from farmers in previous years but they didnt get the expected price in the international market.Farmers said that the dehydration unit owners are selling their produce at cheaper rates in the international market to remain in the competition. As a result, they are unwilling to give the farmers adequate price.There are 100 such plants in Mahua and nearly 50 plants are dysfunctional for the want of orders. India exports 40% of worlds requirement of onion and is the second biggest exporter of onion after America, which sends out 45% of its produce.According to farmers, their production cost is Rs 140 per 20 kg and since last two years, they are booking losses.Himmat Patel, a farmer from Talaja, said, This year, the yield is expected to reduce because area under sowing was much less due to last years experience. Moreover, irrigation water is also not available. Farmers cant afford to book more losses now and government should intervene.Farmers who didnt sow white onions also didnt sow red onions instead.D S Royla, secretary of Bhavnagar Marketing Yard said, This year, production of red onion is expected fall by 25% because of non-availability of irrigation water. However, its early to say that it would result in price rise in the retail market because we dont have proper figures of the crop in other states."

This prevented trucks from entering the yard and brought the sale of vegetables and foodgrains to a halt for nearly three hours. Murugeppa Gudisalamani of Seeparamatti village, who has grown onion in six acres, said that traders had colluded with each other to deprive farmers of fair prices.By this time, the police tried to intervene and urged the farmers to open the gates and the latter agreed. However, after a few minutes, there were further allegations of cheating by traders and farmers closed the gates again. By evening, a team of officers convinced the farmers of the need to allow routine transactions. The gates were opened later."

This was double the price of Rs 12 for a kg of onions a week ago.Onion supply also dropped by over 1,000 quintal at Market Yard on Wednesday, with the prices going up by Rs 2 per kg. On Tuesday, onion prices in the wholesale market were Rs 6-Rs 17 per kg. Within a day, the prices rose to Rs 8-Rs 18 for a kg.Wholesalers feared that the prices might increase to Rs 2,000-Rs 3,000 from the current rates of Rs 800-Rs 1,800 for a quintal.An Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) official told TOI that onion supplies decreased on Wednesday than what it was during the previous four days.He said, Several factors are leading to the decrease in supply. During Diwali , onion stock drops as the new crop does not reach the markets. Besides, onions have not yet reached the harvest stage in many fields. Another reason may be water scarcity in various districts because of less rainfall this monsoon.The official said the stock of old onions, which reached the market around April, was also dwindling. We need both the old and the new crops as the demand is high during this period. Besides, use of chemical-based fertilizers farmers by the farmers in soil for years are also affected the quality of the crops, he said.The biggest onion market in Lasalgaon of Nashik district is also reporting dipping stocks over the last eight days, with just 10,000 quintal being the average supply per day. Nashiks kharif onion production is set to plummet drastically by about seven lakh tonnes or 78% following drought-like conditions in parts of the district. Over 60% of the total kharif onion acreage of 52,517 hectares in the district has dried up, with scanty rain this monsoon.Indersen, a vegetable vendor in Koregaon Park, said hoarding of onions by middlemen was triggering an artificial shortage and price rise.Yakub Pathan, a retailer in Wakad, said the stock of old onions was down to 50%. The retailers prefer to buy old onions because the new crop tends to rot fast, he said."

Food Processing Industries Federation president P. Bhaskar Rao said Chittoor had been the leading producer of tomato in the State and had a substantial share in the national market.But, since it is a perishable commodity and the farmers and also entrepreneurs are struggling to earn minimum returns from it, the Union government has stepped in to alleviate their plight. The ODOP scheme is applicable for processing industries in food parks established by both the Central and the State governments.Tremendous scopeLike all other agriculture and horticulture crops, only about 5% of tomato is processed, which provides a tremendous scope for venturing into the business of adding value to it.Food parksMr. Rao pointed out that the Andhra Pradesh government was promoting 12 food parks with its own budget in addition to the Central government-sponsored Srini Food Park in Chittoor and Mallavalli Mega Food Park in Krishna district and the one dedicated for aquaculture namely the Godavari Mega Aqua Food Park at Bhimavaram in West Godavari district.Processing unitsIn all, 20 to 25 food parks had been sanctioned by the Centre across the country, but the State had taken the task of promoting the processing units upon itself by setting up its own parks in view of the great importance of the rich variety of crops to its economy and the livelihood of lakhs of farmers."

Rahul Gandhi does not even know that onion is grown under or above the ground, but he acts as if is the well-wisher of farmers, he said.Earlier, Rahul Gandhi used to talk about making Amethi a brand, but has failed to do so.

We are coming out with a wide range of Ready to eat and Ready to reconstitute food products. Research to ensure that these products have nearly one-fourth of calorie requirement for the day is under way, besides ensuring Recommended Dietary Allowance requirements of essential minerals. These products will benefit those children in the group of seven to 15 years.CFTRI was inaugurated in 1950, and we are celebrating our 68th Foundation Day this year, said the chief scientist.

Today, CFTRI is considered the home of food science and technology in India.Subramanian went on to add that baby food was among the earliest innovations of CFTRI, which today houses a whopping 17 research and development departments. We have since rolled out many other innovations such as parboiled rice, spice oleoresins, energy foods, spirulina cultivation, etc, he added.More recently, CFTRI played a crucial role tending to the nutrient needs of flood-affected victims of Kerala and Kodagu. We prepared 15.6 tonnes of food in six days, and dispatched 55,700 meals to Kerala, Subramanian said.A carbonated beverage plant, in addition to the upgrading of the existing animal house facility and the ragi mudde machines are among the recent innovations of CFTRI. Subramanian pointed to the jump in CFTRIs rank from 32 in 2017 to 16 this year in Scimago Institutions Ranking  Scimago ranks are a measure of the impact of scientific studies and research.Schoolchildren were awarded certificates for achievements in a wide range of science competitions organised at schools in association with CFTRI.

Interestingly, the same produce is being sold at Rs. 22 and Rs. 18 respectively in the retail market.An increase in the arrival of stocks from the Rayalaseema region, particularly from Kurnool district, is said be reason behind the drop in the wholesale price, which is expected to take a further plunge in the coming weeks, as harvesting is in progress in Maharashtra. At present, about 1,600 tonnes and 2,000 tonnes of onions are arriving here every day.Farmers bring their produce here from faraway places.

The new variety is virtuous enough to help the farmers improve earnings as it has smaller gestation and a longer preservation period than any other regular variety of onion.It may be recalled that the agriculture scientists of BUAT had developed a dark red variety of onion which had proved to be a boon for onion growers of Bundelkhand region. Associate Professor, BUAT, Dr RK Singh calls this new variety Line-883. ""The crop of this variety gets ready in 83 days instead of 110-1120 days taken by regular onion varieties,"" said Dr Singh.He added that the yield is almost 20 per cent higher than the regular onion crop with 300-350 quintal per hectare as against 250-280 for normal varieties. ""We have tried to address the preservation issues as well. Usually, onion stays just for a month and gets sprouted at normal temperature but Line-833 can be preserved for over two and a half months without sprouting both at normal temperature and cold storage.Dr Singh has been conducting his experiments with the seeds of Line-833 in Bundelkhand region for the last two years.Before this, he had actually started his research on the new variety while being in Nasik National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF) a decade ago. Elaborating on its positives, Dr Singh explained that it took lesser time to grow as compared to the regular varieties. ""This is ready within 80-85 days against traditional 100-110 days of onion crop. Moreover, its level of endurance and resistance to disease is much higher than other onion varieties,"" he said.On his decision to introduce this variety to Bundelkhand onion growers, Dr Singh said was best-suited option for them as Bundelkhand was water deficient and the new variety grew to require a lesser amount of water while giving best results in Kharif season.However, he added that its seeds were used by over 400 farmers of different regions and states, including Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Bihar, Jharkhand Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan and Karnataka, on trial basis with exemplary results. Moreover, 15 farmers of Banda district have used the seed of Line 833 and got very good output, said BUAT authorities endorsing the variety. Explaining the technical aspect involved,Dr Singh claimed that in Bundelkhand region the sulphur content in the soil was higher than normal. ""Sulphur increases the activity of soil. For Line-833 sulphur rich soil is best suited so it will give outstanding results and can be a boon for Bundelkhand framers,"" said Dr Singh."

Read MoreDownload The Times of India News App for Latest CityJHANSI: An agriculture scientist at Banda University of Agriculture and Technology has come up with a high-yielding variety of onions that can be preserved for a much longer period. Its gestation period is also much less than the normal variety. According to Dr RK Singh, associate professor of the university, who has developed this new onion , this variety gets ready in just 80-83 days as compared to 110 taken by normal varieties. The yield is also 300-350 quintal per hectare against 250-280 for normal varieties which is almost 20% higher.Besides, it can be stored for two and a half months in normal temperature without getting sprouted whereas normal onion starts getting sprouted within a month. It can also be preserved in cold storage for up to 80 days, which is almost four times higher than the normal varieties staying power.As per Dr Singh, he had started his research more than a decade ago in Nasik where he was posted in National Horticulture Research and Development Foundation (NHRDF). During his initial research on this special variety, he had named it Line-883. After he was transferred to Banda, he saw good feasibility in Bundelkhand of testing it. I got good results in the past two years, he said. Discussing some more positive points of his new variety, Dr Singh said that it was quite tolerant to local diseases. The new breed has a growth of 50-55cm length with a bulb of diameter of 5-6 cm. It requires less water and gives best results in Kharif crop . Some local farmers have already started using the seeds and have got very good results. As per farmer Ram Singh (49), the new seed is boon for farmers of Bundelkhand. Singh, who has been awarded by Union agriculture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat for his earlier outstanding results, said: The new seed developed by Dr RK Singh is indeed very good and is producing good results in local climatic conditions."

As tea at the bus stand was always in demand, they set up a tea shop and later started serving vadas also, he said. The founders had always been proud to remind their customers that they established the shop in the year when the Tamil movie ``Pathinaaru Vayadinile, featuring the late Sridevi as heroine, hit the screens  1974.So, what is special about the vadas made in the shop? It is in the quality of the urad dhal, pepper, rice flour and quality of oil used to fry it. The golden brown vadas, like doughnuts, are fried through and crispy on the outside. Though the shop also sells other varieties like keerai vada, paruppu vada and onion vada, it is the urad dhal vada that most customers prefer as the main snack.A vada is sold at Rs 6 with coconut chutney prepared from freshly grated coconut as an accompaniment. On an average, the tiny shop sells as many as 2,000 urad dhal vadas a day and the number goes up on chilly days. They make 60 vadas per round as customers wait in queue for their freshly fried ones. ``The freshness is what makes these vadas extra tasty, said A Simon, who dropped in for a bite while waiting for his bus.Tile:What is famous: Urad dhal vada, keerai vada and milk bunWhere : In tahsildar cross street near Anna bus stand (Find out from her)Cost per vada: Rs 6Timings: 5.30 AM to 8PM"
5ce746b0e8e3fc56af41853a,Quick and easy recipes for Diwali parties,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/food/quick-and-easy-recipes-for-diwali-parties/cid/1673711,2018-11-03,"Since people are hungry when they arrive at a party, they tend to load up on appetisers. So, its a good idea to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger food. Source: `www.cucinamiabynatasha.com`I love how the festive season in India stretches for so long. In Bengal it starts with Durga Puja and in other parts of the country with Dussehra. Once that is done, the countdown to Diwali begins and then theres bhai phonta or bhai dooj.It goes further on to the New Year for some communities. So its a long time before people are back to normal life! And this means parties, celebrations and more eating and drinking. And lots of hosting! Heres a guide to make you shine as the host at your festive celebrations.DECIDE ON DECORYou do not need to spend a fortune to decorate your home to reflect the festive spirit. Diwali is all about light. So simple diyas and tea lights around the house can create magic. Pair those with fresh orange and yellow marigold and you have a gorgeous traditional look.The entrance to your home should give a positive first impression. Do it up with floating candles and flowers in a large bowl of water or a simple rangoli on the floor adorned with diyas.For me, the dining table is always the highlight as food is an integral part of any party. I love doing up the table based on the occasion and theme. At my own Diwali party in Bangalore, I added a south Indian touch with banana leaves, flowers from the local market and classic earthen diyas. All for less than Rs 200!PREP IN ADVANCEWe all host parties and get-togethers because we want to share these happy moments with our loved ones. However, most of the time, the host ends up running around and getting stressed during the party. This would not happen if you organise yourself and also reduce the number of unnecessary tasks.Choose a menu which you can prepare a day in advance. Dishes which have to be made or assembled just before serving are a complete no-no.For garnishes like fresh herbs, lime wedges and other fresh ingredients, prepare them just before the party and keep them ready on a tray in the service area of your kitchen. That way you dont have to go rummaging around in your overcrowded fridge for the dhania while the hot food is waiting to be served.Use disposable crockery and cutlery to reduce washing up. These days you get lovely bamboo and paperware which are eco-friendly and look nice as well.Ice, ice, baby! How many times have you been at a party getting your drink from the bar, only to be told Sorry we are out of ice! There is nothing more putting off than a warm drink, be it a whisky or a cola. Do remember to start stocking up on ice cubes a couple of days in advance so that will be one big job out of the way.Sweet potato chips www.cucinamiabynatasha.comSWEET POTATO CHIPSGet healthy and gourmet with these oven-baked sweet potato chips.Ingredients4 sweet potatoes2tbsp olive oilSalt and pepperChilli flakesMethodPeel the potatoes and cut into chips.Steam half-way.Heat the oven to 180C.Combine the sweet potatoes with the olive oil, salt and pepper.Bake on a baking dish or tray for about 30 minutes, tossing in between till crispy.Serve warm with any dip, sauce or chutney.Minted pea hummus/ beetroot hummus www.cucinamiabynatasha.comMINTED PEA HUMMUS/ BEETROOT HUMMUSWhen the classic hummus bores you, you revive it by adding vibrant colours and veggies! You can use either peas and mint, or beetroot in this recipe for some gorgeous hummus.Ingredients1 cup chickpeas (boiled)2 beetroots, cut in large cubes, or 1 cup of boiled peas and some mint leaves1tbsp tahini2 garlic clovestsp cumin powderJuice of  lemonChilli flakesSalt and fresh pepperToasted pine nuts or walnuts for garnishMethodSteam the beetroots/boil the peas or bake in the oven.In a blender, blend together the boiled chickpeas, beetroot/peas and mint, tahini, garlic, cumin, chilli flakes, salt and pepper. Add lemon juice and 2tbsp of water till you get the right consistency.Garnish with toasted nuts and seeds. Drizzle some extra virgin olive oil just before serving.GET THE MENU RIGHTIt is incredible how much food gets left over at parties and then the host family ends up eating the same thing for the next couple of days or distributing it to neighbours and domestic staff in the justification that they are not wasting food. Well, why not just make less of each with the idea that if one dish finishes there will always be something else to eat.In my opinion, the appetisers or finger food and the dessert should be the main focus. The main course could be very light or just a one-pot wholesome dish for those wanting something more. People are hungry when they arrive. So they tend to load up on appetisers.A good idea is to serve salads and rice dishes in little cups as finger foods which people can have while playing cards.Try out some healthy appetisers like sweet potato chips with beetroot/pea and mint hummus or curried peanut dip which you can make in advance. These are regulars on my party menus by popular demand. You can also make them for your post-Diwali visits or bhai phonta gatherings as, by then, people are really done with all the heavy eating of the season.So go on, get cracking to make your festivities super special.Wish you all a shining and enjoyable Diwali!The dining table can be a highlight; decorate it in the traditional way with diyas, flowers and banana leavesCurried Peanut Dip www.cucinamiabynatasha.comCURRIED PEANUT DIPThis is a new addition to my recipe stash with an interesting desi touch of spices, peanuts and coriander.Ingredients1tbsp vegetable or olive oil1 small onion chopped1tbsp garlic, mincedtsp coriander powdertsp turmeric powderRed chilli flakes to taste2 large carrots, finely chopped cup toasted peanuts4tsp fresh lime juice1tbsp soy sauce1tsp brown sugar1tbsp crushed peanuts (for garnish)1tbsp chopped fresh coriander (for garnish)1tbsp crumbled feta cheese (optional)MethodIn a pan, heat some oil and cook the onion and garlic.Add the coriander powder, turmeric powder and red chilli flakes.Add the carrots with salt and pepper and saute until carrots are half-cooked.Add in the toasted peanuts, lime juice, soy sauce and brown sugar.

5ce746b3e8e3fc56af41853d,A moveable street feast in Calcutta,https://www.telegraphindia.com/culture/a-moveable-street-feast-in-calcutta/cid/1673726,2018-11-03,"A walk down a sidewalk in Calcutta is like walking down a buffet line, writes Christine Kaaloa on her food blog, Grrltraveller. The entry reads: This city is phenomenal when it comes to street food. Some hawkers practically work and sleep in their stalls. Each morning, they wake up and prepare food, hot, spicy and savoury for the hungry passers-by.Calcutta has close to 2,00,000 street food vendors serving over 10 million people daily with over 250 varieties of dishes  soft-boiled duck egg sandwich, uttapam, malai kofta and dal butter fry with masala kulcha or missi roti, dudh puli, sarpuria, whatever not.A recent survey conducted by travel portal booking.com has declared Calcutta the top street food hub of India, ahead of Amritsar, Delhi, Ahmedabad and even Mumbai.Serenaded by honking cars and buses amid smoke and dust, these vendors have been carrying on for decades. Profits are minimal, but sales volumes keep them going.Indira Chakravarty, a public health expert, whose studies on the citys food vendors have led to policy changes at various levels, tries to get street food vendors to cater whenever she organises seminars and conferences.Her reason: street food is safer because vendors rarely store food. As a consultant with the Food Safety and Standards Authority, she has seen how a lot of hotels store meat, poultry and non-vegetarian items for as long as six months. A street vendor prepares food in the morning and by evening everything is sold out, says Chakravarty, who is now chief adviser of West Bengals public health engineering department. As if to underline her point, she orders toast, omelette and peyanji  an onion pakoda variant  from a vendor near her office in Dalhousie Square.Chakravarty has conducted surveys of Calcuttas street food on behalf of the All India Institute of Health and Public Hygiene (AIIHPH), whose results have been feted by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. The verdict: The spread is tasty and highly affordable. At the time of the survey, in 1995, hygiene standards needed improving.That has changed, Chakravarty says. Our members try to maintain standards and learn the basics of food safety, says Anadi Saha, general secretary of the Hawker Mens Union and Hawker Sangram Committee. He adds, We have had workshops organised by AIIHPH experts.Though much has been done, much remains to be achieved. Vendors dont have a clear idea about harmful artificial colours  like the carcinogenic metanil yellow used in jalebis  or spurious food additives. Neither do they know that deep frying in the same oil is bad for health. But the biggest bugbear seems to be the lurking extortionists with their continuing threats of ousting vendors.We are trying to fix all these, says Saha, who is looking forward to the civic bodys suggestion of setting up smart food kiosks. Vendors have also been promised ID cards and medical insurance coverage.THE FOOD WALK*8.30am  Madan StreetOn the footpath adjoining the Hindustan Building of the Life Insurance Corporation of India, brothers Barun and Bholanath Den have just set up their breakfast stall. Sitting atop an earthen stove is a frying pan, which exchanges place occasionally with a wire mesh laden with thick slices of bread. The frying pan is for the eggs. Most office-goers demand two slices of bread with a boiled duck egg cut in half and sprinkled with salt and pepper. Those with more time on their hands often opt for a half boiled egg, cut open and smeared on the bread and covered with a drizzle of finely chopped onions.Our father set up the stall in 1978 when this was a small market for radio, transistors and their spare parts, says Barun as he shells a hens egg with the end of a teaspoon. His dexterity and speed is such that the shell comes off as a continuum. A massive flood had destroyed our village, Amta, 50 kilometres west of Calcutta, says Bholanath as he passes a piece of toast to his son, who then slathers on it much butter and sprinkles sugar.Insurance agent Chandan Bhowmick says, I leave home at 7.30am. Theres no time for anything. I eat breakfast here and wash it all down with a bhaanr of tea. The eggs and toast cost Rs 20 and the tea, Rs 5.The Den brothers feed about 700 people every day till 8pm from Monday to Saturday. By evening everything is sold out, says Barun. Nowadays we are getting orders for office picnics and from film production units, he adds proudly.E. Chandran Swami's south Indian food stall Prasun Chaudhuri*9.30am  Crossing of Princep Street and Ganesh Chandra AvenueE. Chandran Swami has been selling south Indian food at his kiosk here since 1968. I came in 1961 from Kilalkulam near Madurai. I was 14, he reminisces as he pours batter with one swift circular motion on a square tawa. He didnt learn to make idli, dosa and uttapam in Tamil Nadu. He learnt it all at a south Indian joint here. Seven years later, he set up his shop. Today, at 70, he is helped by his grandsons.Sanjoy Roy wolfs down a masala dosa (it costs Rs 50). He is a clerk employed with a private firm that deals in automobile parts. You must try his special tomato-onion uttapam, he tells us while dipping pieces of dosa in crimson chutney. You wont find this special chilli-garlic chutney anywhere in Calcutta.Chandran cooks all the food early in the morning at his rented house near New Market with the help of his wife, daughter and grandsons. He arrives at the kiosk sharp at 9am on a cycle van. He takes special care to store the coconut chutney and other perishables in ice boxes during peak summer. The cheapest item at his kiosk is a single dahi vada, which comes for Rs 17. The most expensive item on his menu is mixed cheese butter uttapam  it costs Rs 65. Of late, hes been getting a lot of contracts from school canteens.Every day, at 6pm he shuts shop, purchases a Tamil newspaper and heads for the Maidan. There, lying on the soft grass, he reads leisurely the days news. It is a stale serving this, but thats how he likes it.Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba Prasun Chaudhuri*2pm  Ganesh Avenue and Mangoe Lane crossingWhen we reach Rajneesh Walias foodstall Mission Dhaba, there is already a large crowd around the tandoor. About 40 people, including several cab drivers, are milling around. The plates in their hands are laden with dal makhani, chana, paneer, kulcha and pulao.Gopal Das, who drives a yellow taxi, says he lunches here at least four times a week. My order seldom changes, he says. I take half plates of chana masala, dal makhani and raita, alongside two tandoori rotis. All of it comes to Rs 60. We take a cue and place the same order. The dal makhani has a lovely smoky taste. The masala kulcha is as soft as a pillow. And the Rs 14-a-plate raita has pineapple and pomegranate in it.Rajneesh cooks the food with a couple of assistants at a small shop on Mangoe Lane. He says, My father, Surjit Singh Walia, started this 20 years ago. But this half-plate variety is my innovation.Rajneesh has started getting orders to cater for weddings and private parties. No advertising and all, he says matter-of-factly. Its mostly word-of-mouth.Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now Prasun Chaudhuri*4pm  Meredith Street and Central Avenue crossingAfter a heavy lunch, its time to wrap up with some desserts. Bablu Kanta Ghosh has been selling Bengali sweets on the pavement near the India Coffee House for nearly 50 years now. I learnt my craft at a sweetmeat shop in Howrah, says Bablu. He himself hails from Haripur village in Hooghly district, 35 kilometres north of Calcutta.From Monday to Saturday, he stays at Bowbazars Chhana Patty, the hub of cottage cheese. Chhana is the basic ingredient of most Bengali sweets. Bablu prepares sweets that are not easily available at sweetmeat shops  malpua, labanga latika, bel morabba and darbesh.The bel morabba is a big hit with those who have problems with their morning constitutional.I make these myself and bring it all here in a hand-pulled cart, says Bablu. He also sells rasogolla, chhana pora, lyangcha, rasomalai and a variety of sandesh sourced from Hooghly. Sweets from Hooghly are far better than those you get in the city, he says. During winter months he sells nalen gurer sandesh and rasogolla.Sunirmal Bose, a 65-year old office peon working at a travel agents office, is one of Bablus oldest and most regular customers. I am a big fan of his malpua and labanga latika, he says. During Vijaya Dashami, I take a whole lot of these home.Every Saturday, Bablu leaves for his village. A sweet end to a mixed week."

Consequently, the retail prices jumped, and in the national capital New Delhi, the price hit Rs. 40 a kg, before the Union government reviewed the price and availability of onion and asked the Delhi government to make onion available through its public distribution system outlets as was done in 2015 when prices had spiked.Has supply dropped?Government data show production of onion has fallen marginally during the 2017-18 crop year that ended June 30. The third advance estimates say onion output is likely to be around 22 million tonnes during the reported period, lower than 22.4 million tonnes in 2016-17. However, compared to the average production of the past five years, it is about 12% higher.Traders point out that the supply of onions in the Lasalgaon market mainly dropped owing to a drought-like situation in parts of Maharashtra, where the onions Kharif crop is likely to be lower. However, they are hopeful that as the arrival from neighbouring Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh has started picking up, prices will moderate. Jaydutta Holkar, chairman of the Lasalgaon APMC, says supplies are gradually rising, and on October 31, the average wholesale price of the onion was around Rs. 10-11 a kg. Onion price surged only for a couple of days in mid-October but later as the arrival increased the price has dropped. However, those selling in the retail have kept the price up only to derive more profit..., he says.Traders and the government hope prices will moderate in the coming days as the supply is expected to improve as soon as the harvest begins in the onion-growing areas of Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Rajasthan.Why this recurring volatility?In India, onion prices are extremely volatile. While the production in the country over the years has been rising, sharp price spikes are experienced almost every alternate year. The key reasons for severe and frequent price shocks are attributed by agriculture experts to production fluctuations and changes in the nature of demand.The growth in onion production has risen from below 5.5 million tonnes till 2002-03 to nearly 20 million tonnes in recent years. Experts point out that the annual growth rate of above 13% in onion production since 2000-01 is phenomenal and no other food crop in the country shows this type of growth in the recent years.However, domestic and overseas demand for onion seems to be outpacing growth in supply, points out Professor Ramesh Chand, a member of the NITI Aayog. He says the per capita demand of onion has increased from 4 kg in 2002-03 to more than 13 kg in recent years. This growth in per capita demand for onion reflects a mind-boggling change in preference of Indian consumers for onion. It also implies that the effect of spikes in onion price on household budgets is getting heavier. It looks strange that increased availability is associated with the increase in price volatility rather than providing flexibility to absorb small shocks in supply, he says.What is in store?The price trends of onion over the years show that high prices prevail only for a few months and the excessive volatility can be managed through appropriate mechanisms. Professor Chand says a multi-pronged strategy involving technology, extension, public stocks, and market intelligence is needed to address excessive volatility. Stocking by public sector parastatal like the NAFED will also keep a check on exploitation and market manipulation by private trade, besides price stabilisation, he adds.Vikas Vasudeva"

The scheme was announced in the budget speech of 2018-19 with an outlay of Rs 500 crore to stabilize the supply of tomato, onion and potato (TOP) and to ensure availability of these crops throughout the country round-the-year without price volatility.Union food processing industry minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, in a press release on Monday, said, Price volatility of TOP crops wreak havoc in the households of this country. This scheme has been prepared after sustained talks with all stakeholders and we will ensure that the TOP crops reach all households in the country all through the year.She said the government had laid down special measures and grants-in-aid under the scheme to ensure enhanced production of TOP crops and to augment value chain. Operation Greens aims to enhance the value realisation of TOP farmers by targeted interventions. These interventions would range from strengthening of production clusters and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) and connecting them with the market to price stabilisation for both producers and consumers through a proper production planning. The measures would include introduction of dual use varieties, reduction in post-harvest losses by creation of farm gate infrastructure, development of suitable agro-logistics, creation of appropriate storage facilities linking consumption centres and increase in food processing capacities. Operation Greens also envisages setting up of a market intelligence network to collect and collate real time data on demand and supply and price of TOP crops.The ministry would provide 50% of subsidy on transportation of TOP crops from production to storage and hiring of appropriate storage facilities, the minister stated."

Yes, in this good old new city of Calcutta, where malls, coffee shops, nail salons threaten to beat down all oddities into a global sameness, these cries can still be heard. They rent and then dissolve into the skies, add flavour.Of course, they are all different pheriwalas or pedlars, but because one rarely gets to put faces to those voices, in my head those cries always emanate from a single entity  faceless, mysterious.Daaab. Daab chai, daaaab, is one of the earliest cries of the day. (Daab means tender coconut.) The clear shout slices the sleep off the morning in one fell swoop. So what if you havent heeded the cry? It continues to linger in the air, impossibly itinerant, till the thirst begins to bubble over.So you are ironing your clothes and thinking daab. You are chomping dry toast and thinking daab. You are looking for your spectacles and thinking daab. And just when you cannot take it any longer and at the cost of getting late for work you dash down the stairs to claim your daab, he is gone. Poof! Like he was never there.Daaab. Daab chai, daaaab, is one of the earliest cries of the day. (Daab means tender coconut.) Image: The TelegraphIt reminds me of something my grandmother told me. Many years ago, as a little girl in Dhaka, she would be woken from her sleep in the pre-dawn hours by a faraway voice. Day upon day it sang the same song: Kaya re bhai kaya/Jaal bunechhe maya/Je matite jonmo/Shei matitei milai kaya. The deep philosophy about mortality, attachment and existentialism would tug at my heartstrings every time Dida sang it to me. She and her siblings woke up early one day determined to identify the Voice. And what did they see? The form of a man riding off into the blurry morning on a bicycle.Sometimes I think the pheriwala inhabits our consciousness and days like Didas invisible man, like an outer inner voice. As the day ripens in the city, the pedlars voices return. Mid-morning it is Ka-goj. Purano ka-goj (meaning, old newspapers), or Lohaaa lokkor. Lohaaa lokkor (meaning, scrap iron) or Chaaabiwala  that would be the keymaker. Towards afternoon you hear  Sheel katai. Sheel katai.The content of the cries is really elemental. It is the rendition that makes them stand out. The way the syllables are broken. The way the vowels are pulled out, dragged along. The way the pauses and sound effects are woven in.The sheel-nora is a variant of the mortar and pestle  sheel is the mortar and nora, the pestle. To approximate the perfect grind on the turmeric or onion or ginger, it is imperative that from time to time the mortar is worked upon by a professional. A sharp instrument is used to pockmark it. That is the service on offer here.In many areas you can still hear, Jyanto katla, magur, koi... Live freshwater fish. In some other neighbourhoods, Chul-kapod-bashon. In exchange for hair  it is measured out in glasses or steel tumblers  and used clothes and old utensils, pedlars offer brand new steel utensils.Not every word of every cry can be deciphered always. But you can tell what is what from throw and timing. For instance, just before winter and during it too, there is the odd clang-clang of the dhunuri or the quilt-maker. The sound comes from the sitar-like thing used to fluff the cottonwool stuffing of legacy quilts.I remember a time when post-school hours, a raspy voice would sing out, Doi chai, doi, or Cakeman. The bhaanrs or earthen pots of reddish yoghurt came with ice-cream spoons and tasted of the earth. Cakeman carried a tin trunk on his head filled with cream rolls, chicken patties and pastries with thick pink icing.In the world of pheriwalas, the auditory performance plays out according to some unwritten rules. These are mindful of the tempo of human life, urban existence. In the evenings, except for the rare cry of bel phul (mogra flower), it is mostly a medley of odd bells and rattles.The rattle signals the rare advent of the madari with cavorting monkey on leash. The jangling of bells could be the dosa-idliwala. And by way of a wrap, there is the siren ting-ting of the ghoti goromwala.Ghoti means pot and gorom, warm. This pedlar carries with him a roundish contraption with a lamp burning in the centre. Its many deep pockets contain peanuts, jhuri bhaja  impossible to translate  chips and more. He mixes up the savouries, warm from the heat of the flame, and adds finely chopped onions, green chillies and tangy aamra before serving it all in paper cones. As he awaits the next customer, he lets out a short, sharp cry  Ghoti gorom."

The 43-year-old cook has been working in the shop for the last 30 years.What makes the parotta unique at Ajmeer Mahal is its fluffiness, combined with chicken and mutton curry or gravy offered along with it. In most of the shops, the dough is kneaded for just 15 minutes as they do things in a hurry. We knead it at least for an hour and as a result the parotta is fluffy and tasty. We also add broken cashew, added Balamurugan.Parotta and egg parotta are the best sellers at Ajmeer Mahal. Balamurugan said that the onion is sauted till it becomes dry and only then the eggs are added. After the egg becomes dry, the minced parotta is added. If you add parotta when the egg is still creamy, the aroma will not be great. It takes a bit more time, but it enhances the taste, he added.Apart from parotta and its varieties, the shop offers variety rice, biryani, chicken 65 and grill chicken. Parotta is available from 6pm till 12am on any day and is priced at Rs10 apiece, while egg parotta is sold at Rs60."

Individually, in petrol and diesel it was 19.85 per cent and 23.91 per cent, respectively, and for liquified petroleum gas (LPG) it was 31.39 per cent during October.The WPI inflation is in contrast to the retail or consumer price index-based inflation data released earlier this week. The October CPI inflation had cooled to a year-low of 3.31 per cent.ICRA Principal Economist Aditi Nayar said the uptick in the WPI inflation in October reflected the impact of the pass through of higher commodity prices and the rupee depreciation. The disinflation in food prices had a much smaller impact on wholesale inflation than the CPI, given the difference in weights for food items in the two indices.""Despite the change in the monetary policy stance to calibrated tightening and the uptick in the core-CPI and core-WPI inflation in October 2018, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) appears likely to maintain a status quo on the repo rate in the December 2018 policy review, following the decline in the October 2018 headline CPI inflation, the deep correction in crude oil prices, and the pullback in the INR,"" Nayar said.The RBI is scheduled to come out with its fifth bi-monthly policy review statement on December 5.She said that the easing in the crude oil prices and the recent strengthening of the rupee, would keep WPI inflation range bound between 4.5-5 per cent in October-March period.Nayar said the core WPI inflation hardened to a three-month high of 5.1 per cent in October, reflecting the impact of the rupee depreciation on the landed price of imports.""While the uptick in both the core-CPI and core-WPI inflation in October 2018 warrants some caution, the recent pullback in the rupee and crude oil prices has softened the risks to the inflation trajectory,"" she added.The Indian rupee had touched the record closing low of 74.39 in October, and ended the month with total losses of 104 paise or 1.43 per cent due to a strengthening dollar, firming oil prices and trade worries. Since then the currency has recovered and is now trading around 72.2 to a dollar.Brent crude, the international benchmark, was trading around USD 76.25 per barrel in October. The brent crude futures is now trading at USD 65 to a barrel.To cushion the impact of global fuel price rise, the government had, with effect from October 5, cut excise duty on petrol and diesel by Rs 1.50 per litre and asked state-owned oil firms to subsidise the fuel by another Re 1 a litre.The 5.28 per cent inflation is the highest in four months, and a higher inflation than this level was last seen in June at 5.68 per cent.Among food articles, potato prices continued to rule high with 93.65 per cent WPI inflation in October. While onion witnessed deflation of 31.69 per cent; the same for pulses stood at 13.92 per cent.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) mainly takes into account retail inflation data while formulating monetary policy.In its fourth monetary policy review for the fiscal, released last month, the Reserve Bank maintained status quo on the benchmark interest rate but warned that volatile and rising oil prices, and tightening of global financial conditions pose substantial risks to the growth and inflation.For October-March, the RBI pegged CPI-based retail inflation to be between 3.9-4.5 per cent."

She loves to cook and wrote her first recipe book, Miss Masala: Real Indian Cooking for Busy Living, around eight years ago. Mallika Basu  former Bengal chief minister Jyoti Basus granddaughter  has more kitchen wisdom and scrumptious meals to share in her second cookbook, Masala. Sprinkled with memories of Sunday lunches with her politician grandfather and secret recipes from her north Indian maternal grandmother, Mallika has whipped up a delicious hardback of slow feasts, classic curries, sweet treats, quick fixes and more. We caught up with her on an email chat.What inspired you to write a cookbook, as there are several on Indian cuisine already?This is a very personal book that was inspired by my own experience of trying to fit Indian cooking into a busy family, social and professional life.I use a lot of cookbooks and found myself finding ways to simplify the recipes in them and the recipe instructions being given to me by my family. A lot of Indian recipes are based on nostalgia and age-old traditions, but we dont live the way our parents and grandparents did. Even my mother (theatre veteran Dolly Basu) and her friends use great little shortcuts to make food simpler to cook and more wholesome.I found myself reaching for gadgets, innovative food products/ingredients, and easy cheats that dont compromise on flavour. I saw a gap in the market for an Indian cookbook that reflects the way we live now  for busy people, who dont have much help in the kitchen and want to get wholesome, delicious food on the table for friends and family.The design aesthetic of contemporary India was also important for me to reflect. The Western view of India is all elephants and paisley, despite the beautiful, minimalist Indian design I have been enjoying. We were keen to capture the texture and colours of handloom, architecture and nature in the look and feel of the book.How did you go about curating the dishes?I started with mealtime moments. We Indians love our breakfast, and there is a huge trend of lazy brunches, so that had to be a chapter. I also love entertaining, so feasts needed to feature. Then I included family favourites from my homes in Calcutta and London. A lot of recipes from Delhi feature, where my mum is from and where I worked briefly. Then there are several Bengali recipes. But importantly, we were a cosmopolitan bunch and recipes from other communities featured too. I am very influenced by Gujarati food, for instance, and I travelled extensively in Kerala, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and even researched Calcutta food. So recipes from there feature too.Masala has many anecdotes from your childhood, involving your grandfather Jyoti Basu. What was your relationship with him like?It was like any other relationship between a doting grandfather and his besotted granddaughter. Dadu called me his crown princess and was keenly interested in my academic and other achievements. When I participated in a beauty contest and came last, it didnt stop him from driving his convoy straight to our home and chanting beauty queen, beauty queen as he came up the stairs to see me. He looked so glum in photos but he sprung to life and smiles when he was around us. When I got married, his one concern was that I would give up my career. So I think hed be proud that I have not one but three full-blown ones, including motherhood!Any food memory from your childhood that comes to mind?Sunday lunch was a big tradition at our home (in Salt Lake). I always remember lazy afternoons with lilting Bollywood tunes, vodka cocktails for the grown-ups, my dad (Chandan Basu) stirring slowly and the kids filling up on chanachur while lunch took ages to cook. I also have not-so-fond memories of driving my mother crazy at mealtimes. I was a very fussy eater and skinny child. My poor mother oversaw the most amazing food, which I would reject without even trying. I did eventually grow out of it though, as is probably evident!An easy version of burgers  Chappli Kebab Picture from Mallikas InstagramIn the book, you mention that you have been influenced by your maternal grandmother a lot...Nani is a proper matriarch with Afghan blood in her. She was actively involved in our parenting and a strong influence on food, culture and others. I used to travel with her to Delhi for my winter holidays and have the best time. She gave up non-vegetarian food when she lost her husband, but still cooked excellent chicken curry. Thanks to her, I enjoyed the best of Delhi home cooking  rajma chawal, kadhi pakora, gajar methi, and parathas stuffed with absolutely everything.I called her when I was writing Masala and we had an awkward conversation, as she is hard of hearing, until I asked her for her recipe of nimbu ka achaar. She sprung to life and after much testing, the recipe has now been perfected for modern kitchens and is in my book.To be honest, I had all manner of busy people in mind. A lot of my followers are young families, professionals without kids and silver surfers who are enjoying their kitchens and cooking in a new way. I live in London, so some of the recipes do need to be adapted for international kitchens but its never complicated and nothing an instinctive regular cook cant manage. I know a lot of Indians who move away from home to study, or to get married or for work. They buy my book because they find the recipes are so doable and always taste right.In the age of quick tutorial videos, do you see a cookbook being relevant?Absolutely. Quick tutorial videos are great, but there is only so much you can cram into a short video. Cookbooks are increasingly being bought for longevity, because they offer something over and beyond just recipes. A video tutorial can never replace that.Is cooking a passion or is it just a hobby or something more?All of the above. I find it very relaxing and often cook after a long day to unwind. But more than that I am passionate about addressing misperceptions about Indian cooking that exist. Its not as complicated, difficult and time consuming as people think. Thats what got me writing about food. All you need is know-how, great recipes and a fantastic cookbook.Channa Dal, Mustard Prawn Curry, and two favourites  Peas Pulao and Saag Aloo Picture from Mallikas InstagramAt home, what kind of cooking would we find in your kitchen?I often use my own cookbook, so thats very much the kind of Indian food you would eat if you came to my home. I love other cuisines, and so Indian dishes take pride of place alongside Chinese, Japanese, Persian, Italian and much more. My family loves variety; the kids especially are gourmet babies, with a very wide-ranging palate and love for food and cooking. So its a mixed bag. The food is always wholesome, well balanced and simply cooked.What kind of influence does your husbands half-Peruvian and half-British heritage have on your cooking?I was quite lucky that Peruvians like flavour and lots of chillies! I never had to tone down our spicier dishes for him... We met at university in London through Gujarati friends and the rest, as they say, is history!How much of Indian culture are your kids exposed to?They call themselves half-Indian and love dressing up in their festive Indian clothes and eating Indian food. I often make dosas and chillas at home for weekend breakfast, which they eat before you can wink. And they love going on holiday to India. Sadly, I havent been great at teaching them Hindi or Bengali. Still they are only small so there is hope!How do you make time for this alongside a career in communications?They say if you want something done, give it to a busy person! But seriously, I have been very blessed with the support of my husband, my family and friends. I also gave up a full-time role in communications in favour of consulting, so I now have a portfolio career that allows me the flexibility of enjoying my day job and indulging my passion. Hopefully, I am living proof of my own unique difference  that I am a busy home cook writing delicious recipes that work for other busy home cooks.What is next in the cooking space for you?I am still busy promoting the book and it is such a labour of love that I am trying to slow down and savour every minute. Watch this space for my next venture!Macchli Curry (Simple Fish Curry) Source: MasalaRecipe for Macchli Curry(Simple Fish Curry) (Serves 2-4)Coated in turmeric and chilli and simmered in a gently spiced curry, this is a very simple way to enjoy fish with the lightest of spices. Fish in India comes from both the fresh waters of its lakes and rivers and from the sea. Although foreign varieties such as basa are gaining popularity in restaurants and supermarkets, the morning trip to the fish market for the catch of the day remains a firm tradition in the fish-loving states. In Bengal, for instance, this is traditionally a job for the man of the house, who prides himself on his masterful bargaining with the sellers.

Three days ago, premium quality onions were being bought from farmers in the range of Rs. 12 to 15 per kg, but their prices also crashed to below Rs. 10, by Monday. In other parts of the State, farmers are being forced to sell their crop for Rs. 1/kg.Distressed, the farmers in Bagalkot district recently protested by throwing onions on the road and staging rasta roko. Similar agitations were held by farmers in Hubballi. The Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, which also held a protest in Bengaluru on Monday, has demanded that the government announce a minimum support price (MSP) and open centres across the State for the purchase of onions. We spend more on transporting onions from the farm to the market than what we get, said Hanumanthappa, an onion farmer from Amingad, Raichur district, who had come to Bengaluru on Monday to protest.Basavaraj, another onion grower from Chitradurga, felt the government must announce an MSP and buy their stock. Last year, onions got good price as a kg went up to Rs. 30 in the wholesale market. We were expecting a similar situation this year, especially after Deepavali. But, we have now incurred huge losses, he said.According to Ravi Kumar from the Onion and Potato Traders Association, Bengaluru, there has been a glut of onions in markets across the country leading to crashing prices. Supply has far outmatched demand for onions in the market. In the last two weeks, markets in Alwar, Rajasthan; Ahmednagar, Maharashtra; and Belagavi, Karnataka have been shut down for days, and they havent bought onions as the existing stock is still unsold, he said.Why the glutWith a bumper onion crop this year, crops from Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh have flooded the market, while the harvest season in the State has yet to end.To add to this, onions from Pakistan and Afghanistan have flooded Punjab and Delhi markets.We dont see the situation improving till the harvest season for the crop is over and stocks are cleared. In fact, we foresee a further drop in prices, said a procurement official from a prominent retail chain in Bengaluru.One kg of onion is still being sold at Rs. 20/kg in the retail market and the prices are expected to crash this week."

The decision was taken by the All India Vegetable Dehydrate Manufacturer Development Association, that begins direct procurement from farmers on Thursday at Mahuva.The members of the association have had old dispute with commission agents over the commission they charges.Secretary of the association, R K Seta said, We had asked the commission agents to reduce commission from currently 3% to 2%. We had been doing consultation since last two and half months but there was no consensus. For farmers to get reasonable price for their produce, and save our procurement cost we have decided to procure it ourself directly.Mahuva is one of the biggest onion production, trading and dehydrating hubs in the country. White onions from western Indian states comes here for dehydration.India supplies 45% worlds onions. There are nearly 300 registered commission agents in Mahuva market yard who procure onion from the farmers in open auction.The arrival of onions has just started and will continue till March. The commission agents charges 3% commission and give 19 days credit to the purchasers.There are two type of purchasers one is trader who purchases red onion while dehydration unit owners buy purchase white onions which is only for export after dehydration.The commission agents have been demanding reduction in payment cycle to 12 days from 19 days.The meeting was held between agents and buyers in market yard where chairman of the market yard proposed 15 days payment cycle which was rejected by the buyers.Chairman of Mahuva Market yard Ghanshyam Patel told TOI: The traders or buyers say that onion is unregulated farm produce so it can be produced from the farmer. It is illegal to procure from the farmers directly outside the market yard.This year onion was cultivated in 24,000 hectares in Bhavnagar and Amreli districts. The current price of onions is Rs 100-130 per 20kg for red onions and Rs 150-180 for white onions. According to market experts this year the production is expected to go down by to 25 percent due to insufficient rains."

Democracy and rule of law are under attack. We have to fight this onslaught on our institutions, otherwise history shall never forgive us, Singh told reporters here. Singh rejected Modis allegation that the UPA government was remote-controlled by the Gandhi family.Manmohan Singh said: This is absolutely incorrect. The government (UPA) was run in a manner that the party and the government were both on one platform. I feel this was the reason for the success of our government. There was no difference of opinion between the government and the party.Tearing into the Modi government, he said: Our nation is going through extremely challenging times for the last four and a half years. National security is imperiled, women are unsafe and marginalised and weaker sections face persecution. Farmers distress is all pervading and the youth are suffering from acute joblessness. The common man is suffering from rising prices, notably prices of petrol, diesel as well as cooking gas.The unwitting and ill-conceived demonetization and a flawed GST, coupled with tax terrorism have dealt a body blow to organised and unorganised sectors, the noted economist said.Singh accused the Modi government of building a false narrative a day to justify the demonetisation disaster. The plain truth is that demonetisation is a monumental failure of epic proportions. None of the stated objectives of demonetisation has been achieved. Neither was the Rs 3 lakh crore of black money confiscated as claimed before the Supreme Court on November 10, 2016 nor was fake currency checked. Stated objectives of ending terrorism and Naxalism have totally floundered, he said.Notebandi was a deliberate and designed attack"" on the savings of small and medium businesses, farmers and homemakers, he said, pointing out that 120 poor people lost their lives in bank queues as a parallel market to convert old notes into new ones flourished under the watch of Modi government.The Modi government came to power on the promise to usher in transparency and end corruption. But we have only witnessed corruption peaking under Prime Minister Narendra Modi . The acts of omission and commission in Rafale deal need a thorough investigation by a Joint Parliamentary Committee, the former PM said.Asked how Congress was reduced to ruling just four states, Singh said, The Congress party does face problems. Those problems, particularly what happened in 2014 elections, the ability of the opposition to mislead media and through media the public at large about so-called corruption in the UPA regime. I think we were not able to carry connections with the public in conveying ourselves in 2014.But since then, people have seen through Modis promises, he said, adding: I think people now recognize that a large number of promises made by the BJP turned out to be hollow.Labour Bureau data shows only a few thousand jobs were created or added every quarter and the promise of achhe din proved hollow, he said, demanding to know why the Labour Bureau Survey for October-December 2017 has not been released.Over 2.8 lakh youth with MBA/LLB/BE/PhD applied for 738 peon posts in February this year in Madhya Pradesh and the state could create only about 17,600 jobs every year. The maximum number of people in India, who ended their life due to unemployment, belong to BJP-ruled MP. Between 2005 and 2015, there has been a 2000% increase in suicides in MP due to unemployment, he said.Attacking the Shivraj Singh Chouhan government on Vyapam scam, e-tender scam, onion purchase scam, dal purchase scam, agriculture pump subsidy scam, he said that proper investigation and accountability are the first casualties in MP. Farmers are in great pain all over India, including MP. Between 2004 and 2016, MP saw nearly 17,000 farmer suicides,"" he said."

This profit comes only if the produce commands a good price in the market. The farmer has urged Mr. Modi to intervene and help farmers get higher profit."

This is one reason why she chose the BSP.I initially considered contesting from other parties part of the Maha Kutami, but was told that they would offer me ticket from a reserved constituency, if such possibility emerged from the seat sharing adjustments. I felt uncomfortable about being reduced to my immediate identity, and decided to join the BSP. It is like homecoming to me, Ms. Sujatha, who teaches Sociology in Sathavahana University, says.Having been a fellow with UNHRC and Forum-Asia, and conducted international workshops, Ms. Sujatha says the tokenism associated with being Dalit woman has always troubled her.Identity issuesI would be constantly reminded that I was on these forums owing to my identity. Even if one has potential to speak on other issues, one is reduced to representing ones immediate identity, she rues.She, however, chose Chennur owing to the presence of more Dalit voters there, numbering over 80,000, and also because she had worked there on caste and land issues earlier.Ms. Sujathas decision to enter political fray is rooted in the persecution she reportedly faced from the State agencies, during her fight on Dalit issues. She is fighting three cases slapped against her after questioning atrocities on Dalits.Most prominent was the complaint filed over an open letter she had written to the DGP questioning the decision to ban film critic Kathi Maheshs entry into Hyderabad.Bridging the gapBesides, her constant engagement with Dalit communities since formation of Telangana as separate State, over various atrocities, brought home the painful fact that all demonstrations and protests aside, justice is always encapsulated in having to approach the elected representatives and official machinery, however much hostile they were.It fuelled my desire to fight elections and bridge the gap between government and the movements, she said.Strong voiceBorn in Suryapet of Nalgonda district, Ms. Sujatha began her activism as student, with Vakapalli sexual assault case, and went on to fight displacement at Polepally, illegal quarries at Karimnagar, and Polavaram Project. During Telangana movement, she emerged as a strong voice for separate State, through her writings.Poor representation of women in legislatures too bothers her, and through her contest, she hopes to take womens participation in politics beyond agitating over onion and gas prices. Chennur is highly displaced area with huge unemployment and wanting in basic facilities, she says and vows to focus on women and youth if elected."

And on their way back from Ghosh Mansion, Aaduri gives Hem the lowdown on Lata and Ronny.Sarat Chandra Chattopadhyay, arguably the greatest exponent of relationships in literary Bengal, had written in Devdas that childhood love was, for all its intensity, ultimately cursed. It seldom led to happily ever-afters.But we are both over 18, Kakimoni, Lata had replied, softly, suddenly maudlin even though she found the possibility that what they had  that perfect, fragrant, sunset-coloured thing  might be poisoned to be highly remote. Shed buried her nose in the pink pashmina shawl she had stolen that season from Manjulikas almirah.When shed lifted her head, she saw Kakimoni smiling. Whaaat? shed said, and Kakimoni shucked her chin. That pink is perfect for people newly in love, shed laughed. You are right, it doesnt apply to those who are not children. But Kakimoni said that tartly, raising her eyes in the direction of the verandah where Ronny was bickering with Molly over the carrom board, much like a minor. Well find out, wont we? she said, Whether you were children or adults!Kakimoni would then heave herself from the bed and go out to their little kitchen, carved out of a nook where a tertiary stairway had been boarded up  the Ghoshes had all divided up their kitchens by then  in order to make them scrambled egg sandwiches with cheese. And Lata would drag herself out of bed and curl up in one of the Bombay fornicators kept outside on the verandah (neither she nor Ronny knew the term then), five of them in a line, and impatiently wait for Ronny to stop playing carrom and revise economics with her. Its he who needs the revision more, she would huff. But the sight of him and Molly wrapt in play also made for a pleasant picture. Once, unknown to Ronny, she had snuck his camera out of his bag and taken pictures of them.Where are those pictures? she wonders. Hadnt Ronny framed one and given it to her?When theyd broken up, shed told Kakimoni bitterly, on a weekend she was home with dark circles under her eyes, You were right. Childhood love is poisoned.Not me, Kakimoni had replied sadly, enveloping her in a hug, Sarat-babu.***The Bombay fornicators are long gone.Lata stands now where they used to be lined up and watches as the lights over the courtyard come on. It was Ghosh Mansion all this while; now, in the blink of an eye, it is transformed from a decaying house in a decaying neighbourhood into an unfamiliar place, a new continent, one where happiness and success and glory are all a handspan away for the taking.After Latad taken charge of the Molly-AJ wedding, along with the army Nimki had summoned from the massive contacts list on her phone, Ghosh Mansion had suddenly come alive in the last two days. Given the paucity of time, the rooms on the ground floor were all locked up for the evening in lieu of being cleaned (Lata kept a roster of the keys and promised the various owners of said rooms that it was a temporary matter). The corridor and the courtyard leading to the naach ghar were scrubbed clean. Not even a speck of dust should be visible to the Marwaris, Nimki was heard shouting every 10 minutes or so, Mollys mother-in-law has OCD and we better live up to her standards of cleanliness. In any case, Molly doesnt know any housework. If they see dirty corridors here, they will always link the two. FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE. Lata had also decided that since there was no time to get the walls painted, a major red herring was required. She cajoled the electrician to create a canopy of twinkling lights over the courtyard.The effect, Lata now sees, feeling quite pleased with herself, is magical.Molly steps out of Kakimonis bedroom in her engagement outfit and sighs at the lights. She wears a white chanderi full skirt trimmed beautifully in gold, paired with a post-box red choli. Much to her mothers unhappiness, shes refused to wear anything around her neck but the plain gold choker that Manjulika and Lata had given her from Manjulikas own collection and a pair of gold danglers that had been their great-grandmothers.Lata looks critically at Molly, straightens her tikli  the sole item from her parents trousseau  and then, gently kisses her cheek.I dont know what Id have done without you, Molly murmurs into her hair.Im glad I am here. And I hope you and AJ will come to London and stay with me so I can dispense jamai aador and luchis like a grown-up Ghosh.Molly squeezed her hands. Boro Jethis gold bracelet, studded with pearls and rubies, glittered. It had been a pair that, Lata knew, was given to Jethima, the eldest daughter-in-law, by their grandmother, and Jethima had given her one at her wedding, reserving the other for Molly. What about Goopys bride? Manjulika had said to Jethima then. Arre baba, Jethima had replied conspiratorially, Goopys wife will get a lot!I miss Goopy, Molly said.I was just thinking about him! Lata exclaimed, Anyway, now listen, Bobbys just texted me. They are about 15 minutes away. I think you should go now and sit in the throne room. Guests have arrived. Wheres the entourage?Almost as though theyd heard her, Mollys girlfriends, the old ones from school and college and the new ones from Berlin, all trooped out of her room, where theyd been getting ready. Their individual beauty enhanced by the collective glamour, the girls held themselves erect and frowned in concentration, speaking to each other in code. Lata did not miss a single detail of this pageantry: the wisps of hair slipping out of elaborate hairdos, the silken saris curving and catching at unaccustomed feet. They walked up to the balustrade awkwardly and then, finally finding their stride in their saris, followed Molly down the elaborate staircase, where ancestors in gilt frames looked down at them approvingly.Lata took pictures on her phone, waving the girls away, exhorting them to mind the way. A few minutes later, as they crossed the courtyard, carefully carefully, doddering on their high heels, saris and lehngas bunched up so that their calves were briefly visible, the lights fell on their youthful faces and covered them with stardust.From upstairs, in her pink-yellow tussore sari, Lata watched them and marvelled at the fierce brevity of childhood and youth.Now it was here. Alive and flickering in the stack of Mills and Boon novels under her bed, clattering upon the carrom board, surfacing in the large cupboards in the store room which were perfect for stolen kisses and the third-floor terrace which was perfect for horrible fights.And now it was gone.***First came the ashirbad and then the ring ceremony. The Jaiswals and the Ghoshes and the Germans and the assorted others all mingled happily, eating the delicious (if vegetarian) hors doeuvres and drinking gallons of Blue Lagoon.As regards the food, Boro Jethu had firmly put his feet down. At the Oberoi, they could serve whatever mishmash modern cuisine they wanted to, but at home, it would be old-fashioned comfort food. It was a gargantuan tragedy that the affair had to be made vegetarian. Yes, there would be piles of motorshutir kochuri with stuffed aloor dom and chholar dal with coconut bits. Yes, the old thakurs would whip up family secrets that would never ever be revealed to the Jaiswals. And yes, there would be five kinds of savoury fries, excluding mochar chop and five kinds of mishti, excluding doi. No chatter about calories would be entertained. No dahi vada, golgappa or that sort of rubbish would be served. They were the Ghoshes after all. And there was no question of serving any kind of fancy salad with imported leaves, olive oil and vinegar  only the time-honoured slices of cucumber, tomato and onion on a plate, along with mustard and mayonnaise.Lata had escaped the vice grip of relatives, who had far too many questions than she could handle and whose comments about how slim her waist still was and how expensive her sari looked were all lined with a certain malice. She now stood in a corner and exchanged notes about the next day with a surly Bobby. (Who looked smoky-eyed and bewitching in a black chikankari anarkali set with mukaish work on it.)Whos that? Bobby asked, suddenly interested in a man who had walked up to Nimki and had clasped her hands in his. He wore a beautifully tailored suit, in charcoal grey, and suddenly Lata found herself looking away.(To be continued)"

I was reminded, well, not of the story, but of the title when we sat down to dinner at Rustoms  a restaurant that serves delicious Parsi food in the Capital  a few nights ago. You could have named our table Seven Hungry Men and Women.I was just making a list of all that we ate, and felt rather embarrassed. We ordered enough for a party of 15. And we finished up almost everything on the table. But let me start at the beginning. A dear friend from Kolkata was in town  ostensibly to see how I was doing. We were meeting her after a long time, so there was much to talk about. So we  a group of seven  gathered at Rustoms.Gourmets delightRustoms has been around for a while in Delhi. I used to hear good things about it when it was at Adhchini. Somehow, I never went there, quite possibly because the traffic there could be manic. But I had been raring to visit the place ever since I heard that Rustoms had moved to the Parsi Anjuman complex on Bahadur Shah Zafar Marg.So we gathered there, and ordered chhanch and homemade raspberry soda (Rs. 150 each), sev puri and dahi batata puri (both Rs. 175), Russian pattice (Rs. 295), paatra ni macchhi (Rs. 325), prawn kababs (Rs. 325), salli boti gosht (Rs. 395), chicken dansak (Rs. 175), vegetable Parsi pulao (Rs. 395), caramel custard and lagan nu custard (both Rs. 250) and Bombay kulfi (Rs. 150).I just had a taste of all the fried dishes  and they were delicious. The papri with sev came with a heap of crunchy sev over the papri which had been topped with chopped onion and tomatoes and chutney. The dahi batata puris had potatoes, onions, chutney and a delightfully spiced curd over it. The prawn kababs were again a great mix of mashed prawn and spring onion. But what I really loved was the Rusian pattice  which was a mix of creamy cheese, chicken and mashed potatoes, coated with semolina and some cheese straws and then deep fried. It was  in one word  yum!I had the fish without any guilt pangs. It was a telapiya fillet which had been steamed wrapped in banana leaf after being smeared with sweet, sour and spicy chutney prepared with mint and coriander leaves. I had it with the vegetable pulao and loved it. I am told the prawn berry pulao is a must-have there, but we had friends with a prawn allergy, so steered clear of it.The salli boti gosht  mutton with a spicy tomato gravy topped with crispy potato straws  was nice and rich. I thought the chicken dhansak was just about ok. It seemed like a normal dhansak with minced chicken balls on the side.But I loved the desserts.

This is the sprawling Parsi complex (ample parking space there) next to the Maulana Azad Medical College, on the other side of the road from all the newspaper offices (Phone: 09910060502 and 01133106353).We left after the dessert but the other five lingered over coffee. And after eating and drinking all that, they eyed the food on other peoples tables and decided that the next time they are there, they will have a thaali. The vegetable thaali (Rs. 400) has soya pattice, Parsi dal, tarkari ni curry, vengna nu achar, steamed rice, Parsi rotis and chutney. The mutton thaali is for Rs. 495 and the pomfret one for Rs. 695.

One of these, say some traders, is the recent cyclone that hit southern parts of the country. They say that since huge quantities of onion are being transported to Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala from Karnataka, the transportation was hit owing to the cyclone in these regions. The onion which was supposed to go out of the State, remained in Karnataka. Due to this, the prices dropped significantly.Other traders say that production being higher than the requirement has also led to a sharp decline in the market price.According to sources, while a quintal of onion was being sold at around Rs. 2,000 till a fortnight ago, it is now being sold at around Rs. 1,200 per quintal.The traders at Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) here say that the lower quality of onion which was actually sold for at least Rs. 800 per quintal, is now going for Rs. 300 per quintal.The traders and the farmers both admit that sharp decline in the market price results in loss only to farmers as they are the final stakeholders.Meanwhile, other traders believe that the situation is temporary as the market will pick up within a fortnight and prices will be stable enough to help get a better price for the farmers."

While Madhya Pradesh has introduced it only for foodgrains and oil seeds, Haryana has taken it up on an experimental basis for perishables.Notification issuedGoing by the volumes, Karnataka is the first State implementing the new system in a full-fledged manner for perishable commodity like onion, said Karnataka Agricultural Price Commission chairman T.N. Prakash Kammaradi. As per the KAPCs recommendations, the Karnataka government issued a notification on November 27 announcing the scheme for onion in the markets of Gadag, Bagalkot, Dharwad, and Belagavi districts from November 28 to December 12. Under the new system, the government has fixed the support price level for onion at Rs. 700 a quintal and the Price Deficiency Payment level at Rs. 200. This means that farmers get cash benefit of Rs. 200 if the onion price rules around Rs. 500 in the market. As the maximum benefit level is fixed at Rs. 200. The scheme is expected to cost Rs. 50 crore to Rs. 75 crore, which would be used from a revolving fund.The Price Deficiency Payment system is being implemented with 16 conditions that include getting verification regarding crop details from a committee of top officers at the entrance of the APMC, selling only to registered traders, verification of the quantum of produce by officials of weights and measurements, keeping track of onion-laden vehicles that go out of the APMC yards, and noting down their destinations, etc.According to Dr. Kammaradi, the new system is one of the options for quick response during price crash. It will take a minimum of one month under the conventional market intervention scheme of direct procurement by government as various clearances will have to be obtained. But it is possible to begin the scheme within a day under the Price Deficiency Payment method because the State has already introduced a digitalised system of collecting real-time data of arrivals and prices in markets, he said.Also, under the conventional direct procurement scheme, disposing the procured crop is an issue as it has to be stored till there is a demand for it in the market.Bailing out farmersOnion price has crashed in wholesale marketsPrice Deficiency Payment system will apply to markets in Gadag, Bagalkot, Dharwad, and Belagavi districts from November 28 to December 12"

Waivers dont reach many due to lack of documents and Aadhaar-seeded bank accounts.Punjabs example has shown that tenant, small and marginal farmers dont get the benefit of loan waivers. Many farmers dont have land titles and necessary conditions for the direct benefit transfer of government aid. Similar cases have been reported from UP as well, said an agricultural expert who drafted the roadmap for Punjab on loan waiver.Tenant farmers till 34% of the total cultivable land in Andhra, 25% in Punjab, 21% in Bihar, 17% in Odisha, 14% in Bengal and 15% in Haryana. The number of tenant farmers has risen in recent years owing to migration of people from rural to urban areas, said a senior official of NITI Aayog.While political outfits compete to win the hearts of farmers, reforms which could have addressed their woes skip the agenda of governance.NITI Aayog reached out to all state governments with the model land leasing law, which could have provided recognition to tenant farmers to access benefits and loans.

The court thus upheld conviction of a 22-year-old farmer from Nashik in the April 2014 case.Justice A M Badar, who passed the judgment on November 28, set aside his conviction under a charge of raping a girl aged under 16 but held him guilty under Section 376 for rape and also under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act ( Pocso ).The convict had challenged his August 2015 guilty verdict and a 10-year sentence for the crime committed in a field owned by his father in Nashik district. The prosecution said the girl was in need of a job and had agreed to work on the field. The convict took her along with younger children on his motorcycle to the field where he forced her inside a hut and allegedly raped her.The accused denied the rape or sexual assault charge. His defence was that two other girls, whom the survivor allegedly confided in, falsely implicated him for not having paid them for incomplete work on an onion plantation. A hostile public witness failed to prove the spot and other key witnesses were not examined, said the defence.Justice Badar said the girls testimony inspired confidence and required no other corroboration, but noted the presence of medical corroboration in her case too. He said she was competent to testify and had given rational answers. Her version that a witness forced her to allege rape cannot be construed to mean she was compelled to make a false allegation, as argued by the defence.There was no evidence to show she was over 18.The court therefore maintained the conviction for rape and under Pocso Act but reduced the sentence to seven years imprisonment."

Till December 3, onion was sown over an area of 12,191 hectares, or just 50% of the area sown in the same period last year. Till December 3, 2017, onion had been sown on 24,200 hectares in the state.Figures released by the states agriculture department reveal that in the rabi season, on average, onion is sown on 46,400 hectares in the state. This year, the acreage is just 26% of the average, or 12,191 hectares.Officials said that onion is mainly cultivated in Bhavnagar district and other parts of Saurashtra. This year, sowing in Saurashtra is yet to gather pace. Officials said of the 12,191 hectares sown, 10,900 hectares were in Saurashtra.Ghanshyam Patel, chairman of the Mahuva market yard, said there is not enough water in Saurashtra this year and farmers hence chose not to sow onions. The acreage sown with onions is not likely to gather momentum as the first week of December has passed.Apart from their water woes, farmers in 2017 did get remunerative prices for their crop and this may also have kept them from growing onions. Patel said that farmers last year did not even recoup the basic costs they incurred.Meanwhile, at the Ahmedabad Agricultural Produce Market Committee yard, onions were selling for between Rs 5 and Rs 11 a kg, depending on quality. In the retail market in the city, onions are selling for Rs 25 a kg.Gordhan Patel, a farmer in Visavadar , said, This year there is hardly any onion cultivation in the region as people are moving to other crops or are not sowing any crops. I have three bighas of land but because of no water this year, I decided not to sow a commercial crop. I will sow a fodder crop, which will help me feed my cattle and will also bring in some money.Sources in the Mahuva market yard, the states largest yard for onions, said that this years crop will start arriving by December 15. The market is presently getting 7,000 to 8,000 bags a day, which being put in cold storage.Another farmer, Pratap Sardasiya, says he has sown onions on one half his field and jowar on the other. He said that last year he got Rs 50 for a 20kg bag of onions and this deterred him from sowing the crop on his full four-bigha holding."

He, however, couldn't say what measures, if any, had been taken by the district administration to provide some relief to onion growers like Sathe who fetched very low rates.In a related development, Shreyas Abhale, another onion grower from Sangamner in neighbouring Ahmednagar district, has followed Sathe's lead by sending Rs 6 that he got by selling around 510 kg of his onions."

Bumper production of onions has affected the onion growers in Nashik and Ahmednagar districts adversely.An onion-grower from Niphad taluka in Nashik district recently sent his earnings to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to mark his protest after he was forced to sell his produce for little over Rs 1 per kg.The farmer, Sanjay Sathe, had donated Rs 1,064 he had received after selling 750 kg of onions to the Disaster Relief Fund of the PMO (Prime Minister's Office) through a money order.Two onion farmers from Nashik district have allegedly committed suicide in the last two days, apparently due to indebtedness and low rates commanded by the bulb in markets.Meanwhile, a farmer from Nevasa taluka in Ahmednagar district has distributed 20 quintals of onions for free and put up a flex board in Marathi sarcastically thanking the Union and state governments for ""keeping onion prices very low"".The farmer Popatraon Wakchowre, who hails from Punatgaon village, brought the onion to a weekly market Sunday along with the flex board.""I am deeply hurt because of this government's policies and a little concern it has towards our plight. In the last four years, we hardly got better rates for our produce,"" Wakchowre said.""I put up the flex board and sarcastically thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis for keeping the prices so low,"" he said.Wakchowre, while distributing onions, also placed a donation box requesting people to help him to clear his dues.""I am stooped to the level of a beggar because of this government. I own some agriculture land but I have to seek donation to clear my dues. I cannot repay just by selling my produce,"" the farmer said."

Only one demand which comes, again and again, is that MSP should be 1.5 times the cost of the C2.""...I am in favour of enhancing the income of farmers but to enhance the income by only giving them the price by government, which is not reflected in the demand of the society can have very adverse fiscal implications because many a consumer would not be able to buy such produce and it will end up in mounting public stocks,"" the noted agriculture economist argued.""Cost of such stock and interest thereon will rise, so it becomes so costly,"" he added. Further, if MSP is too high compared to open market price, the export will suffer and the country will become attractive for import from many countries.According to Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP), C2 is the most comprehensive definition of the production cost of crops as it also accounts for the rentals on owned land and interest on fixed capital assets over and above A2+FL.The Swaminathan Commission was tasked with finding solutions to the problems faced by farmers. The commission submitted five reports between December 2004 and October 2006.Chand also said he expects that the country's farm production will increase by about 4 per cent in the current fiscal.The agriculture sector growth has been very good in 2016-17 and 2017-18. In one year, it was 6.3 per cent, in the other year, it was 3.4 per cent.""Even this year(2018-19) in the second quarter, it is 3.8 per cent which is not a bad growth for the agriculture (sector). Maybe at the end of this year, we will have agriculture sector (growth) something close to 4 per cent,"" he remarked.Asked why onion prices are crashing and farmers are not getting good prices for their produce, Chand said, ""If you do not have a storage capacity for onions then you will find that this kind of things will happen.""Noting that our agriculture production has changed in the last 10-15 years but our markets are not evolving, he said, ""new production scenario is a scenario of surpluses ... markets should now prepare themselves to handle surpluses.""That will not happen if regulations are not changed, if the infrastructure is not built, we will keep crying about these things,"" Chand insisted."

5ce5c99ae8e3fc56af40ef46,Well-being of society at root of rigorous rituals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/bihar/well-being-of-society-at-root-of-rigorous-rituals/cid/1674931,2018-12-11,"Modern day Chhath has emerged as the most revered and popular community festival of Bihar, in which all strata of society participate with equal zeal and sincerity though with many new manifestations and amendments. But the worship of the Sun God, which constitutes the essence of the festival, has been prevalent in the Magadh region and in other parts of Bihar for millennia.Though the role of fire got minimised in Aryavarta (present day Uttar Pradesh) after the Later Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC), its use increased further east, in the Bihar region, from 600 BC onwards as new settlements emerged in Magadh.The pre-historic settlements of the hilly and the jungle terrain of South Bihar regions and Northern Jharkhand were the source of the sustenance for nature worshippers, including the followers of the sun/fire cult. In recent times, more than 42 rock shelters/cave settlements belonging to the pre-historic as well as early historic period have been deciphered in the districts of Nawada, Jamui, Giridih and Jamui.The Taradih excavations of Bodhgaya have unearthed artefacts since the Neolithic period. Several fire pits have been found which also justify the worship of fire/sun god as continuity since pre-historic times.The Aryanisation of the Magadh region, since 600 BC, superimposed the Rig Vedic (1500-1000 BC) concept over the local tradition of the sun/fire cult in the area.The first manifestation of the Sun God in the Mahabodhi pillars of Bodhgaya in the art form during the Saka-Kushan period is thus natural. As such, we also find Sun God appearing on Kushan coins during AD 200-300.The rapid march of the Magadh Empire during 600 BC and the subsequent rapid urbanisation of the Magadh region further regenerated and popularised the local prehistoric sun/fire cult among the urban gentry and the ruling elite of Magadh region.LINK BETWEEN WORSHIP OF SUN GOD AND MOTHER GODDESSWorship of the Mother Goddess is associated with the fertility cult, which had its origins in primitive agricultural societies of the world. Discovery of idols of Mother Goddess in various matured forms at the sites of the Indus Valley Civilisation prove beyond doubt that the worship of Mother Goddess has been popular in India from pre-historic times.The Mahabodhi Pillars of the Saka-Kushan times have revealed two distinct images carved out of stone: (i) The Sun God and (ii) The Primordial Mother Goddess.While the image of the Sun God was conceived during the Rig Vedic phase, the Primordial Mother Goddess was still in the pristine form, as the River Goddess and was conceived from the folk traditions of Aryavarta.With the evolution and the advancement of the agrarian economy in Aryavarta, the worship of Mother Goddess emerged as the most popular form of worship in the folk tradition.The River Goddess slowly evolved in the mindset of the village communities of Aryavarta during the Late Vedic Phase (1000-600 BC). The concept of the River Goddess of Aryavarta travelled far and wide during 600 BC to AD 300 from Northwest India to Eastern India in the Indo-Gangetic belt and was popular among the people of the time in general and the village communities in particular. The Mahabodhi Pillar depicts the River Goddess as sitting on a ghata (vase or kalash) and black-clouds representing two elephants are pouring water on her head by their trunks, signifying heavy downpour during rainy season. Later, the River Goddess has been identified as the Gaja Lakshmi form of Goddess Lakshmi in the Brahmanical pantheon but it also survived in its pristine form, in the folk tradition of Magadh (in particular) and Bihar (in general) in the form of Chhath Puja.Interestingly, the most significant utensils used on the occasion of Chhath Puja are a holy pot (kalash) and the chaturmukh dwip. The kalash signifies the Mother Earth or Mother Goddess, which proves beyond doubt the inter linkage between the Sun God (male divinity) and the Mother Goddess (female divinity).The Chhath Puja is directly rooted to the well being of the agricultural society as the worship of the Sun God is directly related to the harvesting season of two major crops of Bihar: kharif and rabi. The harvesting time of kharif crops is the month of Kartik (October-November); and that of rabi is Chaitra (March-April).The present form of Chhath Puja was conceived during the medieval period. The various aspects of Chhath Puja got crystallised with the stabilisation of the medieval period as we can see the devotees urge the Sun God to provide them good health, male progeny and wealth (good harvest and monetary gain), a general urge for all classes of the agrarian feudal society of the central Gangetic plain of Bihar.THE SIGNIFICANCE OF COCONUT, PAAN AND BANANASSeasonal fruits and vegetables (of the Bihar eco-system) are needed for Chhath Puja, but the only exception is coconut which is known as Kanchan Phal. It signifies that coconut is resistant to rotting for months due to its sclerenchymatous outer cover and can be safely transported from one part of the country to another. In the ancient and the medieval period coconut (but not the green coconut) was very much part of Bihars dietary supplement.Significantly, betel leaf (paan) and bananas had been brought from the Southeast Asian eco-system in the ancient period, probably by Brahmin and Buddhist monks, but both had been internalised in the cultural traditions of India. Both paan and bananas predate the medieval Chhath Puja traditions and are essential part of the rituals.Of late, pineapples and oranges have also become a part of the Chhath Puja offerings.Orange is unknown in the wild state, it is assumed to have originated in southern China, northeastern India, and perhaps southeastern Asia from ancient times but now, it is available in the market due to the availability of rapid communication. Similarly, pineapples, a fruit of the eco-system of northeastern states, are now readily available in Bihar during the Dala Chhath of Kartik.The use of some of todays common fruits, vegetables and pulses is not seen in use by devotees due to their origin from other eco-systems like potatoes (Latin America), onion (Central Asia), apples (Central Asia), lentil (Central Asia), cauliflower (Syria and Europe), cabbage (Mediterranean countries) among others. Instead, the local edibles are in use e.g. sweet potato, singhara, pomelo, Bengal gram (chana dal) and turmeric saplings.Jaggery (gur) from sugarcane is the traditional sweetener of Indian cultural tradition and is an essential part of Chhath Puja festivities.But now some devotees also use sugar crystals, popularised by the British who opened sugar mills in north Bihar and elsewhere during the early decades of the 20th century.The author is a research writer and freelance journalist.

And this despite the Centre allocating large sums for several schemes to boost farmer incomes. So what went wrong? TOI takes a look at the stress points hurting the sector.Two successive years of drought (2014, 2015) have taken a toll on the farm sector. The government has allocated significant funds for the sector but slow implementation of projects has not eased the pain. Drought in Maharashtra, Gujarat and Karnataka have also added to farmers woes.Prices have collapsed for farm commodities. Low international prices have meant exports have been hit while imports have hurt prices at home. For example, there was a bumper production of pulses in 2016-17 but imports of nearly 6.6 million tonnes arrived, compounding the problem. In 2017-18, another 5.6 million tonnes flowed in, depressing domestic prices further. The government delayed imposing tariffs on imports, which heightened the problem of prices for farmers. According to a Niti Aayog paper, on average, farmers do not realise remunerative prices due to limited reach of the minimum support prices (MSP) and an agricultural marketing system that delivers only a small fraction of the final price to the actual farmer.The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana was launched in 2016 to provide insurance and financial support to farmers in the event of failure of any crops due to natural calamities, pests and diseases. It was also meant to stabilise the income of farmers and ensure they remain in farming. But the scheme has seen lower enrolments due to a string of factors, including high premiums and lack of innovation by insurance firms.Irrigation is crucial for the farm sector, where large tracts of land still depend on monsoon rains. The Centre launched the Rs 40,000-crore Long-Term Irrigation Fund, operated by the National Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development (Nabard). Under this programme, 99 large irrigation projects were to be completed by December 2019 but the progress so far has been limited. Experts say a number of factors, including bureaucratic delays and slow implementation by states, have hurt progress for this crucial input.According to a Niti Aayog document, farm sector development has ignored the potential of marketing. Archaic laws still hobble the sector. Access of farmers to well-developed markets remains an issue although several initiatives have been launched to develop an electronic market place. Reforms to the APMC Act have been slow and most states have dragged their feet on it. Experts suggest an entity such as the GST Council to bring together states and the Centre to jointly take decisions to reform the sector and provide better access to markets for farmers. According to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the combination of market regulations and infrastructure deficiencies leads to a price depressing effect on the sector.Introduction of latest technology has been limited due to a number of reasons. Access to modern technology could act as a boost to productivity through improved variety of seeds, farm implements and farming technology. According to a Niti Aayog paper, there has been no real technological breakthrough in recent times.Large gaps in storage, cold chains and limited connectivity have added to the woes of farmers. It has also added to the significant post-harvest losses of fruit and vegetables, estimated at 4% to 16% of the total output, according to the OECD.This has meant that there is little incentives for farmers to diversify. According to an OECD document, share of high-value sectors in food processing is low with fruit, vegetable and meat products accounting for 5% and 8% of the total value of output compared to cerealbased products at 21% and oilseeds at 18%A government-appointed panel had recommended that FCI hand over all procurement operations of wheat, paddy and rice to states that have gained sufficient experience in this regard and have created reasonable infrastructure for procurement. These states are Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh. It had suggested a complete overhaul of FCI and recommended that farmers be given direct cash subsidy (of about Rs 7000/ha) and fertiliser sector deregulated. The panel had said direct cash subsidy to farmers will go a long way to help those who take loans from money lenders at exorbitant interest rates to buy fertilisers or other inputs, thus relieving some distress in the agrarian sector. The report has been put in cold storage.The share of the farm sector in GDP has declined from 29% in 1990 to about 17% in 2016, but it remains a major source of employment. According to OECD data, 85% of operational land holdings are less than 2 hectares and account for 45% of the total cropped area. Only 5% of farmers work on land holding larger than 4 hectares, according to the Agricultural Census, 2016. Productivity lags other Asian economies such as China, Vietnam and Thailand and average yields are low compared to other global producers. Wheat and rice yields are nearly 3 times lower than world yields while those for mango, banana, onion or potato are between 2 and 7 times lower than the highest yields achieved globally, according to the OECD."

The Telegraph file picturePublic health experts on Thursday wrote to the Centre seeking termination of the contracts of a non-government agency that they said provided midday meals to schoolchildren across 12 states but kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for religious reasons.The agency their letter to the Union human resource development ministry referred to is Akshay Patra, which provides midday meals to over 1.76 million children in 14,700 schools.The Jan Swasthya Abhiyan (Peoples Health Movement) and the Right to Food Campaign have expressed concern that the agencys decision to keep eggs out of its meals reflects a religious diktat.In their letter, they have highlighted that the ministrys guidelines on midday meals, issued last year, specify that no organisation supplying the meals should use the programme to propagate any religious practice.The health groups have argued that the inclusion of eggs can help children from the economically disadvantaged communities, who on average show a higher prevalence of under-nutrition and stunting than children from non-disadvantaged communities.The practice of keeping eggs out uses a religious preference to deny a high-nutrition-value food to children who would otherwise eat them, Sylvia Karpagam, a public health physician in Bangalore and member of the Abhiyan, told The Telegraph.Akshay Patra, in a statement emailed to this newspaper, said its freshly cooked meals are in compliance with the nutrition norms prescribed by the HRD ministry.A spokesperson for the agency declined to comment on the issue of eggs, onion or garlic.In their letter, the health experts have cited the nutritional constituents of eggs and stressed that the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad, recommends at least three eggs a week for children. Parents, civil society and children in several states have demanded eggs, the letter said.What were fighting for is the right of local communities to exercise their own food choices, said Vandana Prasad, a paediatrician, community health expert and member of the Abhiyan and the Public Health Resource Network.Members of the Abhiyan and the Right to Food Campaign said the immediate provocation for the letter was the agencys refusal to introduce onion and garlic in its midday meals as demanded by the Karnataka government.They said the standoff between the agency and the Karnataka government highlighted the position of rights-based campaigns that midday meals should be locally prepared and culturally relevant, and not provided by agencies that limit food on the basis of religious beliefs."

The market at Kalamna is dubbed to be the biggest in Asia in terms of size.Farm goods have been traditionally sold in market yards governed by Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees (APMCs). The yards are dominated by middlemen, who buy the produce from farmers and further sell it to traders. In turn, a commission is deducted from the amount paid to farmers. Over a year ago, the state government did away with the old system. The agents at APMC now have to charge the commission from the buyers, instead of farmers.However, parallel markets soon emerged at smaller centres throughout the region, say agents. The operators take advantage of the grey area in the law. The commission rule is only applicable to the formal markets run by an APMC.An APMC market is registered and the area is defined by a boundary. Middlemen at Kalamna say that those in the unregulated markets continue to charge commission from farmers, and not traders. Since such markets do not come under any regulator, like the APMC, the operators here have a free run. Several complaints have gone unheeded. A complaint was even sent to the department of agriculture marketing, but there was no response, say the agents at Kalamna.This grey area increases the losses for farmers when there is a crash in prices, as it is happening with onions, said agents. As much as 5% commission is charged on onions, which is a big sum with depressed prices.The traders prefer the parallel markets, where they do not have to shell out any commission. The presence of more traders there also attracts farmers to such markets since the produce can be sold faster, and payments are made in cash, explained a Kalamna agent.Such markets have cropped up in interior areas of places like Tiroda, Wardha, Amravati Chandrapur and other areas, said Mohammed Afzal of Afzal Trading at Kalamna.As against last year, the rates of onions have come down by more than half. The current rates are in the range of Rs300 to 360 per 40kg. This comes to Rs9 a kg in the wholesale market. It was Rs1,400 per 40kg or Rs35 a kg on the same day last year. There is no major change in the arrivals at Kalamna market, despite all the hype about overproduction, he said.Even as an overall glut in the supply has led to crash in onion rates, the presence of parallel markets is adding to the farmers woes, said Ilahi Baksh of Saurashtra Trading Company at Kalamna, which deals in onions and potatoesThis has reduced volumes in the legal APMC run markets. It is because both traders and farmers prefer informal markets, he said. Onion growers do not depend on markets near the production centres like Nashik or Dhule alone. They also come to Nagpur, where they have to depend on these markets, added Munsif Bhai of Saurashtra Trading."

It wasnt blood. But Bandu Markad said it wasnt any different for him. The farmer was in distress and he had just squished the pomegranates that he had grown under tremendous hardships, which included getting water in the drought-prone district.Markad had reason to curse his luck. When he took the yield from his 1,200 trees to the market, he got a price of Rs 10 per kilo. Days ago, it was Rs 80. A video of Markad in tears and beating pomegranates to pulp soon went viral. Moved, people sent him money. At the end of five days, he had about Rs 2 lakh in his account.One could call Markad fortunate. But across the country, a range of issues from debt to low prices for their produce have forced farmers to take desperate measures. Many killed themselves, destroying the lives they left behind. A month after BJPs Devendra Fadnavis took over as CM of Maharashtra in 2014, he said tackling the agrarian crisis would be his top priority. He drafted a special action plan to check suicides in 14 of the worst-hit districts. In 2017, 2,917 suicides were reported, while in the current year, up to October 31, 2,223 farmers have ended their lives.On March 12 this year, thousands of farmers from Maharashtra reached Mumbai after covering 180 km on foot to highlight their plight. On November 30, those in north and central India trooped into Delhi  among them prominent leaders from Opposition parties, indicating the significance the issue has acquired on the national political stage  to articulate their anguish.In the sullen crowd were men like Mohanlal Nagda of Rewli-Devli village in Neemuch district of MP.Nagda had for long avoided looking at the big pile of onions rotting away in a corner of his farm. It invariably brought tears to his eyes. Harvested on his 2-acre land, all 100 quintals of his onion yield now lies dumped. He knows he wont recover the cost if he tries to sell it.The mandi is only 10km away. But Id rather not take my produce there, he said. He quickly did the math. The onions are harvested, but to cut them I must spend Rs 15,000 at Rs 150 per quintal. Transporting it to the mandi will cost Rs 2,500 more at Rs 500 per trolley. I need to spend another Rs 1,500 on loading, unloading and mandi expenses, Nagda told TOI. At Rs 2 per kg, all Id get is Rs 20,000. So, I preferred dumping them, however much it hurts. I spent around Rs 40,000 on cultivation alone. The produce is already decaying. It terrifies me.Maharashtra has declared drought in 151 talukas across 26 districts in the wake of a deficient monsoon. The dry spell has affected an estimated 60% of the 1.6 crore farmers in the state. Due to below average rainfall during sowing season, the output has been hit too. Several areas reported over 70% crop loss and the state sought relief of Rs 7,962 crore from the Centre.But respite looks remote for large chunks. A Nashik farmer recently sent a money order of Rs 1,064 to the PMs office. It was what hed got after selling 750 kg of onion after a crash in prices. It doesnt help that Maharashtra  like many other states  hasnt been able to break cartelisation by wholesale traders and middlemen in market yards to ensure fair pricing. Even implementation of minimum support price (MSP) has not been achieved by the state. Moreover, farmers across India are forced to sell their produce at low rates because the infrastructure to store and process it is lacking.Acting on a report that finances, lack of assistance for healthcare and poor crop output were among the reasons for farm distress, Fadnavis proposed last year that agricultural loans should be waived and farmers can avail fresh aid from financial institutions. In June 2017, the CM announced a loan waiver scheme for 89 lakh farmers; loans amounting to Rs 32,000 crore were to be waived. So far, loans worth Rs 17,000 crore owed by 40 lakh farmers have been waived, while Rs 25,000 crore has been sanctioned for 50 lakh farmers as fresh aid. A raft of schemes has also been drafted to tackle agrarian distress, but implementation is slow owing to lack of coordination and supervision at different levels.Far away in Punjab, farmers are on the warpath over implementation of the Swaminathan Commission recommendations on fixing of MSP of rabi and kharif crops. They also want a complete farm loan waiver, not the partial one okayed by the Amarinder Singh government.Seven farm organisations in Punjab have decided to raise both issues and hold protests on December 18. The organisations have decided on round-the-clock protests outside banks from January 1 to January 5. These groups had earlier stopped the supply of milk and vegetables to urban areas in the state, leading to clashes with milkmen and a lot of produce literally going down the drain.Its a similar story but a different crop in UP. Owing to a bumper harvest this year, potato farmers say they are ruined as the price per 50kg sack has fallen to as low as Rs 20. Cold storages are full of unsold potato. Rakesh Kumar, owner of Mangla Mata cold storage in Badaun, said, Storages in the region have a total capacity of 30 lakh sacks. Of these, 20% are potatoes, but no farmer is coming to fetch them right now because of falling prices. I have already thrown 7,000 sacks while 10,000 more are still here. Selling the produce at villages for Rs 20 per 50 kg sack does not even recover the cost of transportation.Mahendra Swaroop, state president, Cold Storage Association, UP, said, Huge quantities of potato are stuck. District magistrates do not let us dump our produce anywhere as it stinks badly. Haalat kharab ho gayi sab ki."

The cool weather and all this love and happiness around calls for some warm, cosy food. For me, its all about hearty one-pot hot dishes for the family to share.I love the flavours from the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern kitchens  simple, fresh ingredients cooked with bags of flavour. My culinary philosophy emphasises on cooking with local seasonal produce. There are beautiful pumpkins, carrots, oranges and greens in the market these days and there are so many innovative ways to prepare them. Roasting vegetables and meat in the oven is a great way to cook as you dont have to keep hovering around the stove. Also, the nutritional value remains intact and you get a lovely smokey-charred flavour.Here are some of my current favourite Mediterranean winter dishes that you must try making soon. They are vegetarian but you could add some grilled chicken or fish to them. Alternatively, enjoy them as an accompaniment to your meat or seafood dish.Roast Pumpkin, saffron and orange soupA boring pumpkin soup gets transformed into an orchestra of flavours.Ingredients: 2tbsp olive oil, one onion (cut in wedges), 500g pumpkin (cut in wedges), 1tbsp chilli/sriracha sauce, 5-6 saffron strands, zest of one orange, 500ml (or more) water,  cup coconut milk (or cream), salt and freshly-cracked pepper,  cup pumpkin seeds (toasted), chilli flakes, 2tsp honey/date syrup, fresh coriander/parsleyMethod:Preheat the oven to 220 degrees Celsius.

5ce596a2e8e3fc56af40d61a,After row  notices on separate entry at IIT-M mess withdrawn,https://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/iit-m-clears-up-mess-pulls-discriminatory-notices/article25748253.ece,2018-12-15,"Notices announcing separate entry/exit and handwash areas for vegetarians and non-vegetarians at a mess on the campus of IIT Madras were withdrawn on Friday evening following opposition from a section of students who labelled the move discriminatory.Students posted photographs of the notices put up at the Himalaya hostel block, earmarking separate counters for vegetarian, vegetarian without garlic and onion (pure vegetarian) and non-vegetarian food on social media. The students had to use separate entry and exits and use separate wash basins and utensils.Objecting to this, a section of students contended that it amounted to discrimination. Upper caste households in India would usually have two entrances  one for the upper castes and the other for the impure lower castes. A mess in IIT-M is now having the same system. This mess has two separate entrances  one for vegetarians and the other for non-vegetarians. Not just that  separate wash basins and separate utensils as well. What started as a demand for pure vegetarian mess has become full-fledged untouchability, a student posted on Facebook.It is vacation time and only postgraduate and research scholars are occupying the hostels at present. A student said that the Himalaya complex (one of the hostels on the campus) has six mess halls. Students from different hostels dined in the mess where notices were put up to segregate students based on their food choices. More than 300 students were allotted to the mess.To avoid mix-upHowever, Sriram K Kompella, students general secretary said, It is not like people are not allowed to enter the vegetarian mess. Only that no non-vegetarian is allowed in it. Non-vegetarians can still register and enter the pure vegetarian mess. He contended: We believe and respect the lifestyle choices of vegetarians and are trying to ensure that theres no mix-up either in the kitchen, wash area for utensils and the dining region.According to him, separate entry and exits help to keep track of who registered for which mess and ensure those who hadnt registered for the mess did not dine there without paying the fees. The institute requires students to register every month afresh and they can change their food choices.We are not tracking who eats what or their caste. The segregation is purely on the basis of their food choice. There is no discrimination based on their choice of food either, argued an official.The notices were removed later in the evening. Secretary of hostel affairs Nihal K, issued an explanation stating that the posters had been found in the RRC mess, Himalaya. The caterer has been instructed to remove the poster immediately upon its discovery by mess monitoring committee.Caterers actIt was the act of the caterer and there was no directive by the committee, the note read, adding that in due course of time action will be taken on the caterer after an enquiry. The note said two entrances were provided to the mess to make the passage to each counter easier and not restrict passage from one to another or differentiate students in any capacity, and apologised for the inconvenience.The monitoring committee is a team of students that takes care of the issues in the mess and reports to the hostel affairs secretary. The final decision on matters will be taken in consultation with the Dean of Student Affairs and the Chairman of the council of wardens."

The scheme is implemented by the Union Food Processing Ministry, that has a corpus of Rs. 500 crore and aims to aid farmers in times of price fluctuation in tomatoes, onions and potatoes. The State is considering seeking transport subsidy for onion growers to sell especially stored onions in consuming States and working on ex-gratia grant to compensate affected growers.Onion prices have come under pressure because of the arrival of stored onions as well as fresh kharif crop. The wholesale price for stored onions is lower owing to poor quality, while the kharif crop is fetching around Rs. 10 per kg, as per official data.In November, 50% of the onion that arrived in wholesale mandis in the State comprised stored onions. The price quoted was between Rs. 3.50 and Rs. 4 per kg, which has created unrest among farmers, a source said.There is higher quantity of stored onions in the State as farmers had increased area under the crop during the 2017-18 rabi season in anticipation of better prices, the source said."

It includes Rs 6- Rs 8 production cost and Rs 3-Rs 4 for harvesting, packaging, cold storage and transportation. The fresh crop, which has hit the market, is being sold for Rs4 per kg. So we are not being able to recover the production cost. The implementation of GST has also bumped up the costs.More than 90 per cent of the potato crop in the state is grown in the Doaba region, which comprises Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts. Potato is grown on around 85,000 hectares, and it produces 2.2 million tonnes of the crop.Singh said that retailers are earning from the crop, but farmers are failing to recover the production cost. It is estimated that around 10 lakh bags of potatoes from the previous year are lying in 500 cold storages in the state (each bag has 50 kg). Now, they have been given for free as cattle feed, said Singh, who has 12,000 bags lying in his store. He added that as the crop this year has been infected with blight disease the production is expected to fall. Also, farmers are spending Rs 5,000 extra to save the crop.Jang Bahandur Sangha, Secretary General of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers, said, Punjab supplies 75 per cent of shed potato (potato seed) to other states. But most states have already sown their crops. Hence, we suspect that our potato seeds will not be sold and there will be no liquidity with the farmers.Potatoes from India are exported to the Middle East, Sri Lanka and Russia. Exporting potatoes are costly as it involves freight charges. The US and the European Union does not allow potato imports and for last two years Pakistan, too, has banned it, said Sangha. The state government has asked the Centre for permission to export potato to Russia, the USA, Iran and Sri Lanka."

Chandrababu Naidu on Sunday asked the officials to take precautionary measures for Phethai cyclone keeping in view the experience during the Titli cyclone. The government expected involvement of every employee and official. The machinery had to respond at lightning speed and work with dedication. The departments had to work in coordination to restore normalcy, he told officials during a teleconference.Cyclones had become a routine affair. The State had already faced Titli and Gaza when the government could assess the possible loss in advance. The landfall and heavy rainfall could be forecast exactly. Phethai was the third one in a row.The loss could be minimised with better planning and preparedness. Making an estimate and assessing the possible loss was necessary as it would give a fair idea of resources on hand. It would help mobilise the resources such as electricity poles, he said.Mr. Naidu recalled that the property loss was more during Titli, which uprooted thousands of trees and electric poles. The government had to struggle to restore power supply immediately. New electricity poles had to be erected at many places. Hence, arrangements should be made in advance to restore power supply and transport facilities. The power supply and road connectivity could be restored easily if the power saw machines, electricity poles etc necessary material were kept ready.The Revenue, Electricity, Panchayat Raj and Roads and Buildings departments should work in coordination. The NDRF teams should be deployed in advance. Rice, dal, oil, potatoes and onion should be procured. Emphasis should be on drinking water and food, he said.The people should be involved in relief measures through awareness on their duty in disaster management. Every village had to be alerted. Relief and rehabilitation measures need to be taken up. One force for each village should be readied."

5ce588bfe8e3fc56af40ce5a,Bad egg: Mid-day meals that only feed political goals,https://www.telegraphindia.com/opinion/bad-egg-mid-day-meals-that-only-feed-political-goals/cid/1679148,2018-12-18,"An egg a day keeps the doctor away. Eggs are among the most nutritious food items and contain almost all the nutrients required by growing children. This explains the long-standing demand to include them in mid-day meals, which is the primary  and, at times, the only  source of nutrition for close to 10 crore children. Given that India is home to a third of the worlds malnourished children, the importance of nutrient-rich items in the meal cannot be emphasized enough. Yet, time and again, religious and caste considerations of the majority  or should it be minority given that some estimates show only 23 per cent of Indians are actually vegetarian?  are allowed to come in the way of a childs health. It was recently revealed that an NGO contracted by the Centre to provide mid-day meals in 12 states kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for religious reasons. This is disturbing. But more worrying is that many state governments in a secular country have been influenced by similar concerns. The fundamental right to food also involves a right to choice, and surveys show that both parents and children in the states that do not serve eggs in mid-day meals are eager for its inclusion. What, then, explains the governments reservation against incorporating a non-vegetarian item? There are allegations that it is the result of pandering to influential caste groups and private contractors like the one in question. But such appeasement seems innocuous before more sinister influences of caste equations. Children from the scheduled groups  those who need it most  are reportedly given insufficient quantities of food, served last and asked to sit separately for mid-day meals.Yet, these biases are far from the only reasons behind the inadequacies of the scheme. Food procurement for mid-day meals is increasingly being centralized, wiping out traditional local diets  often more nutritious than the rice and pulses that are served  like various kinds of millets. Worse, the scheme is being used to replenish State coffers. For instance, in 2017 the ministry of human resource development directed that pulses for the scheme would come from the buffer stock of the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation. In other words, help the Central body exhaust produce that it was unable to disburse. There are also directives to use fortified nutrients and packaged food on the pretext of making mid-day meals more hygienic. This opens the scheme up to private players. In the end, the scheme benefits a myriad stakeholders but one: children."

Follow us to track latest news, live updates, news analysis and cutting-edge data analytics. Track live election results , the big trends and fastest updates on counting day with India's largest news network.Sharif Khan, 45, from Baldara village in Baran district of Rajasthan found his name was listed on a loan waiver scheme three days before a rally by the PM on November 6. The waiver was announced in August but my name was not on the list till November. I have two loans of Rs 2.5 lakh in total but was only eligible for a waiver of Rs 25,000. I went to the BDO and was told I would not even get that money. Instead, I could take Rs 25,000 worth of fertilisers. I told myself, at least I am getting something, Khan said.Formulas to waive farm loans are not uniform across states. Rajasthan, for instance, calculates waivers based on amount of crop damaged, size of land holdings and harvest volume. Others have fixed limits for the amount to be waived.Khan is among thousands around the country who have been stumped by the fine print in waiver schemes. Many farmers across India who TOI spoke to said the hastily put together and poorly executed approach will not solve systemic problems.Waivers cannot be a longterm solution. If the government gives minimum support price according to the market rate, that will be the biggest remedy, Khan added.In Wasadi village of Aurangabad in Maharashtra, Balwant Patilba Nikam, a marginal farmer with less than an acre, explained his situation. I received Rs 12,000 as protsahan (encouragement) from the state government in the runup to loan waivers. Under protsahan, small loans of up to Rs 15,000 are waived. My loan was Rs 12,000. But I needed money for production in the next season, and I ended up taking another loan. The government has to help us out of the debt trap. Partial waivers or small loans waivers alone wont help. The government should help us look at alternatives like poultry farming in addition to cultivation, Nikam said.More than 1,500 km away, in Thiruppurambiam village of Thanjavur district in Tamil Nadu, 55-year-old V Anandan said he hadnt gained much from the waiver or the AIADMK governments process.Sometimes, farmers say, the loan process itself is faulty. I spent Rs 1.25 lakh to grow paddy on my 4.5 acres. According to the norms, and my eligibility, the cooperative society should have given me Rs 1.02 lakh as loan. But they sanctioned Rs 25,000, which was waived by the government. I had to bear the rest of the production cost. In future, if I do not have the money for the sowing season, I will have to apply for another loan, Anandan said.The Swaminathan Committee in 2004 had recommended farmers be allowed to fix the price for their produce on their own (cost of production plus 50% as profit), keeping local factors in mind. Waiving loans wont help, particularly when the loan is only a fraction of our expenses, Anandan added.Pandit Kerba Patil, 46, who has a farm in Kolhapur, Maharashtra, had taken a loan of Rs 1.5 lakh three years ago. Floods destroyed his crop.I could not pay the instalments on time. This continued for two years and the interest went on increasing. Ultimately, I had a debt of Rs 2.5 lakh, he said.When the state government announced the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Shetkari Sanman Yojana in 2017, Patil managed to get Rs 1.5 lakh, his original loan amount, waived. But now, Patil must clear the accrued interest of Rs 1 lakh before getting fresh loans. I have been farming since I was 6 years old. Being debt-ridden for the first time was harrowing, he said.In UPs Ujhaiya Fakirpur village of Mainpuri district, two Dalit brothers Upendra and Bablu, faced a similar dilemma. They had taken a loan of Rs 2 lakh in 2013, but even after a waiver of Rs 1 lakh in 2017, they had to pay Rs 1.8 lakh.Upendra said, When we heard about the loan waiver, we contacted our village lekhpal. Months later, we were informed Rs 1 lakh has been waived from the principal amount. But when we reached our bank, the manager said we had to pay the interest of Rs 80,000. So we paid Rs 1.8 lakh in total.Others have had their loans waived and carry a clean slate, but they too say waivers are not the longterm solution. One of them, Mubarik Ali, in Guleli (Bareilly), had borrowed Rs 1 lakh on his Kisan Credit Card, against which he had repaid Rs 20,000. The outstanding amount has been waived and paid directly to the bank. It was impossible to get another loan till the earlier one was repaid, so this has been a relief. However, the government must focus on three things: crop insurance, better irrigation and subsidised seed and fertilisers. It will reduce our cost. If the entire crop is insured, there will be no need for a waiver at all, Ali said.Farmers are also compelled to take loans, even when they dont want to, as their produce does not get proper prices, said Nivrutti Nyaharkar in Vahegaoin village, Nashik. Nyaharkar, an onion grower, had borrowed Rs 1 lakh six years ago. Within seven months, he was to pay Rs 1.32 lakh. Despite my willingness to repay I could not, as my produce wasnt getting good prices. Moreover, input costs kept increasing. For two years, bad weather affected the harvest, Nyaharkar added. Thankfully, my loan was waived off. But next year ... I may face the same set of problems again.(With reports from Shoeb Khan in Ajmer, Vincent Arockiaraj in Trichy, Syed Rizwanullah in Aurangabad, Rahul Gayakwad in Kolhapur, Priyangi Agarwal in Bareilly, Arvind Chauhan in Mainpuri and Tushar Pawar in Nashik)"

But without any inquiry, the state government officials in their report stated that my onions were blackish and of low quality. It is false and officials are misguiding you.""""I hope you will understand that if authorities can lie to you, what challenges a common man would be facing in government offices,"" he said in the letter sent from the local office of India Post.Almost every onion grower was facing the same situation of low rates and the state's ""apathy"" towards it, Sathe claimed, and requested the prime minister to find a solution to it.Notably, authorities of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) had said last week that the report submitted by the district deputy registrar office to the state government was ""false"".No official of the district deputy registrar office had met the APMC authorities in connection with the farmer's case, they said.Nashik district in north Maharashtra accounts for about 50 per cent of onion production in India.The Lasalgaon APMC in Nashik is the country's largest wholesale onion market."

Many farmers have been residing at the yard, hoping for sale of their produce one day, and alleged that sale of onions was stopped the past week.Protesters said assurances given by officials had remained on the paper as onion stocks, accumulating in the yard, were not being moved. A farmer, who had brought 400 bags from Kadapa district, said he had been selling 1-2 bags for Rs. 100-150, just to earn enough to feed himself and stay at the yard.Others alleged a nexus between middlemen and officials and urged the State government to act.If this continues, we will not have enough money to cultivate the next crop and will have to resort to the extreme step of ending our lives, they said."

The simmering discontent among farmers gained political traction in 2018.Various opposition parties have been raising their voices against different issues to suit their electoral needs but they showed unanimity in expressing their solidarity with the demands for better crop remuneration and farm loan waivers during the November 30 farmers' rally in the capital.At the same rally, Congress President Rahul Gandhi had said: ""The voice that is reverberating now across the country is of the farmers who are in deep distress and crisis.""For the first time, the 2019 Lok Sabha elections will be fought on issues revolving around rural distress, said Yogendra Yadav of Swaraj India, who is credited with bringing over 200 farmers' outfits under one banner -- the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC).""There has always been agrarian distress in the country. However, it never got an occasion to become a principal factor in the elections. The BJP's defeat in the Assembly polls, coupled with the newly-achieved unity among farmers, has ensured that farm distress would take a centre stage in the 2019 elections,"" Yadav told IANS.He termed the BJP regime led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi ""the most anti-farmer"" government in the history of the independent India because of its ""unsympathetic"" treatment of farmers in the past four-and-a-half years.Many videos throughout the year went viral on the social media, featuring angry farmers throwing their harvest and milk on the roads in the absence of remunerative prices.Amid protests, the government increased the Minimum Support Price (MSP) for certain agriculture commodities. However, the farmers found this not at par with their demands and expectations.Also, poor procurement of commodities owing to inadequate numbers and delay in the opening of purchasing centres by the government agencies forced the farmers to make distress sales.In the case of vegetables, while the retail prices hovered between Rs 20-30 in major cities, the prices received by farmers for semi-perishable commodities such as potatoes and onion slumped to Rs 1 per kg.The Agriculture Ministry seemed ""ineffective"" to create a redressal mechanism, activists said, though it came up with three procurement plans. Notably, Union Minister and Senior BJP leader Nitin Gadkari had in June this year acknowledged that there was agrarian crisis due to surplus crop output and sought action to address the problem.And yet, the BJP-government failed to take corrective action by analysing the demand-and-supply situation, said Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana leader and Lok Sabha member Raju Shetti, who quit BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) over farmers issues' last year.""The government has been quite aware of the farmers' issues. However, it did not take required action to ensure remunerative prices for farmers and the procurement of their harvest was ineffective,"" Shetti added.Noted agronomist Ashok Gulati said there was ""lack of understanding"" and ""lack of vision"" in the current BJP regime. He said the government did not carry out the required market reforms but resorted to just slogans and announcements.""Even after the Mandsaur firing episode, the government did not act,"" he said.Any government needs a smart agriculture minister for effective implementation of schemes, he added.Interestingly, Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh chose to attend a Yoga session with Baba Ramdev in Bihar two days after the Mandsaur firing."

Not only did the initiative ensure that the farmers got paid adequately for their produce by eliminating middlemen and absorbing transportation expenditures, the Pratishthan also made onions available to consumers at a fair price.Kondhanpur farmer Balasaheb Chorge, who had harvested 1,500 kg of onion, was one of beneficiaries.The approximate input cost for medium quality onion for me was Rs 5 per kg. Buyers at the Pune Market Yard were only offering Rs 3-Rs 5 per kg. The best case scenario was no profit and the worst was actually suffering a loss. I would also have had to incur an additional expenditure of Rs 2,700  to transport the produce, pay the commission agent and porters, and the market yard levy, Chorge told TOI.However, the Pratishthan workers bought his produce for Rs 8-Rs 10 per kg, depending on the quality.The Pratishthan helped many other onion farmers from around Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar earn about Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kilogram of onion. The onions are now being sold directly to the consumers from an empty plot in Sahakarnagar.Credit goes to Rahul Mane and Prasanjit Fadnavis, who, under the guidance of senior labour union leader Balasaheb Fadnavis, bought over 30-tonne onion from 35 farmers in Sangamner , Rahatwadi, Darade, Vaphgaon and others.Prasanjit said, We noticed the farmers were getting very low prices  Rs 2 per kilogram  though the consumers in the city were still paying nearly Rs20 per kg for onions. My father, Balasaheb Fadnavis, suggested we help the farmers by buying the produce directly from them and selling it at the same cost to consumers. We bought the onions for Rs 10 per kg and sold at the same cost while bearing the transport and logistical expenses ourselves.According to Prasanjit, the farmers were able to save the costs of brokerage, transport, labour, cess and taxes, thus earning greater profits.Balasaheb Fadnavis said, Two years ago, I had gone to an onion farm and saw that the farmer was not harvesting the crop due to poor prices. That time, I had bought the entire 200-300 kg of onion and sold it for him. This year, I suggested Mane and my son take up this initiative.Shivaji Jarande, another farmer said, Mane and Fadnavis bought my produce for Rs 8 per kg and the entire amount is my profit.Mane added, We are getting bulk orders from many big residential societies and are hoping to bring in another 10 tonnes of onion for direct sales."

The department also does not have a full-time secretary for three and half months now.State agriculture minister and senior BJP leader Pandurang Phundkar passed away on May 31. Ever since his death, Revenue Minister Chandrakant Patil is handling the additional charge of the department. Amid rumours of State Cabinet expansion, the party has not appointed an independent minister for this department.Similarly, agriculture department secretary Bijay Kumar retired from his position in August. Ever since the departments additional charge is being handled by Eknath Dawale, secretary, Water Conservation and Employment Guarantee Scheme (EGS). The government is yet to appoint a full-time secretary for the agriculture department, one of the most crucial in the upcoming general and Assembly elections.Both the departments are working very well. None of the schemes are being derailed, no funding has been stopped. It is true that the department does not have an independent minister and secretary. But there has been no dearth of funding for farmer-related projects, said a senior minister. When asked about the cabinet expansion or re-division of cabinet portfolios, he refused to comment saying the Chief Minister has the authority to take the call.Maharashtra was in the middle of controversy recently after a farmer named Sanjay Sathe sent Rs. 1,064 earned from selling onions to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to highlight the low returns on the crop. Following record-break onion production, farmers have been complaining of low returns on the sale of their produce. Up to July, the State has recorded 1,417 farmer suicides. Despite the Chief Ministers assurances, the farm loan waiver scheme announced in June 2017, is yet to reach its target.This government is not serious about the agrarian sector and the 50% of the population which is dependent on farm sector. It is shameful to not have an independent minister and secretary for this department, said Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant."

The think-tank has also suggested replacing the Commission for Agricultural Costs & Prices (CACP), which was recommending MSPs, with an agriculture tribunal.The report comes at a time when agrarian distress has become a politically potent issue with state governments vying with each other to write off agriculture loans, ignoring the fiscal implications.On Wednesday, Rajasthan became the latest state to waive farm loans. The scheme, which offers to write off up to 2 lakh, will set the exchequer back by 18,000 crore.READ | Former NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Panagariya flays politics of farm loan waiversEarly this month, a farmer in Nashik had to sell his produce of 750 kg of onion for a paltry sum of 1,064.

The Niti Aayog strategy paper, released here on Wednesday by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley, calls for annual nine per cent GDP growth to create sufficient jobs and achieve prosperity for all.Finance Minister Arun Jaitley sought to distinguish between slogans and sound policies. In a veiled reference to the Congress president Rahul Gandhis stress on farm loan waiver and unemployment, Jaitely said slogans are soon found out, while sound economic policies deliver in the long run. The document mooted various measures to create jobs and pep up the economy.Four key steps -- Increase the investment rate as measured by gross fixed capital formation (GFCF) from present 29 per cent to 36 per cent of GDP by 2022; About half of this increase must come from public investment which is slated to increase from 4 per cent to 7 per cent of GDP; government savings have to move into positive territory, requiring significantly higher resource mobilization efforts - will help achieve 9 per cent GDP growth, the document said."

Altogether, Rs. 150 crore will be directly transferred to farmers bank accounts.The Opposition, meanwhile, termed the package as a mockery of the plight of the farmers.

Nationalist Congress Party State president Jayant Patil said.Onion production in the State takes place in three seasons: kharif, late kharif and rabi. According to government officials, the onion produced in kharif and late kharif seasons cannot be stored for too long, compared to that produced in rabi season.While the total onion production in the State till now is estimated to be around 75 lakh quintal, the agriculture market committees received around 41.23 lakh quintal onion in November.With such a huge supply, the prices have naturally dropped. The onion belt of the State, especially north Maharashtra, is suffering. Todays decision will help to bring relief to farmers, an official said.Last week, as a mark of protest, an onion farmer in Nashik had sent his paltry earnings to the Prime Ministers Office.

It is shocking that religious prejudices can rob children of their fundamental right to food in a secular country like India. Moreover, it is a well-known fact that a nutritious and hearty mid-day meal can reduce dropout rates in schools along with checking malnutrition among children.Given that India is home to 48.2 million malnourished children with stunted growth, the careless disregard towards the menu of mid-day meals reveals the establishments apathy. Eggs are highly nutritious. Further, a boiled egg cannot be adulterated in any way, making it the perfect component of welfare schemes. Add to this the fact that five million eggs reportedly crack or go bad in India owing to the lack of adequate cold storages and the absence of the protein from mid-day meals seems more senseless.The purpose of the mid-day meal scheme is to provide nutritious food to students and address the problem of malnutrition. The government should ensure that no prejudice stands in the way of this.Sujit De,CalcuttaSir  The task of deciding the items on the menu for a mid-day meal should lie solely with the nutritionists or public health experts. The human resource development ministry or any private agency contracted by it to serve mid-day meals should not have a say in what the children will eat. It has been reported that Akshay Patra, the organization which provides mid-day meals to over 1.76 million children in 14,700 schools, has deliberately kept eggs, onion and garlic off the menu for its own religious beliefs. But according to the agency, the meals it supplies comply with the norms of the HRD ministry.The government must remember that its decisions affect a vast number of people critically. The least it can do is set up a commission of experts to determine food items which will provide the highest amount of nutrition to children from underprivileged families.Sukhamay Biswas,CalcuttaSir  Akshay Patra has been praised for the nutritious, clean and hygienic food that it serves to children as part of mid-day meals. The controversy around the inclusion of eggs, onions and garlic is needless, especially since the eggs that are mass-produced these days in factories are often laced with antibiotics. Worldwide, there has been a shift in consumption patterns towards plant-based food and beverages. These are widely believed to be more natural, sustainable and healthy. Akshay Patra should be allowed to continue running its well-managed programme.H.N. Ramakrishna,BangaloreFlavours of BengalSir  Bengalis have always taken pride in having a nuanced palate. But time  and the Green Revolution?  seems to have tamed their taste buds. A plate of pulao served at a famous Bengali establishment convinced me of this. The short-grained, sweet and sticky variety of rice known as gobindobhog that was synonymous with pulao has been replaced in most places with the long-grained basmati. No one can deny that basmati is flavourful, but can it ever replace the taste of parboiled rice with mangsher jhol? The ubiquitousness of basmati is killing the vibrance of Bengali cuisine.Sanchari Mukherjee,CalcuttaParting shotSir  Amitav Ghosh should be congratulated for winning the coveted Jnanpith award. He has the rare distinction of being the first Indian writer in English to bag the prestigious prize. Ghoshs writings paint vivid pictures on a wide variety of themes like travel, the unique problems of the diaspora, post-colonialism, postmodernism, eco-criticism, history, memory, time, political struggle, communal violence and loss, among other things.Ghoshs research is always deep and illuminating and his books like The Shadow Lines and The Hungry Tide tug at the readers heartstrings.

The factionism has gone. The drinking water problem is under control after Ravi Krishna helped us to build a water purification plant and sourced water from a borewell, said K Harischandra, a villager. But all our hopes have been dealt a blow by this years drought, he added.While the sum assured is Rs 40,000 per hectare, each farmer gets only Rs 2,990 per acre, despite losing his entire crop. Many of the farmers do not have any information about the Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, a crop insurance scheme.I invested around Rs 15,000 per acre by taking loans, but the yield was only one sack of groundnut per acre. None of the agricultural officers visited us and we dont have any knowledge about the insurance scheme, said B Muniswamy, a farmer who lost his groundnut crop due to the drought in the kharif season.When TOI visited Kapatralla, some farmers who have not migrated seemed curious about the visitors. They wondered whether help had arrived. Onion crop in 10 acres has dried up. I suffered Rs 20,000 loss per acre, said Golla Rangamamma, a woman farmer of the village.A Hariprasad, manager of Andhra Pragati Grameena Bank at Kappatralla, told TOI how they have disbursed ?8.38 crore loan to around 971 people this year for kharif and rabi crops, to farmers from four villages, including Kappatralla, Jilledubudakala, Madhapuram and Obulapuram.Each loan is renewed for most farmers. We fix the premium, when farmers take crop loans for weather-based insurance scheme. For groundnut crop, the rate is Rs 900 per hectare. We have processed around 675 claims under the scheme. The insurance company has settled claims for 2017-18 where Rs 2,990 was given per acre. Under PM Fasal Bima Yojana, for crops like cotton and onion, around 29 farmers got registered, Hariprasad said.But farmers alleged that insurance companies and agricultural officers have failed to do proper assessment, leading to less insurance amount. Kurnool district collector S Satyanarayana added that the insurance amount was paid to the consumer as per the assessed damage of the crop by assessors of the insurance company."

The summer crop, harvested in March and April, has shelf life of about six months. Usually, the last batch of the summer crop reaches the market in mid-October, after which, the kharif onions takes over.This year, farmers stocked on the long-lasting summer crop hoping for a better price later. However, low demand and glut in the market brought prices crashing down. Even the fresh kharif crop is getting low rates at present. On Monday, kharif onions were selling at a minimum price of Rs2 per kg and an average of Rs5 per kg.The average wholesale onion prices have crashed by 91% in the past two months from Rs21.51 per kg on October 17 to Rs2 per kg on December 24. This occurred as supply exceeded demand.Farmers are finding it difficult to even recover the cost of transporting their produce to the market. To add to their woes, stocked onions have begun sprouting with the drop in minimum temperatures.How will farmers survive if they get such a low price? We should be able to recover our costs at least, if not make some profit, onion farmer Kuber Jadhav said, recommending that the government announce minimum support price of Rs20 per kg for onions.APMC officials said farmers prefer storing onions in a bid to get better price for their produce. The current arrival of summer onions in the market is the farmers storage, which is about six months old. Moreover, the fresh kharif crop has also started arriving in the market, causing huge drop in demand for the summer onions.On Monday, minimum wholesale onion price was recorded at Re1 per kg and maximum wholesale price was recorded at Rs3.91 per kg at Lasalgaon APMC. Average wholesale onion price was Rs 2 per kg. Totally, 12,000 quintals of onions were auctioned at Lasalgaon on Monday.Upset with the low prices, farmers from Nashik district had sent the money earned through the auction to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister of Maharashtra Devendra Fadnavis."

He later ploughed the field with a tractor.At the Vinchur sub-market of the Lasalgaon Agriculture Produce Market Committee, which is the countrys largest wholesale market for onions, Maruti Gund was offered Rs 191 per quintal on Wednesday. Upset with the low price, he took the crop back to his farm and ploughed over it.He also tried to sell the produce in the wholesale markets of Ahmednagar and Pune, but he had to spend a lot in transport. When the onion prices started crashing, I sold 47 quintals in Ahmednagar and got Rs 300 per quintal. But I had to spend Rs 200 per quintal on transport, gunny bags, labour cost and other expenses. In the end, I was left with Rs 100 per quintal, he said.Gund then sold 25 quintals of onions in the wholesale market at Pune, but got the rate of Rs 290 per quintal. The quality of summer onions I sold there was very good but nevertheless I got a paltry rate, he added.After all these efforts, he decided to again go to the nearest APMC. He still had over 50 quintals of onions in storage. After I got just Rs 190 a quintal, I took 30 quintals and dumped them on my farmland. At least, I will have good manure and I would not have to spend on fertiliser for the next crop, said Gund.He added that he will similarly be dumping the remaining 20 quintals of onions on his farm. When asked, Gund said, Government should compensate the losses or give grant considering the base rate of Rs 2,000 per quintal to farmers. It should compensate the losses of onion farmers, who have sold or yet to sell, accordingly.On governments ex-gratia of Rs 200 per quintal for onion farmers, he said, We feel it is a mockery of farmers. This will not solve a problem of farmers and we will also not accept the ex-gratia amount. We feel it is a mockery to farmers, he said."

These officials are trying to project the crop insurance scheme as the Centre's contribution. I vouch that this is a travesty of truth,"" she said. ""The Centre is trying to showcase the scheme as its own when it pays only 20% of the liability while the state bears 80%. I am telling AIC officials the state will withdraw its deposits with AIC if they continue with such misinformation. We can very well bear entire liability if we can pay 80% of insurance premium,"" she said.State officials pointed out that Bengal was the only state where farmers didn't have to pay crop insurance for rabi crops other than potato and onion . The state government pays its own share and also the beneficiary's share, which adds up to 80% of the insurance premium.The Centre uses the PMFBY tag by paying only 20% of the premium share. According to state officials, the CM has introduced a crop insurance scheme called Bangla Fasal Bima which is aimed at covering rabi crops, with the state bearing the entire cost of the premium. ""Now, when the CM has mentioned it, beneficiaries under PMFBY are likely to be transferred to the Bangla Fasal Bima scheme,"" a state official said.The CM also listed government bounties in the agricultural sector. ""We have abolished 'khajna' (land rent) on agricultural land. The owner of agricultural land doesn't have to pay a mutation fee to get it registered. We are giving farmer pensions to 1 lakh beneficiaries and have increased monthly pensions from Rs 750 to Rs 1,000,"" she said."

It may be noted that onion arrivals have increased in the market at present due to which the prices in the mandis are subdued, the agriculture ministry said in a statement.Before July, the export incentive for fresh onions was zero. The government had introduced the 5% incentive in July. Now, with the current increase, onions enjoy one of the highest incentives for agro-exports, the ministry said.Meanwhile, Prabhu had written to finance minister Arun Jaitley for increasing the export incentives under the Merchandise Exports from India Scheme (MEIS). Under MEIS, the Centre provides duty benefits depending on product and country. Rewards under the scheme are payable as percentage of realised free-on-board value and MEIS duty credit scrip can be transferred or used for payment of a number of duties including the basic customs duty.In view of the urgency of the situation, the finance ministry is requested to allocate additional funds of Rs 179.16 crore, so that MEIS reward at 10% can be provided for the export of fresh onions up to June 30 next year, Prabhu said."

Gujarat is one of the top producers of garlic and onion with extensive sowing in Bhavnagar, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Amreli, Junagadh, and Kutch districts.We are forced to sell garlic from Rs. 20 to Rs. 80 per 20 kg in APMCs, said Premjibhai Senjalia, a farmer from Rabarika village in Amreli district. Average price is about Rs. 50-70 per 20 kg, that means Rs. 250 to Rs. 350 per quintal.Due to the extremely low prices, Mr. Senjalia said he was yet to sell the approximately 50 quintals of garlic lying harvested in his house. I had garlic in 10 bigha land and production is about 50 quintal. I have stocked it because there is no one willing to buy thanks to lower prices, he said, adding that thousands of farmers in his district had also held back on selling their harvests.In most APMCs in the State such as the ones at Rajkot, Gondal, Mahuva and Jamnagar the prices of both the commodities have been hovering below Rs. 100 per 20 kg, pushing farmers into distress as they sell at a loss.Across the region, garlic and onion growers are selling at a loss, said Virji Thummar, a Congress legislator from Amreli district. They dont even realise their basic costs of labour and inputs, he added.Bhikhabhai Markana, a farmer from Kalavad in Jamnagar district, harvested about 40 quintal of onion from his 2 bighas. He sold 23 quintals at the Rajkot AMPC at Rs. 40 per 20 kg, fetching him Rs. 200 per quintal.My cost including labour, inputs like seed, fertiliser and irrigation is Rs. 12,000 for the two bighas of onion and I would sell the produce for about Rs. 8,000-10,000 at current market price, he said, reflecting the plight of the regions farmers.Sacks of unsold garlicBalubhai Ahir, a garlic grower from Khirsara village in Rajkot district, told The Hindu that more than two lakh sacks of garlic were lying in farmers houses in about a dozen villages in Jetpur taluka.Not many farmers have sold the stock because of low price, they are not getting even peanuts, said Mr. Ahir. Average cost to grow garlic is Rs. 12,000 per bigha during its four-and-a-half month crop cycle and average yield is 7-8 quintal. If sold at current price of Rs. 70-80 per 20 kg...a farmer would realise about Rs. 2,500-3,200 per bigha, a loss of at least Rs. 8,000-9,000 per bigha."

In case of non- compliance, the varsity will cancel the licences.
