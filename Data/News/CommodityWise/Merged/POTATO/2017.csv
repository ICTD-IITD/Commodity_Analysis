An alumni wing of St Xavier's College, Ranchi along with other people from the region set up a food stall at an Indian Fair at Charlotte in North Carolina of United States of America (USA) few months ago.One among these non-resident Indians (NRI) Abhishek Sinha, working as vice-president manager in Bank of America who pursued intermediate (Science) from 1994-96 and Bachelor of Science (Chemistry honours) from 1996-97 in St Xavier's College while sharing details of this American inclination during the college alumni meet on December 31 told TOI, ""In mid-September, we had thought of participating in the fair with homemade litti-chokha, samosa and mutton rice. It was a surprise to see Americans loving these items and litti-chokha more because our dishes are spicier than theirs.""""They were relishing and constantly asking us to offer another plate of litti-chokha. On the first day, all the food we made got sold out in four hours and on the second day, it was sold out in the first two hours.USA has strict rules regarding preparing dishes for fair. We had to rush to our houses, prepare hundreds of litti-chokha and return to the fair,"" he said.Accepting the love for Bihar-Jharkhand's traditional dish, Deveshi Halder, an artist settled in Bellevue, Washington, who had graduated in Economics at St Xavier's College from 2006-09 said, "" Litti-chokha is undoubtedly famous on the east coast of United States including North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Florida but not the same on our side.""Litti is prepared by flour wherein cereals and ground pulses are mixed. This kind of flour is called Sattu. Onion, lemon, garlic and salt are added in it. The material is roasted and served with or without ghee. Chokha is the smashed potato including salt, garlic, onion and chilly flakes. Both litti and chokha is served with tomato chutney.Sinha said the group displaying such Bihar-Jharkhand customs is called Sparsh and has 150 members."

58d67cc7a3d24b1894a674fa,'Non-profitable' agriculture shrinking fast in hill villages,http://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/non-profitable-agriculture-shrinking-fast-in-hill-villages/story-ObaZQsaEuuzYk4aauXSqGN.html,2017-01-05,"Digamber Negi, 37-year-old farmer in picturesque Doon Dwara village on the border of Dehradun-Tehri Garhwal districts, is cursing his fate after monkeys barged into his field a week ago and destroyed vegetable crop.Like Negi, several other villagers have similar plight to share. The village has a population of 320 people and they are dependent only on agriculture.Villagers complain that in the past one decade or so, attacks by monkeys and wild boars in their agriculture land have made things difficult. We keep guarding fields from monkeys during day and from wild boars during night, said Negi.Farming in hills is shrinking fast and farmers losing interest in it. Besides attacks by monkeys and wild boars, farmers facing problem due to lack of irrigation facility. Farming in hills is rain fed and canals are limited to some pockets.In Doon Dwara, villagers have either stopped or growing limited crops like millets, oats, vegetables like cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes etc.Shyam Singh, another farmer, said monkeys destroy vegetables while wild boars destroy potato fields. We are left with very little options, Singh said.Farming in hills has become a non-profitable entity. Government figure shows that agriculture land came down from 7.91 lakh hectares in 2009-10 to 7.41 lakh in 2011-12.Half of the states agricultural land falls in four districts of Dehradun, Nainital, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar in plains and rest is shared by nine hill districts.Prakash Dimri, another farmer, said: 2,200 is the average cost that comes on sowing in an area of 0.02 hectares or 1 nali while the return is not more than 1,500.The land holdings are tiny and which are getting further fragmented over time. 87% farming in hills is rain fed while only 13% has irrigation facility, said Vijay Jardhari, an agro expert.Change in the climate pattern is also a big concern, rain cycle is no more regular thus farmers are left with little choice, he said.Jardhari said farmers must continue with millets since it survives drought like condition and give handsome returns. He, however, is clueless on providing solutions to farmers who were not growing millets owing to threat from wild animals.Due to growing population of monkeys, acres of arable land left untilled and agriculture activities have almost reduced to vicinity of houses in the villages.Villagers in Thano in the outskirts of Dehradun are trying to grow crops such as ginger, turmeric, bitter gourd and lady finger that usually monkeys dont eat.People in Balori village that falls in Pauri district have passed a resolution asking the district administration to either drive away monkeys or vasectomise them.The forest department is entrusted with the task of catching monkeys but it is confined to urban areas. In February 2016, the department gave permission with riders to kill the wild boars affecting farming in hills.Killing wild boars is not an easy task. In the absence of trained hunters, the order is meaningless said Ratan Aswal of village Mirchoda."
592874f57be9e013b183fd7f,Small lives made smaller,http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/telangana/2017/jan/05/small-lives-made-smaller-1556239.html,2017-01-05,"It was on the bus to Mancherial that I remembered the bottles of anardana I had forgotten to pack. Adilabad had been chilly and I subsisted on a plate of two idlis and several packets of potato chips. There was no direct bus to Peddapalli, one of the new districts carved out by the TRS government. So I took the bus to Mancherial and was glad to be ushered to the ladies seat. I had the window seat and the sun was out. But by the time I reached my destination, I had a headache, leaving me longing for anardana.From the bus terminus, I rushed to the railway station to catch the Kagaznagar Express. On the way, I spotted a Patanjali store and I thanked the stars and Baba Ramdev. As I paid for a box of Amla Pachak, I asked the woman minding the store if the past year had been good to her. It has been nothing less than perfect, said Anasuya, her optimism surprising me. She commutes 20 km to the store every day but the job kept her happy. I am single. No dependents and nothing to worry about. The note ban didnt affect me, she said, laughing.How so? I dont need a lot of money. I can live on Rs 2,000 a month. Big families are the ones suffering, she explained.Still mulling over this new surprising angle to demonetisation, I stopped at the Women Police Station to eat my Amla Pachak. My headache had eased but now I was hungry. I espied an old woman roasting corn on the cob on the street outside and sensed an opportunity to have a conversation while I sated my hunger. I picked a cob and asked her to a rub a lot of lime and salt on it. As she took my tenner, I asked how business has been. The reply was a staccato burst of fire, taking down the entire political economy of Telangana: My husband died six years ago and I havent received a single benefit from the government. I live with my son who has his own life. What Telangana? Curse Telangana. Nothing has happened since it came. Theres nothing for us. Not a house, not any money. Is this the way to look after old people like me?And she declared: Write this! Ill never vote for Modi or KCR again.Unlike the luscious American corn invading Hyderabad, this cob was of the native variety, hard to chew even for someone whos used to opening beer bottles with her teeth. The headache threatened to come back and so I licked the salt and lime and threw the cob away.The 30-minute journey to Peddapalli on the 12758 Up Kagaznagar Express was remarkable only for my encounter at last with the formidable mother-in-law passenger who insisted on keeping her bag on my seat rather than let me sit in it. The Peddapalli railway station was rather more interesting: it had more monkeys, looking diseased, than people. Wary of simian interest in my hair or my bag, I tiptoed out and asked the first auto driver I saw to drop me at the bus stop. Its only 1 km away. You can walk, said the kind man. He reminded me of the autowallahs back home. I smiled and asked him to drop me anyway.Mirza Ghouse Baig didnt think the new district would change his fortunes. He had stopped believing false promises anyway. When the state was formed, the local MLA promised a number of things. He said they would construct houses for those who had land. Nothing has happened till today. It has only become worse with the note ban, said the 32-year-old with two children and a wife to take care of.He used to make about Rs 300 per day driving the auto but the note ban has brought his earnings down. He might have his own auto but he wouldnt be able to afford Rs 5,600 a year for insurance. We cannot pay that and hence cannot get a fitness certificate for the vehicle.What can I do? he said as I paid him and walked to the bus to Karimnagar."
58d9204ea3d24b224f242550,"In This Maharashtra Village, Parents Migrate for a Living, Children Die",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-this-maharashtra-village-parents-migrate-for-a-living-children-die/story-csNQgANn8n2g3NOmC3wecJ.html,2017-01-05,"As Soni Wadwi breastfed her one-year-old son, Sonu, outside her hut in Khoch village, Palghar district of Maharashtra in western India, she recounted how he almost died from severe malnutrition four months ago.The family left the village last year for work for several months as many do. When they returned, Sonu was weak and admitted to a hospital.Wadwis son survived and made a full recovery but about 400 other children died from malnutrition-linked illnesses in Palghar between April and November 2016 -- a rising trend that campaigners put down to an annual pattern of migration for work.In the last three years, malnutrition has claimed the lives of about 1,600 children in Palghar, a tribal region battling high unemployment and poverty, with national headlines over child deaths prompting government action to address the problem.Read: Maharashtra tribals dont eat wheat, barter it for salt, oil, says studyKhoch lies 150 km from Indias commercial capital Mumbai and close to the border with Gujarat, one of the countrys most prosperous states, but unemployment is forcing parents to move to cities to find work to feed their children.Palghars problem of malnutrition is shocking because of its proximity to Mumbai, but it is migration to Mumbai that is at the root of this problem, said Milind Thatte, founder of Vayam, a movement for tribal development.People from Palghar migrate to Mumbai for work, but the cost of living there is very high. They dont eat to save money.Villagers start leaving Palghar in December for the Mumbai satellite towns of Thane and Bhiwandi where they often work 12-hour shifts at construction sites or road building projects.Once the monsoon season halts construction, workers return to villages in July for a jobless spell until October, when the start of the harvest provides daily work on farmland.Locals refer to September as starvation month, when many people are unemployed and childrens deaths peak.The end of the harvest in December again signals the end of the villagers home stay.We have no work now, but we will leave soon. We are waiting for the seth (the construction site contractor) to come and take us, Wadwi said.BOTTOM OF THE LADDERNamdev Savara, a member of the Kathkari tribe, has devoted an entire wall of his one-room hut in Khoch to colourful depictions of Indian gods and goddesses.So when his son, Ishwar - which means the supreme lord in Hindi - died in September, he hung a black and white picture of the child on this wall of worship.Savara said he will not leave Khoch in 2017 and he will work on a local road construction project with his wife. The couple will stay close to their two other children who go to school.According to government data about 39% of Indian children suffer from chronic undernutrition and around 42.5% are underweight.In Palghar, malnutrition most affects the Kathkari tribe -- a one time forest community which is among the lowest in the pecking order of the Indian caste system.Most children who died this year due to malnutrition-linked illnesses were from the Kathkari community, said Nidhi Chaudhari, who heads the Palghar local government office.Vivek Pandit, an activist who has represented the area in the Maharashtra state assembly, said Kathkari people dont have land and are handpicked for their ability to do strenuous work.They work at construction sites, break stones for road construction or at brick kilns, Pandit said.Employers usually prefer to hire Kathkari couples as they coordinate better and are cheaper than two men, with men paid around 200 rupees daily and women anywhere between 50 and 100 rupees.The migrant workers survive on rice and the occasional dish of potato and onions, saving their money for the jobless months.WEAK AND VULNERABLEDoctors said children suffer due to irregular feeding patterns when both parents work long hours.The parents priority is not their childs health but to earn their daily wages, said Ramdas Marad, superintendent at the Palghar sub-district hospital that runs at twice its capacity in the monsoon months between June and September.Children are more vulnerable to disease such as pneumonia or respiratory infections during this time as they are weak and their immunities are compromised.The government is drawing up a list of Kathkari tribe members to ensure they benefit from the government schemes for jobs and education, among the others that they are eligible for.The government has even started a new road project in Khoch to attempt to slow migration, but only a handful of people who have bank accounts are so far eligible.Savara is among them but his decision to stay in Khoch this year is an anomaly in the village where migration began last month.Many, such as Wadwi, even committed to leave in September, when a contractor visited families and bought promises of migration against an advance payment.I know my child was malnourished when we migrated last year. But what will I feed him if I dont work? she said."
58e4c222a3d24b1c91edf55a,"With elections before harvest season, parties target farmers",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/with-elections-before-harvest-season-parties-target-farmers/articleshow/56360003.cms,2017-01-06,"AGRA: With elections in Uttar Pradesh slated for February, long before harvest season begins towards the end of March, farmers will find time to participate both in political meetings and to take up their issues with the candidates. Political parties too have framed special strategies to woo this large chunk of voters. Villages are expected to witness crowded 'chaupals'.The multi-phase elections will begin with notification for the first phase on January 17 and end with voting in phase 7 on March 8, coinciding with a period when farmers have some time on their hands. ""This season wheat has been sown in around 1.24 hectares alone in Agra district and potato in 79 hectares. Harvesting of mustard crop will take place on 30 hectares. Farmers will start harvesting potatoes from around February 25, followed by wheat and mustard in March,"" said deputy director of agriculture, K N Rai.Shyam Singh Chahar, district head of Bharatiya Kisan Union said, ""Farms in Agra and nearby districts are covered with crops of wheat, potato and mustard. Framers will not be having much to do on the fields till first phase of voting on February 11. Farmers will be discussing their issues with the candidates and mark their presence in election rallies and political meetings.""Farmer Manvendra Singh of Kheragarh block said, ""It is after a long time that the election schedule is suitable for farmers. During election campaign days, we will have time to listen and interact with candidates and ask them what they are going to do for agricultural development and welfare of farmers.""This time party workers and candidates will not have to make the round of farms to meet cultivators and seek their vote. During the day, farmers will be either at home or in public places in villages.BJP district president Shyam Bhadoriya said, ""The party in Agra has been in continuous interaction with farmers. Our wing, the BJP Kisan Morcha, has been helping farmers in their time of need. Ahead of elections we are going to organize special chaupals and interact with farmers around bonfires. We will remind farmers of the pro-agriculture initiatives of the central government and note down their grievances."" BSP district head Pramod Raina said, ""We will make farmers aware of the Centre's neglect and farlse promises by the state government. In recent seasons farmers in the region have faced major losses due to harsh weather but the government has not provided any help. Through open meetings the party's plans for welfare of farmers will be conveyed throughout the district."" Congress district president Dushyant Sharma said, ""Party workers are in regular touch with farmers. The Centre's unplanned demonetisation has hit farmers the most. Once votes to power, the Congress will completely waive all pending debt, reduce electricity bills by half and enact other initiatives to relieve the burden on them. Special teams have been constituted at the district level to visit different villages and convey the party's vision for the welfare of farmers."""
58e4c27aa3d24b281b1020e6,West Bengal should try to maintain law and order: Governor Kesharai Nath Tripathi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/state-should-try-to-maintain-law-and-order-guv/articleshow/56361789.cms,2017-01-06,"KOLKATA: An apparently innocuous advice from the head of the state became a political hot potato on Thursday with the ruling Trinamool training its guns at Raj Bhavan like the Left did after the Nandigram killings nearly 10 years ago in March 2007. West Bengal Governor Kesharai Nath Tripathi while responding to a question on the attack on the state BJP headquarters in Kolkata soon after Trinamool Lok Sabha leader Sudip Bandyopadhyay's arrest, said: ""Every state, irrespective of political attachment, should try to ensure peace in the state and maintain law and order."" The governor didn't name any state neither did he comment on the prevailing situation in West Bengal.While BJP leader Rahul Sinha welcomed the governor's statement saying that Tripathi had advised the state government to discharge raj dharma, Trinamool secretary general and minister Partha Chatterjee feared that BJP was trying to use the governor's office. The Left also didn't spare the governor for ""breaking silence"" only after the BJP party offices and leaders came under attack.Political parties read between the lines of his statement giving political connotations to the context in which the governor made the statement. The governor's comment comes two days after the attack on state BJP headquarters on Tuesday evening, and a day after men carrying Trinamool flags mobbed Union minister Babul Supriyo's Kolkata home and also led a siege to BJP party offices in Durgapur and Hooghly. The violence apart from the bedlam in city continued even on Thursday, the recent being the attack on state BJP president Dilip Ghosh's house. All these caught the notice of Union home minister Rajnath Singh who in turn called the state BJP president and asked him to lodge separate FIRs on each of these attacks. The Union home department has asked for an action taken report for all these cases.The continuing violence without any arrest so far doesn't speak well of the state's law and order. Such a situation also blunts the state government's writing to the Union home ministry against the deployment of CRPF jawans at the state BJP office on the day of the incident without the state government's consent. On the contrary, the Union home minister's taking interest in the happenings in West Bengal has prompted the police brass at Lalbazar to take guard. Setting aside the usual nonchalance over the last two days, Lalbazar has fortified the BJP party offices and the residence of the leaders across the state, and are likely to make some arrests before sending a report to Nabanna. The state government also wants the police to take action before it sends the action taken report to the Union home ministry.Mamata Banerjee as opposition leader had witnessed such wrangling match between the BJP government at the Centre and the Left Front government in West Bengal in 1998-99 during the violence in Keshpur, Nanoor, Suchpur when the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government had sent a central team to Bengal to take stock of the ground reality.State parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee thus doesn't want to open yet another front of confrontation with Raj Bhavan. ""The government has no problems with the present governor. We may have differences at times but some people are trying to take it too far. I had a talk with the governor even today,"" Chatterjee said, adding that his party isn't in a mood to burn bridges with Raj Bhavan."

Swaminathan sees bio-fortification, the process of improving nutritional quality of food crops, as holding the key to tackle malnutrition and under-nourishment.In his talk on Science and zero hunger challenge delivered at the 104th Indian Science Congress here on Friday, Dr. Swaminathan called it a matter of shame for the nation to rank low in child nourishment and food security, in spite of the farmers being the pride of the nation. He floated the idea of developing Nutrition gardens (botanical gardens with plants considered rich in vitamins, iron, iodine etc.) and creating public awareness. In this connection, he referred to the role played by the newly-developed sweet potato variety having orange-coloured flesh (high in beta carotene) in combating child malnutrition. After calorie deficiency and protein deficiency, the hidden micronutrient deficiency requires attention now, he pointed out.Calling food as curative medicine, as has been found in the case of tuberculosis, he said that reaching food to the masses would eliminate most disorders.On Ehrlich's prediction of India falling flat in achieving food security, he threw a challenge to the agricultural scientists to prove wrong all such prophesies. Dr. Swaminathan suggested genetic checkmating of new disease threats to usher in the era of food security.From Nehruvian focus on multi-purpose irrigation projects to Lal Bahadur Shastri equating farmer with the soldier with the catchy slogan Jai Jawan Jai Kisan, Dr. Swaminathan dwelt on former Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayees inclusion of Jai Vigyan that gave the technological thrust to India's focus.On Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu's offer of Rs.100 crore to Nobel prize winner from the State, Dr. Swaminathan hailed it as having great potential to stimulate scientific thinking."

A total of 1.70 crore people have been hit hard, with 81.5 lakh losing their jobs. The Prime Minister can't run the country. Let there be a national government and let someone else from BJP take over. It can be Advani, Rajnath Singh or Arun Jaitley .""Appreciating what President Pranab Mukherjee said about providing protection to the poor, the CM urged him to become a saviour for the states.""The present PM is the great Kalidas who is cutting branches of the tree on which he is. The country isn't in safe hands of `buddhiharan babu' (a fool).Even government projects have been hit. I ask SDOs to get in touch with the CMO in the event of a government project being stalled,"" the CM said, asking officials to create a dedicated CMO phone number for this.Mamata feared that worse is in store for the state. ""What you are seeing now isn't the bottom of the crisis.The worst is yet to happen. How long can industries operate without funds? They are running out of working capital. People have money in banks, but they can't withdraw it. We don't know how long the cashless PM will continue with the cash withdrawal ceiling. Farmers, bidi workers, tea plantation workers, those working in jute mills, artisans, weavers and jewellery makers are the worst hit. The Centre had promised Rs 2,500 crore to cooperative banks. But they have got only Rs 300 crore. The cash crunch has taken a toll on rabi crops and potato farming too."" She argued that the slump in farming will lead to aspike in commodity prices in the near future and the country will be heading towards famine.The CM also hit out at Modi over his bid to do away with the old institutions. ""Yesterday , we got a letter from the ministry of corporate affairs dissolving the board for industrial and financial reconstruction (BIFR). This is not the only one. Soon after he came to power, the PM abolished the planning commission, which used to allocate resources for states. He replaced it with Niti Ayog. The PM has been eroding institutions that formed the country's backbone,"" the CM said.The CM took a dig at the deployment of CRPF jawans in front of the state BJP office. ""Political parties are calling in the CRPF when there is a state government. The PM is misusing government agencies. The country is witnessing a terror, we have to come out of it."" She then appealed to all political parties to set aside their differences and chalk out a common minimum programme for the national government."

Some have even approached us to supply maize in bulk.""Bangarmau has half a dozen big flour and maize mills, a dozen rice mills, large cold storage for potatoes and numerous mandis for green vegetables and fruit. The launch of the expressway in November facilitated farmers, mill and mandi owners significantly as they are able to transport their produce to man dis of Gorakhpur, Delhi and Lucknow in almost half the time it used to take earlier.Mandi owner Jameel Ahmad said, ""Once the eway is opened for trucks, we would be able to supply potatoes and muskmelon in bulk to Lucknow in less than two hours. Even supply to Mahewa mandi of Gorakhpur, which took six hours, will now take only four hours.""Shopkeepers said the expressway can help them reach more markets in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab as now they are directly connected to Agra. Maize mill owner Sanjeev Kumar said, ""Earlier, the trucks took two days to reach Delhi as they had to halt at Agra after travelling from Bangarmau for one full night.They reached Delhi after another night's journey but now they will reach in only a day as they will join the Yamuna Expressway from Agra. Freight charges have reduced to almost half to benefit entrepreneurs as well as farmers.""The e-way has also solved the problem of transporting perishable commodities on time as trucks carrying fruit and vegetables to mandis of other cities will reach in almost half the time. Singh added that UP government has proposed many cold storage for potatoes along the e-way like in Kannauj and Safipur. This will help farmers sell potatoes at profitable rates and prevent rotting.There is a big demand in Delhi and Haryana."""

Velumani and District Monitoring Officer and Principal Secretary Harmander Singh visited drought-affected parts of Coimbatore and said that the district had, due to poor rainfall, witnessed drought after 140 years.A release from the district administration quoting the Minister said that as against the districts average rainfall of 671 mm, the rainfall last year had been only 223 mm - a deficit of 67.5 per cent. The impact of the poor rainfall had been that 8,230 of 9,869 ha of maize, 1,665 of 2,916 ha of jowar, and 2,200 of 4,662 ha under pulses, had been affected.Of the 295 villages in the district, 276 were affected. Officials would assess damages due to drought and steps would be taken to provide 100 per cent compensation.A.P. Nagarajan, MP, MLAs, and officialsaccompanied the team. The team visited villages in Madukkarai, Thondamuthur, Periyanaickenpalayam, Annur, S.S. Kulam, Sultanpet, Pollachi North and South and Anamalai panchayat unions.In Tirupur , Minister for Housing and Urban Development Udumalai K. Radhakrishnan on Sunday inspected the heavily stressed areas across the district where acute water shortage was experienced by farmers.Official sources said the objective of the visit was to make a ground-level assessment of the difficulties faced by the farmers due to weak monsoon and submit a report accordingly to the State government to mitigate the hardships.A recent report sent by the Department of Agriculture to its head office had indicated that nearly 15 per cent of the total cropped area in the district since the commencement of rabi season, was heavily stressed with almost entire crops withered.In Udhagamandalam , Minister for Social Welfare and Nutritious Noon Meal Programme V Saroja said that there had been a more than 50 per cent shortfall in rain in the Nilgiris this year after visiting parts of the district on Sunday.Speaking to reporters at Nanjanad, Ms. Saroja said that on an average, Nilgiris district witnessed 1,920 mm rainfall, while this year, a total of 970 mm rainfall was recorded throughout the district.The Minister visited drought-affected areas around Udhagamandalam, including Forest Gate and Kavaratti, where she met potato, carrot and cabbage growers and listened to their problems.Around 1,000 acres of potato farms, 500 acres of carrot and 200 acres of cabbage seem to have been affected by the lack of rain in and around Udhagamandalam. The district administration will take a count of the total number of farmers affected, Ms. Saroja said.She said that a report would be prepared and sent to the government, recommending for compensation to be provided to farmers who have incurred losses due to the deficit in rainfall this year."

While releasing the data for the full year with more than a quarter to go, the Central Statistical Organisation (CSO) did give a disclaimer about not incorporating the impact of demonetisation in its projections about the countrys growth. The deceleration to 7.1% from 7.6% in the previous fiscal has come about on the back of considerations like global headwinds, retaining Indias status among the fastest-growing economies of the world. But such self-congratulatory report card carries no credibility when vast segments of the economy are in a state of disarray.In the initial days of the note-scrapping exercise, unprecedented anywhere on this scale, Indias micro-small industries reported 35% job losses and 50% dip in revenue, according to a study by the All India Manufacturers Organisation (AIMO). Job losses may go up to 60% and revenue loss to 55% before March 31, the AIMO study further projected. Certain vital sectors of the economy, which are among the largest employment generators, have come to a standstill even as they battle the image of being the parking lot for black money and corruption. Real estate and jewellery industries are almost shut, while tourism, infrastructure, automobile, media, fast-moving consumer goods, transportation, among others are in the grip of a slowdown. Agriculture sector and the entire rural landscape  which had a godly opportunity of rewarding farmers and farm workers, courtesy good monsoon  seem to be squandering away prospective gains as distress sales of onion, tomato, potato and several other crops are being reported from a large number of states following the note ban.The CSO may have managed to give flattering data by some technical and financial jugglery, but the GDP numbers without factoring in the impact of demonetisation are meaningless and are being taken so by the markets and independent analysts. The Finance Ministry, which is busy making the Budget to be presented a month ahead of the conventional last day of February, would do well not to rely too much on the CSO advance estimates while projecting the revenue and expenditure figures for the fiscal 2017-18. With Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Finance Minister Arun Jaitley admitting visible impact of the invalidation of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes on the economy, an ear to the ground policy would serve better."

Yet each birthday marks a milestone in ones life, justifying a celebration no matter how small. Perhaps nothing brings people together as readily as a birthday does. A birthday party I once attended turned out to be hilarious.The birthday boy, an ingenuous youngster in his early 20s, turned up and breezily announced, Ill join all of you as soon as Ive changed into my birthday suit! For heavens sake, dont!, almost everyone chorused in mock horror, leaving him completely baffled. It turned out that the nave guy had got a new suit specially tailored for the occasionand was blissfully unaware of the negative connotations of appearing in ones birthday suit! Forgetting a loved ones birthday is a common human failure.I sometimes forget my wifes birthday, triggering much acrimony. And trying to make amends only sours her disposition further, bringing forth stinging accusations like You never forget your brothers birthdays! I usually cut a sorry figure conceding that she does have a valid point there. As Ogden Nash pertinently observed, Marriage is the alliance of two people, one of whom never remembers birthdays and the other never forgets them.It was Robert Frost who defined a diplomat as one who always remembers a womans birthday but never her age. Sadly, Im no diplomat and sometimes tend to blurt out indiscreetly, As far as I can remember, you turned 37 last year.This gaffe is usually enough to make the flustered lady blush a shade of red seldom seenand drop me like a hot potato from her list of future birthday party invitees! While in service, I used to wish my Scottish boss unfailingly on his birthday. Then one day he surprised me with his perspicacity. Tell me, he remarked shrewdly, Is there any link between my birthday and your annual confidential report thats due around the same time? Smirking, I left it to him to draw his own conclusions!It must be said, to his credit, that after retiring from India he thoughtfully gifted me a three-year subscription to The Writer on my thirtieth birthday. This London-based monthly for aspiring writers proved to be a real boon. I still treasure the old yellowing issues. Talking of birthday gifts, a friend once confided that a clever wife is one who knows how to re-tie the birthday gift her husband has hidden from her!"
58f6ba8b7be9e031f13bab7a,Farmers on expressway to crorepati club,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/farmers-on-expressway-to-crorepati-club/articleshow/56464744.cms,2017-01-11,"A brick and mortar house now stands tall in place of the decrepit mud hut with a thatched roof at local farmer Jaiveer's house in Hinmapur village of Kannauj. The roof that once reeked of moisture and rain, is replaced now with an open cemented terrace that housed the marriage party of his daughter a few months ago. It was a distant dream for the family not very long which came true, thanks to Agra-Lucknow Expressway.When the government acquired around 12 bighas of Jaiveer's land what he and his family got in return was close to Rs 3 crore, and the tag of becoming a crorepati farmer in the small village. And, with money, came not just the house and the marriage, but also a tractor, two motorbikes, a car, a potato trading unit in Kanpur and land bought in another part of the district, all adding to the family's assets. It's, however, not just Jaiveer, but other farmers like Raghuvir and Pyaare Lal who have all earned the distinction of becoming millionaires because of the compensation that the expressway has brought""Pehle bas jaise taise khane peene ka kharcha nikal aata tha, ab hum crorepati hain. (Earlier, we would barely make ends meet, and now I am a crorepati),"" said Jaiveer. ""We are still the same people though,"" he quickly added.The family spent around Rs 5 lakh on the daughter's marriage, sending her off with all possible gifts that the villagers would have only dreamt of. ""The fridge and washing machine, double bed and other furniture that we gave her on the wedding, wouldn't have been possible earlier,"" said Asha Devi, his sister-in-law.Farmers Pyaare Lal and his brother Munshi Lal who live in Rata Purwa under Behrin Panchayat also joined the crorepati club overnight with over Rs 1 crore they received for their 7-8 bighas of land, that fell right on the highway curve. The family bought more land, a plot for a house and spent quite a sum of money on the treatment of one of their sons who met with an accident. ""One of my sons wanted to get into the police but was falling short since I could not put him in a good coaching and training centre due to lack of money. With the sum we got, he has now finally entered the police services and is posted in Fatehpur,"" said Pyaare Lal with pride.Another farmer, Raghuvir, from Rata Purwa had for the past two years been thinking of marrying off his daughter but borrowing a sum of Rs 4 lakh would have been too high a loan to take care of. Suddenly, the expressway came in and Raghuvir breathed a sigh of relief when his family was compensated for 16 bighas of land for a sum of over Rs 1 crore as the rate here was less as compared to Jaiveer's village.""Itni achhi shaadi na kar pate. I married her with the choicest of gifts that I had wanted to give my daughter. The wedding party was a big one with over 150 people from the grooms' side alone and the entire village still remembers it,"" he said. Not just the marriage, Raghuvir spent the money in buying more land, keeping his farming intact and also got a new house made."

On November 13 last year, Modi had urged the people to give him 50 days to implement the note ban and said if after that they found shortcomings in his work they could punish him at a public square. At the Prakash Utsav event in Gandhi Maidan on January 5, Lalu's absence from the dais had set tongues wagging. ""I was happy to sit cross-legged for two-and-a-half hours along with devotees,"" Lalu said today at a news meet where he tore into the Centre over demonetisation. "" Ekdam tanatan hain, (I'm fit as a fiddle),"" Lalu said he had told Modi when the Prime Minister had enquired about his health. He said Modi's praise for prohibition was a red herring. ""Nitish has been demanding prohibition in the entire country, but Modi cleverly avoided committing on it. His praise for prohibition was to hide the failure of demonetisation and deflect public attention from it,"" Lalu said. He said the country was reeling from the note ban shock, with GDP growth rate plunging and the unorganised sector virtually destroyed, impacting around 40 crore workers and common people. ""Farmers across the nation are facing devastation. They have to sell potato and cauliflower at just Rs 2-3 per kilo,"" he said. Aboout BJP president Amit Shah's visit to Patna Sahib today, Lalu said: ""He has come late. Yet he should pray to Guru Gobind for forgiveness for implementing demonetisation in the country."" He also challenged Modi to declare how much black money the government has recovered after demonetisation. Peppered with questions about the bonhomie between the JDU and the BJP (read Nitish and Modi), Lalu flicked them away by saying ""it is a good thing"" and that the BJP should support the government in developmental works instead of mudslinging. Lalu also revealed that he had called up Akhilesh Yadav last evening and told the Uttar Pradesh chief minister: ""Enough is enough; you should meet your father (Mulayam Singh Yadav) to stop all this (the infighting). Akhilesh asserted that he was still with his father and had asked for just three months to officiate as Samajwadi Party (SP) president."" Lalu said he would call Mulayam tonight, and that SP leader Amar Singh ""should make efforts to bring Mulayam and Akhilesh together""."
58ff2b297be9e0413616325e,"Not modified, but  genetically 'edited' foods",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/590846/not-modified-genetically-edited-foods.html,2017-01-11,"Kenneth Chang, Jan 11, 2017, International New York Times 22:59 ISTA new generation of crops known as gene-edited rather than genetically modified is coming to the marketIn a few years, you could be eating the next generation of genetically altered foods  potatoes that do not turn brown or soybeans with a healthier mix of fatty acids.And you may have no idea that something is different, because there may be no mention on the labelling even after a law passed by the US Congress last year to disclose genetically modified ingredients takes effect.A new generation of crops known as gene-edited rather than genetically modified is coming to the market. Created through new tools that snip and tweak DNA at precise locations, they, at least for now, largely fall outside of current regulations. Unlike older methods of engineering genes, these techniques, like CRISPR, for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, have generally not been used to add genes from other organisms into the plants.The US Department of Agriculture has asked companies to advise it of their plans. But once the companies submit data to show the agency that the gene edits do not introduce foreign genes from plant pests into the crops, the agency is giving businesses the green light.Hundreds of acres of gene-edited crops have been grown in several states, unencumbered by oversight or regulations. And a few people have eaten them. This is not Frankenfood, said Andr Choulika, chief executive of Cellectis, one of the companies developing gene-edited crops.In October, Cellectis hosted a dinner at Benoit New York, the Alain Ducasse Manhattan restaurant, and served dishes made from its gene-edited soybeans and potatoes. Guests included professors, journalists and celebrities like Neil Patrick Harris, the actor. I dont even know what gene editing is, Harris said. I thought we were supposed to wear jeans.Calyxt, a subsidiary of Cellectis doing the gene-edited food, is also developing new versions of wheat including one with greater resistance to fungal diseases, another lower in carbohydrates and higher in dietary fibres.Other companies also developing gene-edited crops including DuPont Pioneer, which has used the technology for a new variety of waxy corn, used most commonly not for food but for starch in adhesives. Scientists at Pennsylvania State University have used CRISPR to create mushrooms that do not turn brown as quickly.The current regulations were written for the earlier generation of genetically modified organisms, where scientists used bacteria and viruses  typically from plant pests  to drop a payload of new genes into the nuclei of the plant cells where they merge with the plants DNA. That worked, but scientists could not control where the new genes would be inserted, and that led to worries of potentially dangerous genetic disruptions or crossbreeding with non-GMO crops.Companies like Calyxt have portrayed gene editing more like moving the cursor in a word processor to a particular location and making a small change to the text. Federal agencies have not yet said how they intend to regulate gene-edited foods, and the incoming Trump administration, while criticising overregulation in general, has not weighed in.Other parts of the world are also considering whether to regulate gene-edited foods and how to do so. In Europe, where many countries have banned the cultivation of GMOs, the European Commission has created a scientific panel to study the issue, with debate resuming this year.Choulika said the inspiration for the October gathering was a dinner more than two centuries earlier, by Antoine-Augustin Parmentier, a French scientist who was enthralled with potatoes brought to Europe from South America. But many Europeans scorned the potato. France even outlawed the growing of potatoes in 1748. Largely because of Parmentiers work, potatoes were declared to be safely edible in 1772, and the ban was lifted. Still, few wanted to eat them.In 1778, Parmentier organised the first in a series of lavish dinners for the high society of Paris, serving dishes all made with potatoes. Potatoes became a fixture in French cuisine. With farmers harvesting the first substantial plantings of the Cellectis gene-edited potatoes and soybeans last year, Choulika thought of throwing a modern version of Parmentiers gathering. This is the first dinner on Earth with gene-edited foods, Choulika said to the diners. Things that you eat today, millions of people are going to eat during the 21st century, and this will not stop.At the dinner, the soybeans were transformed into a several dishes. Carole Pourchet, director of the Lab, the research and development arm of Ducasses food enterprise, said the gene-edited soy cooked like normal soy, but the potatoes were a little drier, leading to the idea to fit them to retain moisture.The potatoes showed up in mashed potatoes and potato pie. The dinner was maybe potatoes cooked 10 ways, said Richard C Mulligan, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who was one of the guests. Choulika worked as a postdoctoral researcher in Mulligans laboratory two decades ago.Cattle without hornsFederico Tripodi, chief executive of the Calyxt subsidiary, said the company hoped the soybeans would be used in cooking oil for commercial and industrial use by 2018. The potatoes, edited to remain fresher longer and not produce carcinogens when fried, could be grown and sold in 2019. A second potato that is slower to turn brown just got word from the USDA that it, too, is not subject to regulation.Gene editing is not being used only with plants. A Minnesota company, Recombinetics, is editing the genes of farm animals  for example, creating cattle without horns. Critics warned that the industry was repeating the same mistakes of GMOs.Weve never been against any of this technology, said Michael Hansen, a senior staff scientist at Consumers Union. We dont say its inherently bad or these crops are inherently dangers. Its just they raise safety issues, and there should be required safety assessments.While the gene-editing templates match a specific sequence, it is possible that the same sequence occurs elsewhere in the genome or they will match similar sequences, and the DNA will be sliced in those places, too, with unknown consequences. They make it sound very exact, Hansen said. It will have off-target effects.Mulligan of Harvard said he was not sure that people would see much difference between gene-edited and genetically modified. The objection that people have is a more visceral and vague objection to messing with DNA, he said. Its hard to see that the public would see the difference. He admitted that he was more excited by the chef."

Sounds good?Chef Sathya, Hablis HotelI have been a chef for a year now. Previously I have worked in Le Meridian Chennai, London Hilton, Arbutus. My first job was in Le Meridian Chennai, which I got through campus, and my first-ever experience of cooking was when I took it up as a profession;I made a salad of tandoori, prawns and pineapple and garnished it with different peppers and lemonade sauces. When it comes to my favourites, I always prefer European food, particularly pork belly, beef burger and roasted salmon dish. I am a serious person when it comes to cooking and I am really focused!Spice or sweet; it doesnt really mater! What matters is the balance of taste. If there is one ingredient I cant live without, it would probably be potato, because when I was in London for long, we would eat lots of potatoes in different forms and it was part of our diet.Without potatoes, nothing works in the kitchen!(laughs) They contain starch and carbohydrates which is must in every meal. In Europe probably we either have mashed potatoes or baked potato and even boiled potatoes part of every meal.I have no specific person in mind that I want to cook for but to be specific, it would be a sportsperson and I will look at the preference of his taste, based on that, I will decide the menu and start cooking. If the person is a non-vegetarian I would go for braised lamb with potato, carrot puree, rice and hazelnut. If he is a vegetarian, probably something with cheese.Talking about experimenting with food, I do a lot and well, fusion is part of our job. For instance, we had lemongrass chicken cooked with Asian flavours, the combination was a success because of the different tastes and flavours that blend in together.Now settled in Chennai, I must confess that my food experience has been very minimal.

In the last kharif season, nearly 65,000 farmers had availed Rs 64 crore loan while during rabi crop, only 19,960 farmers availed crop loan of Rs 36.78 crore.The farmers of the district have not shown interest in getting their crops covered under the scheme mainly due to official apathy and lack of farmers account in cooperative banks. The farmers hesitate to open the accounts in cooperative banks with a contention that their earlier agri-loan arrears will be deducted from the PMFBY amount. While the insurance amount differs for every crop, lack of information on the scheme is also one of the reasons for the failure of the scheme in the district. The insurance scheme covers only four crops, including green gram, black gram, groundnuts and potato. While potato is covered in Kujang block, groundnut has been declared as notified crop for Balikuda and Nuagaon blocks in the district.In January 2016, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had launched the new scheme to minimise the burden of premiums on farmers who take loans for their cultivation and safeguard them against inclement weather. There will be a uniform premium of only 2 percent to be paid by farmers for all kharif crops and 1.5 percent for all rabi crops. In case of annual commercial and horticultural crops, the premium to be paid will be only 5 percent.Lead Bank Manager Anil Pattnaik said not a single farmer has availed the crop insurance under the scheme from cooperative banks in the district while 50 farmers have insured their crops of `30 lakh for the rabi season through UCO Bank. Meanwhile, the disbursement of crop loan through cooperative banks and Primary Agricultural Cooperative Credit Societies (PACCS) has been affected due to demonetisation as it is a cash-based transaction.Farmers leader Bansidhar Mohanty said due to lack of awareness and Government apathy, the disbursement of crop loans to farmers through PACCS and cooperative banks has been affected. Collector Yamini Sarangi expressed displeasure over the status of crop loan during rabi season and said steps have been taken to ensure the benefits under PMFBY in the next kharif season."

That was when the expressway came close to this Kannauj village , allowing vehicles to not just zoom past but come wheeling into the interiors.""Previously there were only a few tractors owned by one or two people. Others had to hire them for using on fields and sending their final produce to the market. Now there are more than 10 tractors and 80-90 motorbikes here,"" said Phool Singh. Singh's own one bigha land, which was acquired for the expressway, fetched him Rs 6,20,000. Three years ago, he had been offered just Rs 27,000 for the same land by another farmer, he claimed.Elsewhere, Shiva Rajput's white SUV is flanked by two buffaloes tied to a hook in his small courtyard. The SUV was bought from the compensation for his three bighas of field. The only one to have a four wheeler in the village, Shiva uses it not just for taking his family to cities that were once out of reach but rents it out to villagers. So the SUV doubles up as an ambulance in case of a medical emergency or a mini traveller for marriage parties. ""Not even the villagers thought there could be a four wheeler here. I let people use it at about Rs 500 for a trip,"" Shiva said.In a population of close to 2,000, fields of around 100 big and small farmers were acquired for the project. For farmer Rambir, it has become easier to take his potato produce to the market as he has his own tractor. ""I had to hire a tractor for at least Rs 250 per trip and I needed to make at least three trips,"" he said. ""I am also using the tractor for tilling my land which I did by hand previously,"" he added.According to farmers, owning their own tractors has come as a major relief. Previously, while they had to take their produce to markets in Bihar, Gorakhpur, Ballia, Lucknow, Varanasi and Kanpur on a rented tractor or through middlemen, it is now being done directly, helping them save up the extra cost."

People are flocking retail kite markets at Dabgarwad and Rander to buy kites and manja and other commodities to make Surti Undhiya and also a memorable event on Saturday.There was not much enthusiasm about the festival in the city for many days because of cash crunch brought about by the government's decision to demonetize high-value currency . Uttarayan is that time of the year when apartment terraces play host to memorable events that eventually help blossom love and friendships among people and hence is keenly awaited. The changed scenario has brought the smiles back on the face of the despondent shopkeepers.Prakash M, owner of Maharaj Kite and Manjawala, Bhagal, said, ""These few remaining hours of sale before the festival will save our business. The sale still will only be 70 per cent compared to that of last year.""Chintan Desai, a resident of Adajan, loves to buy kites and manja from Rander market.

He disrespected the party that gave him so much respect that they twice made him the Member of Parliament.Watch: Punjab Polls: Navjot Singh Sidhu Will Campaign For Congress, Says Captain Amarinder SinghNot only did he not bother attending the parliament, he does not have even one thing to his name that he did for the people of his constituency, she added.Kaur, who is the Member of Parliament from Bhatinda, also taunted Sidhu for his disloyalty towards the BJP.I think his loyalty is highlighted by the fact that he could neither be loyal to the party that made him the Member of Parliament, nor to the pradhaan or his Godfather who brought him to politics. A person, who cannot be loyal to his own and goes shopping for a post to see who can give him the biggest discount or the highest position, cannot be trusted, she said.Harsimrat added, One day, he is joining the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and when he is not declared as the CM candidate, he drops it like a hot potato and goes shopping to the next party.

He had his government at the state. It was a golden opportunity for him to serve the people. But I dont think his intention was ever to serve them, which is why he ran away when the opportunity arose, she said.Earlier in the day, the former BJP leader officially joined the Congress in the presence of party vice-president Rahul Gandhi.

Her clothes were found here. Express Photo by Gopal Kateshiya The trench in which the girl spent 34 days. Her clothes were found here. Express Photo by Gopal KateshiyaThe pit, partially shaded by babool trees and on the edge of a cotton farm, is lined with saris and other womens clothes, empty wrappers of potato wafers, snacks and biscuits, broken bangles, and tin sheets stripped from cans of edible oil and sticks which were used to cover the trench. Some distance away, visible from the pit, is a clearing in the fields, strewn with polythene bags of the kind used to pack illegal country liquor, and more clothes, as well as firewood, a blackened oil tin that may have been used to heat water, a toothbrush, and a toothpaste.It was in this pit  around 5 ft deep, 7 ft long and 4 ft wide  in a village in Morbi districts Wankaner taluka that a 15-year-old was kept confined for more than a month. If she stood up and craned her neck, she could see the clearing where she was taken to and allegedly raped most nights.Eight people have been arrested since the girl was rescued, including the 18-year-old accused of raping her and his father and other relatives. Last month, she underwent an abortion. On December 29, the girls family left their home and are now living by the roadside, claiming threats from the accused.The two families are neighbours and distant relatives from the same community, Devipujaks, who are mostly landless labourers. The girls family is better off of the two.Watch What Else Is Making NewsIn their defence, the accuseds family is calling it an affair gone wrong. In her statement, the girl has told police, Naresh forced himself on me inside the pit the same night that I was kidnapped. Later, he would pull me out of the pit at night, rape me and push me back in the pit before daybreak. He would tie my hands and legs, gag me and threaten me with a knife, asking me not to yell or to try escape.Before leaving, he would allegedly cover the pit with the tin sheets, leaving just a small gap for her to breathe.The eldest among six siblings, the girl has studied till Class VII and would help her parents till their 12-bigha land. Her mother says she dropped out since there werent many girls in her class.The girl says she had gone out of her home to relieve herself late on the night of November 10 when Naresh kidnapped her. She told police that eight men pushed her into a rickshaw, took her to the isolated farm taken on lease by Nareshs family, around 2 km away, and shoved her in the trench. Nareshs father, who usually drives a rickshaw, had taken the field on an annual lease of Rs 5,000 and planted cotton.The land belonging to the girls family is located close by. They searched for her for five days before registering a police complaint on November 25.A dupatta finally gave away the pit. Nareshs younger brother Pavlo spotted it in the field and told his father Jayanti it was mine. He knew I was missing. Naresh and Jayanti feared that being a child, Pavlo would spread the word. Therefore, they had no option but to inform my family that I was in their field, says the girl, her voice cracking.The date was December 13  34 days after she went missing  remembers her grandfather.Naresh was booked for kidnapping, rape, illegal confinement and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act as the victim is a minor. Police also arrested his elder brother Haresh, 20, father Jayanti, 45, uncles Chatur and Devkaran, and three other relatives, Avcharan, Chana and Kishor, after the girl said they had helped Naresh kidnap her. The clothes the girl was wearing on the day of her kidnapping were among the items seized from the pit.After a medical examination showed she was pregnant, the POCSO court allowed an abortion. Police have taken samples of the foetus and sent them for DNA tests.The grandfather says that due to the long confinement, the girl has suffered physically and mentally. When we rescued her, her eyes had sunk in. She was so gaunt She cant sleep well even now, she is afraid still, he says.The grandmother accuses the 18-year-olds family of being bootleggers prone to violence, and says they threatened to abduct two more girls of the family following the police case. We are terrified to go back to our village, she says. The family has handed over their land to a fellow villager to till, and has written to Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani seeking aid.While police took nine more people into preventive custody following the girls familys complaint of threats, they are out on bail.Morbi SP Jaypalsinh Rathore says they are ready to offer all help. There is a witness protection system. If the girls family approaches us, we shall provide them protection. But we are hearing about threats to them through the media.In his statement to police, Naresh has said he and the girl were involved in an affair for three years. On the night of the incident, she told me on the phone that she would die if I did not elope with her. I agreed.The 18-year-old, who was taking computer lessons in Rajkot after failing in his Class XII examinations, claims he had bought her a phone and it was through this that they stayed in touch.While the girls family denies this, and police say they have not recovered any such phone, Nareshs mother Radha shows a mobile with 2G connection, claiming it was the phone her son had given the girl. Radha says he confessed to her about the affair and gave the phone before his arrest.The girl was besotted with my son and that is why he failed his Class XII exam last year There is a bagful of love letters she wrote to my son, Radha says, showing a smart phone reportedly belonging to her son with photos of the two.She also questions the girls claim that she had gone out of her home to relieve herself when she was kidnapped. There is a toilet at her home. Why did she go out at night? The toilet is located adjacent to the girls house, and can only be accessed from outside.Nareshs sister Neeta claims the girls family was aware of their affair. The younger sister delivered her love letters to Naresh. Her aunt knew about the phone calls between them, she says.Radha adds that they too fear reprisal from the girls side as all the men in the family are now behind bars.However, she admits that none of it absolves Nareshs crime, and says they had no idea about it. For a month, he kept her in the trench and we all were in the dark.Naresh would spend the day at home and leave for our field in the evening, saying he would guard the crop against nilgai at night. Since we were all busy with the wedding of my elder son Haresh, nobody went to the field for weeks. His father went there two days after the wedding and found the girl there. Immediately, he called up her grandfather, Radha says.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

He predicts that the demonetisation will hit the economy quite drastically. In an interview with Suvojit Bagchi at his home in Santiniketan, which he visits every winter, Professor Sen spoke about the motives and impact of the move.Weve seen the primary impact of the demonetisation: long queues outside banks and shortage of cash. Now we are seeing the secondary impact, which is on the informal sector. Potato sowing in West Bengal is affected and some other businesses are collapsing. What could be the impact of all this?What you are calling the secondary impact shouldnt at all be surprising since the availability of money plays a very big part in facilitating business and trade. Particularly for small businesses (farming, for example), money is often used in the form of cash. In the long run, cashless transactions can perhaps be made into routine practice, through organisation and training, but that would take time. To act on the presumption of instant learning and institutionalisation is to place the hard-earned interests of many people without any connection to black money in serious risk.Most of what we now call cash is actually promissory notes, the emergence of which reflected a big advance over relying only on precious metals (like gold and silver). Promissory notes played a significant part in building up the financial backbone of industrial Europe. If in the 18th or 19th century, Britain had been demonetised suddenly, it would have devastated British industrial progress.Given the underdevelopment of electronic accounts and transactions, big parts of the economy are similarly vulnerable. For many, especially among the poor, making efficient and correct use of electronic payments and receipts would remain difficult to master and the possibility of losing ones money would be hard to avoid, especially given the shortage of infrastructure and the slowness of learning in using cashless transactions. The perplexing question is why some people  those who gave us demonetisation  did not foresee that this would happen and even more perplexing is how the promoters of demonetisation can be so blind even now to the overwhelming evidence of a crisis.Why has over 85 per cent of cash suddenly been taken out of circulation?The Government of India seems to have been caught in a confusion of purposes. Demonetisation has been seen both as a way of catching and eliminating black money, and as a way of moving towards a cashless economy. The former has gradually been replaced in the rhetoric of the government by the latter, which is not surprising as demonetisation can make only a very small contribution  at a huge social cost  to the black money problem. This is because only a very small proportion of black money (it is estimated to be 6 per cent or so, certainly less than 10 per cent) is in cash. Most black money is in the form of precious metals and other assets in foreign accounts. The inconvenience and loss imposed with no black money (workers earning wages; small businesses doing trade or production; people, even housewives, keeping small savings) are much more acute than any benefit from catching relatively small amounts of black money. There are going to be huge job losses too, and the recent reports by All India Manufacturers Organisation are beginning to show that serious job losses are already happening as a result of what Londons Financial Times has called a dramatic drop in business in the 34 days since Narendra Modi announced his plan to scrap 86 per cent of its banknotes.The unrealistic governmental expectation that the black money problem can be solved, or largely removed, by demonetisation soon became clear even to the government. Then the initially trumpeted objective of getting rid of black money through demonetisation was suddenly changed into a very different objective  to leap rapidly into a cashless society. However, for such a structural change, much more time is needed, and the draconian measures  penalties installed in the hope of catching black money  are particularly ill-suited. The result has been a combination of chaos and widespread suffering rather than an orderly transition to a cashless society.Do you think there are political reasons behind the demonetisation move? The elections are coming up, so that may have been one?I dont really know. Since economic reasoning could not have sensibly led to such a ham-handed policy, it is natural for people to suspect an explanation in terms of political advantages that the ruling parties were expecting to get. It has certainly given, at least for the time being, a great political image to the Prime Minister of being a huge fighter against corruption, even though the policy has done very little to achieve anything on that front.These 50 days of hardship will not take black assets out of the economy?How could it? Only a very small proportion of black money (around 6 per cent, certainly less than 10 per cent) is in cash. How can cleaning up of 10 per cent, at most, of black money clean it all up? Even that 10 per cent is a huge overestimate, since the black money dealers are much more skilled in overcoming official barriers than are normal honest people who are simply harassed  or made to lose their money  because of their lack of specialised skill in avoiding transaction barriers.If it is a bad policy, why do you think there havent been protests against demonetisation yet?The governments publicity surrounding this inept move has been very strong. People have been told again and again that if you are against demonetisation, you must be in favour of black money. This is a ridiculous analysis, but a readily exploitable political slogan. The persistent crisis created by demonetisation is only slowly becoming clear in terms of hard statistics as well as in public perception.The false perception of nobility and success can be held up through endless repetition of distorted facts and propaganda. The truth may ultimately prevail, but the government might be able to maintain the loyalty of a large part of the public for a long time, certainly until after the U.P. elections.It is worth remembering that the notorious Irish famines in the 1840s did not immediately cause serious public agitation against the government run from London. That happened only later  much later  but when it did happen, the understanding of blame had a huge long-run impact, making the Irish people deeply suspicious of everything that the government in London did.The false perception of nobility and success can be held up through endless repetition of distorted facts and propaganda"

And it is expected that controversial President-elect Donald Trump 's official swearing-in ceremony tomorrow is going to cause just as much furore. As he takes oath as America's 45th president, the glamour-packed event promises pomp and circumstance in the US capital like none other.The run-up to what will be one of the most watched events in recent times has seen a flurry of preparations  from top-of-the-art robust sound systems to stages, lighting, security screeners, warming tents, halls for the ball, draperies, floral arrangements and more. The celebrations are being organised around the theme 'Make America Great Again', which Trump used in his campaign. The show will kick off with the wreath-laying ceremony by Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence at the Arlington National Cemetery. Artists are set to perform on the footsteps of the Lincoln Memorial. Trump is also holding three inaugural balls (Obama had 10 of them at his first inaugural). His team also hopes to keep its parade to 90 minutes. The longest parade, with 73 bands and 59 floats, lasted more than four hours, at Dwight Eisenhower's first inauguration , in 1953.As per reports, Trump will be sworn-in as the 45th US President on January 20 using two Bibles, one that former President Abraham Lincoln used at his first inauguration. The other is his own, which dates back to his childhood, which his mother presented to him upon his graduation from Sunday Church Primary School at First Presbyterian Church, on Children's Day on June 12, 1955.The inauguration is clearly not going to be an average affair by any means, but one with as much glamour and hoopla that can be imagined. A report says Trump has raised a record $90 million to cover its astronomical costs, far more than President Barack Obama 's two inaugural committees.A sizeable chunk of the who's who is not going to be seen at the inauguration. As per reports, key performers have stayed away, allegedly for their own reasons or from fear of a backlash from fans. Elton John has declined. ""He will not be performing,"" affirmed his publicist. Just a month ago, John said in an interview that the prospect of a Trump presidency made him ""fear for the world."" Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli is also not performing. County singer Garth Brooks affirmed he won't be there as ""scheduling conflict kept him from performing"". David Foster, producer and 16-time Grammy winner, says he ""politely and respectfully declined,"" too. Welsh singer-songwriter Charlotte Church says she was invited to perform, but she responded on Twitter to Trump, saying. ""A simple Internet search would show I think you're a tyrant.""Massive protests are being organised all over the country against Trump. In New York, Mark Ruffalo , Alec Baldwin and Michael Moore have organised a guys' march. Scarlett Johansson , Julianne Moore, Katy Perry , Debra Messing, Frances McDormand and Amy Schumer are expected to be in a women's march. Reports say tens of thousands are also readying to hit the streets of Washington DC during his inaugural week, to show their opposition to the newly-elected president.As per a menu released by the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies, the traditional luncheon  for Donald Trump, Mike Pence, their families, congressional leadership, members of the Supreme Court and future Cabinet secretaries  will be a three-course meal of lobster and shrimp with a saffron sauce and peanut crumble, a second course of meat with dark chocolate, juniper jus and potato gratin, chocolate souffle and cherry vanilla ice cream.Trump inauguration souvenirs are being sold in the run-up to the big day. Stores in Washington are cashing in on the drama and selling everything from Trump-chocolate bars, to baseball hats, buttons, mugs, calendars and more.He may now hold the majority vote, but Donald Trump is said to have one big lesson to learn from outgoing US President Barack Obama. British behavioural expert Judi James says Trump needs to learn to cry so as to show a warmer side to him. ""If he could squeeze one tear out during his inauguration on Friday, people will turn around quite quickly their feelings towards him. Clearly, he is going to go swanning out there with his alpha male feathers strutting, but if at the right moment he could squeeze out a tear it would have an amazing effect on people,"" said the author. Obama has shown his emotional side over numerous occasions and has wept at least 10 times on camera.The Inauguration ceremony will begin on the west front of the Capitol with musical performances. Sixteen-year-old soprano Jackie Evancho will be singing thenational anthem. The Rockettes dance troupe will also perform.Opening remarks, followed by religious leaders offering the invocation and readings. Pence will be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas.Trump will recite the oath of office using Abraham Lincoln's inauguration Bible, as well as the one that his mother gave to him at his Sunday School graduation. He will then deliver his inaugural address.Ceremony ends. As per tradition, Trump and Pence will attend the Congressional Lunch in the Capitol.Inaugural parade. The new President and Vice-President make their way 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometres) along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House , with bands, members of all US military branches, etc.Trump, Pence and their wives will make appearances at three official inaugural balls, two of which will be held at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center and the other, at the National Building Museum."

But if you are going for Goan traditional food, which the pub claims is their speciality, hit the main course first, I would say.The plain rice served with salad and pickle along with Goan Prawns Curry was delicious. The curry was rich and creamy and the Thai-based vegetable curry was a delight. Made in coconut milk gravy, it tasted sweet and looked richer than its non-vegetarian counterpart.We tried a couple of starters along with some cocktails. The Fiery Crispy Potato had the crispy wedges glazed with hot and spicy red sauce. Cooked in oriental style with bell peppers and onions, the starter looked colourful and bright against the dim lighting of the restaurant. The sauce and bell peppers made it very spicy and reminds one of masala fries.The description for the Bollywood Crackers in the menu reads crispy, crunchy, cheesyrest is a secret. But the rest in this case turned out to be a disappointing. The round patties were crunchy and cheesy, but also sour and oily. You may not enjoy this one unless you are a cheese lover.The Chicken Cafreal is served with pav. Cooked in Goan style with coriander and mint flavour, giving it a green tinge. It lacks the said flavours. The meat was a little hard and did not look appetising.The Spicy Prawns in Port Wine was better than the other starters. Do not go by its look. It does not look interesting but tastes better compared to the rest. Simmered in butter, port wine and crushed red pepper, the prawns were served, topped with chilli flakes. It had a strong flavour of vinegar and tasted sweet and sour.The cocktails lacked alcohol punch. The Watermelon basil is said to be well balanced drink to cool you down with a refreshing mix ginger, basil and vodka but you could barely feel the kick, making it just like a juice. The Lemon Drop is suggested as a tangy refreshing vodka cocktail with a burst of fresh lemon. Well, you feel the burst of fresh lemon, making it taste more like a fresh lime juice, rather than a cocktail.It lacks the alcohol punch. The Lusty Chocolate has a consistency of melted chocolate and icecream. The menu reads this sweet version made of vodka, chocolate syrup, baileys and fresh cream is so sophisticated in taste that you dont want to share. It reads true, you wouldnt really like to share, not because it is a sophisticated drink but the mix of milk, cream and alcohol was not soothing. To be safe with the choice, you can go for Mai Tai or the Orange Blossom. The Orange Blossom is a vodka-based tangy and refreshing drink.Among desserts, Bebinca, a Goan dessert is a good choice. The pudding, made with flour, sugar, egg yolk and coconut, is served with a scoop of Vanilla ice cream, topped with chocolate sauce. You can feel the sugar syrup lingering in your mouth. Definitely my favourite pick from the dinner night."

(REUTERS Photo)US President Donald Trump has thanked his defeated Democratic rival Hillary Clinton and former president Bill Clinton for attending his inauguration saying he was honoured by their presence, and urged the attendees to give them a standing ovation. At a Congressional luncheon held in his honour at the US Capitol soon after his inauguration, Trump said he was honoured by their presence.Ill tell you, there is something that I wanted to say because I was very honoured, very, very honoured when I heard that President Bill Clinton and Secretary Hillary Clinton were coming today and I think its appropriate to say and Id like you to stand up, Trump said.In fact when Trump entered the room, he went out of his way to walk across the room to shake hands with Hillary, and said to her loudly, Thank you for being here. Clinton was among the more popular guests as people lined up to talk with her and in some cases get photos.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAnd honestly, theres nothing more I can say because I have a lot of respect for those two people, Trump said.So thank you for being here and were going to have four great years hopefully of peace and prosperity and well be working very, very hard, he added.The 69-year-old former senator and secretary of state was defeated by Trump in November 8 elections.Earlier during the luncheon, 70-year-old Trump and First Lady Melania Trump were presented with gifts from the Congress.For the 8th consecutive Inauguration, Lenox Corporation created the official Inaugural gifts from the American people, given to the new President and Vice President of the US.Trump and Vice President Michael Pence were presented with custom-made, one-of-a-kind engraved crystal vases. The Presidential crystal bowl shows an image of the White House on one side overlooking the Jefferson Memorial on the opposite side. The Vice Presidential crystal bowl depicts the US Capitol building overlooking the Lincoln Memorial on the other side.Each bowl has a compass rose cut into the base with the points of the compass aligned correctly with the buildings etched into the crystal. The bowls are made of lead crystal and are 12 inches across, and will be placed on top of black cherry wood bases that bear an inscription of the date and occasion engraved into silver plaques. Presenting the gift to the First Lady, Senator Roy Blunt said the glass for it came from Slovenia.The other unique thing for the first lady and her parents that would never have been such an important thing before; the glass came from Slovenia, he said amidst applause.Blunt is Chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies.The designer thought that the blest glass in the world for this particular design, which he began to work on last summer was glass from Slovenia, maybe he knew something that none of us quite knew for sure at that time, he said amidst laughter.In his remarks, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the new President has surmounted formidable challenge getting to this moment.He has been underestimated often. But he never let it stop him from succeeding, he said.We are wishing him similar success as he turns to the charge of governing. We face many challenges, but weve been challenged before and emerged stronger. We live in changing times, yes, but some things endure and we celebrate one of them today, McConnell said.This inauguration is a reminder of our common story as Americans, and on this most uniquely American of occasions, I ask you to stand and join me in raising a glass. Mr President, may you find every success in the years ahead, may you unite our country behind a common vision, he said.We come to this sacred inauguration day united and respect for our Democracy and determined to make a difference in the lives of hardworking Americans, said Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader in the US House of Representatives.She presented one of the flags that flew above the Capitol today to Pence. The Joint Congressional Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies has been hosting this traditional lunch at least since 1953 with President Eisenhower.In 1981, President Reagans first inauguration, the lunch took its current form and moved to this grand hall, the National Statuary Hall, which served until 1857 as the chamber of the House of Representatives, Blunt said.Another recent addition is that of Norman Borlaug, the leader of Indian Green Revolution.The lunch was largely attended by members of Congress leaders, chairmen and ranking members of committees and random lucky ducks; cabinet members and key incoming staff members of the White House, Supreme Court Justices, Trump family members. Former presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton and Bush did not attend. On the menu were Maine Lobster and Gulf Shrimp in Saffron Sauce and Peanut Crumble; Angus Beef with Dark Chocolate and Juniper Jus and Potato Gratin, followed by Chocolate Souffl Cherry Vanilla.

""The recent example before us is the heavy losses suffered by farmers of potato and pea crops due to demonetisation,"" said Virsa Singh , who owns seven acres, while addressing a gathering at Bachiwind village on Saturday.The farmers are of the view that if there was an MSP for potatoes and peas, they would have not suffered any losses since the government was bound to purchase their produce at a fixed rate, but the situation was other way round. ""Peas were sold for Rs 15-20 per kg last year, but now they are sold for Rs 4-6 a kilo. Many farmers ploughed the crop in fields only,"" said BASC general secretary Rattan Singh Randhawa.Anup Singh, a farmer who had lost wheat and basmati crop due to bad weather, said elections were the only time when people gave a patient hearing to them. ""I am telling everyone that I will vote only if a party will fix the MSP of fruits and vegetables, and implement recommendations of Swaminathan Commission ,"" he said.A farmer who had just returned from a rally by the Congress, Gurveer Singh, said that on the night of January 20, he led a delegation of farmers to meet the assembly candidates of the Congress, SAD and AAP and talked to them about their issues. ""I am really confused; everyone of them promised to accept our demands if voted to power, but I don't know who to believe,"" he said."

(FIle | AP)WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump on Tuesday revived two blocked pipeline projects as he signaled his determination to unpick existing environmental legislation.Trump gave an amber light to the Keystone XL pipeline -- which would carry deposits from Canadian tar sands to US refineries on the Gulf Coast -- and an equally controversial pipeline crossing in North Dakota.Both had been put on hold by president Barack Obama's administration on environmental grounds.Since being sworn in on Friday Trump has begun rolling out an orthodox conservative agenda, despite a campaign often being out of kilter with Republican party ideology.He has moved to curb funding for abortions, embraced Israel, frozen government hiring and now sought to unwind environmental legislation.But he has also bucked orthodoxy and sought to put his nationalist and populist print on policy, especially on the economy and trade.True to his claim to be a hard-charging dealmaker, Trump said both pipeline projects would only be built subject to renegotiated terms and conditions.""It is subject to a renegotiation of terms, by us,"" Trump said. ""We are going to renegotiate some of the terms and, if they like, we'll see if we can get that pipeline built.""- Made in USA -The freshly minted president indicated that one possible focus could be who makes the actual piping.In a separate executive order issued Tuesday, Trump decreed that pipes should be American made -- echoing his ""America First"" doctrine.""I am very insistent that if we are going to build pipelines in the United States the pipes should be made in the United States,"" Trump said.""We want to build the pipe, put a lot of steel workers back to work.""Most, although not all, oil pipelines buried underground and made of carbon steel.Obama had rejected a permit from Calgary-based firm TransCanada to build the 1,179-mile (1,900 kilometer) Alberta-Nebraska section of the project.Environmentalists have assailed the project, arguing that the Alberta deposits produce some of the ""dirtiest"" crude in the world.The Canadian government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has cautiously supported the plan, seeing it as a means of boosting business.But Canada's liberal leader has also helped wage the international charge against climate change.Ahead of Trump's announcement, natural resources minister James Carr said the move would be ""very positive for Canada,"" creating 4,500 construction jobs.""We believe that it's a good project for both Canada and the United states and we're very hopeful.""- Dakota chill -The Dakota Access Pipeline is more of a political hot potato in the United States.Native Americans and their supporters strongly protested against the project, prompting the US Army Corps of engineers -- which has approval authority -- to nix the plans under the Obama administration.Thousands had camped in freezing winter temperatures to block the oleoduct's planned route.The Standing Rock Sioux Tribe is concerned about potential water pollution, saying the pipeline's route endangers areas with sacred historic artifacts.The standoff -- which included some 2,000 military veterans who joined the protest -- prompted violent clashes with law enforcement as well as sympathetic demonstrations nationwide.But Trump has supported the 1,172-mile (1,886-kilometer) oil pipeline, which would snake through four US states."

Singhvis association with the animal rights activists in this case, thus, became a political hot potato for the party unit in Tamil Nadu, leading to open criticism.Jallikattu is a Tamil tradition, and it is the basic right of people here. Those who are against it are our enemies, Tamil Nadu Youth Congress State general secretary, Mohan Kumaramangalam, told Express, condemning Singhvis decision to appear in the case.We urge Singhvi to not appear in the court in this case. If he thinks his profession as a lawyer is more important, then he should resign his Rajya Sabha seat and also from the Congress party. If he appears against jallikattu, we will protest against him, Kumaramangalam added.Following this, TNCC president S Thirunavukkarasar took up the matter with the party high command, urging the leadership not to permit Singhvi to appear in the case.On Wednesday, a battery of lawyers led by Singhvi filed a petition in the Supreme Court challenging the jallikattu bill. The plea was filed on behalf of the Animal Welfare Board of India, Compassion Unlimited Plus Action and other animal rights activists. It termed the amendment a fraud on the Constitution and a violation of a 2014 Supreme Court judgment. The case is now slated to come up for hearing on Monday."

They believe it will put a resurgent Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Bihar on the mat and throw a hot potato at the Modi-led Centre while widening RJDs acceptance levels among Bihars masses.Lalu Yadav wants a vigorous public campaign for special state status for Bihar. State finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui has set the stage for it, said an RJD leader, referring to the demands raised by Siddiqui at the pre-budget meeting of state finance ministers in Delhi earlier this month.The call for special category state status was made by JD(U) when it ruled the state in alliance with the BJP. They put tremendous pressure on the UPA-II Central government then. Dozens of rallies on the issue addressed by Nitish Kumar and a statewide signature campaign helped JD(U) consolidate its position among the masses in Bihar.RJD, which was then an ally of the Congress-led Centre and the main Opposition party in Bihar, had not been keen on the issue. But now, with it being the biggest party in Bihars grand alliance and the Centre having a BJP government, Lalu is serious about leading the call for special status.We have demanded funding by the Centre for Bihars rapid growth. PM Narendra Modi had announced an economic package of `1.25 lakh crore ahead of the Assembly elections in October-November 2015. But Central funds aid remains inadequate, said Siddiqui.RJD leaders know that JD(U), whose support for demonetisation created differences in the ruling alliance, will support the special category state.Some RJD leaders describe the partys plans to lead a public campaign as stealing JD(U)s thunder. The two parties still do not see eye to eye on many issues and engage in subtle one-upmanships.Special category state status is a very legitimate demand of Bihar and the Centre cannot escape any longer, said RJD legislator Bhai Birendra."

Trump did not contradict May as they stood together and answered journalists questions in the White House East Room. May also took a tougher stance on sanctions against Russia.When asked how close the U.S. is to lifting penalties that were imposed on Russia after its incursion into Ukraine, Trump said it was very early to be talking about that. May said sanctions should remain until a 2015 cease-fire agreement for Ukraine is fully implemented.Trump has been less critical of Russia and its leader, President Vladimir Putin, than his predecessor and some lawmakers, including fellow Republicans.

If it does not, the revenue from the power will continue to provide more income to an emboldened Taliban.Drug tradeThe Taliban have long tapped into Afghanistans lucrative drug trade and illegal mining, in addition to the streams of donations they receive from supporters abroad, mainly in the Persian Gulf states. But in the past two years, they have found new ways of diversifying and collecting revenue, according to interviews with officials, Taliban commanders and local residents.The diversification of the revenue collection system has raised fears that the balance of the war could tilt even further in the year ahead, and that the insurgency is becoming more entrenched and acting as a shadow government in parts of the countryside.What it suggests, essentially, is that the group is becoming more efficient in systematically taxing the areas they either control or have a lot of influence on, said Timor Sharan, senior analyst for Afghanistan at the International Crisis Group, a research institute. Efficiency of taxation is quite significant in terms of sustaining the group for a long time.In addition to collecting electricity bills from thousands of homes in provinces such as Kunduz and Helmand, the insurgents levy taxes on potato harvests, flour mills, teachers salaries, marriage ceremonies, and fuel and vegetable trucks crossing their checkpoints.At the same time, the Taliban continue to pursue their original sources of funding. The United Nations, in a recent report, said narcotics, illegal mining and external donations remained major income streams, with the drug economy bringing in up to $400 million in 2016.

The fair, which started on Thursday, will continue till February 9.There is a huge demand for turmeric, cinnamon, cardamom, cereals like mandia and varieties of pulses. Even a kind of potato grown in interior districts is a hit among the city folks, said Lalita Pradhan, a tribal woman from Kandhamal. She has been coming to the fair for the last 15 years.Besides, products like badis, a dried and preserved food made from black gram, from Keonjhar district, turmeric from Phulbani and Rayagada, honey, fumigant and tamarind paste from Mayurbhanj, pulses and cereals like black gram, kendula, mustard, cumin seed, cinnamon and a large variety of rice are also quite popular in the fair.

A tomato vendor waits for customers at Urma in Purulia. Picture by Mita Roy Farmer Balaram Kisku, who has cultivated around 100 quintals of tomato in Purulia in November-December, has been feeding a part of his produce to cattle instead of letting it rot in the fields. Agriculture department officials said the demand for tomato was all the more hit because people in eastern India can do without the fruit-vegetable in the kitchen, unlike potato or onion. According to the officials, around 1,000 tomato farmers had been hit in Purulia and Bankura. ""I sold tomato at Rs 20 a kg between October and November. The demand started falling in the middle of November and with it, the price too came down. The situation has come to such a pass that I am being forced to sell a bucket of tomato (around 20-22kg) for only Rs 10 to the wholesalers,"" said Kisku, a resident of Hatinada village on the Ayodhya hills. The vegetable trade has been hit hard in rural Bengal, where wholesalers depend on cash and digital transactions are still a hard nut to crack. ""The cash crunch has left vegetable farmers in serious trouble. The situation is worse for tomato growers because people can do without tomato for days. If people have cash, they would rather spend on potato than tomato,"" an agriculture department official said. In Purulia and Bankura, farmers usually grow tomato between October and March. Officials said the dry climate in the two districts and the hilly terrain are conducive to growing tomato. In the last season, about 3,000 tonnes of tomato had been supplied to various parts of the country from Purulia and Bankura. But this time, the demand has plunged several notches. Ramesh Pandit, a Dhanbad-based tomato wholesaler who owns a warehouse in Purulia's Balarampur, said around 150 quintals of the fruit-vegetable were lying unsold with him. Sources in the agriculture department said a good production this time had added to the trouble of tomato wholesalers in Bengal, which has very few multipurpose cold storage and processing units."

While farmers appear anguished that much of the promises made by the BJP during the 2014 polls remained unfulfilled, the chief minister seem to be beating the anti-incumbency factor, as locals claimed that Yadav has turned Agra into Paris.Even while the long drawn out family feud within the Yadav clan continues to command the attention of the people on the lines of a never ending television serial, the state chief minister seems to be gaining the support. Akhilesh Yadav has taken the right step to take control of the party. Mulayam Singh Yadav should have passed the baton to avoid the family drama. Akhilesh Yadav has done a lot of good works for the state. There is no anti-incumbency factor against him, said Rajesh Pachauri of Bakalpur village in Mathura.Even while the BSP supremo Mayawati had faced the CBI probe in the Taj corridor project, the chief minister seems getting the credit for its completion. With carved and lighted red-sandstone pillars dotting the Taj corridor in Agra, the stretch has become a major tourist attraction. Akhilesh Yadav has turned Agra into Paris. You may just go and take a look, said Rohit Singh, who added that the inner ring road in the city along with the promises of airport and Metro have endeared the chief minister closer to the people in Agra.Even while Agra had traditionally been a BSP bastion, the SP is making spirited attempt to make inroads into the area. The prospects of the SP had apparently taken a hit after the sudden demise of its nominee Chandrasen Taplu. However, his wife Mamata Taplu, who is now the SP candidate from Agra Cantonment, after winding off campaigning late evening, told EXPRESS that people in the city are rallying behind the chief minister due to his development credentials. He is a youth with a clean image. The chief minister has fulfilled all promises that he had made for Agra. My husband had also done a lot of developmental works, said Mamata Taplu.While Akhilesh Yadav is drumming up support for completion of road projects and welfare schemes, the BJP is facing anger of the farmers. Farmers sowed pulses in the hope of better prices. But once the crop matured, the prices crashed. Similarly, the potato farmers could not recover even half the input cost, said Ajay Singh, a farmer in Sikandara.Having won the political battle against his uncle Shivpal Singh Yadav, people on the ground claimed that the chief minister could not be blamed for poor law and order situations in the state. People are well aware that there were bad elements who did not allow the chief minister to function independently for most parts of his tenure. Now that those elements are out of the party, Akhilesh Yadav has come out clean and stronger. The Muslims will back him in this elections, said Gani Mohammed, a retired teacher, in Agra."

In western suburbs, truckloads of onions are brought for sale. Six kg of onions are sold for Rs. 100.Wholesale traders said there had been a 20 per cent increase in the price of locally grown vegetables in the past few days. But, the cost of some vegetables such as potato and carrot remain stable.Green peas and broad beans are popular choices as they are priced in the range ofRs. 20 and Rs. 25 in the wholesale market.Normally, prices go up in December and drop after Pongal.This time, prices of vegetables remained low due to demonetisation. Drought in other places has influenced the price now. The vegetable market receives only 350 loads of produce against its normal share of 400 truckloads daily.P. Sukumar, joint secretary of Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market Merchants Association, said normally, it takes two months for fresh harvest of vegetables.The cost of locally grown vegetables received from areas in the radius of 100 km may slightly dip by mid-February.But, the severity of drought and summer may have an impact on the prices of vegetable in the coming months. There are chances for the prices to escalate by 50 per cent in April if there is not enough rainfall, he said.Vegetable crops were destroyed during cyclone, particularly in Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram"
5904680a7be9e04154df67a9,Budget For Railways: Focus on safety and basics is welcome,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/talkingturkey/budget-for-railways-focus-on-safety-and-basics-is-welcome/,2017-02-01,"For the first time in the history of independent India, finance minister Arun Jaitley incorporated the Rail Budget within his Union Budget presentation for 2017-18. Although he clarified that the railways will continue to enjoy functional autonomy, the merger of the two budgets brings to an end an outdated tradition. True, the mass-mover deserves special attention given its role as a fundamental pillar of the countrys economy. However, its also a fact that the practice of having a separate Rail Budget had created much scope for politicking. As a result, for decades we were witness to the bizarre exercise of the rail minister announcing new trains with an eye on political calculations, even though the railways was bleeding financially.The net effect was the creation of a vast railway network that wasnt profitable  hiking railway fares being a political hot potato that no government wanted to deal with. Predictably, our railway infrastructure began to crumble with poor maintenance and slow pace of upgradation. Add to this babudom and bureaucratic red tape, and its easy to see why the railways is in its current lacklustre state.Given this background, the need of the hour today is to overhaul our railway infrastructure and get the basics right. We need better rail coaches, better track maintenance, better customer services and better safety. All of this simply cant be achieved if the railways is treated as government largess to be used for political gains. In that sense, its certainly welcome that the independent Rail Budget has been done away with.That said, what did Budget 2017-18 have in store for the railways? First, it announced an 8.3% higher budgetary allocation for the sector at Rs 1,31,000 crore which includes budget support of Rs 55,000 crore. Second, it announced the creation of a Rail Safety Fund with a corpus of Rs 1 lakh crore over a period of five years  an important decision considering recent rail accidents. Third, as many as 500 rail stations will be made differently-abled-friendly by providing lifts and escalators. Fourth, by 2019 all coaches are to be fitted with bio-toilets. Fifth, unmanned railway level crossings are to be eliminated by 2020. Sixth, steps will be taken to launch dedicated trains for pilgrimage and tourism. And seventh, service charge on rail tickets booked through IRCTC will be withdrawn.Many of these proposals are rudimentary and should have been done a long time ago. But thats precisely the point  in the pursuit of populism successive governments have failed to implement the basics for the railways. We are far behind a country like China which not only has an excellent railway network but has also used this as an economic force multiplier to boost manufacturing and exports. In fact, Chinese proficiency in railway technology and building is now a crucial part of Beijings transnational connectivity projects under its Silk Road Economic Belt. The latter will see Chinese trains and Chinese-build/sponsored railway tracks transport goods all the way from China to Europe.Hence, its welcome that the 2017-18 Union Budget keeps the focus on basics in the railways rather than headline-making bullet trains. For, it is only by upgrading the basics that the railways can achieve its true potential as an economic force multiplier and not a burden on government. It is now up to government to implement its announced proposals in an efficient manner and drive the railways into the 21st century."

593ba70f7be9e0066b6f5d0e,Bihar wish-list for Mr Jaitley,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170201/jsp/bihar/story_133304.jsp,2017-02-01,"What does Bihar expect for itself when Arun Jaitley rises to present the budget on Wednesday? Before every budget, there is hope in states that specific doles would be offered to them. But the Union budget is not for any particular state. Its for all the states. However, if funds are increased for departments, Bihar will also benefit, remarked former state finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi even as the current finance minister Abdul Bari Siddiqui expressed the hope that Bihar would be given major concessions. The Telegraph finds out what the wish-list of some key sectors is. ROADPromises and more promises but precious little has been done. The Centre has failed to fulfil the promises made to the state regarding the road sector despite repeated meetings. Union minister in charge of roads, Nitin Gadkari, had promised that Bihar would get Rs 50,000 crore for road projects, which did not take off. The state sent a proposal of upgrading 3,600km of roads to national highways; in response, the union ministry agreed to upgrade just 13 state highways covering a total of 910km. Promises made by the Centre to construct 53 road over bridges too have not been fulfilled. Several national highways are in need of urgent repair. All that the Centre has approved is a new link between Sahibganj bypass in Jharkhand to Manihari bypass in Bihar, including four-lane bridges over the Ganga, and Rs 1,742.01 crore for the rehabilitation of Patnas Gandhi Setu. Bihar road construction minister Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said: The promises made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on spending Rs 55000 crore on roads in Bihar are yet to be met. I hope that in this budget, the state gets the funds to repair the national highways and the amount he had promised. RAILWAYThe state expects funds for ongoing projects and betterment in passenger services. Money is required for ongoing projects which include an electric loco manufacturing unit at Madehpura, a wagon workshop at Garhara in Begusarai, a workshop at Jamalpur, and a rail bogie factory at Dalmianagar. ECR officials said a request for capacity augmentation has been sent to the railways for a coach maintenance workshop at Harnaut. Bihar Daily Passengers Association secretary Shoaib Quraishi said: The railways need to work on issues like safety of passengers, punctuality of trains, confirmed berths, improvement in on-board services and emphasis on the cleanliness inside trains and station premises. We are expecting that the railway will also work on improving the quality of food. HEALTHHealth experts are hoping that the total expenditure on the healthcare sector will increase. As per the last budget, the total expenditure for health was only 1.62 per cent of the whole budget out of which the National Health Mission had a share of less than one per cent. We are expecting an increase in the total expenditure on the healthcare sector this time. Increasing the budgetary allocation of the National Health Mission would give a boost to healthcare. The finance ministry should also focus on human resource. In 2015, the National Rural Health Mission had recommended formation of a special empowerment recruitment cell in states where there has been a delay in the recruitment of manpower in hospitals. There is a huge scarcity of doctors in state-run hospitals because the Bihar government had failed to fill vacancies in government hospitals, said Dr Ranjit Kumar, general secretary of Bihar Health Services Association. Sunil Kumar Singh, a member of the governing body of Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences, said the government should waive customs duty on high-end instruments that are being imported. This will ensure availability of high-end equipment in all hospitals. Besides, subsidies and incentives should be provided to the pharma industries for initiating research work. This will help in creation of new medicines of the same molecule and will ultimately bring down prices of medicines, said Singh. INDUSTRYThe focus of the government is on sectors like leather, textile, food processing to expedite industrial development and job creation. Industrialist Satyajit Singh said the finance minister should focus on increasing domestic consumption, public and private investment, exports and job creation. We feel the Union government should bring down corporate tax to a maximum 25 per cent from the current levels. The rebate on interest paid on housing loan should be increased from Rs 2 lakh to Rs 3.5 lakh, as it would boost the demand in the real estate sector and make a positive impact on fiscal sentiments. The GST peak rate should be limited to 20% and the focus should be on developing micro, small and medium enterprises, Singh said. AGRICULTUREAround 80% of Bihars population depends on agriculture and allied activities for a living, but the sector contributes only 25% of the gross state domestic product (GSDP). Progressive farmer and chairman of the marketing wing of Nalanda Organic Vegetable Grower Federation, Rakesh Kumar, said it was time agriculture and horticulture were made profitable ventures, else people would be forced to leave farming. A minimum support price (MSP) should be declared for potato and onion to provide fiscal protection to farmers. Data show that the price of potato and onion has been almost static over the last 20 years, while cost of inputs like fertiliser and pesticide has multiplied several times. The Union budget should declare MSP for potato and onion and provision free electricity for farmers, Rakesh said. TOURISMBihar lacks basic infrastructure in attracting more tourists despite having the potential. Though the flow of tourists to Bihar has increased manifold but soon after their arrival, tourists start thinking about their return. It is due to the lack of proper communication linkage and infrastructure, said an official of the tourism department. Bihar is well known for its heritage sites like Bodh Gaya, Rajgir, Nalanda and Vaishali, besides, historical sites linked with Jainism. But sadly these sites are just that  well known. We hope the budget provides some budgetary incentives to bring these tourist sites on a par with other popular tourist destinations of the country. Again, with certain other measures like converting Bodh Gaya into an international religious city with access without visa (based on passport of respective country) would go a long way in making it an international spiritual destination, the official said. There is still a shortage of budget hotel rooms. The government should make one, two, and three star hotels a priority, because hotel owners do not patronise building budget hotels as they think they wont make any money. The government should come forward and take initiative, the official said. REAL ESTATEThe realty sector has pinned high hopes on the budget with experts hoping to get industry status for housing sector. Sachin Chandra, honorary secretary, Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI)Bihar, said: The housing sector has not yet been given the status of industry because of which finance from banks is costlier right now. Once it gets the industry status, loans would become cheaper as well as it will be easily available giving a boost to the realty sector. Also, he added, the government should increase the interest limit on housing loan exemption from the current Rs 2 lakh to either Rs 2.5 lakh or Rs 3 lakh. CIVIL AVIATIONBihar hopes the budget will allocate funds for the modernisation of Patna airport, which has seen a surge in air traffic over the past few years. Passenger flow at the city airport increased from 14.5% in 2014-15 to 32.4% in 2015-16 necessitating the much needed expansion of the airport. We are expecting the budgetary allocation of Rs 500 crore to be used for the first phase of expansion work to be carried out with regard to the construction of the terminal building along with other operational requirements, said Patna airport director Rajendra Singh Lahauria."

Initially, the transplantation process had slowed down in the district due to severe cold, which affected the growth of the seedlings.As per reports, paddy seedlings have been transplanted in 4,687 hectares of land till January 27 against the target of 14,635 hectares for the current rabi season. Generally, paddy transplantation picks up from the first week of January during rabi season. But, stunted growth of the seedlings led farmers to put the transplantation on hold and wait for the sapling to attain the right size. However, the transplantation has gained momentum from the third week of January after the seedlings gained right growth.Umesh Mishra, a farmer of Satupali village under Dhankauda block, said, The severe cold badly affected the growth of paddy seedlings. But as temperature rose, the seedlings attained maturity for transplantation. Though every year he starts paddy transplantation in the first week of January, this season he did it from January 20, he added.District Agricultural Strategy Committee (DASC) has set a target to cultivate paddy in 14,635 hectares with a production target of 87,810 tonne during the rabi season. Till January 27, maize has already been cultivated in 365 hectares against the target of 401 hectares while wheat has been grown in 81 hectares against the target of 125 hectares. Similarly, pulses including moong, biri, kulthi, cow pea, field pea and gram have been cultivated in 12,299 hectares against the target of 15,527 hectares.Besides, oilseeds, including groundnut, sesame, mustard, castor and sunflower have been cultivated in 9,677 hectares against the target of 11,637 hectares. This apart, cultivation of vegetable, including potato and onion, has already been done in 14,604 hectares against the target of 17,676 hectares. Moreover, cultivation of condiments, including chilli, garlic and coriander has surpassed the target. The condiments have been grown over 7,067 hectares against the target of 6,750 hectares.Deputy Director of Agriculture, Sambalpur, Pradosh Kumar Samal admitted that the weather conditions were adverse for proper growth of paddy seedlings. However, he said things have improved and transplantation is underway in full swing across the district. He hoped that the transplantation would be completed by February 15."

58ff1c877be9e041361628f2,"Thanks to note ban, farm sector may not see 'acche din'",http://www.deccanherald.com/content/594489/thanks-note-ban-farm-sector.html,2017-02-02,"Sagar Kulkarni, Feb 3, 2017, DHNS 8:48 ISTDateline: New DelhiDays after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced scrapping of high value currency notes, Agriculture Ministry officials were eagerly awaiting the details about sowing for rabi crops across the country. The government was facing all round criticism for having announced the note ban at a time when the agriculture sector was witnessing an upswing on the back of a better monsoon after two consecutive drought years.The sudden withdrawal of legal tender of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 currency notes had left the farmers devoid of any cash to buy seeds or fertilisers. But as the figures trickled in, there was a sense of cheer as the sowing operations appeared unaffected.Up to November 11, rabi sowing was completed on 14.6 million hectare area  5.7% lower than normal crop coverage and the gap declined steadily. During the week ending January 20, 2017 sown area under rabi crops was 628.34 lakh hectares, which was 6.07% more than last year's acreage of 592.36 lakh hectares.Agriculture Minister Radhamohan Singh has been issuing statements on how demonetisation had not affected rabi sowing to counter the campaign by opposition leaders on note-ban leading to agrarian distress.Experts have been sceptical about the government's gung-ho approach vis-a-vis the rabi sowing numbers, particularly the comparison with the previous year's acreage which was low because of severe drought. Though the government speaks glowingly about demonetisation not affecting farm activity, the numbers tell a different story. According to the data released by the Agriculture Ministry, rabi sowing in 2013-14 had touched 670 lakh hectares and leading to a bumper harvest of 263 million tonnes.Economist Pronab Sen was categorical. Rabi sowing looks big on the small base of last year, he said. Sen, India's first chief statistician, also said the government could have pushed for implementation of demonetisation in January this year as the seven-week gap would have helped farmers make purchases of seeds and fertilisers for sowing of the winter crop.According to Sen, delaying note ban by a few weeks would have helped farmers sell their kharif crop, prices of which had already fallen drastically on account of good harvest. The wholesale markets, which usually deal in cash, had a tough time lifting the farm produce and the maximum impact was felt by those dealing in fruits and vegetables.Farmers in Punjab and Uttar Pradesh dumped their potato crop on the roads in Ambala and Lucknow, respectively, as they had no cash to pay for transportation of the farm produce to wholesale markets. In Gujarat's Surat, farmers threw vegetables and milk on the streets as they had no access to cash after the government kept out the district central cooperative banks out of the demonetisation process.Prices of fruits and vegetables dropped in wholesale markets post-demonetisation as did the market arrivals. Prices of banana, apple, tomato, cabbage were lower in the range of 4% to 9% in November when compared with the rates in October, making it clear that farmers were affected to some extent.Government analysts say that the prices of tomatoes crashed in December because of glut in the market due to bumper crop. But they admit that it would be difficult to ascertain how much fall was because of the glut and how much due to disruption due to demonetisation.Cash crunch in rural areas had turned acute as the cooperative banks as well as primary cooperative credit societies too were kept out of cash exchange affecting purchase of quality seeds and fertilisers by farmers.There were reports about slowdown in farm activity such as timely spraying of pesticides or application of fertiliser for want of labour. Many farmers were unable to make cash payments to farm labourers who were forced to return to their home towns. Cotton trade nosedived as mills were unable to make cash payments to farmers who supply bales.Quiet acceptanceThere is quiet acceptance of this fact within the government circles as productivity may take a hit this year. Also, farmers have bought far less amount of fertilisers this rabi season when compared with the previous two drought years. One set of estimates peg the sale of fertilisers to be nearly 7.5% lower than the previous year.This means that despite high acreage achieved during the sowing phase may not reflect in the farm output this rabi season. According to a study by Ramesh Chand, Member, Niti Aayog, a 1% increase/decrease in fertiliser use result in 0.1% increase/decrease in agriculture GDP and about 0.14% increase/decrease in crop output.If the current trend in the shortfall in fertiliser consumption continued till the end of the rabi season, it could lead to a more than 1% decline in production. As a result, the rate of growth in farmers income is also expected to dip due to the drop, though Chand still pegs it at 5.8% in real terms for 2016-17.Indias farm sector was looking set for some good times after two consecutive drought years that had slowed down growth and even witnessed a contraction of 0.2% in 2014-15. The normal monsoon had cheered the farmers who had reaped a better kharif harvest and were keen to follow up with even better returns in the winter crop cycle.Ratings agencies had forecast 4% growth for 2016-17 over the previous year which was certainly brighter given the meagre growth in the past couple of years. The sector had barely witnessed growth since 2011. In 2012-13, the farm sector grew by 1.5%, followed by 4.2% in 2013-14, -0.2% in 2014-15 and 1.2% in 2015-16. At a time when things were looking up, the demonetisation decision has pushed the long desired achhe din for agriculture in the realm of uncertainty."
58f57bcf7be9e01a357a188b,Budget balm for sectors hit hard by notebandi,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/budget-balm-for-sectors-hit-hard-by-notebandi/articleshow/56926605.cms,2017-02-02,"Finance minister Arun Jaitley 's budget speech is itself an ad mission of what demonetisation has done to the country's informal sector, the middle economy and the daily wage earners.While discounting Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee 's blistering attack against PM Modi on demonetisation in public, Jaitley has touched upon some of the concerns expressed by the opposition over sectors -MSME, salaried class, district cooperative banks and farmers -hit hard by the notebandi. The total budgetary outlay showing an 8% increase compared to 2016-17 and the 11% increase last year (compared to the year before that) is also an indication that the common man will have to wait for some more months to come out of the effects of demonetisation.A case in point is the MSME sector. Mamata has been crying foul over the plight of this sector that accounts for 25% of the GDP. This happens to be the mainstay of Bengal's industry . The finance minister has lowered the effective tax on units with Rs 50-crore turnover in this sector. He has also promised credit guarantee to SME loans, raising the cap from Rs 1 crore to Rs 2 crore. However, for this, the MSME transactions have to go digital before they can get access to credit. A study by the Naitional Institute of Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP), New Delhi, indicates that the demand for credit would be low post demonetisation.Next comes investment in the rural sector. Even as the agriculture ministry has been claiming that the all-India acreage figures didn't show any dip post demonetisation, ground reports from Tarakeswar, Burdwan reveal that potato acreage has suffered because the district cooperative banks didn't get enough money to disburse as loans. The finance minister has provided for a Nabard corpus of Rs 20,000 crore to finance district cooperative banks and societies so that farmers get bet ter access to loans. And in a very limited scale, Jaitley has given a tax relief of Rs 1,000 a month for the sa laried middle class who bore the pains of demonetisation for days.Chances are that the small relief may not be enough to tackle the rise in indirect tax after the Centre rolls out GST.Third, there's hardly any takeaway for the rural poor in Bengal. In a state where a total 24,250 villages don't have any bank branch, it will be a tough task for the MGNREGS workers, or those under other schemes, to avail of the direct cash transfers. ""Look at what women got from this Budget. It's even less than the allocations the Mamata government has made for Kanyashree. Worse, from now, respective states have to co-fund the railway projects,"" said Trinamool Rajya Sabha leader Derek O'Brien. CPM state secretary Surjya Kanta Mishra sees little chance of public spending in the state's infrastructure projects. ""Budgetary allocations for capital expenditure during the last financial was 1.86% of the GDP . This time, including railways, it's 1.84%. There has been a contraction in capital expenditure,"" Mishra said."

The Election Commission, would, however, dismiss such a poetic conceit when it comes to allotting poll symbols to candidates on the grounds that too close a similarity in such graphics could confuse voters. Even as the dust has settled after the Samajwadi Partys internal fracas, which led to a dispute as to who was the true claimant of its cycle symbol, an aandhi of what might be called political trade mark wars has swept through UP.The state is fielding a record number of independent candidates, which has caused the already hard-worked EC to burn the midnight oil in the course of finding suitably dissimilar poll symbols for all of them. Still, some of the pictorial representations that the EC has come up with might well leave many in a daze of decipherment.For instance, the coconut, which is traditionally used in religious ceremonies, might be deemed to be auspicious by many, but some could also interpret it to mean that the allottee will find the upcoming contest a tough nut to crack. Similarly, the symbol of a cot could prove ambiguous, conveying to voters that the candidate in question could either make all their dreams come true or merely sleep on the job.Though a candidate who has been assigned a TV set as his electoral chhaap seems pleased as punch, saying TV is an appealing sign. It broadcasts messages, the message that voters might receive could be that the contestant might turn out to be a do-nothing couch potato more interested in the idiot box than the ballot box.Considering that the object in question is often used as a missile to denote displeasure, the symbol of a chappal could be construed as an augury of a flip-flop show, if not a flop show. Or, on the other foot, it could suggest someone possessed of down-to-earth humility who is prepared to tread the strait and narrow.The hypodermic needle could also convey ambivalence, either being viewed as a depiction that the contestant will give the body politic a much-needed shot in the arm and is exactly what the doctor ordered, or that after the hustings the candidate will prove to be as elusive and hard to find as the proverbial needle in a haystack.The harmonium might strike the right chord with voters, or it could just as easily be taken to mean that itll make the electorate face the music. Some might find the air-conditioner really cool, though others could get het up about it, particularly if theyve endured long power outages.Symbolic logic has its pitfalls as revealed by the cautionary tale of the party which, in an area of low literacy, put up posters showing its sign with the mark of approval superimposed upon it. When it lost by a landslide, it discovered that all the voters had dutifully followed instructions and stamped the palms of their own hands, instead of the Hand on the ballot sheet."

The details of that long journey are now hazy but Sharma's legacy, roughly 160-odd years later, is still edible. The deep-fried pooris that the UP villager served up in a corner of 19th-century Fort still form the daily bread for the sixth generation of his descendants.Pancham Puriwala, the famous puri-bhaji cafe on Perin Neriman street, near the GPO, traces its origins to the humble diner that Sharma set up in the late 1840s. Now managed by brothers Sandeep, Anupam, and Akshay , the restaurant retains a lowkey ambience, with its marble tiles and perforated steel seats. There is still no air-conditioning. "" ACs would invite taxes,"" says Anupam Sharma. Worse, it might encourage customers to linger. ""Ours is a khao-aur-khisko joint.""Amid an explosion of new cafes, the eatery's cheap and filling traditional fare continues to pack the tables, drawing both taxi driver and bank manager. A plate of five thick pooris (pancham means five in Hindi) and dry potato sabzi that used to cost four annas in the late 1800s today costs Rs 35. For Rs 60 to Rs 140 a thali, you can also sample modern takes such as masala pooris (infused with urad dal), green pooris (made of spinach) and the popular potato-pumpkin sabzi. ""Our USP is our authentic North Indian taste,"" says Anupam, who eats at the restaurant most nights.Anupam recalls the stories told by his grandfather Badriprasad Sharma , whose garlanded portrait hangs in the restaurant. When Pancham Sharma first came to the city , Perin Nariman street was known as Bazar Gate Street or simply `Bazar Gate' and had no street lights. Pointing to the office of DCP Zone I opposite the eatery, Anupam says the building ""was where petty criminals like ticketless travellers and drunkards used to be locked up."" Nearby is a peepal tree that Anupam says was planted by his great-grandfather, Mangal Singh Sharma.In fact, city historian Deepak Rao says that before 1857, there was a pond facing Pancham Puriwala called Gibbet's pond -locally known as Phansi Talao  which was a popular spot for public executions. In the Sharma household, legend has it that ""large crowds would gather to witness executions and afterwards they would drop in to eat puri-bhaji,"" says Anupam.In the 1960s and '70s, famous folks like music director Khayyam, actor Rajesh Khanna and former politician George Fernandes would grab a bite here. In those years, the Sharmas also briefly ran a sweet shop called Pancham Dugdhalay nearby .Lately there have been some nostalgic visitors. An old customer who moved to Seattle brought his son to the eatery just as his father did before him. And a British couple who were regulars before Independence revisited the restaurant recently . No wonder the late columnist Busybee, aka Behram Contractor once wrote that the eatery should be put on the heritage list.Still, the restaurant is slowly adapting to changing times (with annual margins as high as 30 percent, there seems to be no rush.) In recent years, the menu has been expanded, the interiors revamped, and deliveries started in the Fort area. And now demonetisation -which ate into 15 per cent of business  might force Pancham Puriwala into a revolutionary upgrade. ""We are planning to get a card swipe machine,"" says Anupam."

Instead, they promised KCR a one-on-one with the Prime Minister and an all-party meeting after March 8, once the final phase of election in Uttar Pradesh is over.To placate KCR, the BJP leadership also assured favourable announcements for Telangana from finance minister Arun Jaitley during the budget session.The day-long negotiations ended in positive note with KCR agreeing to visit Delhi and meet several Union ministers. The CMO confirmed that KCR is leaving by 8pm for New Delhi on Sunday . Speaking to TOI, TRS MP B Vinod said, ""There will be a meeting with Prime Minister Modi, for which time and date is not yet confirmed.

With drought and water scarcity affecting agriculture , the going hasn't been easy. Working in the fields fetched them Rs 150 a day. Money was always short.Around 10 women, in their 20s and 30s, recently came together and founded 'ShivParvati' self-help group by registering it with Shri Kshetra Dharmasthala Rural Development Program (SKRDP). The idea was to supplement their income and cut down on the mounting debts. Prabhakar Naik , a resource person from SKRDP, encouraged the women to form a group and start small savings. But the women had to pinch and scrape to save even Rs 50 from their daily wages.Naik saw that Khanapur had large swathes growing sweet potato. But the farmers growing sweet potato were not doing well as the government has not fixed even a minimum support price for this vegetable. ""My job is to empower women by creating jobs for them and improve their livelihood. I thought of a part-time job for these women so that they can earn some extra money and improve their livelihood,"" says Naik.Naik advised this group to try making snacks from sweet potato and sell them.Says Ashwini Rajput, a member of this group, ""We gave it a shot and started making snacks from sweet potato. We started selling a 100 gm packet for Rs 20. Well, it clicked surprising us too. We have been getting a good response and now we have also started taking bulk orders.""The women even recently bought a small potato cutting machine for Rs 5,000 from the money they managed to save. Every evening after a hard day in the fields, the group gathers at one of the members' houses to prepare the snacks. Tulsa Chougule, another member, says that while eight of the women are involved in preparing the snacks, two of them market it. The profit earned is distributed equally among all, she adds."

'What might be people in places that are conflict-inflicted, war prone or do not have enough food surviving on?' Her thoughts led her towards a new project named Starvation Cookbook, a series of recipes that aren't like anything you might ever get to taste, unless thrown into a situation of extreme living conditions. Karolina, who was recently at Kochi Biennale , staged her performance 'Hunger is/isn't an object,' documenting 14 instances of extreme starvation from across the world.Bread baked out of bark flour, cookies from mud, potato peels, black sugar, grass and water mixed with petrol, jelly made from carpenter's glue, water and salt soup eaten by residents in Syria... the taste of all these dishes are unique, as they represent hunger. 'Their purpose is not nourishment, but survival. And, a lot of people on famine belts and warzones in our world survive on them on a daily basis,"" says Karolina.Ask her what prompted her into taking up such a project and she says, ''Probably my interest in cooking. This thought struck me especially at a time when I was going through a phase in which I wasn't happy enjoying the space of an artist. I found respite in cooking, and exploring various recipes. On one such day, a thought about people who are famished, especially in areas where hunger is artificially created through wars and conflicts, struck me and I began my research on it. Starvation Cookbook is the result of the same,"" she says.According to her, what makes all human being equal is the fact that we have to consume our daily share of food for survival. An empty plate can reflect problems around the world quite well, she says. ""My project explores the condition of extreme hunger, the political or economic reasons for it and the survival mechanisms and sustenance measures adopted by local communities. It is something you can find everywhere. For example, if you go to a fancy Indian restaurant in London, you might find the most top quality dish  but the country would definitely have some unique recipes which the poor there would have been surviving on, for years together. For instance, take the case of kanji  which is quite tasty for a change and helped many in Bengal and Kerala survive at hard times,"" she says.With Starvation Cookbook, Karolina hopes to reveal the bitter differences between the taste of war, collectivization and inflation. ''It will get us closer to a notion of what the 'world food' really means,'' she signs off."

Makeshift steps with wooden slats were lowered but to no avail. Food had to be sent down, and a bucket with water lowered.Keeping a watchTwo persons were posted to keep an eye on her. Sometime in the night, when the cloak of darkness had settled on everything around, she came out.On Tuesday, zoo staff decided to let her munch fruits inside. Steps are being built inside the enclosure to the moat so that they can move up and down easily, he says.With Kohima, there were no such unanticipated situations. When let out first, he took his time exploring the enclosure and even climbed up a tree. I let him out when I come in the morning. I also take him some fruits to eat. He remains there till food arrives around noon, and then its back inside, says Radhakrishnan Nair.Food includes watermelon, pumpkin, pineapple, boiled eggs, and rice. Sweet potato that was a staple for them in Nagaland is yet to be given, as it is not available here always.But there is honey to make up for it. Apple, grapes, and banana too are given. And then there is some punch too  watermelon pieces in blocks of ice. If the ice isnt too hard, they keep going at it till the ice breaks and they can gorge on the melons, says Radhakrishnan Nair. There is medicine too  for worms.The daily outings will continue till the bears are deemed fit enough to be released into the enclosure permanently.Since they are in the growing phase, they need lots of exercise. They cannot be kept inside much longer since their stomachs have started sagging, says zoo veterinarian Jacob Alexander.The animals are doing fine, their initial stress as good as gone, Dr. Alexander says. The minor injury on Dimapurs paws has healed, he says.Just before Kohima climbed up the ledge in his enclosure with a piece of pumpkin to nibble, Radhakrishnan Nair let the bear lick some honey from his fingers. But he would not try that with Dimapur who loves baring her teeth. She puts out her paws so that she can grab us, and even sloshes drinking water at us, he says, smiling."

58f5f054a3d24b0b70c264eb,"In potato town, a mash of livelihood and caste matters",http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/In-potato-town-a-mash-of-livelihood-and-caste-matters/article17280533.ece,2017-02-10,": It is a little past noon and scores of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers wearing saffron caps have gathered at Hariyali Bazaar, a defunct farmers complex, to attend the partys Vidhan Sabha workers meeting. As they wait for the arrival of their leader, Subrat Pathak, a prominent businessman with interests in the ittar (perfume) industry and potato storage, the karyakarta s (workers) list their grievances against the Samajwadi Party leaders in the constituency.If the SP promoted the sale of illicit liquor, encouraged bribery and neglected the districts cottage industries, it was also accused of land grabbing, hooliganism and promoting Yadavvad  a reference to the partys alleged favouritism to the Yadav caste. The reserved seat, Kannauj Sadar, falls under the Lok Sabha constituency of Dimple Yadav, wife of Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav. The incumbent MLA, Anil Dohre, is from the SP, making it a prestige seat for the ruling clan.The MP [Dimple Yadav] comes here thrice in five years, and then too meets only a select few from her coterie, not the common people. The MLA is also missing, BJP Kannauj vice-president Vikram Tripathi says.Apart from these criticisms, there is one issue every BJP worker at the meeting refers to: the communal violence that erupted in the densely populated locality of Lakhan Tiraha during the Durga Puja procession in October 2015. Two people were killed in the violence, which led to a curfew. Some BJP leaders were arrested or named in the FIR. Pathak was himself accused of instigating the violence.Memories of violenceThe BJP claims the SP (Samajwadi Party) government falsely implicated its leaders to appease Muslims and that they would protest the injustice meted out to them for speaking up for Hindus. Innocent people were implicated in the case while the main accused are patronised by the SP. We will raise a fight against this injustice, Mr. Pathak told The Hindu , as he arrived to take the stage. In 2014, he lost the Lok Sabha polls by fewer than 20,000 votes against Dimple Yadav.The BJP is relying on inciting the memory of that incident. Though locals make passing references to the communal incident, as one travels across the constituency, there is little resonance for it among the people. Everything is peaceful today. It is not an issue, says Rohit Joshi, a sweet shop owner who lives in the heart of the troubled area.The issues more relevant to this seat appear to be development, caste polarisation  mostly targeted against the Yadavs  and the impact of demonetisation. If the SP is relying on holding on to its support based on the goodwill earned by the Yadav family, development work and privileged treatment received by the constituency under Akhilesh Yadav, the BJP is hoping for an anti-Yadav polarisation among the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) and the upper castes, and for Mr. Modis appeal to pull it through.The BSP is hopeful that the search for better law and order would push voters, including Brahmins, towards it, so that its core Dalit vote gets supplemented, and that it makes a dent among the Muslims.No single issueThere is, however, no singular issue that might affect voting. Demonetisation has upset the districts famous potato farming sector  20 varieties of the tuber are grown here. But its bearing on voting is hard to ascertain.Hansi Devi, member of the Kashyap OBC caste, is collecting red potatoes from her field. She complains that the produce on her 13 bighas of land post-demonetisation was halved  the harvest falling from 80 sacks to 40 a bigha. There was not enough cash to buy seeds and urea. So is she waiting to teach the BJP a lesson? Not really. She rejects both Ms. Mayawati (She does not listen to anybody and works for her caste.) and Mr. Akhilesh Yadav (Under the SP, we face the dadagiri of Yadavs.)A few feet away, a fellow caste member, young Ram Kashyap, a farm labourer, has different views.  Notebandi has crippled us. Akhilesh Yadav is the best for farmers. The farmer wants electricity and water supply  he has given it all. If farmers have money, we get paid, Mr. Kashyap says.Traders bore the brunt of demonetisation. Many of the 110 cold storages here were forced to throw open their potatoes to rot as traders had no money to purchase them. It felt like we were punished for a sin, says Nurul Hasan Siddiqui, who suffered losses of Rs. 12 lakh.Siddiquis community, along with the Yadavs, is the fulcrum of the SPs support here. By and large, Muslims across the belt continued to express faith in the cycle, but there were a few differing voices. Significantly, Siddiqui, a former SP district head, is one among them. He is unhappy that Akhilesh Yadav overthrew his father Mulayam and promoted political novices among Muslims to shield his failures.The SP has won Kannauj for the last three terms. The BJP won the previous three before that  1991, 1993 and 1996."
590467a67be9e04154df66ee,What does Swachh Bharat tell us about ourselves?,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/second-thoughts/what-does-swachh-bharat-tell-us-about-ourselves/,2017-02-10,"Since coming to power in 2014, one of the most prominent initiatives of the NDA government is the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan. Prime Minister Modi has personally invested his energies in the initiative and continues to be its face. Celebrities have joined the campaign, the media support has been widespread, and even the new currency notes carry the Swachh Bharat motif. In terms of visibility, outreach and sheer simplicity, it is unparalleled. Perhaps demonetization might give it a fair run, but demonetization is exceedingly complex and unlikely to endure in public imagination once the cash becomes easily available. The idea in essence is quite simple  that we ought to keep our surroundings clean. But shouldnt that be quite obvious? Should it not boggle the mind that the Prime Minister of the largest democracy must tell its people to do what they should be doing anyway?Bharat or India is basically not swachh. All of us have grown up seeing garbage littered in our public places, streets, railway or bus stations, hospitals, riverfronts, sea beaches, footpaths, gardens and so on. Empty plastic water bottles dot the countryside. The stench from open sewers is suffocating. It is quite normal for someone to buy a pack of potato chips or pan masala and throw the wrappers anywhere. The absence of civic consciousness is breath taking.So what is it about Swachh Bharat Abhiyan that touches the chord in all of us? It has less to do with actual litter than what it symbolizes. We want to claim the public spaces as our own. The litter invades our sense of ownership even if it is only partial, and the litter-thrower is an unmerited imposition on the turf that does not solely belong to him. The litter violates our sense of propriety.Surprisingly though, most people do not litter. Very few people cause most of the problem. At a recent handicraft fair, I counted 14 instances of littering over a 30 minute span as I sat sipping tea, while an estimated 400-500 people walked by  giving the number of litterers at about three percent. This resonates with the well-known problem of free-riding tendency. Recall your student days when you had to work on group projects. Invariably, one or two members turned up to be free riders. They did no work whatsoever, and the rest had to all the work. And even though the rest were in a majority, they could not prevent the free riding behaviour. Game theory tells us that groups are generally unable to police themselves. They are powerless against free riding behaviours, and require an external authority to bring the lawless to order. In the context of Swachh Bharat, the external authority is the apparatus of the organized state.Therefore, Swachh Bharat is not just about the physical litter. It symbolizes the failure of the self-policing by the groups amidst a weak or an absentee state. The lack of civic consciousness is only a symptom of an unfinished contract between the citizen and the modern state. Our long cultural memory still dates back to royals and kings, living in splendid opulence, sporting Rolls Royces, and utterly incompetent and unconcerned about the public. We are yet to forget that memory and figure out what we can fairly expect from the modern kings.An unfinished contract means that the state remains weak or absent. A weak state implies that we get locked into a million prisoners dilemmas with fellow citizens, leading to enormous under-performance. The Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is actually an opportunity to repair the contract between the citizen and the state, where each can levy fair expectations on the other and obtain mutually reinforcing positive gains.When Gandhiji returned from South Africa, one of the first things he did was to pick up a broom and start cleaning public places. How right he was!"

Growers are saying that post-demonetisation, there has been no rise in price and buyers dwindled, too. Even a couple of years back, potatoes used to be sold at Rs 3,000-4,000 per quintal.Watch What Else is Making NewsSo, growers are demanding government help to export potatoes and get a good price. Punjab is expecting a production of over 2.2 million tonnes whereas it has the capacity to store around 16 lakh tonnes in the nearly 500 cold stores. But the old crop, lying in the cold stores, needs to be cleared first.Middle-East and Russia always prefer our potatoes. But farmers alone cannot do anything as government support is required post-demonetisation, said Jalandhar Potato Growers Association (JPGA) general secretary JS Sangha.Small farmers said they cannot even afford to keep potatoes in cold storage which costs more than the price of the crop.At mandis, we are forced to sell potatoes for Rs 3 per kilo while in the retail market, it is Rs 9-10 per kg, said Jagtar Singh, another farmer, from Jandhusinga village.Sangha said keeping potatoes in cold stores is a burden on big farmers, too, as the rate of the crop is less than the cost of keeping it in cold stores.Demonetisation was announced during the sowing season and several traders left without buying the seed which is the best in the country, said Sangha, adding, A large amount of our potato seeds went to waste as buyers from other states had no money.There is a huge demand for potatoes in Russia and Middle-East but farmers alone cannot do anything, said JPGA president Raghbir Singh.We have exported potatoes at Rs 900-1,000 per ql to Russia a couple of years ago on our own. Now, if the government helps us to sell potatoes in Russia and Middle-East, then government and potato growers can earn four times more than at present, said Sangha. By sea, it takes three-four weeks to send potatoes to Russia and the government should arrange for export via Pakistan as it will reach there much early, but no heed is being paid to that, he added.For all the latest Cities News, download Indian Express App"
58f6cb917be9e031f13bbf23,UP polls: Note ban dents BJP in urban pockets,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/agra/up-polls-note-ban-dents-bjp-in-urban-pockets/articleshow/57106597.cms,2017-02-12,"AGRA: Demonetisation, farmer distress and poor living conditions notwithstanding, people of Agra are hopeful. And if the 'silent voter' does, indeed, exist, her voice may only be heard when the election voting machines beep in agreement with their choices.In Agra's nine assembly constituencies, it's hard to predict the electoral verdict. It is, however, almost certain that the BJP that is the chief challenger in almost every constituency in the district. And while some are vocal in their support, many are open in voicing their dissent. A Dalit farmer in Agra Rural reserved constituency, Govind Singh said, ""In 2014, we voted for Modi ji in the hope of seeing our fortunes rise. This time, though, I will not vote for him. That's because he did nothing for the farmer. In fact, with demonetisation, he hurt us badly.""Singh might have gone on about how the farmers are now looking for alternatives in the Rashtriya Lok Dal, the Samajwadi Party and the Bahujan Samaj Party but for the arrival of Chaudhary Phool Singh, an upper caste Jat. Singh arrives with a pack of young strongmen from the village. And from this point onwards, the Jats outshout the Dalits, and the conversation turns in favour of the BJP The Dalit now fall silent.In faraway Etmadpur, the opposite end of the Agra district, the Yadav voter is similarly silenced by the dominant Thakur voices in Barhan village. Here, the upper caste voters are divided in their support for BJP and the local BSP candidate Dharam Pal, who enjoys considerable goodwill in the constituency. Etmadpur is a traditional BSP seat where the BJP is usually never a contender. When former village head Shyambabu Tyagi alleges the incumbent UP government led by chief minister Akhilesh Yadav has done nothing to ease the farmer distress in the potato belt, Pappu Yadav, a corner tea stall owner, says he received a cheque of Rs 750 when he lost his crops to a severe drought two years ago. Soon after, Yadav is surrounded by a group of naysayers in the village. Outshouted and outnumbered, he falls into an embarrassed silence. A local stringer, a bystander to the debate, says: ""Oonchi jaat waley bolne nahi dete. Waise yahan BSP jeetegi kyonki candidate accha hai. Lekin hum pe pressure hai (BJP se)...thoda help karneki.""If the BJP's traditional support in urban pockets is eroding, the saffron party is making up by making inroads into the rural terrains where it has not usually held sway. Though there is a dent in popularity in the BJP graph in comparison to the Lok Sabha polls in 2014, people are still hoping that the promise of ""acche din"" will bear fruit, especially if the BJP wins Uttar Pradesh. ""Agar aloo ke daam girte hain, to Modi ji ki kya galti hai? Yahan to aloo ke kisan hames ha hi pareshaan rehire hain,"" says Ajay Pal Singh, insisting that demonetisation has had no impact of farmers' fortunes."

We were ruined by the note ban, he said.Demonetisation also impacted the small local industries that depend heavily on cash transactions to pay wages of the labour procured locally. Traders were also adversely hit.Big industries did not experience the pain... the smaller ones were badly hit, said Rajesh Gupta, a trader in Lakhimpur-Kheri district."

Swaminathan has said that climate change demands anticipatory action from scientists and policymakers.Mr. Swaminathan was speaking at a consultation on climate change and food security on Monday at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, of which he is founder. It was part of a project, called Clima Adapt, which is being supported by the Norwegian Embassy in India. The programme was also attended by Jon Georg Dale, Norways Minister for Agriculture and Food.In his speech, Mr. Swaminathan described how temperature, precipitation and sea level rise affects agriculture. We have made a study that showed that, as a result of higher temperature, the duration of wheat crop in the Punjab will go down by one week....This will bring down the wheat production in the country which will go down by 5-6 million tonnes, he said.Alternate farmingMr. Swaminathan said that rising temperatures will necessitate alternate methods of growing potato. We grow 50 million tonnes of potato; 30 years ago, we grew five million tonnes. How did this sudden potato revolution take place? It was because of a method developed for sweet potato production during what we call aphid-free-season. Now, when the temperature goes up, the aphid-free-season will be gone, he said.Minister Dale, who began by noting that Chennai has the same population as Norway, said that such projects are a win-win for both countries. The experience from such projects have been used in several projects in Asia and Africa, he said.The Minister said that MSSRFs work on sea water farming was of particular interest to his country. We are committed to a policy approach which sees water and water-related ecosystems are protected and managed sustainably, he said, repeating a G20 pledge.The Norwegian minister also hoped to an end to the Syrian conflict. Syria is important for this world. We hope that Syria, at the end of this horrible war, can resume agricultural production, he said.He said that agricultural policy will be affected by climate change. We must adapt food production and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from the agriculture sector....Agriculture must, as far as possible, take its share of (greenhouse gas) reduction, he said. Mr. Dale concluded by quoting Mr. Swaminathan: If agriculture goes wrong, nothing can go right."

Though BSP ruled in Uttar Pradesh and made some mistakes, my respect for her is intact"".This had prompted BJP to dub BSP as a hidden partner of Congress-Samajwadi Party.""They cannot win this race as BJP, which is running on two legs, will pip them to the post,"" Modi told the rally today.On the state of affairs in Uttar Pradesh, Modi said the abbreviation of UP may be read as ""up"", but everything is ""down"" in the state.""The only thing up in UP is corruption, law and order, riots, atrocities on women, unemployment, poverty, mortality rate of mother and child, migration...and Akhilesh says 'kaam bolta hai' (work speaks)...it is not kaam but karname (misdeeds) which are speaking for him,"" Modi said.Claiming that the Centre has taken important steps for the welfare of farmers, the Prime Minister said his party has promised in its manifesto that onion and potato will be bought at Minimum Support Price and will not allow the potato growers to die.""BJP manifesto promises loan waiver of small farmers...As an MP from the state, I promise that it will be my responsibility that this promise is fulfilled in the first meeting of the BJP government,"" said Modi, who represents Varanasi constituency in the Lok Sabha.Addressing the gathering in this region having a large number of potato growers, Modi said in the last (Lok Sabha) elections the ""bahu"" (Dimple Yadav) of Samajwadi Party had promised to set up chips-making unit here which did not come through, but she won the poll.""Will you not seek a reply from her or not,"" the Prime Minister asked in his typical question-answer style of establishing direct rapport with the public.""The SP government (in UP) is anti-poor,"" he said, adding that while he himself as no home or vehicle of his own, SP leaders have large fleets of vehicles.""What kind of samajwad (socialism) is this? It is nothing but betrayal of poor. Scams are being reported even in orphanages in UP,"" Modi said.He contended that central assistance for foodgrains was not reaching the poor in UP as the state government was not interested in accepting it.He also took a dig at Rahul Gandhi saying, ""the Congress leader seeking vote from you is not aware that potato is grown in the field and not in factory...He (Rahul) took out a kisan yatra and talked about setting up potato factory.""Claiming that people of the country have hailed note ban, he said this is proved by BJP's victories in Panchayat polls in Odisha, Municipal elections in Chandigarh and Gujarat and Vidhan Parishad poll in UP.Congratulating ISRO scientists, he said they have hit a century by launching a record 104 satellites at one go.Modi also cited the decision of his government to slash prices for coronary stents for heart patients.""The stents will be sold at Rs 8,000 against Rs 45,000 earlier. Congress had failed to revise the prices for years,"" he said.Modi said opposition played all types of games in the last three months raking up issues like demonetisation and surgical strike.Referring to anomalies in recruitments in UP, Modi said police recruitment in Uttar Pradesh is driven by caste-based decisions.""We have removed interview requirement from the recruitment process in Class III and Class IV categories in central government. Around one lakh people were recruited in Railways without an interview,"" he said.There are plans for recruitment in BSF and CISF which will be done in a fair and honest manner to give jobs to the deserving candidates, Modi added.Promising to continue the fight against black money and corruption, he appealed to people of Kannuj to vote for BJP on February 19 in the third phase of polling."

Prices in wholesale markets rose 5.25 per cent last month from a year earlier, their fastest gain since July 2014, government data showed. In December and November, inflation based on WPI stood at 3.39 per cent and 3.38 per cent, respectively. In January 2016, the print was (-)1.07 per cent. The previous high in WPI inflation at 5.41 per cent was witnessed in July 2014. Inflation in the fuel and power basket more than doubled to 18.14 per cent in January, up from 8.65 per cent in the previous month. However, the food inflation basket witnessed a contraction for the second month in a row with inflation at (-) 0.56 per cent in January against (-) 0.70 per cent in December. ""The higher-than-expected print of January WPI is largely a function of rising global prices, helped further by adverse base effects. With commodity prices accounting for a higher weight in WPI (vis-a-vis CPI), the rise in the former will be understandably faster, reflecting in the January inflation prints, which has now seen WPI creep higher than CPI,"" Yes Bank said in a note. The rise in wholesale inflation is in contrast to the fall in retail inflation to a five-year low of 3.17 per cent in January. Industrial production too had contracted 0.4 per cent in December 2016 to a four-month low, with consumer durables taking the worst hit on account of the cash crunch post note ban. Industry chamber Ficci said the industrial economy was still weak and there was a need to improve the flow of credit to manufacturing and infrastructure sectors. ""We also need to see a further reduction in the lending rates by banks and we hope that the RBI's guidance on this to the banks will be followed up in the form of further reduction in rates for companies,"" Ficci said. WPI inflation in vegetables, at (-)32.32 per cent in January, saw deflationary pressure for the fifth consecutive month. This was helped by a substantial price fall in onions, which stood at (-)28.86 per cent. Pulse inflation moderated to 6.21 per cent from 18.12 per cent in December. Potato prices recorded a sharp fall at (-)0.20 per cent from 26.42 per cent in the previous month."

Swaminathan has said that climate change demands anticipatory action from scientists and policymakers.Mr. Swaminathan was speaking at a consultation on climate change and food security on Monday at the M.S. Swaminathan Research Foundation, of which he is founder.It was part of a project, called Clima Adapt, which is being supported by the Norwegian Embassy in India.The programme was also attended by Jon Georg Dale, Norways Minister for Agriculture and Food.In his speech, Mr. Swaminathan described how temperature, precipitation and sea level rise affects agriculture.We have made a study that showed that, as a result of higher temperature, the duration of wheat crop in the Punjab will go down by one week....This will bring down the wheat production in the country which will go down by 5-6 million tonnes, he said.Alternate farmingMr. Swaminathan said that rising temperatures will necessitate alternate methods of growing potato.We grow 50 million tonnes of potato; 30 years ago, we grew five million tonnes. How did this sudden potato revolution take place? It was because of a method developed for sweet potato production during what we call aphid-free-season. Now, when the temperature goes up, the aphid-free-season will be gone, he said.Minister Dale, who began by noting that Chennai has the same population as Norway, said that such projects are a win-win for both countries.The experience from such projects have been used in several projects in Asia and Africa, he said.The Minister said that MSSRFs work on sea water farming was of particular interest to his country.We are committed to a policy approach which sees water and water-related ecosystems are protected and managed sustainably, he said, repeating a G20 pledge.The Norwegian minister also hoped to an end to the Syrian conflict.Syria is important for this world. We hope that Syria, at the end of this horrible war, can resume agricultural production, he said. He said that agricultural policy will be affected by climate change.We must adapt food production and reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from the agriculture sector....Agriculture must, as far as possible, take its share of (greenhouse gas) reduction, he said. Mr. Dale concluded by quoting Mr. Swaminathan: If agriculture goes wrong, nothing can go right.Rising temperatures, precipitation and sea level rise will adversely affect agriculture, he said"

""It is shameful that there is a son who is ignoring the struggle of (Samajwadi Party patriarch) Mulayam Singh Yadav. He has jumped into the lap of those who had tried to kill his father,"" the Prime Minister told an election rally in Kannauj. ""Akhileshji,"" he added, ""I want to ask you, did you forget the incident of March 4, 1984, when some people had fired at your father to kill him?"" Observers believe local political rivalry had led to the 1984 attack but Modi appeared to be referring to the Congress, as he played on the differences within the state's ruling party that has formalised a pre-poll deal with the Congress. Mulayam had opposed the tie-up but Akhilesh went ahead, eventually sealing a seat-share pact that left 105 of the state's 403 seats to the Congress. ""Nothing would be more shameful than such an act of a son to join hands with the attackers of his father for (the sake of his) chair,"" Modi said. The Prime Minister was speaking on a day 67 constituencies voted in the second phase of the Uttar Pradesh Assembly elections. Kannauj will vote in the third phase on February 19. Modi asked Akhilesh to listen to Mulayam, saying the chief minister does not understand the ""designs of the Congress"" which, he claimed, had also kept its future options open with the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi's arch-rival. ""Akhilesh is new and he is not able to understand all this. But Mulayam Singh Yadavji understands very well the designs of the Congress party,"" Modi said. The reference was to Rahul Gandhi's comments at a joint media conference he had addressed with Akhilesh last month where the Congress leader had said BSP boss Mayawati's ""politics does not pose any threat to the country"". Congress sources had said Rahul avoided criticising Mayawati's politics to send out the message that the agenda for Dalit empowerment was a common goal. Although Modi appeared to be soft towards Mulayam at one point, he didn't mind targeting the entire Yadav family later in his speech. ""I don't have any car. I use one given to me by the government because I am the Prime Minister of the country. But the Samajwadi family has 200 cars. Is it socialism?"" he asked the crowd. Modi also attacked Akhilesh's wife, Kannauj MP Dimple Yadav. ""The daughter-in-law of the Samajwadi family had promised to the people of Kannauj during the 2014 Lok Sabha election that she would set up a factory to produce potato chips. Now is the time for you,"" he told the crowd, ""to ask her why she didn't fulfil her promise""."

Union agriculture ministry's 'District-wise Estimation of Production and Area of Fruits, Vegetables and Crops in India' has revealed that Banaskantha has produced 17.10 lakh MT of potatoes, which is 9% of the total production in the country. Gujarat is followed by Agra which has produced 15.84 lakh MT of potatoes. Recently, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had lauded the farmers of Deesa for their potato yield and their progressive agricultural practices.The McAloo Tikki burger, French fries, and potato wedges  among the most beloved fast food items  all contain the delicious 'grown in Gujarat' element. Potatoes for these menu toppers come from farms of Deesa of Banaskantha district. Potatoes are sourced from farmers by McCain Foods , a Canadian multi-national. Apart from McCain, a soft drink company and a local potato chip giant have contract farming deals for potatoes in the region, which have given high returns to the farmers.According to the data, the area of sowing was the highest in Muzaffarpur in Bihar, while Banaskantha was ranked third in the country on this count with a sowing area of 52,800 hectares.In Muzaffarpur, sowing took up 85,500 hectares. However, when it comes to production, Banaskantha was leading the chart.Rajesh Shah, a farmer in Deesa, said: ""We have adapted drip irrigation and with the availability of water, the per hectare productivity has increased."" He said five years ago, the yield was around 20 tonnes per hectare. ""But for the past two years, it has increased to over 28 tonnes per hectare."" Ashish Guru , the president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association , said: ""Climate in Banskantha is conducive to growing the crop. Besides, farmers here are open to changes."" He said that the district has perhaps the highest number of drip-irrigation users. ""This has not only improved the yield has also improved the quality of the crop,"" he saidThe cold storage capacity in Gujarat was boosted by approximately 6.25 lakh tonnes (1.25 crore bags of 50kg each). Currently, the capacity is 22.50 lakh tonnes. This also spurred the production of potatoes."

He had seen Narendra Modi in real life for the first time and from the closest possible distance. "" Chehra ekdum gora hai, aur chamakta hai (His face is totally fair and it glows),"" Singh, a backward class marginal farmer, tells those gathered at the teashop near his village. Last Wednesday, Modi addressed a rally in Kannauj, and Harinath had managed to wind his way to the front rows on the military ground. The five Assembly seats of Kannauj, represented by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Akhilesh Yadav's wife Dimple in the Lok Sabha, will go to polls this Sunday. At the teashop, Congress leader Tariq Bashir confronts Harinath. He asks whether Modi's ""glowing"" face will fetch "" roti"" for Harinath. ""Chehra dekhne se roti milega kya?"" Tariq asks. Harinath retorts "" roti"" is given by ""Bhagwan (God)"" but it is his dharma to respect a big person like Modi who has come to his place. Harinath points out how the Prime Minister has promised to waive loans of small farmers and ensure potato farmers get a fair price if the BJP comes to power in Uttar Pradesh. ""Modiji is such a big man and if he is promising, then we have to believe him,"" Harinath says. Tariq, the Congress leader, keeps arguing but Harinath doesn't give in. Eventually, Bhaiyalal Rathore, a retired teacher, steps in. ""You (Tariq) are opposed to Modi and so whatever he (Harinath) says you will not accept,"" Bhaiyalal says. The argument ends on a pleasant note with no sign of ill-will. Some point out it is "" matdaan (election)"" and so each one has his ""mat (view)"". After tea, Bhaiyalal and Harinath invite this reporter to their village. The village called Gadiya Kachpura, around 2km from the teashop, is dominated by non-Yadav backward classes in an area regarded as Yadav territory and a stronghold of the ruling Samajwadi Party. The over 500 dwellings are inhabited by residents belonging to castes such as Kushwaha, Kahar, Kaanchi, Dohre, besides a couple of Muslim and Yadav families. Gadiya Kachpura has electricity, road connectivity and other basic facilities. Most residents acknowledge "" vikas hua hai"" (development has taken place). They say Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah are pocket boroughs of the Yadav family and the association has rewarded the region in terms of development projects. But some spoke of ""one problem"". ""Akhilesh has done a lot of work. Farmers are getting electricity and he has built roads. But there is one problem,"" says Pritam Singh, a Kushwaha. After a pause, he resumes: ""The problem is that one community is being more favoured. The government gives money for the wedding of Muslim girls but not for Hindus. In wazifa (scholarship) too, Muslims get a preference over Hindus."" Amrital a.k.a. Baba, saffron-robed and aged over 60 years, chips in. He claims his old age pension was stopped in 2013 and when he ran from one official to another, he was asked to pay a bribe. He claimed that elderly Muslim men and women get pension without paying any bribe. Vijay Pratap, a 38-year-old teacher at a government school, says there is no communal tension in the region that has never seen any communal flare-up. ""The villagers are upset over one community being given preference by the government,"" he says. Surendra Singh, 50, enters the discussion and says development is not everything. ""Safety and security of the country is most important,"" he says. He says "" badlao"" (change) is needed in Uttar Pradesh to ensure the country is safe and secure. ""Everyday we hear reports of aatankwadi (terrorists) infiltrating. The hands of the leader who works in national interest should be strengthened,"" he says holding up a clenched fist. ""Modi is working in national interest,"" Surendra adds. Many residents acknowledge that local BJP leaders and Vishwa Hindu Parishad representatives had been raising these issues much before the polls were announced. The villagers claimed that in the 2012 Assembly polls, the village had split 50:50 in favour of the Samajwadi Party and the BJP. ""This time it is going to be 80:20 in favour of the BJP,"" said Bhaiyalal Rathore, who claims he was a ""socialist"" but stands disillusioned because of caste and communal politics. The BJP is banking on the support of non-Yadav OBCs to end what they say ""the 14-year exile of the BJP in the land of Rama and Krishna"". Combined with the support of upper castes, the party hopes to regain power in Lucknow. The party has fielded over 100 backward class candidates. The undercurrent of communalism, particularly among the non-Yadav backward classes, appeared to be permeating beyond Gadiya Kachpura village. In Farrukhabad town, 40km away, J.N. Katiar, a retired state government official, insists the BJP is the best option for the state to become "" uttam pradesh (best state)"". ""Modiji will face re-election after two and a half years (the general election in 2019). He will come again seeking votes and so he has no option but to develop Uttar Pradesh. The SP and BSP will loot the state for three years and then do some work,"" he says. But soon Katiar reveals the main reason for his preference for the BJP: "" Hinduyon ki hitayshi sarkar UP ko chahiye (UP needs a government that serves the interest of the Hindus."""

They have been hit as big- and middle-level traders are not coming to markets to strike the deals. The prices have crashed so much that even recovering costs is becoming a challenge, they say.Potato seed growers are saying that they are facing double whammy as the season of selling potato seeds in November was lost to demonetisation and the prevailing crisis seems to be an aftermath of it. Punjab produces good quality potato seeds which are sold across the country.""No traders is coming to purchase the fresh crop and prices have nosedived in local mandis. In November, when potato seeds were to be supplied, demonetisation came. Farmers from West Bengal, which was the main market to be catered at the time, had no cash and the growers and suppliers here refused to sell on credit. Even according to conservative estimates, over four lakh bags (50kg per bag) were left in the stores in Punjab,"" said Inderdeep Singh Grewal, a major potato grower from Saraba village near Ludhiana. ""I too suffered big loss in November despite owning a cold storage,"" he added.""In November, several small growers had already sold most part of their produce and the middle and big producers were badly hit. However, this time, it's theses small growers who are worst hit as they sell their produce directly in the local mandis and don't have financial capacity to store,"" said Jaswinder Singh Sangha, secretary of Jalandhar Potato Growers Association.""Most of the trading of potato crops is done in cash. Now traders are wary of making all transactions through banks,"" Sangha said.

""We are considering to launch some protest or agitation to expose that how demonetisation has hit the farmers,"" he added.Grewal pointed out that the last two - three seasons were good for potato and the area under the crop also increased. ""This time production is good and if things don't improve a major part of the produce would simply left to be rotten,"" he said.Kala Sanghia-based potato grower Gurminder Singh, a middle-level grower, said that farmers were now striving to recover their costs only and even that seems to be an uphill task.""We don't have any money to sow maize crop and have no money to pay the land owners whose lands we have taken on annual contract,"" said Nawan Pind-based small farmer Mandeep Singh.

Yadav farmers see the November note recall as a ""demon"" but say they would have supported the Samajwadi Party even if the demonetisation never happened. Across central Uttar Pradesh constituencies that vote in the third phase on February 19, people seem agreed that the ""note bandi"" has hurt livelihoods. But how it might affect the Assembly polls is harder to assess, with caste and community leanings appearing to trump economic logic for many. Among the few dissenters is Mehboob Alam, a small-time building contractor from Kanpur district. He insists the note recall has changed the minds of many who would ordinarily have backed Prime Minister Narendra Modi. ""Had the note ban not happened, Modi would have formed the government in Uttar Pradesh. The demonetisation has upended his game,"" Alam, 52, said at Belaur market. Dikshit said he had lost a couple of lakhs of rupees this season because the note recall had left people without cash, worsening the effects of a bumper crop. ""Last season, I sold a sack of potato (weighing 52-55kg) for Rs 600-700; this season the price fell to Rs 150-200. I couldn't recover my input cost,"" the resident of Salempur, a village of ""Pandits"" in Farrukhabad, said. But he insisted that this would have no impact on votes. ""This time, all the Brahmins will vote for the BJP,"" Dikshit said, drawing vigorous nods all around. ""We had voted for Mayawati in 2007 and for the Samajwadis in 2012. But not this time, after the way Akhilesh has neglected Brahmins."" Most upper caste voters said they would support the BJP, as did most non-Yadav backward caste farmers, while acknowledging the distress caused by the demonetisation. ""We have suffered; we couldn't recover even the labour cost. But the note bandi will prove good for the country and for everybody in future,"" claimed Sujit Kumar Katiyar, a potato farmer. A rare exception was Anil Kumar Rajput, a landowning upper caste resident of Pasningpur village in Farrukhabad. His choice of Akhilesh, however, was driven more by the chief minister's performance than any anger at the demonetisation. ""Most members of our caste say they will vote for the BJP but I'll vote for Akhilesh. He has performed,"" Anil said. Akhilesh is banking on voters like Anil with his poll slogan of "" Kaam bolta hai (work talks)"". Most Rajputs and Thakurs, though, argued that while Akhilesh may be a good man, his party's district and block-level functionaries were knee deep in crime and corruption. The Rajputs and Brahmins see the BJP as their ""natural party"" that would serve their interests if it comes to power. Reminded that the BJP under Modi was trying to transform itself into a party of the poor and backward castes, Dharmnath Dubey of Naglabag village was dismissive: ""These things have to be done to win elections."" Farrukhabad, Kannauj, Mainpuri and Etawah are regarded as Samajwadi pocket boroughs but the Brahmins there are hopeful of ""our party"" coming to power after a long ""exile"". They are banking on the Muslim vote splitting between Mayawati and the Akhilesh-Rahul combine. ""In Farrukhabad, for instance, Mayawati has fielded a Muslim and the Samajwadis a Hindu. This should split Muslim votes. This is happening across the state,"" said Bhupendra Dwivedi in Farrukhabad town. The BJP vote too risks a division in Farrukhabad, though. Manoj Agrawal, a trader whom the BJP had denied a ticket, is contesting as an Independent. Many in the BJP feel that faulty candidate selection might cost the party."

The party hit back by accusing the Congress of patronising dreaded gangsters, including key accused of Nabha jailbreak.AAP state convener Gurpreet Singh Waraich alleged, ""It has become a habit for Punjab Congress president Capt Amarinder Singh to name AAP for any untoward incident in the state even though AAP has time and again made it clear that none of our leaders are involved in any kind of anti-social activity."" Waraich was accompanied by state secretary Gulshan Chhabra and co-coordinator of media cell Manjit Singh Sidhu.Waraich alleged, ""Gurpreet Sekhon, the key accused in Nabha jailbreak case belongs to a Congress family and Vicky Gounder, an accomplice of Sekhon, was brought into the world of crime by a Congress leader.""

He refuted charges that any AAP leader had given shelter to gangsters, saying that no office-bearer of AAP were involved in harboring any criminal.He also attacked BJP state president Vijay Sampla for ""meaningless allegations"" and said that gangsters and terrorists in Punjab were products of the Congress and SAD. ""AAP will clear the mess,"" he added.Waraich expressed his concern over crash in potato prices and demanded that NAFED shall procure the potato produce through MARKFED to protect the interests of farmers. He also demanded that the Centre provide subsidy on freight to potato growers so that they could transport their yield to other states and even export it.AAP convener said that the SIT formed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to probe the remaining cases of 1984 genocide of Sikhs had proved an eyewash and was only used to give clean chit to criminals and political leaders. He said that Modi had formed SIT to preempt formation of SIT by AAP government in Delhi. Out of 59 cases picked by it chargesheet was filed in four cases and 38 cases were closed.Punjab AAP chief Gurpreet Singh Waraich said that the party was ""satisfied with the working of the Election Commission "" and congratulated the poll panel for peaceful conduct of elections.

Now, even the safest of SP seats might see a tough contest.The BSP, with only six MLAs, and the BJP, with five, are trying their best to take advantage of the Yadav family feud.Sundays polling will decide the fates of Shivpal Yadav, Mulayam Singh Yadavs younger daughter-in-law Aparna Yadav, his nephew Anurag Yadav and Akhileshs aide Anurag Singh.Also in the fray are BJP leader Rita Bahuguna Joshi, who is fighting against Aparna Yadav, SP ministers Nitin Agarwal and Abhishek Mishra and BSP heavyweight Nakul Dubey.SP minister and MP Naresh Agrawals son Nitin is contesting from Hardoi while minister Farid Mahmood Kidwail is contesting from his current seat Kursi (in Barabanki). Another minister, Arvind Singh Gope is fighting to retain his Ramnagar seat in Barabanki.Union home minister Rajnath Singhs influence on the five Lucknow seats under his Lucknow Lok Sabha constituency, will come under test.The polls will also tell whether the big-ticket projects of Akhilesh Yadav government in Lucknowthe Metro, Janeshwar Mishra Park, Gomti River Frontwill convert into votes.Unlike the previous two phases, the third phase has the highest number of big fights, and figures many first-timers among the 826 candidates.The phase will be critical for both Akhilesh and Shivpal, who were locked in a bruising months-long feud for party control. The chief ministers move to replace 20 winners with new candidates will be put to test. For Shivpal, it will determine whether the leader, who is contesting the elections as a loner without any support from the party, is able to win on his own.Read | UP elections: Why a hung assembly cant be ruled out in this battleground stateThe region where voting takes place is one through which the SP governments flagship Agra-Lucknow expressway passes through.

The Indian snack major is now twice the size of Hindustan Unilever's packaged food division or Nestle Maggi and larger than the India turnover of the two American fast food rivals Domino's and McDonald's put together.The company has three distinct areas of operations with Haldiram Snacks and Ethnic Foods with that clocked Rs 2,136 crore from the northern region, Nagpur based Haldiram Foods International that caters to western and southern markets with annual sales of Rs 1,613 crore and a much smaller company, Haldiram Bhujiawala, for the eastern market with revenues of Rs 298 crore in FY16, according to data from Tofler, a company research platform.These figures, when combined with other regional snacking firms, conclusively demonstrates one thing  in fast food or munchies, despite the profusion of MNC brands with high cool quotient, good Indian palate prefers local savouries.""We have increased our reach and developed products in-house that ensure quality control.

While these figured in the political manifestos of all the prominent parties, these were only in the form of sweeping statements promising pothole-free roads and rejuvenation of open spaces that have formed the fine print of most manifestos for at least the past two civic polls. The parties offered no clarity on how they plan to achieve this, neither in their manifestos, nor in the public addresses and rallies of its major leaders.Ashoke Pandit, a citizen activist from Juhu, said, No one reads manifesto. It is a cut-paste paper work. I wanted to know what will be offered to me in next five years, but all I heard was abuses thrown against each other. This took over all the important issues that needed to be addressed.Mumbai has been grappling with inadequate open spaces with a per capita open space of just 2.48 square metres as per the open spaces reservation in the citys development plan. In reality, this dwindles to less than 1 square metre per person with several of these open spaces built upon, not in use, or having restricted entry.A policy to free up these open spaces, develop and maintain them has been long overdue, and stuck in political tangles with a significant number of such plots currently in the care of trusts backed by political bigwigs. Several of these plots, which were allotted under the old contentious caretaker policy that was later stayed, have been turned into swanky clubs with access based on a membership fee, and open entry for the public in a limited area for a restricted time. However, despite this, none of the parties have clearly stated how they plan to improve access to open spaces. While the BJP and Congress manifestos promise that the BMC will maintain open spaces, they are silent on reclaiming existing plots handed out under the caretaker policy.Nayana Kathpalia, an activist, said, The first draft of the open spaces policy came in 2007, and ten years later it is still under works. These are promises that will only remain on paper, as political parties are never on the same page when it comes to maintaining open spaces.Despite spending about Rs 1,500 crore annually on Mumbais roads, potholes continue unabated during the monsoon. Since the last election in 2012, the BMC has recorded 87,000 potholes across the city. Despite bad roads having turned into one of Mumbais identities nationally, political parties have not come up with any new solutions or technologies to offer voters.While pothole-free roads and fast-tracking concretization are promises seen on nearly every partys manifesto, how they exactly plan to improve the quality of works and curb constant digging for utility works remains unanswered. Instead, the Shiv Sena and BJP have focused on promising showpiece projects  a coastal freeway from Nariman Point to Dahisar, and a Goregaon Mulund link road by the former, and elevated roads running 250 kms in length by the latter.Mumbais draft Development Plan (DP) was a political hot potato in the civic body over the past two years, with the citys blueprint for the next two decades proposing a spurt in the Floor Space Index (FSI) and affordable housing by opening up No Development Zones (NDZs). However, when it came to campaigning for elections, none of the political parties opposed or supported the plan in their manifestos. While Congress was the first to oppose the draft in the BMCs general body, it failed to even mention the issue in its manifesto. The BJP has, however, promised to make the implementation of the DP a mandatory duty of the BMC, with just 30 percent of the current DP, published in 1994, having been implemented.Mumbai also struggles to manage its 9,400 tonnes of daily waste with two of its dumping grounds saturated beyond capacity. However, the only place where Mumbais garbage featured in political leaders verbal campaigning was in political one-upmanship and graft charges. Shiv Sena and BJP leaders stated their wish to close the Deonar and Mulund dumping grounds, but only while pointing at each other, alleging vested interests in the promise. Moreover, none of the parties manifestos, except for the Congress, have said a single word about closing dumping grounds, which have turned into a serious health hazard for the city. The Congress promises to move these out of the city, but does not specify where and how.READ MOREBMC polls Live: Mumbai steps out to vote for a better tomorrowMumbai civic polls: When it comes to governance, we mean businessBMC polls: Whatever be your choice, but please vote, say candidates"

The first sign of stirring was with the opening of Rakesh Talwars Spare Kitchen II, followed by the jazzy and spacious Matahari night club and now, most recently Swey.Spread across a sprawl of 14,000 square feet, Swey can accommodate 400 people at a go. The eatery, located on the malls level four, is whatever you want it to be: a caf, a pub, a bar or a restaurant that serves you wholesome food, under corporate chef Clyde Comellos direction. Owners Gaurav Dabrai, Vicky and Kabir Luthria, (who also own the kitschy Dishikiyaaon at Bandra Kurla Complex and Copa at Juhu), have utilised the space well, ensuring pockets of private party spaces for large groups ranging from 10 to 30 people.We love the restaurants direction pole that points to all their outposts across the city. Fun elements like a phone booth where you can step in to take a call, and a mandatory stop for all diners: a copper swing for selfies  are the lighter design touches.The rooftop bar has a drinks menu thats by far the best we have tried in a long time. Food and drink meet in two cocktails that we tried out. The first: a cheese me martini (Rs. 550) does not overwhelm the palate but makes its presence felt with the blue cheese and stuffed olives. The second, an apple a day (Rs. 550), which is vodka mixed with a buttery apple jam, comes with an apple crumble rim. If you like to mix your dessert and drinks, this one is for you. But the drink, who knows Donald (Rs. 650), with bourbon-soaked cranberries, with homemade bitters and sugar, steals our hearts. One of our dinner companions succumbs to healthier option: a kale and hearty (Rs. 500), a light vodka-based drink which tastes of a cooling cucumber and kale juice, an admirable combination.The food and drinks menus have been designed by outlet chef Hansel Baptista, and from the first bite of magic mushrooms (Rs. 350), in which the crispy roasted fungi act as makeshift sliders holding cheese and beetroot slices, we know we are in for a treat. The wood-fired pizzas are juicy square flat breads, which are easier to eat. The smoky salmon and ricotta pizza (Rs. 750) has the sweetness of red onions balanced by the sourness of tiny balsamic jelly beans. The feta beignets (Rs. 375) are deep-fried and bland but for the addition of sweet tomato jam reserve. The stuffed calamari (Rs. 500) with a centre-filling of masala prawn chilly fry is chewy, but the zing of East Indian bottle masala dominates pleasantly.Chef Baptista presents the duck waffle two ways but in a croissant just for us to try. The chunks of duck pieces are pan-seared and medium-rare cooked in a pomegranate jus, and a tangy duck confit with orange tang and spices. We are instant fans of the healthy veg spaghetti (Rs. 450) that has thinly sliced veggies as noodles, and spiced roast cashews tossed in a Himalayan rhododendron vinaigrette that adds crunch. The deconstructed ham and cheese toasty salad (Rs. 450) falls flat for its bland dressing as we dont enjoy bite-size pieces of ham slices between toasted bread.For the main course we settle for a kimchi fried rice (Rs. 500) which is peppered with spiced tofu, fried lotus root and thin strips of noori. A Korean dish which traditionally comprises a broken egg, we are served a sunny side up, which we prefer as is. The dish is a roller-coaster of textures  the crunch of lotus stem, and raw vegetables, the softness of tofu pieces and al dente rice cooked in a fiery red sauce.By now, we are stuffed, but theres plenty of room for dessert. We begin with three shots (Rs. 750), which can be ordered sans alcohol too: a negroni with 55% dark chocolate, cinnamon flavoured yogurt and orangechilo cheesecake. The negroni shot has a potato chip dunked in chocolate sauce, while the flavoured yoghurt needs more cinnamon. The orangechilo cheesecake rules our palate with its tangy presence. The syrups are all house made and the absence of synthetic syrup ensures we wont croak with a hoarse voice the next day.Dive into dessertsA fitting end to the meal is the desserts. The bittersweet symphony of theres bourbon in my cheesecake (Rs. 330) topped with a smoked honey is a hit. But the pice de rsistance is the hazelnut entremet. The dessert has a crunchy ganache base topped with a hazelnut meringue thats served with a coffee amaretto Bavarian ice cream with caramel. Self-taught baker and dessert chef Tanvi Kirawant, or as she likes to call herself the Nagpur tigress, tells it takes her 50 steps to make the dessert. We manage to polish it off in five, quick bites.Swey at Atria, Worli, is open from 6 p.m. to 1.30 a.m.; 9820436666"

Besides dip in production of major fruits like mango, guava, litchi and banana, productivity of major crops like wheat, rice and pulse also witnessed downtrend in 2015-16 as compared to 2013-14.Although production of potato witnessed marginal improvement (63.45 lakh tonne in 2015-16 against 60.50 lakh tonne in 2013-14), onion and tomato went down to 12.47 lakh tonne from 13.04 lakh tonne and 10.01 lakh tonne from 10.61 lakh ton in the same corresponding year.Net sown area for sugarcane also came down to 3.46% of net cultivable area in 2015-16 as against 3.66% recorded in 2013-14.

(Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh) Leaving their farms behind at Rajoke village, Amritsar. (Source: Express photo by Rana Simranjit Singh)THE FARMERS of Punjab, who have been facing one crisis after the other for the past few years, are now facing indiscriminate increase in the rate of seeds of spring maize (February to May) and sunflower crops. In the absence of checks by any government agency, they are ending up paying double the amount to buy seeds for these crops. And, farmers have to depend only on dealers for the spring maize seed because the agriculture department provides the seed for Kharif season maize (June to October) only.Watch What Else Is Making NewsFarmers said that to increase rates, false shortage is being created by the seed dealers. Even some farmers groups have complained to the district administration and the agriculture department, which has issued instructions to check the availability of seed. Sunflower and spring maize crops are sown in February and March and harvested in June. We got an agreement with the dealers for getting the spring maize seed at the rate of Rs 1,200-1,400 per 4-kg bag (Rs 300-350 per kg) but farmers are being forced to pay Rs 2,100-2,200 (Rs 550 per kg) for the same quantity now as this will double our production amount, said farmer Jagat Parkash Singh Gill, secretary of Potato Seed Growers Association (PSGA), adding that they have lodged a complaint with the district administration, too.He also mentioned that dealers cartlised themselves to create a false shortage of the seed to charge hefty amount from the farmers. Prithpal Singh, another farmer and general secretary of PSGA, said that even the bills and invoice number are not provided by these dealers against the purchase of seed from them. He added that mostly hybrid seed is used for spring maize and that even the rates of the Cucurbit (Musakmelon, Watermelon etc.) has been hiked by the dealers. The rate of sunflower seed has also been increased from Rs 1,600 to Rs 2,600-3,000 per bag of four kilos, said farmers while making a representation.According to the agriculture department, around 30,000 hectares are ued for the cultivation of spring maize every year mostly in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur and part of Ludhiana districts. Dr Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director in the agriculture department, informed that they have asked the officials of these districts to check the stock available with the dealers. They have also been asked to send a report on seed availability with the dealers, he added.Chief Agriculture Officer, Jalandhar, Jugraj Singh, said that according to their report, there is no shortage of seeds of these crops in the market and they have informed their higher-ups about it. In Jalandhar alone, spring maize is cultivated over 10,000 hectares and sunflower on nearly 1,000 hectares.The farmers said that most of the potato growers of Doaba region, after harvesting the crop in February-March, switch to cultivating spring maize and sunflower crops, which are three-four months crops only.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

With this, King Momo , the mythical king of carnivals, will declare the year's four-day carnival celebrations open on February 25. Oh, what one would give, just to head to Goa and partake in the customary grand colourful parade at Panaji, along the Mandovi river! If that ain't happening, the Goan community settled here in Pune, has a celebration of equal pomp on the cards, if not more. And the best part is, you're invited!Festoons adorn the courtyard of the 113-odd-year-old Poona Goan Institute (PGI) at Rasta Peth. Here's where the city's Goan community will meet for a weekend of fun and frolic. Back in Goa, the grand parade is led by King Momo, atop a float with his queen and entourage of subjects. Jesters, dancers, fire eaters and revellers join in the jamboree.Clint D'Souza, honorary general secretary of PGI, promises that the celebrations here will call to mind memories of home. ""There's a food festival to partake in on Saturday, where one can sample Goan traditionals (sorpotel, sannas, and the likes). Musician Denver Mascarenhas will provide us with some foot-tapping music too.""On Sunday, King Momo and his entourage will declare the carnival party open. Goa Tourism might have selected musician Roque Tome Fernandes to essay King Momo this time, but PGI will have its own king. The parade is one that's fresh out of Mario Miranda's caricatures. ""It features people you see in everyday Goa  a fisher woman, a paowalla, and a padri (priest), among others,"" says Clint, adding that it is also customary for King Momo to choose his wife from the crowd.What good is the celebration, if we don't talk about the fare? City food blogger Hilda Mascarenhas, who specialises in Goan cuisine, says, ""Back then, when fewer people attended the parade, one had the luxury of enjoying their sorpotel, vindaloo and chourico (sausage) pulao by the wayside. But with large crowds now, people prefer finger foods."" The Goans love their meat, so there's a plethora of snacks, like prawn rissoles, mackerelcroquetas and mince potato chops, one can relish off roadside stalls.But no Goenkar can do without chourico pao (pao stuffed with pork sausages). ""Made with spices, smoked and dried, it can be prepared in various ways, either a dry chilly fry, or a thick gravy, to be enjoyed with Goan pao,"" Hilda adds.The last day of the festivities, Pancake (or Shrove) Tuesday, sees the community preparing 'alle belle', melt-in-the-mouth pancakes with a sweet stuffing of Goan 'pyramid' palm jaggery and freshly grated coconut. Hilda says, ""These are enjoyed with tea throughout the year, but Pancake Tuesday is when we use all the remaining home supply of eggs, sugar and milk to make these, before the onset of Lent, a period of prayer and abstinence."""

The rate for storing one bag of produce (50kg) has gone up from Rs 80 to Rs 100 per bag in the past six months in Bathinda district. Now, the cold stores are asking farmers to pay Rs 20 per bag as advance too.The arrivals of fresh potato crop are expected to start in the first week of March. At present, potato is fetching a price of Rs 2 to 2.4 per kg with a 50 kg bag going for Rs 100-120.Bathinda has 35 cold storages with a capacity to stock up nearly 32 lakh bags of 50 kg each or around 1.6 lakh tonnes. Potato has been grown over 6,500 hectares in Bathinda and nearly 1.65 lakh tonnes of output of is expected in the district in the current season, which is the highest after the Doaba region.Though the state horticulture departments manages the potato cultivation, due to no minimum support price (MSP) it can't ensure higher rates from the market for the farmers. Even the rent of cold stores was fixed either under the Central Cold Storage Order, 1980, or the acts enacted by the state governments. Punjab had abolished the control on tariff fixation in 1994.""Earlier, demonetisation badly hit potato growers. With the cash flow diminishing from the market during November-December, the crop was not being sent to other states and farmers had to sell their produce in local markets at lower prices. The losses now mount further with the new crop also not fetching good rates and the cold store owners exploiting the growers,"" said Harcharan Singh Dhillon, a potato grower from Kararwala village near Rampura Phool sub-division of Bathinda. He has sown in potatoes over 200 acres. Rampura sub-division is the biggest producer of potatoes in the Malwa region.Another farmer from Kararwala Jaspal Singh said, ""The potato growers are failing to get bookings in the cold stores even after getting ready to pay more than the previous year. Most of the cold store owners are saying the space has already been booked by the traders."" He said the cold store owners had joined hands to make money by exploiting farmers.Bathinda-based Dhillon cold store owner Iqbal Singh Dhillon, however, denied any exploitation of the farmers. Iqbal said, ""Due to the hike in electricity rates, we are bound to make nominal increase in the storage rates. We are not saying no to any potato grower if we have space. Our cold store has the capacity of 80,000 bags. In the whole district, the cold stores have the capacity to store 30-32 lakh bags and nearly this much potato is produce already in the area.""Bathinda deputy director of horticulture Gurkewal Singh Dhillon also said that demonetisation had its impact on the crop and potato was not fetching the desired rates even now. ""We are taking up the issue with the cold store owners to get space for every farmer at reasonable rates.""The deputy director admitted that cold store owners had increased rates for storing potato. ""It seems tough for farmers to pay and we are trying to settle the issue,"" he said."

Express Photo by Tashi TobgyalWith nine children falling sick after dead rats were found in their food, the spotlight is back on mid-day meals. The Indian Express tracks the food from the kitchens to the students, and discovers some bumps along the wayA peppery aroma emanates from the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur, amid a sputtering of machines and flurry of human activity. On a Wednesday morning, nearly 70 men  supervisors, cooks, housekeeping staff and helpers  mop the 3,400 square yard area, load three 500 kg capacity steamers with potatoes, wash over 2,000 kg of rice, roll out 50,000 puris, temper over 800 kg of curry, and, finally, test the quality of food. On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools.We have 104 people and the second shift, which prepares meals for evening schools, is at work now. Between midnight and 5 pm, our kitchen prepares meals for 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schools, which is about 80,000 students, says Godfrey Pereira, the NGO secretary. His is one of the 43 NGOs that supply mid-day meals to 18.46 lakh children in Delhi schools, run or aided by the Directorate of Education, the north, east and south civic bodies, the New Delhi Municipal Council and the Delhi Cantonment Board.Unlike rural centres, there are no kitchen-cum-stores on school campuses in Delhi, primarily due to lack of space. All mid-day meals are prepared and delivered by NGOs, selected through a tender every three years Its a massive operation, and a small mistake at any of the levels  procuring, cleaning, cooking or serving  can have major repercussions, says Pereira, 58, whose NGO has been a part of the programme since 2003. Ye floor se paani saaf karo, Pereira instructs one of the helpers, pointing to the water that spread after rice was drained. He has just begun his rounds of the kitchen and will inspect all departments  grain clearing, cooking, vegetable cutting, dish washing, frying and storage areas  over the next few hours.On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools. On the menu today is aloo-puri for three Delhi government schools and kadhi-chawal for six Municipal Corporation of Delhi schools.The small mistake Pereira refers to is what could have led to dead rats slipping into mid-day meals served at the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Deoli earlier this month. Nine students were hospitalised after consuming food provided by Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas, one of the 16 NGOs that supply mid-day meals to Delhi government schools. The incident prompted Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia to ordered an inspection of 33 such kitchens by secretary-level officers.Pereira feels that though checks and balances are in place, an error can occur, or be introduced, at any stage, including after food has left the kitchen. You can never rule out sabotage. Its a competitive field and anyone who has lost out on the tender can bribe a driver or helper to spoil food, he says, checking the tempering of the potato curry. Jaldi karo, vans aane waali hongi, he says.Narender Singh, a member of the Suparbhat Education and Social Welfare Society, which supplies mid-day meals to 28 Delhi government schools, feels that problems run much deeper. While 43 NGOs get the contract to provide these meals, they end up sub-letting their duties to other organisations. In case of Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas, food was being provided by a third party. In such situations, monitoring quality becomes difficult, alleges Singh, whose NGO has been delivering meals since 2004. Jan Chetna Jagriti & Shaikshanik Vikas refused to comment on the matter. Then there is the issue of training the staff. These third-party vendors simply hire daily wagers. The government must look into this, he adds.***Food being prepared at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur. Express Photo by Tashi Tobgyal Food being prepared at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur. Express Photo by Tashi TobgyalThe mid-day meal scheme has been operational in Delhi for nearly 15 years now. A November 2001 Supreme Court order made it compulsory for all government and government-assisted primary schools to provide the meals. Two years later, the programme was first implemented in Delhi in 410 MCD schools, and in 2004, it was extended to primary classes of Sarvodaya schools, under the Directorate of Education. In October 2007, the scheme was revised to cover children in upper primary classes as well  VI to VIII.Since then, selected service providers have been supplying meals with a minimum of 450 calories and 12 gm of protein to children in Classes I-V, and with 700 calories and 20 gm of protein for students of Classes VI-VIII.Pereira, now checking the consistency of the kadhi in an 800 kg aluminium vessel, says that while NGOs try and stick to the calorific and protein requirements, the budget for meals is very low. We try and add ingredients such as soya chunks to meet the protein content, but apart from grains, which we get from the Food Corporation of India godowns, there is no subsidy on any ingredient and we pay market prices. We add seasonal vegetables, which are cheaper, but that is it. Spices, kidney beans, are expensive, he says, adding that the gas subsidy provided earlier has been taken away too. We use 90 cylinders a day; heating up large vessels requires a lot of fuel.The NGOs get Rs 4.13 and Rs 6.18 per child per day for primary and upper primary classes, respectively. The organisations also get Rs 1,000 per month for the cook-cum-helpers that serve meals at schools and for Rs 750 per metric ton for transportation. The cost for the entire programme is shared between the Centre and the state on a 60-40 basis.Narendra Singh, whose NGO supplies food to schools in northeast Delhi, also complains about delays in payments. We are yet to receive money for December. In such situations, many NGOs are likely to falter on quality, he says.So, will increasing the number of service providers help? Not at all, in fact it will increase bureaucracy and make monitoring even more difficult, says a member of another NGO, which supplies food to 44 schools in northwest Delhi. You need to empower existing organisations. Increase funding, expand infrastructure and workforce Provide raw material and verify the stock on a monthly basis.Pereira agrees. The problem is that we are not considered a part of the government. The moment there is an incident, such as the one at the Deoli school, there is a blame game, and all fingers are pointed at NGOs. But its only if the government and the NGOs work as a team that issues will be resolved, he says.***The food after being prepared at the the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen is taken to 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schools The food after being prepared at the the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen is taken to 31 Delhi government schools and 124 MCD schoolsThis is not the first time that the Delhi mid-day meal programme has come under scrutiny. In 2013, an audit conducted by the Union HRD Ministry found that the meal served in schools in the capital did not meet prescribed nutritional values. About 95 per cent of 365 meal samples failed to meet nutritional requirements in 2011-2012, and 98 per cent of 322 samples failed in 2010-2011. Seventeen NGOs were found violating norms.Vimala Ramachandran, a former professor at the National University of Educational Planning and Administration, who has been part of several research projects on the subject, says, In cities, there is no space for kitchens on campus and that is where problems begin. Tamil Nadu is the best model where, except for Chennai, all food is prepared on campus. They dont rely on centralised kitchens (like the ones in Delhi). In Andhra Pradesh, sub-letting is not allowed. In Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Tripura, all grains come from the nearest public distribution system store, so it is all subsidised. Why cant other states follow this model, and link PDS or Kendriya Bhandars with mid-day meals?***Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis Sultanpur Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys mid-day meal kitchen in southwest Delhis SultanpurOperations at the Jay Gee Humanitarian Societys kitchen have picked up pace. Four delivery vans have started queuing up at the entrance. Inside, cooks and helpers are putting final touches to the food. Hundreds of stainless steel vessels are being rinsed in potassium permanganate liquid and wiped, before food is packed in them. A few women are locking the vessels with a plastic seal.Hansika Rawat, a teacher from the Tughlakabad Extension government school, has arrived for inspection. Teachers from schools we supply meals too conduct inspections. We get three-four teachers a day, he says, directing one of his supervisors to show Rawat around. Following the inspection, teachers are expected to fill up a questionnaire with queries such as: Is there proper arrangement for drainage of waste water? and Are CCTVs installed in all the compartments?.Pereira appears confident. We follow all directions. I can monitor CCTV footage on my phone. It is a 24/7 kitchen and that is the first thing I do when I wake up at 5 am, he says.The vans take off on their journeys to schools, some as close as a kilometre away, others at least 6 km away. This is another problem. I dont supply food to the government school right next door, some other NGO does. Schools need to be allotted according to location of kitchens, he says.One of the schools Pereiras organisation provides food for is the South Delhi Municipal Corporation Primary Girls/Boys School, in Deoli, a kilometre away from the school where dead rats were found. Before children take their seats on durries in the corridor, a series of steps need to be followed: The room where food is served is mopped, then two cook-cum-helpers open seals of vessels in the presence of Ram Kumar Meena, the mid-may meal in-charge for the school, and then Meena, a few other teachers and two parents  who were there to speak to teachers about their wards  taste the aloo-puri. Following approvals, at around 3.20 pm, the cook-cum-helpers begin serving the meals to Class I students, who have brought their own bowls and plates. We send the food back if we feel it is spoiled. But then students suffer. It is difficult to prepare the meals again at such short notice. We give students biscuits, etc. on such days, says Meena.Soon, the conversation drifts towards the neighbouring school where dead rats were found. My eldest son studies in Class VI in that school and he loves the kadhi-chawal. But since the incident, I have been packing his lunch from home, says Indu Devi, 40, one of the parents tasting the meals.At the Government Boys Senior Secondary School in Deoli, meals continue to be served by the same NGO. No one, apart from students, is allowed to enter the school. Principal sahab baat nahi karenge, says the guard through a small hole in the gate. A little after 3.30 pm, a few students scale the school wall and jump outside. One of them walks over to the general store and buys a packet of chips. I dont like the mid-day meals too much, says the Class VII student.Ask him about students who fell ill, and pat comes the reply: Yes, a few students were vomiting, but they werent from my class. Today kadhi-chawal is being served, but I will go home and eat, he says, walking away with his friends, all of whom have decided to give school a miss today.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

The farmers are still not fully aware about these potential crop-destroyers, he added.The Dean of Indian Council of Agricultural Research HS Gaur expressed his apprehension about the spread of nematode in the country. Citing the instance of a particular kind of nematode which affected plants such as potatoes and tomatoes, he said the Potato Cyst Nematode was first discovered in the Nilgiris and had now spread to various parts of the country."

As potato farmers are staring at heavy losses due to drop in demand and prices, the state government held a high-powered meeting to help them deal with the slump.The CM, who chaired the meeting, suggested that inmates in all the state jails should be fed potatoes. Another idea was to serve potatoes to schoolchildren, under the government-run midday meal programme, to add to their calorie intake. The state authorities discussed the issue after leaders of farmers unions had sought their help.Low-key affairAfter the state assembly polls, Punjab deputy chief minister Sukhbir Singh Badal and his wife, Union food processing minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, made their first visit to Amritsar on Saturday and attended the monthly bhog ceremony of akhand path at the Golden Temple.Unlike their previous trips, their outing remained low profile this time. Whenever the deputy CM was in the holy city earlier, the administrative top brass of the district used to be in attendance besides the entire local Akali leadership. However, neither any senior official nor any prominent local leader of the Shiromani Akali Dal accompanied the couple this time. The duo also showed less interest in talking to reporters.Beyond promisesIn the high-stakes poll battle for the Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, the Shiromani Akali Dal (Badal), in its manifesto released last week, went overboard in making promises. The promises ranged from more schools and dispensaries to free education to more Sikh children.The party also listed promises it made and fulfilled. But one section titled Jo nahee kaha si, oho vee kita (What was not promised, but still accomplished) caught everyones attention. It included rescue operations carried out after Nepal earthquake and floods in Kashmir, and help given to farmers of Pehowa in Haryana to get their lands back from the state government.Foolproof formulaHaryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattars supporters in his assembly constituency of Karnal were upset over the indifference of district authorities to their genuine demands. But they have now found a way to get themselves heard.The formula, according to a local leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), is to invite the CM to their residence. Once officials of the district administration find out about the CMs visit, they take their demands seriously and take no time in completing all pending works, he said. The roads get repaired and painted, potholes are filled up and other issues taken care of.Chinks in Chautala clan?The much-hyped Jal Yudh (war for water) of the opposition Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) in Haryana, which ended with the arrest of its leaders, including Abhay Chautala, on Thursday was seen as the launching pad of Abhays son Arjun Chautala into politics.It was the first state-level programme in which Arjun had actively participated and went to jail along with other senior leaders of the party. However, the absence of family members of Abhays elder brother Ajay Chautala, who is in jail in teachers recruitment case, was the talking point throughout the day-long protest.Neither Ajays MLA wife Naina Chautala, nor their two sons, Hisar MP Dushyant and Digvijay, were seen at the rally. Dushyant told reporters on Sunday that he and his brother were abroad as per a pre-decided programme.Preparing for poetic politicsHimachal Pradesh chief minister Virbhadra Singh will present the general budget for financial year 2017-18 on March 10. The CM holds the finance portfolio and his budget speech lasted two hours last year. But it may be even longer this time.Officers of the finance department are making extra efforts to create a record of sorts in the state assembly, trying to incorporate just about everything.A special officer has been deputed to incorporate couplets and quotations. The officer has sent a message on WhatsApp to his friends, asking them to send best of Urdu couplets that can be used to hit out at the opposition.AAPs hilly dreamsThe Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lacks an organisational setup in Himachal Pradesh, but its supporters showed a lot of enthusiasm during the assembly elections in neighbouring Punjab.A number of its supporters had travelled to Punjab and spent there a month, canvassing for the party candidates. On their return, they are not only eagerly awaiting the poll results, but also visiting different villages and looking for prospective candidates, hoping that the party may enter the fray in the hill state, where the elections are due later this year.(Contributed by Gurpreet Singh Nibber, Surjit Singh, Rajesh Moudgil, Neeraj Mohan and Gaurav Bisht)"

Interestingly, unlike in the jallikattu agitation held in Marina, leaders of various political parties have started flocking to the venue after the tenth day, perhaps after testing the waters. MDMK general secretary Vaiko, leaders of People's Welfare Front and TNCC chief S Thirunavukarasar were among those who called on the protesters on Tuesday expressing their concern at the possible impact of the project on the environment.As per the resolutions passed at the protest committee meeting on Monday, protesters held black flags in their hands on Tuesday at Neduvasal. Villagers from Neduvasal West and Aandavarayapuram joined the protest along with hundreds of farmers, students and youths who came from various districts. Meanwhile, residents of 70 surrounding villages including Neduvasal (East and West), Karukakuruchi, Kottaikadu, Vadakadu, Aandavarayapuram, Pullanviduthi and Vaanakkankadu hoisted black flag atop their houses to showcase their resistance. As many as 500 members from the jamath committee in Pudukkottai also expressed their solidarity with the protesters by staying put for a whole day at the venue.Address the gathering, MDMK general secretary Vaiko said that development of the country at the cost of Tamil Nadu was not acceptable and people would protest against the hydrocarbon project. ""Nigeria bore the brunt of hydrocarbon and people opposed it after sensing catastrophe. Now it's our turn. If the union government wants the project, they may have it in Gujarat. I urge chief minister Edapadi K Palanisamy to take strong exception to the project"", Vaiko added.Leaders of People's Welfare Front (PWF) Thol Thirumavalavan, G Ramakrishnan and R Mutharasan, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee president S Thirunavukarasar and director V Gowthaman who also addressed the gathering said that the Centre should not compel farmers to accept the project. Otherwise they warned of holding a statewide protest. While addressing a protest organized by PWF at Alangudi in Pudukkottai district, the leaders asked the union government to respect the people's feelings and revoke the project.Meanwhile, college students from Mannar Sarfoji in Thanjavur skipped their classes and staged a demonstration raising slogans against the hydrocarbon project. As usual, Neduvasal villagers prepared and served tasty sambar rice with potato curry, roasted green chilli and pickle to the protesters. As announced, traders will down their shutters across the district on Wednesday in support of the ongoing protest."
58f539767be9e01a3579c19b,"From farm to market, potato price jumps 5 times in 60km",http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/from-farm-to-market-potato-price-jumps-5-times-in-60km/articleshow/57381322.cms,2017-02-28,"SINGUR: Potato rates in Bengal is having a free fall over the last couple of weeks, with wholesale prices plunging to an all-time low of Rs 2 per kg (Rs 100 per 50kg packet)  almost half the production cost of Rs 200 per packet. However, the dip is not reflecting in the Kolkata markets, with prices ranging between Rs 7 and Rs 9. So essentially, due to meddling by middlemen, potato retail price turns five times dearer while covering 60-odd kilometres from the farm to buyer.Sensing an imminent crisis, the Bengal government is set to offer minimum support price to potato farmers in the state to stop distress sale of the food crop. The department of agriculture marketing has asked 460 potato cold storages to keep 10% space reserved for government-procured potatoes.According to the agriculture marketing department, this year, a bumper potato harvest is expected in three major potato producing districts  Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura and some blocks of other districts. The potato production, this year is pegged at 1.15 crore tonne in 4,500 hectres of land, compared to 90 lakh per tonne last year. A bumper production often leads to distress sale by farmers who fear rotting of the unsold crop in the field.According to the notification (245-AM/0/4C-05/2013) dated February 23, 2017, issued by the agriculture marketing department secretary R K Sinha, on the basis of the advise of cold storage expert committee, all cold storages were instructed to reserve 10% potato storage space for government-procured potatoes. This space will be at the disposal of the district magistrate till March 21. Significantly, the cold storage will be opened on March 1, 2017, for stocking of the potato of Rabi season.Both farmers and cold storage owners welcome this move. Chintamoni Santra of Pursura, the country's highest potato producing block, said, ""This year, I had potato-farming in 1.5 bigha land, which produces 90 packets per bigha. But I had to sell some of the produce at Rs 80-Rs 100 per packet, incurring a loss of almost Rs 100 per packet. If the government buys out some part of the produce, I will be relived of a huge stress.""Bengal's agriculture marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta said: ""Our chief minister Mamata Banerjee has said farmers must not suffer and middlemen must not loot. This is why we are adopting such measures without disturbing the market equilibrium. Each Panchayat will prepare a list of potato farmers in potato producing districts.""Arijit Saha, the owner of Dhanekhali Cold Storage, feels positive about the decision. ""This will save the potato market to a great extent. A lot of farmers will have a breather. But the Panchayat must prepare the list of potato farmers on a war-footing."""
5929cea77be9e0138af8ed15,Cropping patterns: Diversification dilemma on the ground,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/cropping-patterns-diversification-dilemma-on-the-ground-farmers-punjab-agriculture-4550138/,2017-03-01,"Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba Agnihotri Farmers at a spring maize field in Thammanwal village in Phillaur, Punjab. Anju Chaba AgnihotriCrop diversification and moving away from the entrenched paddy-wheat cycle has been the buzzword among Punjabs policymakers for at least two decades now. It will remain so even when the next government takes over in a couple of weeks time. But on the ground, farmers are still planting paddy during kharif and wheat in the rabi season as before. Some have gone in for diversification, but not the way policymakers, both in the state government and the Centre, would want them to. Theres no better example of this diversification dilemma than spring season maize; and it should be an eye-opener for future policymaking.Spring maize is currently being grown in about 30,000 hectares of Punjab, especially in the Doaba region covering Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Hoshiarpur and Nawanshahr districts that also constitutes the states potato belt. It is planted from mid-February to mid-March, just after harvesting of potato. Spring maizes popularity is precisely because it fits well into the potato cycle. A 95-110 day crop, it is harvested by June, well in time for planting of basmati/non-basmati paddy or even kharif maize. The latter crops are harvested in October, which is also potato planting time.The above cropping cycle, however, is not viewed favourably by the authorities, who feel it doesnt address the more fundamental problem of depleting water tables in the state. The Punjab government wants farmers to grow maize only in the kharif reason to replace water-guzzling paddy. We arent keen to promote spring season maize, as it also consumes too much water, says Jasbir Singh Bains, joint director of the state agriculture department.A senior scientist at the Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) in Ludhiana, too, seconds this view: Temperatures start rising after March and hit 35-45 degrees Celsius level by May-June alongside sunshine duration of 9-9.5 hours. This necessitates frequent watering of the standing maize crop. As an alternative, the government is encouraging farmers to grow spring/summer moong (green gram), mah/urad (black gram), sunflower, vegetables (cucumber, brinjal, capsicum, gourds, beans, etc) and green fodder  which can all be planted in February.But there are no takers for this logic amongst farmers. Why should we grow maize during the kharif season when its yields are not even 25 quintals per acre? We get 36-39 quintals or more from spring maize hybrids. And with rates of Rs 1,000-1,500 per quintal, the returns are more than even from wheat, taking 24-25 quintal/acre yield, minimum support price of Rs 1,625/quintal and 145-day crop duration, points out Jagat Prakash Gill, secretary of the Potato Seed Growers Association who cultivates spring maize of 70 out of his 100 acres land at Thammanwal village in Jalandhars Phillaur tehsil.We prefer spring maize since it is high-yielding, has shorter duration and there is good demand in the market from poultry and animal feed makers. If the government wants us to grow kharif maize, why are PAU and others not developing hybrids that yield close to what we get from the spring-planted crop? Alternatively, why dont they breed spring maize hybrids requiring less water? asks Gurraj Singh. This farmer, who cultivates spring maize on 20 out of his 25-acre holding in Jugral village of Jalandhar tehsil, also points to the Indian Institute of Maize Research, which is being shifted from Delhi to Ladhowal, not far from Phillaur: What are the people there doing to help us?This disconnect between policymakers objectives and farmers preferences has meant that the market for spring maize hybrid seeds is today controlled by private firms. The most popular hybrids in Punjab include DKC 9108 and 9120 of Monsanto and Dupont-Pioneers P1844, P1855 and 31Y45. The biggest grouse of farmers has to do with their prices, which are totally unregulated. Till a couple of years ago, these branded seeds were being sold to farmers at Rs 150-200 per kg. This season, their rates were in the Rs 525-550 per kg range. At 8 kg seeds per acre, it translates into a cost of Rs 4,200-4,400.The distributors/dealers of the seed companies promised us a rate of Rs 1,300-1,400 per bag of 4 kg in early-January. But when sowing began, we ended up paying Rs 2,100-2,200, which was above even the maximum retail price mentioned in the bags. After much hue and cry, they reduced the rates to Rs 1,600-1,700. But by then, much of the seeds had already been sold, complains Arvinder Singh, a 50-acre farmer from Sofi Pind village of Jalandhar who grows spring maize on 40 acres. He further alleges that the dealers did not even provide bills or invoices against their sales.When asked about these seemingly anti-competitive pricing practices, the spokesperson of one of the multinational firms told The Indian Express that we made the seeds available to the dealers at Rs 1,525-1,550 per bag and there was no shortage of material supplied from our end. He, however, admitted that we have no control on our distributors. Equally interesting is the response of the government, which has chosen to be a mute spectator, conveniently citing that it is committed to regulate prices and supply of only kharif season maize seeds. Its another matter that farmers arent interested in growing kharif maize. As a result, they are left with no choice but to deal with private sector monopolies and unscrupulous dealers who have exploited the demand for seeds to jack up prices. The government wants us to grow pulses and sunflower. But we have seen the way moong prices have collapsed within the last one year. For maize, there is at least a market and no lack of buyers, notes Jagat Prakash Gill.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

This led to blockade on the NH as vehicles were finding it difficult to negotiate through crushed potatoes. Later, the administration cleared the road with JCB machines.Farmers also blocked Kartarpur-Kapurthala road and raised slogans against the Union government. They raised slogans against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and termed him anti-farmer. The farmers were led by Union patron Pooran Singh Shahkot and president Harmeet Singh Qadian.They said that while potato crop was going waste, the seeds for next maize crop had been made expensive. They also opposed giving out river waters from Punjab saying state was already grappling with water crisis as underground water table had severely depleted."

The farmers said they spend nearly Rs 22,000 to cultivate potatoes in a bigha of land but are unable to get good returns. Social worker Chand Mamud said prices have gone down to Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg and farmers have no option but to sell their produce at low prices owing to lack of cold storage facilities. The farmers cannot sell them in the district headquarters markets either as cost of transportation is high. Mandia is the potato hub in the district, where 98 per cent farmers grow the tuber. The village, having a population over 3,500, is 10km southwest of the Barpeta district headquarters. Farmers in the village buy potato seeds, fertilizers and pesticides at high prices to grow the crop commercially. Most of them even take loans from private lenders at high interest. The village also lacks irrigation facility and due to which the farmers have to spend money to irrigate their potato fields. Prices of potato at Barpeta Road market varies between Rs 5 to Rs 10 a kilo as traders brings them from Nainital and Bengal. The production in the state has gone up since the agriculture department started distribution of the Kufri Jyoti potato variety for free from 2001 to 2014. ""This year, less rainfall in the winter helped potato production, said senior department officer Dipok Tamuli. Nagaon, Morigaon, Sonitpur, Biswanath Chariali, Barpeta and Darrang are the main potato growing districts in Assam. Agriculture department officials said abundance of quality seeds, coupled with favourable weather are the two main reasons for increase in production of potato in the state. ""Productivity of Pukhraj variety of seeds is almost double and that results maximum potato production,"" said Tamuli. The agriculture department distributed 20,924 quintals of Pukhraj and 1,860 quintals of Khyati variety of seeds among farmers this year. Both the varieties are from Punjab and known as short-duration, disease-resistant and cold-tolerant varieties. ""These varieties could be harvested in 100 days so farmers could opt for another crop assoon as the potato is harvested. Productivity is 15 to 20 times of the seed,"" said Seed Corporation of India managing director, M.P. Rownier."

Lucky (10), could not open his eyes when he saw the sunlight first time in four years. They were beaten with hammers for reasons such as cooking extra rice, dozing off at work and even trying to go to the washroom during work.Their job was to cut threads of jeans and pack it. The task was to pack 10 pieces in 10 minutes and the one who finished last used to be beaten with a hammer by the employer. The tale of extreme torture was disclosed by the 26 boys, in the age group of 8 to 13, who were rescued from a jeans factory in northeast Delhis Seelampur area last month.We were allowed to sleep at 5 am and the employer used to wake us up at 7 am. In between work, if we fell asleep, he used to wake us up by hitting us with a hammer. For four years, we were having two meals in a day - potato and rice. The menu never changed and we were not allowed to go out of the room even for a second, said Raheem, a 7-year-old boy, who was brought in to the factory six months ago.Shyam, who has seen at least five new boys coming every month, could not move on his own when he was rescued. He had to be lifted. Now, we are giving him physiotherapy and he has started moving his feet. Almost every boy has injury marks on their body and has vitamin deficiency. We have never seen this kind of torture in our life, said a member of Bachpan Bachao Andolan, an NGO run by Nobel Laureate Kailash Satyarthi. The NGO runs a children home Mukti Ashram in north Delhis Burari, where these boys are staying and getting treatment so that they can lead a normal life.We were kept in a small room and I have not seen the sunlight in four years. When, I was rescued, I could not open my eyes as I was not used to it. We were not allowed to take bath or go to washroom since every day we used to pack 5,000 pieces of jeans, said Lucky.All boys are from Motihari district of Bihar and were brought to Delhi around six months ago. Six of them are from the same village, indicating that they could have been victims of child trafficking.I am furious. Twenty six child slaves were rescued and most of them have not even seen daylight in four years. I recall a similar case from 1983 when all 27 children we freed from the carpet industry in Mirzapur were beaten, branded, hanged upside down on trees, said Satyarthi.He said there is little change even after three decades. Each child rescued from Seelampur has faced the worst form of slavery. Their hands are scarred, they carry burn marks all over their bodies and their arms have signs of torture.Are children not safe anywhere, not even in the capital of the country? Slavery is not a myth. Child abuse and violence against children are all harsh realities surrounding us. We have to wake up to this bitter truth. I strongly demand fast track courts, child friendly court procedures and time bound trials so that our children and their childhoods do not have to wait, said Satyarthi.The case began to unravel after six children roaming at Anand Vihar railway station were noticed by NGO Childline on February 3. The children said that they had fled from the factory and wanted to go back to their hometown. They also told the NGO that there are many other children trapped in the factory.The matter was brought to the notice of the Child Welfare Committee which asked police and NGO to conduct a raid at the location described by the children.A joint team conducted the raid in Seelampur and 20 more children were rescued on the same day. The children were confined in one room and were living in pathetic conditions. Police also arrested the owner of the jeans factory.According to a global survey report, India has the largest population of modern slaves in the world, with more than 18 million people trapped as bonded labourers, forced beggars, sex workers and child soldiers. The Global Slavery Index by human rights organisation Walk Free Foundation said the number was 1.4% of Indias population.*Names have been changed to protect identity"

Congress circulated video clips of Rahuls election speech to stub out Modis coconut juice jibe.Rahul Gandhis video is universally available. You must watch it... He didnt speak about coconuts, but about pineapple juice. Prime Minister Modi is just making up things, said Randeep Singh Surjewala, incharge of the AICC communication department.Surjewala hit back at the BJP, dubbing it a Bahut Jhoothi Paathshala (School of Lies) and describing Modi as a professor in the art of peddling lies.Modi should stop being the professor of lies and must apologise not to the Congress alone, but to the entire nation for misleading the people by falsifying the words of the leader of the principal Opposition party, he said. At a rally in Maharajganj on Wednesday, Modi had ribbed Rahul over selling Made in Manipur coconut juice in London and setting up potato factories.Rahuls coconut juice remarks could be traced to inaccurate reports in a section of the media about his speech in Manipur.You grow lemon, oranges, pineapples here. I want a day when someone will drink pineapple juice in London and see Made in Manipur on the pack, Rahul had said at a rally on Tuesday. It seemed the BJP managers had picked certain inaccurate media reports to ridicule Rahul.On the campaign trail, when Modi dished out the acronym SCAM to refer to the Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh Yadav and Mayawati, Rahul tried to turn the tables, saying SCAM stood for Service, Courage, Ability and Modesty."

Unable to sell their produce, angry farmers in the Doaba region have dumped 500 quintals of potato on the road, causing a traffic jam on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway.The Punjab government had asked Markfed and National Agriculture Cooperative Marketing Federation of India (NAFED) to procure the potato crop, but they had failed to do so. So, we dumped about 500 quintals of potatoes on the main chowk in Kartarpur on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway, said Harmeet Singh Kadian, State president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation ensured they could not pay for it.Usually, Punjab farmers sell around 200 quintals of potato seed at the rate of `3,000 per quintal. This time, the losses are estimated at Rs 1,500 crore. Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. But then the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.Post-demonetisation and the coming of the new crop, there has been a crash in potato prices. Now, potatoes are selling at Rs 1.50 to Rs 2 per kg compared to Rs 8 to Rs 10 per kg earlier, said J S Sangha, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association general secretary.Farmers should dump the potato outside banks if the government doesnt support them in anyway. The crop dumped yesterday was just a trailer. We will dump the whole crop across the State, as storing it in cold storage costs us much more.In an attempt to resolve the crisis, the Punjab government is now trying to export the crop to Russia and Iran."
58f508237be9e018510a1e5b,Bengal opens farm trade,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170303/jsp/bengal/story_138748.jsp,2017-03-03,"Calcutta, March 2: The Mamata Banerjee government today amended the agriculture produce marketing act to allow the entry of major private players in the trade so that better prices were ensured for commodities produced by farmers. But senior bureaucrats said the measure would work if the state's opposition to policies like contract farming was reconsidered. In the amendment passed in the Assembly, the government has made it clear that any company could trade in agriculture produces by securing a single licence, which can be obtained from Calcutta. As of now, the West Bengal Agricultural Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, 1972, prevents a company from doing business freely as it needs to obtain licences separately for more than 300 regulated markets in the state. ""The amendment will make the trade in the agriculture produce sector easy for any agency. A bigger market will be opened for farmers,"" said agricultural marketing minister Tapan Dasgupta. But senior officials feel opening the market for major private players would not help farmers realise proper price. ""Opening the market for major players is a good move but some other steps like allowing contract farming is required to make things happen for farmers,"" said a senior Nabanna official, who added that major private players needed agriculture produces of certain quality and variety for their business. For example, the official explained, multinational companies, which make potato chips, need chipsona variety. ""Bengal is a major producer of potato... But it produces mainly table variety of potato, which would not attract multinational companies here even if the procedure of doing business is made easy,"" the official added. Bengal produces a large quantity of jyoti variety, known as the table variety and not used by food processing units. The farmers face a lot of troubles in realising prices for rice and potato, two major agriculture produces in the state. In case of rice, Bengal produces common varieties but private players need special aroma rice, which could be produced if contract farming is allowed. ""Farmers would get seeds and fertiliser from agencies and a secured buyer for their produces if contract farming is allowed. If the markets don't have enough quality produce, no company would enter the trade. So, making the market useful for private players is equally important,"" said an agriculture department official. A section of officials, however, said there was a silver line in the horizon after the government prepared a policy to allow private players to go for an indirect form of contract farming in the horticulture sector. ""According to the plan, the private players have to sign contract with the farmers' co-operatives, not an individual farmer, for produces like flower and some vegetables. This gives us hope that the government could rethink its policy of not allowing contract farming in the state,"" said an official."

These are expected to be completed by March, 2018.Official sources said there is hadly any response from private promoters to set up cold stores in tribal-dominated backward districts despite huge subsidy offered by the Government. While the subsidy for new cold stores in plain area is 55 per cent of the project cost subject to a maximum limit of Rs 2.20 lakh, the subsidy amount is Rs 2.80 lakh for scheduled areas.Under the mission, the State Government had planned to bring about 60,000 hectares under potato cultivation to achieve a production of about 11.25 lakh tonnes and 1.42 lakh tonnes of seed potato by 2017-18. However, the area coverage under potato cultivation has been marginally over 25,000 hectares in 2016-17.Referring to a survey conducted by National Centre for Cold-chain Development (NCCD) and NABARD Consultancy Services (NABCONS), the Minister said the State required additional cold store capacity of 2.88 lakh tonnes.In a bid to raise vegetable production in the State, the Government had decided in 2015 to set up 150 new cold stores under PPP mode by 2019. Though the decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik, there is hardly any progress due to lack of response from private partners, the sources added."

That is why I was reluctant when invited to the Pullman Hotel in the area known as Aerocity, near the Indira Gandhi International Airport, some days ago. But I did finally go there, and had such a happy meal that I resolved to step into uncharted territories.The meal was at its pan-Asian restaurant called Honk. The dcor is cheerful and the lights are dazzling. From the ceiling hangs this enormous chandelier, with slender lights casting a bright glow over the place. Well lit restaurants lift my mood, so I saw that as a good sign.I had an interesting conversation with the two chefs  Ajay Anand, culinary director, and Deepak Malhotra, executive sous chef  about the food that they cook. The menu seeks to celebrate what is essentially the street food of Southeast and East Asian countries. And since it is a fine dining restaurant, the food is served most aesthetically, which, to my mind, always adds to the taste and flavours.It was a sumptuous meal  consisting of, among other things, Asian greens with bean sprouts and avocado, duck and sour cherry dumplings, Jade prawn har gow perfume de hen dumplings and leaf wrapped Chilean sea bass. The greens were excellent; the avocado giving a light kick to the dish flavoured with sweet sesame. The jade touch to the har gow dumplings came from some wasabi, and the casing had been pierced with a syringe filled with strong chicken stock, which was the perfume de hen that the dish promised. The fish, nicely moist, came in a delightful buttered garlic sauce.You know my fondness for pork, so its no surprise that I hugely enjoyed the Singapore style pork ribs. The pork was tender and had soaked in the flavours of Chinese five spices, star anise and Schezwan pepper. The meat had been braised for two hours over a very low flame, which helped trap all the juices and spices in it. Likewise, the Nanjing style duck had the predominant flavours of star anise and Shaoxing wine. The meat, lightly powdered with potato starch, had been flash fried on high heat  which meant the duck was crisp from the outside, and meltingly soft within.I am on and off sweets these days  well, actually I must admit that I am more on than off  but I decided that to round off what was a very satisfying meal I needed to have something sweet. I had a spoonful of the jasmine flavoured crme brulee and warm ginger cake with a blob of raspberry and ginger ice cream. The caramel chocolate and peanut parfait was perfect  sweet and just mildly salted.The dinner at Honk made me realise that there is a world out there waiting to be conquered. A wise man had said that you need to dig deep for sweet water. And you have to travel just that extra mile for a memorable meal."
5922bf887be9e01fceefab76,Children in this ashram dream big,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/599555/children-ashram-dream-big.html,2017-03-04,"Channu Patagundi in Nashik, March 5, 2017, DHNS 0:17 ISTKids hit by agrarian crisis are under one roofStudents walk 4 km to study in government schoolAshok Patil is 14-year-old and is studying in 9th standard at a government school in Nashik district in Maharashtra. His aim is to clear civil services examination and become a district collector and help farmers in distress. Innocence and confidence on his face fail to reveal the travails the teenager has faced in the last few years. He is building a life for himself after his father, a cotton farmer in Gadchiroli district, committed suicide unable to clear mounting debts.He can hope to achieve his goal, thanks to Adhartirth Adharaashram, a first-of-its-kind ashram in the country which houses children of farmers who are victims of the agrarian crisis in Maharashtra.There are many like Ashok, who are dreaming amid deep crisis and personal grief. As many as 100 children from 30 districts are in the ashram located on the outskirts of Triambakeshwar, a holy shrine for Hindus. Spread over three acres, the ashram is managed by the 21-member trust, which was setup by Triambakrao Gaekwad in 2007.Trustees are still building the infrastructure for the ashram and improve facilities to accommodate more children. With a picturesque hill in the background, the land was bought by raising Rs 15 lakh through donations. The ashram has a dining hall and it is in dire need of repairs. Children work in the kitchen garden and grow vegetables such as potato and daikon and they are used in the ashram. It also has a spacious multi-purpose meeting hall and dormitory for children. Toilets and bathroom are being constructed.Gaekwad, the founder-president of Adhartirth Adharaashram, is the son of a farmer. He says: In 2007, a farmer committed suicide in Amaravati because he could not repay a mere Rs 1.5 lakh debt. He left behind his young wife and children. I was distraught at the vulnerability of fatherless children and helpless widows. That made me think of securing the future of such farmers' children.Gaekwad discussed the plight of farmers with his friends who are also from agricultural background. The idea took concrete shape and the ashram was started on a small scale with five children. The ashram admitted more children as donations started pouring in. Five women, who saw their husbands end life unable to repay debt, work in the kitchen for a monthly remuneration of Rs 400. Called mousi by children, they stay on the campus. Sankri Thethale, wife of a sarpanch who committed suicide, is secretary of the trust.Ashram has 16 orphas, including nine girls. Lovingly called ""appa"" by children, Gaekwad is worried about the future of these children. ""God only knows about their future Gaekwad says as he looks at them. The children wake up at 5.30 am, offer prayers and take breakfast before walking to the government school in Talegaon village, which is 4 km from the ashram. After school, the children spend some time in shram daan and clean the premises.Interestingly, senior students perform the role of caretakers and mentors for new entrants. When juniors fall sick, seniors tend to their needs.Jana Chaudhary from Yavatmal has been in the ashram for nearly nine years. She said children are divided into groups to perform daily chores. Group's eldest member takes care of the needs of juniors. The seniors wash clothes, make their bed and ready school bags. ""We take care of each other as siblings. We know all of us are from the same background,"" she says.Weekends are special days as philanthropists, guests visit the ashram to share their happiness. Birthdays are celebrated with the children and they have breakfast, lunch and dinner along with them. Ashram children wait for the celebrations as they get sweets and cakes on those days. Every time guests come to the ashram, the children offer prayers, entertain them by singing and performing dance to Marathi and Hindi numbers.Manoj Ambre, a Pune-based techie, celebrated his son's second birthday in the ashram. Manoj says, It is difficult to think of the mental state the children are in. Every day Rs 8,000 is spent on food and on special occasions, expenditure touches Rs 12,000. Without constant support from the donors, it is a daunting task to meet the needs of the children.Two years after the ashram was started, Gaekwad read a news item about the suicide of a young farmer. He visited the bereaved family in Chandori village in Niphad taluk. Along with children, he noticed the impact of the children's visit on villagers. Then he decided to run a campaign urging farmers not to commit suicide.Based on the reallife stories and agony of families, songs and dramas were penned. A fortnight in every January is reserved for the campaign, which covers Vidarbha and Marathwada regions. They start the campaign on January 12 , birth anniversary of Swami Vivekananda and Jijamaata, mother of the great Maratha king Shivaji. They commence the tour by offering prayers at the birthplace of Jijamaata in Buldhana district.At least 40 boys and girls accompanied by their mausi take part in the campaign. Children enact 10 minutes street plays which depict the problems children and dependents face in the event of the head of the family resorting to suicide unable to face financial problems. The aim of the plays is to convince farmers against taking the extreme step, which affects their beloved. Children also make efforts to convince villagers to quit alcohol and other bad habits. Children meet families in despair and console them.Adhartirth Adharaashram has made a name through its work and is highly respected in Marathwada and Vidarbha regions. Gaekwad says there could be hundreds of children in need of facilities offered in his ashram.But we do not have financial resources to accommodate more children, he says.He is hoping that the government will come to the aid of the ashram and help it continue its services. He feels that it will be difficult to run the ashram only on public donations."
58f55739a3d24b0b70c20249,Ear to the ground,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/ear-to-the-ground/article17404927.ece,2017-03-04,"Appraising the vote:In Kalan, numerically there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. Susheela Devi (far right) stands with her neighbours in the village. (Below) An old Thakur house.R.V. MoorthyThe sprawling village of Kalan is set in 1,200 bighas of fertile land in the southeastern corner of Uttar Pradeshs Sultanpur district. An early spring sun filters through the trees onto the ruins of Somit Pratap Singhs hereditary home. He is supervising the building of his new home, as the mountain of bricks before which he sits suggests. Somit has just completed his MSc from the Shri Vishwanath Degree College nearby and hopes to become a primary school teacher, once the Assembly elections conclude and recruitment is resumed.Three days before polling in the Kadipur Assembly constituency (February 27), in which this village falls, we talk about the electoral prospects of the parties in the fray. Its BJP versus BSP here, he says confidently. His vote, like that of his fellow Thakurs, will go to the kamal ka phool (lotus, the BJP symbol). He suddenly rushes off and returns with a large notebook, flips it open and shows me a family tree he has drawn up painstakingly. It goes back two centuries. Its important that future generations know who their ancestors were, he stresses.The Thakurs, BJP loyalistsIndeed, pride in their heritage is a recurring theme with the Thakurs who dominate the village politically, own the largest tracts of land, and are patrons of education. Kalan has many shortcomings, but it has an array of educational options in its immediate vicinity from the government school and degree college to the swish Shivbrat Childrens Academy and an engineering college: it ensures that virtually every child here is getting an education. The last named is administered by Uma Shankar Singh, the former pradhan of Kalan, who studied at Mumbais K.C. College and the Mafatlal Institute before embarking on a 25-year-long career in textile quality control that included a stint at Subbu Textiles in Tamil Nadus Erode district.Rajendra Bahadur Singh, a primary school teacher in a neighbouring village, claims his familys arrival in these parts predates Rana Pratap  a Thakur icon  who ruled in the sixteenth century. His ancestors, he says, came as horse traders from Amer in Rajasthan, overthrew the Rajbhars who were the local rulers at the time and settled down in the village of Khanpur Pilai, less than five km from Kalan. Today, he proclaims proudly, Our clan of Kachwaha Thakurs is spread over 52 villages and the Rajbhars work on our land. But we dont have any social relations with them.Its a given that Rajendra and his family, including his elder brother who holds a PhD in sociology from Lucknow University and has done research work at Delhis Jawaharlal Nehru University, will vote BJP. It is the only nationalist party  all educated people will vote for Narendra Modi, he says.And then he adds, This time, the Rajbhars, who are traditional BSP supporters and even voted for the party in 2014, have shifted to the BJP. The reason? A brand-new Rajbhar party, the Bharatiya Samaj Party, that takes its inspiration from Raja Suhel Dev, ironically enough the Rajbhar king who was defeated by the Thakurs, has allied itself with the BJP this time.Rajbhars shifting right?In Kalan, the Rajbhars, an OBC community, are numerically larger than the Thakurs but, barring the Musahars (earlier rat catchers but now landless labourers), are the poorest in the village. Its members largely live below the poverty line. A handful are marginal cultivators not even growing enough to feed their families, while the vast majority are landless labourers here.The Rajbhar quarter in the village is a tongue of land surrounded on three sides by lush green fields of paddy and mustard. But most of it belongs to another OBC community, the Badhais, traditionally makers of agricultural tools, but whose secondary occupation is cultivation.The crowded mud hovels in which the Rajbhars live are a far cry from the well-lit havelis and whitewashed bungalows of the Thakurs, equipped with modern conveniences. Some have laid out their string beds outside their homes. To protect themselves from the elements and the mosquitoes, they have opened out used fertiliser bags and stitched them into mosquito net-like canopies for their beds.Our ancestors left us no land, says Sanichara sadly, so we work on the lands of the Thakurs and the Badhais. Rajpati and Mala join in the conversation to complain they have the  lal rang ka card  (BPL card) but dont get any of the welfare benefits that others seem to enjoy. No one cares whether we are alive or dead, says Mala. We have no proper drains or toilets, and a kucha (unpaved) road leads to our dwellings. Her nephew, Munna, is a mason who has seen a bit of life outside the village. Look at Bihar: have you seen the pitch (tarred) roads there? he says enviously. Here we were told that everyone with a red BPL card would get a free bulb, and pay Rs. 25 on electricity. But we are being made to pay Rs. 270. In the hand-to-mouth existence that they live, that makes a big hole in their meagre earnings.So has anyone come to seek your votes, I ask. Yes, says Rajpati, someone from the BSP. But when I ask who they are voting for, the women say,  Kono palan nahin (We havent decided yet). Mala adds,  Jahan public jutegi wahan jayenge (Wherever the majority is going, we will follow).Sanicharas father-in-law, Motinath, with matted long hair and a straggly unkempt beard, is more forthcoming: The cycle [the SP symbol] is looking at its community, the elephant [the BSP symbol] at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal .As I turn to leave, there is a surprise. Sanichara, Rajpati and Mala follow me. As soon as they are out of earshot distance from their menfolk, they grab my arm and whisper in my ear: We like Mayawati: we have attended her rallies in the past. We are going to vote for her. Dont you think thats a good idea?Camp BSP: the DalitsIf the Thakurs of Kalan have memories of military triumphs stretching over several centuries that gives them the self-confidence to take on the challenges of life, the BSP phenomenon has empowered the Dalits over the last 25 years. Indeed, though Akbarpur, the birthplace of the socialist leader, Ram Manohar Lohia, is less than 40 km away, only old-timers in the village have fleeting memories of him, with a statue and a few educational institutions named after him there. Instead, with BSP founder Kanshi Ram making this region  of which Kalan is a part  one of his social laboratories, it is the BSP that continues to have influence here.In Kalan, numerically too there are roughly the same number of Dalit families as there are Thakur households, adding to their sense of power. As I walk to the Dalit quarter, right at the heart of the village, this is immediately visible, especially among the women and the younger generation.Uneducated Dalits like Ramachal and his wife Usha are marginal farmers, who supplement their income by carrying bricks at building sites. But they have nothing left at the end of the month. Ramachals ailing father gets a pension, but thats about it. They complain about notebandi (the demonetisation exercise) and are a bit subdued, but their eldest child, Sonu, who is in Class XI at the local government school, is not. He says he wants to be an engine driver and see the world. His mother butts in to say sourly, Where will we get the money for the bribe? But Sonu remains cool and instead explains the Pythagorean theorem with aplomb  a tribute both to him and the school where he studies.At 17, he doesnt have a vote but clearly takes an interest in politics, for it is he who says that his parents will vote for the elephant.  Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants, Sonu stresses.Like Sonu, one of their neighbours, Sunita Devi, who works at an Anganwadi, has her own world view. An attractive young married woman, she is the mother of three little girls, and has studied till Class X. Modi had said ghar ghar sauchalaya [a toilet in every house], but we have no toilets yet, she says. We will vote for Behenji because she gives the most benefits. When my eldest child was born, she was in power and the government gave Rs. 1 lakh insurance for the baby. When my daughter turns 18, I can use the accrued money for her marriage.I tell Sunita I had heard that a BJP representative visited the Dalit quarter, and ask her what she thinks of the Prime Minister. Yes, Rajesh Kumar [a BJP activist] came here and said, vote for kamal ka phool. I told him we are haathi [elephant] people, so forget about it. And then she takes off on the Central government: I was expecting my third child last November and had gone to my parents home in Azamgarh district. Thanks to notebandi , my parents had such a tough time raising the Rs. 5,000 for me to have the child at a private hospital.So what does she expect of the Prime Minister? When we choose a Prime Minister, we do it in the hope that he creates a harmonious atmosphere, and works for the welfare of all the people. Then everyone will be happy. We dont expect notebandi  everyone sitting at home and crying, she says.If the Dalit women are committed Mayawati supporters, some of the men are considering other options. Ramprakash, a bus conductor who earns Rs. 4,000 a month, says, We are haathiwalen but its not necessary that we will all vote BSP. Modi has done some good work: lets try him once. His fiery young wife, Shashikala, and their neighbour, Meera, turn on him: Rubbish! He has done nothing. We women at any rate will vote BSP.And then comes another surprise. Meera says, Our grown-up sons are considering another option  Akhilesh Yadav [of the SP], because he has given cycles and laptops.The split backward voteBut Mayawati has other admirers among the backward castes. In Kalan, there are half-a-dozen homes of the Lohars, traditional blacksmiths, but who have now turned to carpentry, with many moving to Mumbai. The Lohars have some land, but it is not enough to feed them. Saroja Surajlal Vishwakarma, the young daughter-in-law of one Lohar household, is an ardent Modi admirer. But her aunt-in-law, Parvati, who lives in Mumbai and is here on vacation, hates the Prime Minister. She had to pawn her jewellery to get her husband treated after demonetisation devastated their carpentry business. Someone who begs for your votes should not oppress you. Life was best for women under Mayawati. I have been to her rallies, she says firmly.But not all communities who vote BSP have been empowered. Take Kalans only Musahar family. Ram Chander, his two brothers, and his wife Lakshmina, who suffers from a nervous disorder, live on the edge of the village. Three decades back, they lived in a small room in the nearby kasba , and would travel to Kalan for work. One day, a Thakur said that he would give them a piece of land in exchange for which they would have to make sal leaf pattals (plates) and clear away the soiled plates. Now no one eats from those plates and they do odd jobs to eke out an existence. They also have a little stall on the main road where they sell chewable tobacco, potato crisps and toffees.If the Lohars are divided, another backward caste, the Chaurasias, traditional betel growers and a community that has social relations with the Thakurs, are firmly with the BJP. Kalans current pradhan Bimla Devi was away in Mumbai to attend to her husband Chottey Lal, who is admitted in a hospital there after he sustained a heart attack. They have a thriving betel leaf and motor parts business in that city. That is evident from the imposing three-storey house they are building in the village, with tiered, carved balconies that curve around the structure.Their younger son, Krishna, who has a BSc degree, is standing in for his mother. He reels off all the improvements he has made to the village  drains, roads, electricity  and says he hopes to contest the seat when it is de-reserved. His elder brother Mukesh, who is going to sit for the entrance exams for a government job, and he are both BJP supporters. Mukesh says he likes the BJP but wishes the party would not try and divide society  also he makes it clear that reservation for OBCs must continue. But Krishna likes the party for its anti-Muslim stance: They tease our girls in Muslim-dominated areas and the SP gives them protection, he says, adding, I want Yogi Adityanath to be Chief Minister.In Kalan, however, the Muslims are a miniscule minority, no more than six families, two of whom live on one edge of the village. But the two  related to each other  have quarrelled over land, and a wall separates their homes. Tabassum is a young widow. She and her daughter live with her mother and sister-in-law. They have no land, so her brother who works in Mumbai sends home money to support them. My daughter, Saina Bano, has friends at the private school she attends, but none in the village. For much of the year, they live in splendid isolation: Most people dont know we are Muslims, so we go and play Holi, she says and then adds, We invite people for Bakrid. Yes, she will vote, she says. I hear people are voting for Mayawati. Ill do the same.Akhileshs Yadavs?The Yadavs in Kalan are predictably supporters of the SP: they are largely educated and financially on a stable footing. Sangeeta, a young housewife who also works at an Anganwadi, lives in a joint family. Her brother-in-law Rajesh has an MA degree and is looking for a job. But the family has enough land to not only to feed itself but also sell in the open market. Everyone here says they are voting SP, but it is the younger members who answer the difficult questions. The cherubic-looking Saurabh is only 16, but clearly sharper than his elders: when I ask the family what they have to say about the Yadavs cornering all the benefits, it is he who responds, measuring his words carefully: Do only OBCs walk on the roads or benefit from the ambulances and police vans? Are they the only ones who get pensions? Yes, there may be many Yadavs in the police and forces because we are a martial people. But the bureaucracy is dominated by Kayasthas and Brahmins. Why not talk about that?And then Saurabh springs a surprise. He will be of voting age by 2019 and he says: I am very impressed by Modis personality. I think many in my family will vote BJP in 2019. His uncles demur but he has let the cat out of the bag. After SP patriarch Mulayam Singh Yadav came to power, through the 1990s and the 2000s, political power helped the Yadavs prosper materially and enter the middle class. Their aspirations have changed and many no longer wish to be associated with a party associated with lathi-wielding musclemen. If the advent of the polished Akhilesh Yadav has held them back, the results of the current elections could well determine the future voting patterns of the community.The cycle is looking at its community, the elephant at its community. We are trying something new: well vote for the kamal (lotus).Motinath Behenji [BSP chief Mayawati] ran a very good government and the BSP is our party. We are all elephants.sonuOur grown-up sons are considering Akhilesh Yadav because he has given cycles and laptops.Meera"

BSP chief Mayawati during an election rally.Time: 12.45 pmPlace: Inter College ground, Jagatpur, VaranasiMayawatis rally was scheduled for 1 pm, but her audience had started to come in from 10 am. Thousands of them, mostly from the eight assembly segments that make up the Prime Ministers Lok Sabha constituency, all voting in the final phase of the elections on March 8.They came on three wheelers, buses and tempos, and filled the venue in a slow, orderly fashion. Many said they were given food and transport by local village leaders.The election rallies of the BSP leader are like no other in Uttar Pradesh. They are attended by those at the very bottom of the caste and economic pyramid, and are filled with vivid images of the inequalities that lie at the heart of her Dalit politics. Of the 25,000-plus people  including over 8,000 women  at Saturdays rally, perhaps not even a hundred could be called middle class or upper class.The women were in brightly coloured synthetic saris  mostly made in Surat  paired with plastic or synthetic rubber shoes, sandals or chappals. All, old and young, wore metal jewellery with a fake silver or gold shine. Some, both men and women, munched on chana or moongfali in 50-paise packets, or a fried mixture that cost Re 1. There was drinking water  not clean  in loose plastic bags, and a vendor sold colourful icecream of a brand called Madhu. There were no public toilets anywhere near the venue.Over an hour past the scheduled time, there is no sign of Behen Kumari Mayawati. But there are no complaints, no restlessness, not even a murmur in the huge crowd. From the stage, slogans reverberate: Chalo chalein sarkar banayein, haathi wala button dabayein, BSP ki kya pehchaan, neela jhanda, haathi nishaan.Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo) Ravita (on right) at Mayawatis rally. (Express photo)It is 30 degrees, and directly in the sun sits Ravita Kumari, a 23-year-old mother of two children. She has come to listen to Mayawati with Jeevati Devi, Nirmala and Phoolmati from Jagdishpur. He husband Chhotelal, she says, has studied computtery, and has a mobile shop.Asked if she didnt feel warm in her synthetic sari, Ravita said, Hum chhoti jaat hain, suti (cotton) bahut mehenga hai.How much money does your husband give you every month?Kuchho nahin (Nothing). Rs 5 for Lifebuoy soap, a small tikiya. I use Clinic shampoo once a year. I spend Rs 2 on sindoor every month. The gold bangles Ravita wears are for Rs 70, her ring costs Rs 10, her sari Rs 150. The family has a cow, she says, which gives three litres of milk every day. But the cow eats a lot  khaati bahut hai. The family buys 500 kilos or more of bhusa every year for her.Ravitas monthly household budget is Rs 500  thats all that they have left after paying her elder sons Rs-600 school fees. I dont have Ujjawala gas (the Prime Ministers ambitious scheme to provide LPG connections to BPL households) or a toilet at home. Dont ask me why. Our village elders never keep our name in the list (for cooking gas connections). If Mayawatis government comes, we will have more money, she says.As of now, Ravitas ration card gets her 8 kg of rice and 12 kg of wheat for free, and her husband manages another 25 kg of chaawal every month. In our colony, there is no voltage, the fan hardly moves, and bulbs are like dots of light. My biceps pain because I have to draw groundwater daily. The water pump does not work properly, and the thakur in our village doesnt allow us to enter his farm to get water.(Express photo) (Express photo)There are hundreds of women like her at the rally venue, Ravita says. Except old women, all of them work on the thakurs farm, but get no money. The thakur only gives them 6 kilos of wheat every day. Those who work on potato farms are allowed to take a few kilos home. But these are green potatoes, and not of good quality. Landowners never pay us cash.Suddenly, Ravita is distracted. A chopper has appeared in the sky. The crowd rises as one. Ravita is with them, clapping.Mayawati climbs on to the stage. Ravitas eyes are moist, her face is glowing with joy. Kaisi hai? Achchi hai na? she asks.Mayawati ignores the BSP leaders on the stage and starts reading her long speech. Two parties are holding roadshows in Varanasi to occupy the second and third places in this election, she says. Narendra Modi can pray at as many temples as he likes, but he is not going to get results. This is because, she says, the BJP will never be united while I have united the Dalits, and Muslims have added to their heft.Have you got even one rupee in your accounts? Did you get a job after Modi became PM? Has even a rupee of farmers debt been removed so far? Its time to send Narendra Modi back to Gujarat, she says to huge applause.Modi ne chamchon (cronies) ko khadaa kar phoolon ki varsha karaai. He is not going to get the blessings of even his cronies. They dont show it, but they are very unhappy with him. Modis party is daagi-baagion ki party. Many men in the crowd laugh heartily.Mayawati then goes back many years, and starts to read out the history of V P Singhs government, and how the BJP, pursuing its anti-Mandal politics, had forced him to resign. Ravita and Jeevati have begun to doze, and some women start to leave. Other women in blue saris, lathis in hand, tell them to remain seated. They follow the order.On the stage, Mayawati says she has come to know from reliable sources that if the BJP comes to power, it will abolish reservation. Akhilesh Yadav is no better, she says  he is Modis nephew, because Modi considers Mulayam Singh Yadav his elder brother. The chief minister is Sa-pa (Samajwadi Party) ka babua, who doesnt know what he is talking. Now, SP ke babua ko bhabhi (Dimple Yadav) bhi nahin bachaa sakti.As Mayawatis chopper leaves, the crowd starts to move out as it had come in  in a slow, orderly fashion. Ravita comes running to this correspondent. Are you going to get me Ujjawala gas? she asks.And then, coming closer, says, Mere pati ko naukri dilwaye, mujhe gas nahin chahiye.For all the latest Elections News, download Indian Express App"

The imported white wines Villa Antinori from Toscana and Ricossa Gavi DOCG from Piemonte and the red wine Santa Cristina from Tuscany are perfect accompaniments. The fruity Toscana wine complements the earthy starters.The other white wine from Piemonte is more citrusy and goes well with the rich, creamy texture of buckwheat pasta (which tastes like ragi). The crunchy and meaty chicken is also paired well with the sour red wine.The raw and marinated vegetables such as zucchini, carrots and broccoli served on a layer of basil cream cheese in the starter Insalata di Vergue di Prato (Lombardia) taste fresh.The menu reads the vegetables are grilled, and they been rightly done without being smoked or charred. A specialty of Lombardia, a region in North Italy known for its art and culture, the dish is healthy and filling.Then comes the soup. The La Cisra (piemonte) is a chickpeas soup served with winter vegetables. It takes us by surprise as chickpeas is an unusual ingredient in soup.The chef informs us that this soup is usually prepared with pork in Italy. As in India more people prefer vegetarian to meat, he prepared the soup with the stalk of chickpeas. The boiled carrots and onions in the soup make it chunkier and more colourful.Unlike the usual Italian pasta preparations with tomato, Pizzoccheri di Teglio (V) (Lombardia) is prepared with buckwheat fresh pasta, potato and savoy cabbage. It has a creamy texture, yet is healthy. The buckwheat pasta slices had a strong, bordering bitter flavour.Price for two: Rs 5,000"

Shivakumar, CEO, PepsiCo India Holdings Private Ltd., said, we have nothing to do with PETA [People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, a non-government organisation].Asserting that Pepsi had been a partner of Indian farmers all along, he said sustainability had been a crucial component of its partnership with Indian farmers. Pointing to the technology support and extension programmes that Pepsi had been providing to potato growers in the country, he said the focus of the exercise was to touch the entire value chain  from input provision to facilitating financial support and product procurement. The resultant ecosystem, he said, helped farmers improve yield, get higher price and earn predictable income.Mr. Shivakumar said Pepsi would try to extend similar support to those cultivating crops such as mango. Our effort is very much aligned to the countrys big need of doubling farmers income by 2022. We continue to invest into areas which are very important to farmers, he said.Pepsi, he said, was working with close to 24,000 potato growers. We have brought in Frito Lay variety of seeds into India. Farmers have a buy-back agreement with us, and their income have gone up by 35% over the last 2-3 years, he added.Mr. Shivakumar asserted that we are water positive. In this context, he said, Pepsi had given back 12.75 billion litres of water in 2015 alone through assorted conservation and replenishment initiatives. In Tamil Nadu, especially, Pepsi was water positive by 1.5 billion litres in 2015, he added.The three manufacturing facilities it had in Tamil Nadu provided direct jobs to 3,500 people. A release claimed that PepsiCo Foundation invested $17.6 million (close to Rs. 114 crore) between 2008-2016 for programmes related to WASH (Swacch Bharat) and improved access to clean drinking water, benefiting more than four million people across the country.Tamil Nadu is one of the key markets from the point of our investments, brand stature and community initiatives, he said. His statement must be viewed in the context of a recent call for ban on sales of Pepsi and Coca Cola drinks in the state by local traders associations.Reinforcing the 3 P thrust (on people, product and planet), Mr. Shivakumar said Pepsi would fully fit into the Prime Ministers Make in India campaign even as it sought to transform its product portfolio to contain more health products. We have a vision of this. And, we have a plan as well, he said.Innovation and local tastes would be the focal point of this transformation, he said. All these would make Pepsi more than a carbonated soft drink. In this context, he asserted that the introduction of Quaker products would transform the way breakfast was taken by the Indian people."
5903e3157be9e02646bd90bd,Deadly bacteria and ineffective antibiotics,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/599726/deadly-bacteria-ineffective-antibiotics.html,2017-03-05,"Deadly bacteria and ineffective antibioticsSuma Sarojini, March 6, 2017 23:35 ISTRecently, a woman in her 70s reportedly died at Nevada, USA, due to bacterial infection caused by a dangerous strain, Klebsiella pneumoniae, which could not be treated even with 26 different antibiotics. The World Health Organisation has referred to Klebsiella pneumoniae as an urgent threat to human health.Clearly, this is an alarming situation where microbes, which are continuously pitted against antibiotics, have gained an upper hand in the struggle for existence. Antibiotics are the only armour that man possesses against bacteria and, therefore, intensive R&D efforts are underway to maintain a scientific edge over these teeny weeny creatures that can wreak havoc on our lives.The aim of any life form is to multiply for survival on planet earth. For over a century, the mankind has been in a race with bacteria to overpower it with antibiotics.Today, science seeks to maintain a lead over microbes with a few antibiotics which are effective  but the gap is rapidly narrowing down with the emergence of smart bacteria. These are bacteria which have become multidrug resistant like the notorious Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) which invades the Intensive Care Units (ICUs) in hospitals.Lately, the multidrug-resistant bacteria, Klebsiella pneumoniae has assumed dangerous proportions especially in ICUs where it causes urinary tract and respiratory tract infections.This bacteria belongs to the group of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) which are multidrug resistant and proves a nightmare for scientific and medical communities alike who have to fight the battle against this strain both in laboratories and hospitals.In 2008, a Swedish tourist fell ill in New Delhi and did not respond to many classes of antibiotics. Finally, the doctors isolated a Klebsiella strain resistant to almost 10 different kinds of antibiotics.This bacterial strain was labelled superbug since it had a powerful antibiotic resistance gene which could easily be transmitted to other bacteria. These superbugs have a special enzyme called NDM  New Delhi Metallolactamase  which can destroy antibiotics.In order to combat this dreaded super bug, scientists globally seek to discover more potent antibiotics to save mankind from death by infection.A 2011 study published in the scientific journal The Lancet revealed the presence of this super bug even in tap water samples in Delhi. This shows that the superbug was not contained in the labs and hospitals alone but has managed to pervade the environment with its dangerous presence. Clearly, since 2011, these bugs would have further contaminated the physical environment.Antibiotics, as one of the major discoveries in the early 20th century, contained, to a large extent, the premature death of animals and humans over the last century. The absence of antibiotics killed millions between the 13th and 17th century when Bubonic plague, popularly known as black death, swept Europe.Microbes which constitute both fungus and bacteria, can also cause havoc indirectly  like the Great Irish Famine (1845-52), when a fungal pathogen devastated the entire potato crop in Ireland that resulted in the death of over 10 lakh people and displacement of many more.The first chemically synthesised antibiotic, Salvarsan, popularly called Magic Bullet was introduced in 1910 to cure syphilis. It proved to be a boon for many people suffering from this dreaded sexually transmitted disease which lacked an effective cure until then.In 1928, Alexander Fleming isolated the antibiotic, Penicillin from a fungus. During the World War II, this antibiotic proved to benefit thousands of soldiers from immediate death because of the timely administration of this drug.Without antibiotics, these soldiers would have either died or lost their limbs to infection as amputation was the only option if their limbs were badly infected.Thereafter, many antibiotics were discovered which could kill virulent bacteria. However, with the advent of antibiotics, humans thought that they had won the war against bacteria. But, sadly, that was not the case.In 1946, in less than four years after mass production and use of Penicillin, many bacterial strains became resistant to Penicillin. Scientists continued to discover new drugs day in and day out but the smart bacteria continued to gain resistance against these drugs too. Bacteria became resistant to antibiotics largely because of the misuse of these drugs by humans. For instance, in India, antibiotics can be bought over the counter at pharmaceutical shops.Rampantly misusedThe problem arose because people started to consume antibiotics even when not necessary like in viral infections, allergies etc. Antibiotics are rampantly misused as additives to poultry and cattle feed.All these practices have led to the emergence of superbugs  bacteria resistant to several classes of antibiotics. Two antibiotics, namely Colistin and Tigecyclin, were the last weapons in the medical arsenal to combat such multidrug resistant bacteria. However, the recent death of the lady in the US suggests that these bacteria have now successfully dented the ultimate antibiotic armour, too.The issue is time-sensitive because it will not be long before these bugs can pass on their resistance genes to other bacteria which already have a different set of resistance genes. Once this happens, these bacteria will not respond even to the strongest antibiotics available now.Therefore, the medical and scientific communities globally should take immediate action along with their governments to combat the threat to humanity. The first step is to regulate the use of antibiotics to make sure that the bacterial community does not become invincible.(The writer is Assistant Professor, Department of Life Sciences, Christ University, Bengaluru)"

Giving an example, he said in the sale of potato chips, the farmer is ignored whereas being the grower of the crop, he should be an important factor in this chain.The state government is following the concept of peri-urban agriculture, as he had seen in Beijing, where farmers' output meets the needs of adjoining cities.""Agricultural products, being perishable, have a short life. Therefore, the farmers must cultivate need based crops in areas adjoining cities. Emphasis is being laid on bringing 25 per cent of the cultivable area under horticulture. Apart from a modern vegetable mandi, a flower mandi is also being developed,"" he added.The minister said in milk production, Haryana is next to Gujarat and Punjab. ""But as Haryana has potential to do better, it can excel in this field by promoting dairy farming as a profession and adopting some new means,"" he said.Referring to organic farming, he cited the example of Sikkim which is now an 'Organic State' and has been honoured by the Prime Minister.Dhankar said the 400 gaushalas in Haryana can contribute towards promotion of organic farming.The concept of climate-smart agriculture or risk agriculture has already been adopted in some countries to meet the challenge posed by climate change. For instance, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is an initiative to meet such challenges, he added.To a question, he said the state government is keen to set up a processing unit for horticulture crops and a mandi of frozen products to facilitate the sale of agri products in off season."

In addition to that, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbhandak Committee (SGPC) has decided to directly purchase potatoes from the farmers.Khuswant Singh, (45), of Moosapur village in Jalandhar, committed suicide after he suffered a loss in his potato crop, and was in debt of Rs 20 lakh, including cultivating his crop on leased land. The Punjab government has also instructed the education department that schools should directly buy potatoes from farmers at Rs 5 per kg for the mid-day meal scheme in government schools across the state to boost their sales.The meeting in this regard was held between BKU representatives and Kahan Singh Pannu, Managing Director of PAIC, in which all the details were given to farmer leaders. Corporation officials are in talks with Russia, Iran and Sri Lanka to finalise the deal soon, in a bid to resolve the crisis. Meanwhile, Tamil Nadu has agreed to the Punjab Governments request to keep five lakh bags of potatoes in its cold storage.Many farmers, who waited for the prices to stabilise, left their crops standing in the field. However, the new crop came in February, adding to the standing stock and a lot of unsold potatoes already kept in cold storage.The State government has sent the case to the Election Commission of India to sanction Rs 5 crore so that it could buy the first lot of potatoes after the mode of conduct is in place.All the Deputy Commissioners in the State have been directed to buy the crop directly from farmers at Rs 500 and send it to prison departments and schools for the mid-day meal scheme.Meanwhile, Chief Secretary of SGPC Harcharan Singh said, we would be buying the potatoes directly from the farmers as we have told the managers of the gurdwaras and other institutions under the SGPC control to do the same. Presently our institutions are buying potatoes from the open market at Rs 8 per kg on an average. I have also discussed this matter with Punjab Agro Industries Corporation officials.Unable to sell their produce, angry farmers in the Doaba region had on Wednesday dumped 500 quintals of potato on the road, causing a traffic jam on the Jalandhar-Amritsar National Highway.The trouble began in November when farmers from Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Gujarat cancelled their orders for potato seeds from Punjab because demonetisation had greatly affected them."

She cited that the vegetables in the village were way much cheaper than in Sambalpur city.In the village, potato was being sold at Rs 5 per kg, one and half kg of tomato for Rs 10, drum sticks for Rs 20 and cabbage for Rs 3 per kg. On the other hand, potato is selling for Rs 8 a kilo, tomato Rs 10 per kg and drum sticks Rs 35 per kg in the city.A view of the vegetable market in Sambalpuron Saturday | ExpressWhile traders attribute the difference in prices to transportation and porter cost besides levy imposed by Regulated Market Committees, failure of authorities concerned to rein in the vendors seems to have led the farmers to such a situation.The tall promises made by the BJD Government to provide 35 per cent irrigation in each block besides cold storage across the State remain unfulfilled. Blame it on the indifference of the administration which has left the vegetable growers and farmers at the mercy of vendors, who never fail to exploit them.The prices of vegetables were much lower a week ago and began rising with the rise in mercury level.Green chilli, which is available at Rs 24 per kg in the village, is sold at Rs 40 in town and city markets, tomato is priced at Rs 120 for 25 kg (Rs 4.80 a kg) and sold at Rs 10 per kg, brinjal around Rs 6 against market price of Rs 10 to Rs 12 per kg, cucumber is sold by farmers at Rs 15 per kg while it costs Rs 20 in the market. On the other hand, there is a margin of Rs 10 in one kg of coriander leaves which is purchased at Rs 30 and sold at Rs 40, beans are priced at Rs 20 and sold at Rs 30.But, the summer vegetables of pointed gourd (potal) and ladies finger are expensive as of now with pointed gourd being sold by farmers at Rs 70 a kg. The same is sold between Rs 90 and Rs 120, ladies finger is sold in open market at Rs 50 per kg while farmers are selling it at Rs 30 per kg.It is the cabbage growers who have been badly hit with many failing to recover even the harvesting cost. A bag containing 40 kg cabbage is available for Rs 100 even as it is being sold at Rs 6 per kg in the open market, while cauliflower is being purchased from growers at Rs 12 to Rs 14 and sold by vendors at Rs 20.Onion growers too are crying tears of neglect. In Titlagarh, the Nashik of Odisha, distress sale was reported. Although it has been two years since an integrated pack house was developed by APICOL, mere transfer of land to install the transformer to electrically charge the pack house has denied the onion growers to stock their produce and sell it when prices soar."

They had a collaborative farming arrangement with multinational food giant PepsiCo The potato price is coming down almost everyday. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee has called a meeting on Monday to take stock of the situation. Moreover, a number of potato investors could not purchase potato following demonetisation. PepsiCo officials led by Jaideep Bhatia, director agro division, on Friday met potato farmers who cultivated special process grade potato with lower water content.The field potato price on Friday hovered around Rs 2 to Rs 3 per kg.

58f501e97be9e018510a1711,'Potato factory' keeps farmers in business,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170305/jsp/bengal/story_139079.jsp,2017-03-05,"Farmers cultivate process grade potato for PepsiCo in Anandapur village in Hooghly Anandapur (Arambagh), Mar. 4: Had Narendra Modi and Rahul Gandhi fought the farm-versus-factory debate over aloo (potato) in Anandapur village of Bengal, chances are that the Congress vice-president would have won by more than a wafer-thin margin. For the hundred-odd farmers working for US multinational PepsiCo, growing the right variety of potato is probably the most crucial step in a long process that culminates in factories churning out munchies. During an election rally in poll-bound Uttar Pradesh earlier this week, Prime Minister Modi had taken a dig at Rahul, who had in the past echoed farmers' demand to set up a potato factory for them. ""You are demanding a factory of aloo... but I am an Opposition leader. I can't take decisions. I can't put up an aloo factory,"" Rahul had said during his kisan yatra last year. Without naming Rahul, Modi said at a rally this week that potato grows in fields, not in a factory. ""You tell me whether aloo grows in the factory or field. You know but he does not know,"" the Prime Minister had said. But Rahul probably meant potato processing, which Pepsi is doing in Bengal. Bengal produces 112 lakh tonne of table grade potato compared with under 1 lakh tonne of process grade Growing the special process grade potato has saved at least 10,000 farmers this year from a price crash that the regular jyoti variety suffered because of a bumper crop. Compared to Rs 400 a sack (50kg each) for process potato that Pepsi is offering farmers at Anandapur in Hooghly, jyoti is selling at Rs 150 a sack from the field. That is because Pepsi had agreed on the price before the sowing season started in October. Last year, the jyoti variety had fetched a better price than the process variety. But Asim Choudhury, a farmer in Anandapur, stuck to the corporate because of his experience the year before. In 2015, he had decided to give Pepsi a break and gone back to growing the traditional variety. He lost Rs 18,000 a bigha. ""That taught me a lesson. I did not switch this year to jyoti even though there was a higher return in 2016. I have been proven right,"" Choudhury, who owns an acre, said. PepsiCo's chip factories need a potato with low sugar and high percentage of dry matter. The farmer is hoping to make a profit around Rs 18,000 a bigha on the crop he is harvesting now using a power tiller fitted with an attachment specially designed for potatoes. He has rented the machine, as he did in October last year to prepare the field and sow the seeds. The mechanical intervention, which almost turned the farm to factory, saved him at least Rs 2,500 a bigha. Chandicharan Mandal, a local handler or aggregator who has an agreement with Pepsi for cultivation of the process grade potato, had arranged the power tiller on rent with the company's help. According to Jaideep Bhatia, agri-director of Pepsi India, there are 117 such aggregators in Bengal who in turn work with farmers. Machines such as these can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. ""The state laws do not allow direct agreement with farmers like we do in Maharashtra. Even though a direct tie-up would have been more transparent, we are not complaining. We are working with the aggregators,"" Bhatia said. Mandal said he was looking after 150 acres in the area, about 90km from Calcutta. He gets the seeds from Pepsi, arranges pesticides and fertilisers, and then gets power tillers on rent as most small farmers cannot afford to buy them. ""Working for Pepsi has proved remunerative if somebody sticks to the company for 3-4 years. Now with the big power tillers, we are trying to move towards more mechanisation. It is almost like a factory,"" Mandal said, holding a pack of potato chips sold under the Lays brand by PepsiCo in India. His only grouse? ""We want more machines. Only a fraction of land can be harvested with this one. Please tell the company to get it next year. Everyone is asking for it,"" Mandal said, pointing to the tractor which can do in one hour what 10 people take a day to accomplish. The correspondent's trip to Anandapur was sponsored by PepsiCo"

Banerjee, on Friday, said that the government was planning a new law to rein in the bikers by confiscating their two-wheelers.A week after bike racing snuffed the lives out of two teens on Kamalgazi flyover in south Kolkata and a day after the CM's prod, TOI hit the streets to find out the ground situationEM Bypass near Ruby crossing (Biker 02)Time: 11pm-11.15pmWhat we saw: Rows of motorcycles are parked in front of two tea and cigarette shops at the crossing. Three youths on a high-speed bike cross over the road against incoming traffic to reach the spot. They were not wearing helmets. They parked their bikes on the road, bought some puffs and sipped tea before zooming at at least 80-90kmph towards Ajaynagar.Neither any cop nor a patrol car was visible in the area.""Youths on bikes assemble here.

This is the same flyover where two teenagers, Rahul Banerjee and Payel Guha, had died after Rahul's bike hit the side rails. Payel fell 35 feet down on the road after being flung off the bridge, while Rahul was killed on the flyover itself.A week later, TOI found no cops at either end of the flyover as bikers, without helmets, sped at ease. Two SUVs were also found climbing the south-bound flank from Narendrapur end and speeding towards Garia against traffic.Deshapran Sashmal Road-Prince Anwar Shah Road (biker 06)Time: 1.30pm-2pmWhat we saw: The crossing has three shacks that remain open all night serving tea, cigarettes, Maggi and even cannabis. The stretch from Prince Anwar Shah Road till Lake Gardens has three more shops that remain open all night selling cold drinks, cigarettes, potato chips and even alcohol, albeit in hiding. TOI spotted at least four bikes parked in front of one of the shacks opposite the Tipu Sultan Mosque. Some bikers were found sitting on their two-wheelers with one of them pouring alcohol in a soft drink bottle. Another was found preparing a cannabis joint.As a car passed by with a girl stretching her head out of its window, one of the bikers whistled and said: ""Bike pe aja darling. Zyada mazaa aayega (Ride my bike darling. You will get more fun).""Two policemen were found on the other side of the road near Tollygunge Phanri leaning against chairs and occasionally dozing.

Despite good crop yield, they are not even able to recover the input cost of their produce.Uttar Pradesh witnessed an increase of about 20% this year in the areas under potato cultivation. There has been increased production as the weather too remained conducive, said Ram Saran Verma, a leading farmer of Barabanki who has introduced many innovations in potato farming.Farmers are getting Rs 3-4 per kg in the wholesale market for potato that is being sold at Rs 8-10 in the market. The cost of production alone has been around Rs 4 per kg and thus farmers are running into losses, said Verma.Kannauj, Barabanki, Farukkhabad, Firozabad and Agra are some big potato producing areas in UP.The scenario is same in other potato producing states, including West Bengal, Gujarat and Bihar, where potato has been priced almost at the same rate in the wholesale markets.The reason for low prices is very good yield this season. Last year, the potato market was really good. Farmers sold their yield for Rs 8-10 in the wholesale markets. This is what led to more farming of the crop this season. But that has brought us losses, lamented Ram Gopal, a farmer from Firozabad.Farmers said there isnt any provision for food processing in the state. We need some chips factories where our harvest can be utilised. Else it will all go waste, said Surendra Kumar, a farmer from Sultanpur.Farmers are queuing up at cold storages to get their potatoes stored. They are apprehensive that rising temperatures would lead to a lot of potato wastage.According to farmers, there are over 700 cold storages in UP.

Despite good crop yield, they are not even able to recover the input cost of their produce.Uttar Pradesh witnessed an increase of about 20% this year in the areas under potato cultivation. There has been increased production as the weather too remained conducive, said Ram Saran Verma, a leading farmer of Barabanki who has introduced many innovations in potato farming.Farmers are getting Rs 3-4 per kg in the wholesale market for potato that is being sold at Rs 8-10 in the market. The cost of production alone has been around Rs 4 per kg and thus farmers are running into losses, said Verma.Kannauj, Barabanki, Farukkhabad, Firozabad and Agra are some big potato producing areas in UP.The scenario is same in other potato producing states, including West Bengal, Gujarat and Bihar, where potato has been priced almost at the same rate in the wholesale markets.The reason for low prices is very good yield this season. Last year, the potato market was really good. Farmers sold their yield for Rs 8-10 in the wholesale markets. This is what led to more farming of the crop this season. But that has brought us losses, lamented Ram Gopal, a farmer from Firozabad.Farmers said there isnt any provision for food processing in the state. We need some chips factories where our harvest can be utilised. Else it will all go waste, said Surendra Kumar, a farmer from Sultanpur.Farmers are queuing up at cold storages to get their potatoes stored. They are apprehensive that rising temperatures would lead to a lot of potato wastage.According to farmers, there are over 700 cold storages in UP. But as production has been good this time, these storages are likely to be full to capacity and farmers would have to sell off their produce at low prices.Farmers who manage to get their potatoes stored will be safe. But others are sure to incur huge losses.

Among others, the meeting was attended by state president of the All India Kisan Sabha Bhupinder Singh Sambhar and state president of the Jamhuri Kisan Sabha Satnam Singh Ajnala.Later talking to TOI, Ajnala said due to demonetization vegetable growers were forced to plough their mature vegetable crop, including cauliflower, cabbage, peas and beans, in the fields. He said now potato crop was meeting the same fate. He further said that they had demanded a minimum compensation of Rs 30,000 per acre for vegetable growers. ""The government's announcement of relief to potato growers seemed like a gimmick as they have not received any money or support so far,"" Ajnala alleged. He added that if the government didn't come to the rescue of the farmers, they would be forced to launch an agitation."

The drop in potato prices has reduced me to a beggar, says Uttam Das, a potato farmer from Bardhaman district, who has cultivated the crop in 11 acres this year.Mr. Das is one of the many potato farmers in the State who has been badly hit by the sharp decrease in potato prices.Compared with last year when potatoes sold at Rs. 550 per 50 kg, the price this year has gone down to Rs. 200 per 50 kg.According to potato merchants, this years bumper crop along with the heavy losses sustained by them last year due to demonetisation are the key reasons for the drop in prices.While last year the total potato yield in Bengal was 95 lakh tonnes, this year it has shot up to 1.50 crore tonnes, said potato merchant Biswanath De.He pointed out that last year both the potato merchants and the cold storage owners sustained heavy losses due to demonetisation as most of the transaction in the business is done in cash.We (potato merchants) are simply out of cash and last years losses have made us apprehensive and forced us into buying potatoes on large scale, said Mr. De.Almost no buyersIn Bengal, the main potato producing districts are Hooghly, Bardhaman, Paschim Medinipur, Bankura and Birbhum. Usually potatoes are harvested from December to February and then put in cold storage. Merchants start to purchase the crop from March 1 when it is taken out of cold storage. But this year the crop is lying in cold storages and we have almost no buyers, said Uttam Das, a potato farmer. Moreover, nearly 20 lakh tonnes of potatoes will probably rot in the fields as the nearly 450 cold storages in the State are unable to store this years harvest.Price to increase soonEven as he admitted that that there was a problem due to the limited number of cold storages, State Agriculture Minister Purnendu Basu avoided a direct reply on whether potato farmers have sustained losses. Pointing to this years high yield, the Minister said the 450 cold storages in Bengal do not have the capacity to accommodate such a large harvest and urged cold storage owners to set up more facilities in the rural agricultural markets set up the State government.In agriculture profits cannot be the same every year, he told The Hindu . On Monday, Mr. Basu claimed in the State Assembly that currently farmers are getting Rs. 4.50 per kg of potato and the price will increase soon."

Tomato prices touched a high of Rs 42 a kg at vegetable stores in the city on Tuesday. However, it isnt just tomatoes, but other vegetables too whose prices have begun to climb and are expected to become more expensive when summer sets in.In the case of tomato, prices will have to increase as most of the tomatoes sold are coming from Nagpur, said a vegetable store owner who did not wish to be named. It takes around six days for these tomatoes to reach Chennai as they go to Bengaluru first and then come here. The demand for tomatoes is always high and the supply is getting limited, so prices have to go up.He said he was charging Rs 38 for a kg of tomatoes on Monday but since prices increased by Rs 5 at the Koyambedu vegetable market on Tuesday, he had spiked his rate to Rs 42. He explained that the difference in prices at retail and Koyambedu wholesale market is generally around Rs 4 to Rs 5 less a kg for things like tomatoes and can go up to Rs eight to Rs 10 less in the case of vegetables like beans.Vegetable vendors affirmed that most other vegetables have been hovering around the same prices with minor fluctuation. However, they warned that with the beginning of summer, prices too will go up. They attributed this to different reasons, primary one being the water problem in the State.Water shortage will definitely lead to prices being higher this summer, said S Mani, a vegetable vendor at T. Nagar. Prices of vegetables like ladies finger, especially will keep increasing as it is one of the most commonly bought vegetables in summer.He sold the vegetable at Rs 70 per kg on Tuesday. Prices of onion and potato, however, have remained stable. A kilo of onion can be bought for Rs 18-Rs 20 while a kilo of potato is priced Rs 25."

Jasbir Malhi INLD MLA Parminder Dhull protests against the state government for low potato prices, outside Haryana Vidhan Sabha in Chandigarh Wednesday. Jasbir MalhiINDIAN NATIONAL Lok Dal MLA Parminder Singh Dhull on Wednesday brought 200 kg potatoes for symbolic sale in the Haryana Assembly complex to show the pitiable condition of potato growers in the state because of a very low price of the crop. He sold the potatoes at the rate of Rs 1 per kilo, alleging that the government has failed to protect the interests of farmers.Watch what else is making news:The employees and others standing in the Assembly complex bought the potatoes from Dhull. The farmers have been forced to sell the potatoes at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg in bulk. Many farmers in Ambala and Sirsa were forced to throw their potatoes on the roads in Ambala and Sirsa because they have to pay carriage charges to take them to the markets in neighbouring towns, Dhull told The Indian Express. Dhull, who brought four bags of potatoes in his Innova, installed a temporary sale counter in the Assembly complex. Here, he was joined by leader of the opposition, Abhay Singh Chautala.The Haryana government should learn from the Assam government which buys potatoes at the rate Rs 5 per kg from farmers offering them minimum support price (MSP) for the vegetables. I fail to understand why the BJP state government doesnt introduce MSP concept for vegetables and fruits to help farmers, added Dhull, a two-time MLA from Jullana constituency of Jind district. According to Dhull, the potatoes are grown in Ambala, Kurukshetra, Yamunanagar, Kaithal and Sirsa districts. Chautala said they would support the farmers, who have planned to agitate, demanding implementation of the Swaminathan Commission Report to ensure profitable rates of their crops.Later, the INLD MLAs also staged a brief walkout from the Assembly after expressing dissatisfaction over assurances of Agriculture Minister Om Prakash Dhankar over the issue. Dhankar said the state government sends the recommendations to the Commission for Agriculture Cost and Prices (CACP) for fixing the MSP of crops on the basis of expenditure incurred on the crop in the interest of farmers.Thereafter, CACP submits the recommendations to the Government of India, which after a detailed discussion with the representatives of states, announces MSP. When the market price of pulses and oil seeds is lower than the MSP, National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd (NAFED) procures the crop on MSP through HAFED. Likewise, if the market price of cotton is lower than the MSP, it is purchased by the Indian Cotton Corporation at MSP, said Dhankar.He further said that as the market price of black gram and barley is more than the MSP, there is no need for intervention by the government. In addition, according to Dhankar, the state government provides subsidy to the farmers through implementation of schemes sponsored by the Centre and states. Subsidies are provided on seeds, equipments, fertilisers and pesticides, he added. Dhankar said Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana is being implemented in order to compensate the farmers for losses on their crops due to natural calamities.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Before the onset of the paddy season, farmers in some pockets of Punjab prefer growing watermelon and muskmelon from March to May. With the state-owned Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) not producing any hybrid seeds of watermelons, the farmers are solely dependent on private companies, which are selling seeds ranging from Rs 20,000 per kg to Rs 70,000 per kg depending on the variety. Even the seeds of PAUs non-hybrid watermelon variety, Sugar Baby, are not available for sale at its seed shop on the university campus. When The Indian Express visited the PAU seed shop to buy the watermelon seed, the staff deployed at the shop said, Seeds are currently unavailable, although the sowing season has already begun.What else is making news:The state agriculture department has no control over the seed prices of private companies, which enjoy monopoly in hybrid seed sale. Speaking to The Indian Express, Maheshinder Singh, a potato farmer who has started cultivation of watermelon this season after suffering losses in potato crop, said, I have purchased the hybrid watermelon seed for Rs 50,000/kg manufactured by a Bengaluru-based company. The government is not taking any step to check how private companies are looting farmers in selling hybrid seeds. After potato glut, I decided to sow watermelon before paddy to tide over the potato loss to some extent but even melon seeds are so expensive.Watermelon is mostly grown in the Doaba belt of the state with Kapurthala, Nakodar, Shahkot, Jalandhar pockets being dotted with most of the farms. Some pockets are also there in Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and villages near Sutlej banks. With warm weather required for watermelon cultivation coming early in southern parts of the country, the fruit from Karnataka and other southern states also enter the markets of Punjab before farmers here can harvest.Watermelons from Bengaluru and Chennai are already available at shops in Punjab. In fact, they are available round the year now. So, farmers in Punjab are losing interest in watermelons. Seeds are too expensive and then, at mandis, non-hybrid varieties fetch Rs 5 per kg or even less only in peak summers, said Gurpreet Singh, another farmer from Amloh. The hybrid varieties still fetch Rs 50-15/kg for farmers at mandis, Rs 15 being the closing rate at the end of the season. Dilbag Singh, senior scientist, PAU vegetable department, said, PAU is working to develop hybrid variety seeds but it will still take a few years for seeds to reach farmers. Our non-hybrid variety Sugar Baby seeds cost Rs 300-400 per kg only. Since private companies have monopoly on hybrid as of now, their prices are skyrocketing.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

Though a tad costlier, the organic variants have made a splash in the market and are more in demand,"" Shyam, a salesperson at a Rajendra Nagar departmental store, said on Wednesday.In fact, a leading fashion retail house in the city is offering its customers a 500gm pack of herbal 'gulaal' for Rs 49 if they buy apparels worth Rs 2,499. Small stores, on the contrary, continue to stock up and sell only the synthetic varieties. Binay, who owns a grocery shop on Boring Road, has ""never heard of organic colours before"".According to health experts, toxins used in colours can cause a host of skin and eye infections. General physician Dr Amrendra Prasad Singh told TOI, ""Chemical colours, adulterated with lead oxide, industrial dyes, burnt engine oil and diesel among other harmful solvents, make your skin dry and are likely to cause cancer. Amid all the fun and frolic, do not forget to scrub the harmful colours off your skin immediately otherwise there are chances you will develop rashes later.""Even youngsters vouch for the benefits of using herbal colours instead of the chemical ones. Mainpura resident Anubha, who goes for a wild and whacky Holi celebration every year, has already ordered a 1kg pack of organic 'gulaal' worth Rs 792 from an online shopping portal. She said, ""Organic colours, made from extracts of flowers and leaves, do not have any ill-effects. However, awareness about them is limited. It is high time we shunned readymade perilous 'gulaals' and geared up for a safe and responsible Holi by smearing each other with natural colours.""While many of us are still unaware of the advantages of organic 'gulaals', old-timers claim that Holi colours were originally made of dried flower petals. Boring Road resident Meera Roy, who has memories of Holis gone by, recalled how she and her sister-in-law made natural colours at home. ""Humaare samay mein milaawat nahin hota tha... We used ingredients that were easily available in the kitchen - flour, henna, beetroot, rose petals, sandalwood, potato and turmeric - to prepare homemade 'gulaal' with a natural fragrance. In fact, there are places like Vrindavan where revellers have kept alive the age-old tradition of celebrating the festival of colours with roses and marigolds,"" the sexagenarian said and advised Patnaites to switch to organic colours this Holi."

Yet to recover from the crop loss of 2015-16 kharif season, they were forced to go for distress sale of cabbage, tomato and chilli and now it is the turn of potato.The farmers had put all their hopes on potato and looked forward to make up for the loss. Even as potato is being sold for `8 per kg in the open market, the farmers are finding it difficult to even recover the cost of cultivation with traders offering anything between `2 and `3 per kg. In the absence of cold storage, the farmers have no way out but to dispose of the produce at throw away prices.Moreover, the State Government is yet to fix the minimum support price (MSP) for potato despite tall claims of Potato Mission. To make things worse there is no organised market to ensure fair price to the farmers.Under Potato Mission, besides providing incentivised potato seed, the State Government had also committed to give capital subsidy for new cold storage as per the agricultural policy of 2013. It was also mooting subsidising power tariff for existing and new cold storages till March 31, 2018.Plans were also sketched to maintain buffer stock to deal with short-term scarcity situation and a target has been set to bring 60,000 hectares of land under potato cultivation by 2017-18. But, on the ground the picture is not rosy. This year, the Department of Horticulture had distributed 5350 quintal potato seeds to 29 farmers in Bhatli, Bargarh and Attabira blocks.The seeds were meant to produce 424 quintal of potato. This apart, about 500 quintal of seeds were procured from open market and cultivated by farmers across the district. As the situation stands today, many farmers have resorted to distress sale of potato while many are refusing to harvest it as they want to avoid further losses.Premanand Dang of Jamurda village in Bargarh block had cultivated potato over half an acre of land. But, he has no purchaser and is forced to sell his produce at distress prices.Those who had taken debt for the crop were the first to sell their crop at `3 per kg in absence of any organised market in the district. Similar is the condition of Rajkumar Pradhan of the village, who is not daring to harvest his crop in absence of market. Even if he harvests the crop, the amount he would be getting for the produce would not be enough to recover the harvesting cost.Assistant Horticulture Officer, Sunil Kumar Seth said no communication has been received from the State Government on MSP of potato. There was no cold storage in the district and said if farmers wish they can avail the facility in Sambalpur, he added."

(PTI Photo) Representational Image. (PTI Photo)This has been a terrible year for potato farmers, with prices everywhere  from Agra and Farrukhabad in Uttar Pradesh to Burdwan in West Bengal  crashing to well below Rs 4 per kg levels. But about 10,000 growers in West Bengal have managed to realise an extra Rs 5 or so per kg, by supplying to the global snack and beverage giant PepsiCo under a contract farming initiative.Watch What Else Is Making NewsAt current rates of Rs 3.40-3.80 per kg for normal potatoes, farmers are grossing Rs 170-190 from every 50-kg sack that doesnt even cover production costs. However, some of us who have entered into collaborative farming with PepsiCo are being paid Rs 8.40 per kg. That works out to an extra Rs 230-250, compared to what we would have got by selling a sack of regular potatoes, points out Shantinath Nandi.This four-bigha (one acre) farmer from Anandapur village in Hooghly districts Goghat block under Arambag subdivision has been growing process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo for the last six years. He produces between 90 and 110 sacks of the tuber from each bigha, which gives Rs 42,000 at Rs 8.40 per kg. After deducting costs of Rs 22,000-25,000, it leaves a profit of Rs 17,000-20,000 per bigha or Rs 170-200 a sack. Had Nandi been growing ordinary table-grade potatoes, his total revenue itself would have been just Rs 170-190, not enough to take care of even cultivation costs of over Rs 200 per sack or Rs 4 per kg.The process-grade potato varieties such as Atlantic, FC3 and FC5, which PepsiCo is promoting, contain 20 per cent dry matter and 80 per cent water. Table varieties have about 85 per cent water. The lower dry matter content makes them less suitable for processing, as the extra water adds to dehydration and energy costs. Normal potatoes also have higher accumulation of reducing sugars. These, when fried, are subjected to certain enzymatic reactions, leading to their blackening. The resultant chips or fries tend to acquire a dark brownish colour, whereas ideally they should possess a light yellow hue.Shantinath Nandi, Asim Chowdhury and other farmers at Anandapur are among the many who have taken to cultivating process-grade potatoes for PepsiCo, under an arrangement where the Indian subsidiary of the American multinational undertakes to purchase their entire produce at a fixed price announced a month before planting.All they have to do is to grow the potatoes for us, says Jaideep Bhatia, director-agro at PepsiCo India.The maker of Lays and Uncle Chipps potato chips brands does contract cultivation  collaborative farming is the term it prefers to use  in Punjab, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. In West Bengal, its direct farm sourcing operations are spread across nine districts: Hooghly, Howrah, Burdwan, West Midnapore, Birbhum, Bankura, Jalpaiguri, Cooch Behar and Alipurduar.In 2010, our procurement was 39,998 tonnes from West Bengal. This year, we will do 72,250 tonnes. This programme is a big success for us, claims Bhatia. He adds that PepsiCo not only provides farmers with disease-free true potato seeds produced from its laboratory in Punjab, but also tractor-drawn planters and other equipment, crop protection and extension services, cold storage and insurance facilitation.Ive been working with this company for the last 5-6 years and there is certainly increased interest among growers for this kind of cultivation, notes Chandicharan Mondal, a potato aggregator, who has brought 200-odd farmers under PepsiCos programme.But the quantities being procured by PepsiCo and other food processing majors are only a fraction of the 10 million tonnes annual potato production of West Bengal alone. While contract cultivation of processing-grade potatoes is useful, there are limits to how much these can replace the normal aloo used in day-to-day meals and table preparations. And to that extent, the woes of growers cannot be wished away.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"
58f507a27be9e018510a1d61,What women really want,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170309/jsp/opinion/story_139644.jsp,2017-03-09,"Every year without fail when International Women's Day rolls around, it serves as a brutal reminder of how far women have come since medieval times and also how far there is still left to go. This year in the run up to the IWD, Gurmehar Kaur was abused and trolled for merely having an opinion; the Central Board of Film Certification banned Lipstick Under My Burkha, a film exploring female sexuality; 19 aborted female foetuses were found in Sangli in Maharashtra and many men didn't care enough about women's consent or legal consequences and proceeded to rape them. International Women's Day, in the Indian context, has been reduced to tweets, Facebook posts, corporate meetings on sexual harassment (where only women show up), WhatsApp messages and so on, that thank women in their roles as good daughters, mothers, wives, sisters. These messages then oddly suggest that women should be empowered and that they are like goddesses and so should be respected. I am writing this piece to draw attention to this doublespeak in Indian society that has significantly marred women's parity in all spheres - that we celebrate IWD and use it to only praise and laud women in certain roles where they are wholly and unquestionably subservient to others. As a society, it has been recently demonstrated that we will bully women into silence, pay no attention to her consent, and that we are most comfortable when a woman is in the kitchen surrounded by an endlessly recurring pile of potato peels. Part of the tension between female empowerment and how Indian's understand it is related to women's work and Indian society's reliance on unpaid female labour. Consider the fact that in Iceland, for instance, in 1975, 90 per cent of women in the country refused to show up for work and refused to undertake any household work because they were not being paid the same as men for the same job (roughly 60 per cent less than men). Last year, women in Iceland repeated their protest and left work at 2:38 pm because of unequal pay. Such protests over the years were crucial to women emerging in Iceland as a political interest group that paved the way for the election of the first female president in the world. What would happen in India if women refused to work for a day? Food would not be cooked, children would not be bathed and sent to school, husbands would not have their tiffin boxes for the office, clothes would not be washed, in villages and slums the household would have no water, construction work in many places would halt, food stalls would close, farm work would be hit, diapers wouldn't be changed, bathrooms wouldn't be cleaned, loads would not be carried, prayers would not be offered, in-laws wouldn't be fussed over and cared for and there would be a visible disruption of a huge portion of the unorganized sector. Essentially, all that is needed for Indian society to stop functioning at the basic unit of the family is for women to stop working for a week. I would like to think that the above is an exaggeration and that typical Indian men are in fact competent enough to take care of their needs; that they don't need someone in a subservient position as a sock-washer or sex-provider. However, men that help out at home are very rare in India, but more important, many men feel as if they are entitled to their wife's labour and if she is earning, then to her salary and wages. The most important thing that needs to be done for female empowerment to become a reality is that male entitlement over the female body and female labour must be broken. It is because of this that I find it important to be critical of the social media messages that liken empowerment to some state of female godliness that is rooted in antiquity. Making women believe they are goddesses is like asking them to consume LSD where they feel empowered in a mystical realm, but their reality is that they are still stuck at that kitchen sink. We have crafted an excellent script for Indian women, where in childhood the father-patriarch rules them and as adults the husband and son as patriarchs rule them. This also explains why we have an independently sponsored bill which seeks to limit expenditure on marriages, but does not suggest instead that it should be binding that at least the equal of what is spent on a girl's marriage should have been also spent on her education. We wait for a girl to change from child to wife, in spite of her educational accomplishments and career, and once she is married, we also expect her to prioritize children and family over her career. It is no surprise then that the housewife suicide rate in India is rather high if one looks at the NCRB statistics, and that almost no woman in India has a fight-free marriage where at some point or the other she is not depressed or in conflict with her husband, in-laws, her own parents and brothers over property. There is no point in celebrating International Women's Day if in India this day is only a mechanism for men to show that they are appreciative of female labour by likening women to something holy, when the women in fact would like to see some wages for their effort. The day isn't about how nice men are to send such messages on social media. This day is about rededicating oneself to a fight for parity in income, in social roles, inside the house, in nutrition, in healthcare access, in educational access. Women don't want a sharper potato peeler or a cheap trinket or a gaudy photoshopped message imposed on a water-colour female goddess as affirmation; they want to have the same life chances as men, they want to live fuller lives in the same measure as men, they want the same sense of freedom and entitlement that men have, they want the same income for the same job as men get and they certainly don't want to be trapped in an endless cycle of mundane chores to support any man free of cost. My only plea this year is that as a society we need to discard the double-speak and not put women on a pedestal of a goddess only to have her sweep and mop it. Let's instead pledge that everyday of the year we will all see the work that women do as work that men ought also to be doing. Let's not think that women live to serve men and that marriage is an ultimate goal after which women can give up ambition. Let's not teach our young girls to compete with one another over males. Let's teach them that no one is entitled to their labour for free and that it is better to be financially independent than to be liked by one's husband and family. In fact, let us teach young girls that possessing ambition is not synonymous with marriage. The author is the Chief Coordinator of Research at The Hindu Centre for Politics and Public Policy"

Strangely, the slide in the wholesale price failed to have any impact on retail market. The retail price rose gradually from Rs 6 to Rs 10 in some markets till Monday.Demonetisation, bumper production in states like UP and Punjab and bumper crop in Bengal collectively have left Bengal's farmers in a tight spot. The shortage of cash and excess supply have hit demand, resulting in a dip in prices. Farmers stare at a huge loss as most of them have taken loans from mahajans at a high interest rate keeping in mind the profits made in 2015-16. ""There was low yield in 2015-16. The retail prices rose up to Rs 24 per kg in city markets,"" said Gour Das of Purshura, a potato farmer, who took loan at a high interest rate and now finds it difficult to recover production cost.It's a mystery how the wholesale potato price and the retail price become inversely proportional. While the potato wholesale prices plunge, retail prices rise. Potato traders blamed the 6-tier middlemen system working between the wholesalers and retailers and higher margin of profit by a retailer as reasons for the price mismatch. On Monday, the wholesale price in Hooghly, Burdwan and Bankura  three major potato-producing districts  ranged between Rs 2.5 and Rs 3. Farmers fear that if the trend continues, the prices may plunge to as low as Rs 1 per kg.There is severe shortage of cash flow in the potato market. Besides, several big businessmen, a sizeable number of teachers, government employees and professionals invest in potato. ""They buy from the farmers and put the same in the cold storage, expecting a good price at the end of the season. However, demonetisation and this year's bumper production desisted them from investing in this sector,"" said Arup Dutta, an agro-economist.""While the total potato yield in 2015-16 in Bengal was 90 lakh tonnes, this year it has shot up to 1.15 crore tonnes,"" said potato merchant Biswarup De. He said that last year both the potato merchants and cold storage owners sustained heavy loss due to demonetisation as most of the transaction in the business is done in cash.Agriculture minister Purnendu Bose said, ""We observe March 14 as Krishi Diwas. The CM will address the issues and will definitely find a way out."""

Hesitantly she picked up, only to be pleasantly surprised by one of her elderly customers.He was a Jain from Chennai and he called me Annapoorna as I was preparing special satvik meals for him without onion and garlic, says the city-based home-cook whose authentic North Indian fare has a huge fan following.Be it lasooni paneer, baigan bharta or green chilli paratha, she ensures a burst of taste and authenticity. Come up with any typical North Indian vegetarian delicacy, and Deepika will deliver it at your doorsteps. I keep adding to the menu and as of now cheesy potato paratha is a hot favourite with my customers, she says. Deepika, who relocated to the city from Kanupur, says she started cooking for her North Indian friends practising in Medical College.They were missing ghar ka khana and asked me to cook for them on a daily basis. That was some two years back and now the number of my customers has grown in leaps and bounds, she smiles.Her facebook page Leelas Kitchen is a talk among the foodie groups in the city as you dont have to order much in advance. All I need is one hour. I have two helpers who do the peeling and chopping. We are always prepared to take the order and finish it in an hour, she says.Deepika says though she is an expert cook now, once she hardly had any idea about what happens inside the kitchen. It was my mother-in-law Leela who taught me the art, with all its nuances and tricks. She had magic in her hands and hence my page is named after her.There are many specialty restaurants in the city dedicated to North Indian cuisine, but Deepika says their preparations lack that authentic taste and flavour. You dont get a paratha with a thick methi filling there. While we use atta they use maida, and there is always the hygiene part. From the flour to garnish, we make sure that everything is 100 per cent North Indian.Then there are customers who want specific food, something in sync with their health or religion. I think there is no other eatery in the city that provides Jain food, she adds.But its not just homesick North Indians who place orders at Leelas Kitchen. I get equal or more orders from Keralites. I think yummy home-cooked food is something that appeals to all, she winds up."

The subsidy increase has been across the full spectrum of government activities.Subsidies extended to ailing ESCOMs, which account for almost half the subsidy bill, went up by 22%. The political hot potato of making even rich Bengalureans pay more for the electricity they consume was left untouched.Food subsidy saw a massive jump of 75%. This was chiefly due to the expansion of the scope of the Anna Bhagya Scheme. A related populist move was the announcement of one Namma Canteen for each of the 198 wards in Bengaluru. This intervention will adversely impact Bengaluru's vibrant darshinis and gaadis that already cater to a variety of price points.The streak of populism entered the domain of higher education as well. Free laptops have been announced for 1.5 lakh colle ge students.Here, Karnataka has finally joined Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh, and other states in extending freebies at the expense of taxpayers.In spite of all these populist impulses, the budget did not abandon all sense.For one, the allocation on long-term investment grew by an admirable 29%, including healthy increases on irrigation, flood control and water supply infrastructure.The budget speech included quite a few promising announcements. A growing state like Karna taka with an increas ingly complex econ omy needs smaller administrative units to take care of local needs. A total of 49 new taluks will be carved out of the existing 177 taluks. The state has a strong history of b re a k i n g u n w i e l dy d i s tricts like the old Bangalore rural into coherent par ts, but these usually did not involve changing taluks. The new move can be transformative.Akshara Foundation, Shikshana, Pratham and other foundations having a history of working with t h e g ove r n m e n t t o i m p r ove e d u c a t i o n a l o u t comes. In an unusual m ove, t h e C M f o u n d i t worthwhile to name them as par tners. One can be cautiously hopeful of more good ideas permeating into the broken government schooling system.T he budg et seems to mention a better focus on actual learning outcomes, which is big if implemented. That apart, English will now be a subject from class 1 in government schools in the state- a step that could potentially bring far greater equity for Kannadiga students working in a 21st century Karnataka.The writers are fellows at the Takshashila InstitutionReporting by Naheed Ataullah, Sujith John, Manu Aiyappa, Rakesh Prakash, Sandeep Moudgal, Rohith B R, Sunitha Rao, Aparajita Ray, Deepika Burli, Sreemoyee Chatterjee, Arun Dev, Avik Das.

58f6df5c7be9e031f13bd430,Varanasi appeals to stomach and soul,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/varanasi/varanasi-appeals-to-stomach-soul/articleshow/57712478.cms,2017-03-19,"Every year Varanasi plays host to thousands of tourists hoping to discover their spiritual side. That has been the temple town's calling card and commerce. But foodies know that Varanasi's crowded streets and bylanes are also avenues of gastronomic delights. Many famous hawkers appear with their pushcarts in the evening. Some don't even have a signboard. Hygiene isn't their forte. But their offerings -- golgappas, rasedar pakoras, lassi - are addictive and available at a price that would buy you only a snigger in a city like Delhi.Quality street food, to anybody who pursues it like an obsessive lover, isn't just about feeling good. The best snacks take you into an unchartered zone where the taste buds groan with delight. It's like discovering an unknown erogenous zone. In their own way, the street-side hawkers of Varanasi are everyday artists in the business of producing and peddling pleasure.You might get that kind of feeling wolfing down Lalman's golgappas, or paani puris, sold from a handcart in a bylane near Lahurabir Chowk. What makes them irresistible isn't the tangy tamarind water but the filling, a slushy mix of chickpea, boiled potato and spices. He also serves a sweet version of the snack that feels almost like a dessert. Like most golgappa sellers in the city, the stuff he serves is customized to the amount of spicy heat your tastebuds can handle. Varanasi is a city of paan eaters. A long-lasting love affair with the paan makes a tongue hypersensitive to spice. This is primarily due to the use of chuna (lime), an essential ingredient for paan; hence the adjustment.Like Lalman, there are several other artistes of the palate strewn across the city, which is now Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's Lok Sabha constituency. One of the go-to places for breakfast is the late Chhanni Devi's, who sold puri-sabji and jalebis from a rundown shop in Lanka area, near BHU. Popularly known as ""Chachi"", she showered abuse on customers asking her to hurry up; the customers, in turn, were addicted to her rantings.Among the famous who graced the place was superstar Rajesh Khanna. The sabji served with the puri is made of pumpkin, potatoes and black gram. There is a rhythm with which her son Kailash Yadav flattens and shapes the dough before it is deep-fried, twice. The shop opens at 3.30 am. ""We start serving jalebis by 5 am and puri-sabji by 6. By 11.30 am, we are through,"" he says. A plate of four puris and sabji costs Rs 24.Adjacent are three shops selling lassi, all run by sons of Panna Sardar who ran the legendary original Pehalwan lassi. This is the third generation in the business. Lassis, with a dash of malai and saffron on top, are sold in clay cups. Some are so thick you almost need to chew.A kulhar (clay cup) of lassi is about beauty in minimalism. No frills; just the best of natural ingredients: curd made of buffalo milk, sugar and a hint of rosewater or saffron. It's part of the city's living heritage, created and consumed every day, sustained by a commitment to tradition. Places like these created a popular expression called 'Lanketing', going specifically to Lanka for snacks.Then there's Pappu's, the legendary tea stall in Assi mohalla that serves milk and lemon tea. The political gyan is free. The lemon tea here is flavoured with Hajmola, giving it a distinct whiff of heeng (asafoetida).There's much more. Near Lahurabir Chowk stands Jwala Prasad 's push cart selling rasedar pakora made of gram flour (besan), spinach and spices. The three are kneaded into a ball, deep fried and dipped in a fiery curry. Then it's served with a sprinkling of sohal, a salty savoury. The pakoras have two variations: sada and rangeen. The rangeen version is stuffed with bhang, a popular intoxicant generally laced with sweets.At Chetganj, Umashankar Sahu's family has been selling kachoris for three generations. As a peddler, Sahu has the smallest of stands where he keeps the kachoris, a little larger than a Rs 10 coin, garnished with shredded radish and carrot, and served with tamarind chutney.Varanasi is also famous for its sweets to which the city's Bengalis have also made a singular contribution. Shops with signs of desi and Bengali mithai can be seen. Some shops located around Pucca Mohal area along the ghats, sell their stuff only between 7 pm to 2 am. On offer are sweets suggestively named: Palangtod (Bed-breaker) and Malaipuri.One has deliberately avoided referring to the iconic Kashi and Deena Chat Bhandars at Godowlia Chowk which are more established joints. Crowds, including tourists, throng to Deena for a taste of their tamatar chaat, a rather unique snack which uses tomatoes ingeniously and which is eaten out of kullars. In the winter, chura matar, dripping with desi ghee, is the rage.Sometimes one wonders why food doesn't figure in the narrative of the holy city. Is it because it is primarily a business of yadavs and baniyas, who don't figure high in the city's intellectual story? There is no simple answer.What one does know is that there is a self-confidence to Varanasi; the way it looks at life, culture, and itself. The eternal city seems to stand a little above everything it surveys. There is a rhythm to its existence that's yet unspoiled by the ravages of time. And food is an inseparable part of it."

The year-and-a-half-old child had swallowed a piece of plastic that got lodged at the entrance of the wind pipe and nearly choked him to death.Alfaz Khan was having potato chips at home on Tuesday, when he swallowed the piece of plastic. But unaware, his parents, Kajal Biwi and Amirul Khan, could not fathom why he was suddenly having difficulty breathing. When Kajal put her finger in his mouth, she felt the edge of the plastic but could not pull it out. The couple took the child to Chittaranjan Sishu Sadan near Hazra where they were sent to the OPD. Doctors there allegedly said the child had chest congestion, nebulised him, gave medicine for cold and discharged him. Alfaz again had difficulty breathing at night.The next morning, the Khans took Alfaz back to Sishu Sadan. ""We told the doctors something was lodged in his throat but they denied it and treated him with medicine and oxygen at the OPD. They also told us we could take him to SSKM Hospital if his condition relapsed,"" alleged grandfather Salam Ali Khan.Back home, as the child turned blue, the family took him to SSKM that night. On checking, ENT doctors at the emergency found a red plastic sheet near Alfaz's vocal cord and immediately operated on him. ""The plastic was stuck below the vocal cord at the sub-glottic region. Around 1am, we conducted bronchostomy, a micro-surgery to remove the plastic piece. Any delay could have cost him his life,"" said Dr Arunabha Sengupta, ENT head at SSKM.Sishu Sadan administration has ordered a probe."

Investigators contend the assets are linked to two Camorra drug kingpins, Mario Cerrone and Raffaele Imperiale.After years shrouded in darkness, they can now shine again, said Jet Bussemaker, the Dutch minister for education, culture and science said as an orange screen slid away to reveal the two paintings behind a glass wall.The canvas View of the Sea at Scheveningen, one of the two recovered paintings. (Reuters)One of the two men convicted of stealing the paintings told the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf that said he originally wanted to steal Van Goghs world famous Sunflowers painting, but it was too well protected.Another well-known Van Gogh work, The Potato Eaters, was too big to get through the hole that Octave Durham and his accomplice smashed in the security glass to get into the museum after clambering over a fence and using a ladder to get onto its roof.Durham, who was sentenced to 3 1 /2 years in prison after being convicted in 2004, told De Telegraaf that the paintings were sold to the mafia after a Dutch criminal who had agreed to buy them was murdered.Experts said they suffered remarkably little damage even as the thieves in 2002 ripped them out of their frames and fled.It is not only a miracle that the works have been recovered but its even more miraculous almost that they are in relatively unharmed condition, Rueger said.The museum director was on vacation when the call came last year from Italian authorities who believed they had recovered the paintings. He didnt celebrate right away; hed had calls like this before.I was hopeful but also a little hesitant, because over the course of the years we had multiple occasions when people phoned us, contacted us, claiming that they knew something about the whereabouts of the works. And each time it was false, the trace went cold, he said. The way has been peppered with disappointment.But museum experts dispatched to Italy to check the authenticity of the works quickly turned Ruegers doubts into delight.The canvas Congregation Leaving The Reformed Church in Nuenen, one of the two recovered paintings. (Reuters)It was something we had secretly been hoping for, for all those years, he said.The two small works are not typical of Van Goghs later and better-known works, but are still vital pieces for the museums collection, Rueger said.The Scheveningen seascape, with a fishing boat and rough sea under a typically gray, cloudy Dutch sky, is one of Van Goghs earliest works. It is the only painting in the museums collection painted during his time in The Hague. It suffered a missing rectangular chip from the bottom left-hand corner.The painting of the church in Nuenen portrayed the village where his parents lived.He had painted as a gift to his mother, so its a very personal and emotional connection, Rueger said.Rueger said the paintings are now back for good at a museum, which is home to dozens of works by Van Gogh, whose paintings fetch millions of dollars on the rare occasions they come up for auction.The security, I can assure you, is of Triple-A quality now. So Im very confident that everything is safe in the museum, he said."

Picture by Ashwinee Pati Bhubaneswar, March 20: The state's favourite dish was omnipresent - from the dining table to a top trending topic on social media - as resident and not-resident Odias celebrated Pakhala Divas today. Thousands of people took to various social networking sites to share stories of their attachment with pakhala, while many others shared pictures of feasts over the dish at their homes and outside. The dish was also among the top trending topics on micro-blogging site Twitter throughout the day with a number of well-known personalities talking about it. Popular television personality and chef Sanjeev Kapoor tweeted: ""I am sure if today I go to any house in Odisha (or an Odia living in any part of the world), I would get freshly made Pakhala."" Writer Ravinder Singh wrote on Twitter: ""Fermented rice to beat the heat. The haves would eat it with fried fish & veges. The have nots with onion & green-chillies."" Artist Sudarshan Patnaik created a sand art on the theme with a bowl of fermented rice in the middle and a number of popular side-dishes alongside. He posted a picture of his creation on Twitter that was shared by international chefs such as Vikas Khanna and Ranveer Brar and hundreds of people from around the world. Pakhala is an Odia term for cooked rice washed or fermented in water. Depending on the palette, a variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian accompaniments are served with it to spice up the taste. It was included in the recipe of Lord Jagannath in the Puri temple since it was built in the 12th century. The dish has a number of variations, including jeera pakhala, dahi pakhala, basi pakhala, sajja pakhala and chaiin pakhala. Rourkela resident Monalisa Routray added a twist to her pakhala. She said: ""Instead of rice, I tried rice-stuffed dumplings immersed in curd. As side dishes, I had potato patties and fried drumstick. My family members all appreciated my unique spin to the dish."" Odia film-maker Biswananth Rath, who lives in Chennai, said: ""The day is an attempt to preserve the tradition of this Odia cuisine. The Odia association here got together and had a hearty pakhala meal. We also invited a number of non-Odia people."" Akshaya Mohanty, who lives in Rhode Island, US, said: ""I have invited my non-Odia friends here so that they can get a taste of the popular dish."" Lately, a number of hotels and restaurants have included pakhala in their menus. A vegetarian pakhala meal is available at Rs 350 and a non-vegetarian one comes for a princely Rs 400. There are budget eateries as well, which are offering the dish at Rs 70. ""A dish that hydrates the body is advised as a remedy against sunstroke. We have pakhala at home almost daily during the summer. But today, my friends and I wanted to celebrate the occasion in a special manner,"" said Manisha Dash, who visited the Dalma restaurant here."

The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer.Buoyed by its landslide win in the recent Uttar Pradesh assembly elections, the Narendra Modi government has decided to fast-track the implementation of the direct benefit transfer (DBT) system for payment of fertiliser subsidy to farmers.From the coming kharif season, beginning June, the Rs 70,000-crore fertiliser subsidy budgeted for 2017-18 will be disbursed to companies based on actual sales to farmers captured on point-of-sale (POS) machines installed at nearly two lakh retail points across India.This would be a significant change from the current system, where firms are paid the subsidy on receipt of their fertiliser at the railhead point or any approved godown of a district. Prior to this, till October 2012, they were getting the subsidy on despatch of material from their respective factories.From kharif 2017 onwards, we are moving to disbursal of subsidy only after sale to the farmer takes place. The farmers identity will be verified through Aadhaar-based biometric authentication, voter ID or Kisan Credit Card. The sale transaction as well as buyer details would be captured in the POS machine installed at the retailers end and connected with a central server, a Department of Fertilisers official told The Indian Express.The proposed subsidy-post-sale system  as opposed to after receipt-at-district or despatch-from-plant  is already being implemented as a pilot scheme in 17 districts. They include UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanaths home district of Gorakhpur; Kishanganj and Begusarai (Bihar); Dhanbad (Jharkhand); Hoshangabad (Madhya Pradesh); Pali (Rajasthan); Nashik and Raigad (Maharashtra); Narmada (Gujarat); Krishna and West Godavari (Andhra Pradesh); Ranga Reddy (Telangana); Tumkur (Karnataka); Thrissur (Kerala); Karnal and Kurukshetra (Haryana); and, Una (Himachal Pradesh).We will have a nationwide roll-out of this system from June 1. Fertiliser companies have been given a deadline of May 31 for procurement and installation of POS machines at all the 1.98 lakh-odd registered outlets selling to farmers. All transactions thereafter will have to be done through POS machines in order to be able to claim subsidy, the official said.The proposed systems biggest advantage is that it can track actual purchases by the final buyer. A farmer growing wheat or paddy may apply up to three 50-kg bags of urea, one bag of di-ammonium phosphate (DAP) and half-a-bag of muriate of potash (MOP) per acre. That requirement could be more  say, three bags urea and 1.5 bags each of DAP and MOP per acre  for potato and sugarcane.But under the new system, it is possible to record transactions at individual farmer-level. If someone is buying 200 bags of urea, that person is more likely to be a plywood or particle board manufacturer than a farmer. Either way, he isnt deserving of subsidy.Neem-coating has already helped check illegal diversion of a highly-subsidised fertiliser towards non-agricultural use. The linking of subsidy payment to data generated at retail sale point leaves virtually no scope for diversion that is always possible from the godown or rail rake point, the official said. Nor can fertilisers be smuggled from border areas to Bangladesh or Nepal, since there will be no POS machines there for recording sales and claiming subsidy.The fertiliser industry has cautiously welcomed the proposed reform. I want this to succeed, as it is an important first step that should culminate in the subsidy being transferred directly to farmers bank accounts, which is what DBT is ultimately about, said Suresh Krishnan, managing director, Zuari Global Ltd, a leading urea and phosphatic fertiliser marketer.The industrys main apprehension is on the preparedness of retailers to accurately record not just farmers details and quantities purchased, but also the company/unit supplying the material in each case. The fact that fertiliser sales are also concentrated over just few months (June-August and October-December) of the year only complicates matters further. Add to this the possibility of the POS device not working due to network connectivity or signal strength problems, it could be a recipe for chaos during the peak agricultural season.We are also concerned over timely subsidy payment. As it is, the industry is owed Rs 40,000 crore of unpaid subsidy bills carried forward each year, entailing an annual interest outgo of Rs 4,000 crore for which there is no reimbursement. If payment of subsidy will now happen only after actual sale of material to the farmer, it will add to our working capital costs, said Satish Chander, director-general, Fertiliser Association of India.Under the proposed system, payment of subsidy is to be based on weekly settlement of claims from actual sales data captured on POS machines. The industry will be happy if it really happens that way. We have supported this scheme, so much so that the entire cost of procuring and installing the two lakh POS devices (about Rs 400 crore) is being borne by us. We only want that it should lead to the implementation of DBT in the true sense of the subsidy going directly to the farmers, said Chander.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Its poetic, yes - pure music to film geeks the world over, yes. A work of movie marketing genius, by most accounts. But its a tagline. And almost 40 years have passed, but no other has come even remotely close to capturing the tone of the movie its selling with such concise, chilling and underappreciated success.Its not often we talk about movie taglines. But this one, for Ridley Scotts classic creature feature Alien, is worth talking about, even 40 years after audiences first saw it on that equally iconic poster. Especially now that Life, the new space thriller starring Jake Gyllenhaal, Ryan Reynolds and Rebecca Ferguson, is out. The movie is, to put it plainly, like a mutated clone birthed in a secret government lab using smuggled Alien DNA, but unlike the dozens of other films it has inspired, Life probably comes closest to not seeming like an out and out rip off, and takes, against all expectations, a life of its own.For one, its remarkably well made. Almost too well made in fact, for the sort of film it is (a largely derivative thriller which borrows heavily not only from the goofy monster movies of the 50s, but also from gory 80s horror and pulpy 90s action).In it, a crew of six racially and culturally diverse astronauts carrying out important scientific experiments on the International Space Station intercepts a cargo vessel which is said to have discovered a mysterious organism on Mars. Its microscopic, a single cell of life that in itself is an achievement worth writing home about.And indeed, back on Earth, everyones losing their minds over what important heads on Times Squares massive LED screens are calling the greatest discovery in the history of mankind. And our brave crew is tasked with bringing it back home. But over the next few weeks, what used to look like a wondrous, inanimate version of Baby Groot begins showing signs of intelligence. At first, its just small movements; a slight twitch, a steady growth in size, a noticeable reaction to its environment, to touch, to warmth. But before you can say Run! the tiny cell (which theyve christened Calvin, the idiots) begins consuming literally everything it can sense in the goriest, most stomach-churning manner possible.It is explained to us, in just one scene of expertly crafted terror, that there is no stopping Calvin. It will continue getting stronger. It will continue getting bigger. It will continue killing. One by one.And in space, no one can hear you scream.What struck me most about Life was how well it was written. Really, its so rare these days to see such a solidly put together piece of popcorn entertainment. By definition, these movies are supposed to be filled with plot holes and cardboard characters, convenient contrivances and pathetic, laughable dialogue. But not Life, no.You couldnt tell it, but its the handiwork of Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, whom the nerdiest of readers will remember as the real heroes behind Deadpool. With Life, theyve managed to deliver a masterclass in blockbuster movie writing. Its a meta commentary on the very nature of these movies  especially the violent slasher horror films it so lovingly rips off.Theres so much that could have gone wrong. God knows we see it happen often enough. Theres so much explaining to do, made up science-y gobbledygook to deliver with a straight face, so many wafer thin characters to develop just enough for us to care about their survival.Remember how The Martian made you feel like a genius? How every time Matt Damon would explain a complicated potato farming scheme, and youd nod away like it was Nigella Lawson whispering a cake recipe? Well, Life chooses to completely ignore exposition, which, if you really think about it, is a rather bold move.Sure, this also means that a lot of plot elements remain mostly unexplained. And sure, the whole thing looks like Gravity, sounds like Interstellar and feels like Alien anyway, but it never explains itself, or feels the need to explain itself. And soon, as you are wont to do when faced with these situations, you stop resisting. You stop comparing it to the other films its borrowing from, simply because of the honesty with which it is going about it.And finally, a word about director Daniel Espinosa, who I feel never really lived up to the promise of his terrific Swedish debut Snabba Cash. He was given several big-ticket projects to work on when he moved to Hollywood (he first worked with Ryan Reynolds in Safe House, and then with Tom Hardy in Child 44), but be honest, do you remember either of those movies? And he very nearly stuffs up the landing in this one too (the final scene simply doesnt work). But the movie leading up to it is made with such well-oiled precision, delights in such gleefully claustrophobic chills, its difficult to resist.So dont.Watch the Life trailer hereFollow @htshowbiz for moreThe author tweets @RohanNaahar"

In this effort, it has offered to act as a mediator.Addressing a gathering of potato growers in Buh village near Harike, Tarn Taran deputy commissioner D P S Kharbanda said that the administration would arrange for a visit of farmers to chips manufacturing projects installed under the agriculture technology management agency (ATMA) and those who would be interested in setting up their own units would be provided loans with up to 33% subsidy.For the past one month, potatoes are being sold for Rs 2-3 per kg in the wholesale market and were available in retail for Rs 10 per kg. Many potato growers had even ploughed their produce due to steep decline in rates.Kharbanda stated that he had instructed the agriculture department to prepare a list of farmers interested in having their own food processing projects. He further said that the district administration had directed the district education officer to purchase potatoes from farmers for Rs 5 per kg for midday meal scheme.On the issue of lack of storage facility in schools, he said the agriculture department had been asked to ensure storage of potatoes in the godowns near these schools."

58fbd25ca3d24b44f321f598,The breakfast story,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/the-breakfast-story/article17660948.ece,2017-03-25,"On some Sundays, my breakfast consists of two fluffy bhatureys with a good helping of chholey, and some onion slices and pickled carrots and chillies on the side. I go to the local sweetshop for this, and I find that their fare is usually good. But the last time I got our breakfast packed from this busy eatery, I was a bit disappointed. The chholey was fine but the bhatureys were a little hard. They reminded me of bedmi, and suddenly I yearned for the bedmi and hot aloo sabzis that Chandni Chowk is known for.Vegetarian sideOnce the stomach demands, the body obeys. So a few days ago, I decided that while the weather was still bearable, I needed to go to Purani Dilli. I had gone there in the evening once and had my fill of kababs. Now I needed to go to the vegetarian part of the Walled City in the daytime for bedmi aloo.Think bedmi, and you think of Shiv Misthan Bhandar. This is an old, old shop on the mouth of Kucha Ghasiram (Shop no. 375, phone no. 23921406). This is near the Fatehpuri Mosque side of Chandni Chowk, away from the Red Fort end. The shop has just 11 items on the menu.If you are there in the mornings, you can breakfast on nagori halwa (Rs. 60), a delicious dish of small puris which you pierce in the middle (the way golgappas come) and stuff with halwa and eat. Apart from bedmi aloo (Rs. 90), they have chholey bhaturey (Rs. 80), and kachori and samosa (Rs. 50). They sell six kinds of sweets  jalebi and imarti (Rs. 500 a kilo), gulab jamun (Rs. 450), suji halwa (Rs. 400), mung dal halwa (Rs. 450) and malpua (Rs. 400). You can also buy them by plate  two imartis, for instance, are for Rs. 60 and two pieces of jalebi for Rs. 50.When I used to go there earlier, you had to stand and eat. Now the place has expanded at the back and there is seating for at least 30 people. If you are eating there, helpers keep filling your slot for sabzi and chholey if they find it empty. I, of course, took the bedmis home  and had a delicious lunch of two big puris stuffed with a dal paste, a nicely runny potato sabzi and lightly cooked chholey. I had all this with some tart methi chutney and pickles.The best thing about Shiv Misthan Bhandar is that every dish is cooked in desi ghee. I love the flavour and taste of ghee, so bedmi fried in ghee is like ambrosia for me. And because there are only 11 items on the menu (unlike the big vegetarian fast food chains, where you get everything these days from pizzas and pasta to noodles and burgers and bhatureys and chaat), Shiv Misthan keeps a strict check on quality. I have been eating their food for years, and find that it is as good as it was when I first went there long years ago.The place is known for its chholey bhaturey and imartis, too. And I firmly believe that their jalebi is a lot better than the thick ones that you get in Dariba. Shiv Misthans jalebi is juicy, yet crisp. And its delicious when eaten hot, just off the kadai.My craving for bedmi aloo has been met. But its been a while since I had Shiv Misthans nagori halwa. One day soon, I tell myself."

The truck owners say they're parked near private Noida colleges for most of the day because 80-90% of their business comes from the students of these colleges, who're usually dissatisfied with the fare at their college canteen, don't have restaurants nearby, and can afford to pay for the varied fare the food trucks dish out.Shobhit and Karishma Agarwal, co-owners of Burnout stationed near Sector 37, say, ""90% of our customers are students from nearby colleges, who come from well-to-do families. Since we cater mostly to youngsters, we ensure that we don't have the same old, greasy, desi khaana. We keep introducing offers to attract the young crowd. For instance, we have sombrero hats for our customers, who can wear them and click selfies, tag us and get discounts. Apart from this, we also have a TV screen and a sound system to give the feel and the vibe of a restaurant in an open space.""Bhavik Bhatia, who owns a food truck called Being Truckers stationed outside a Noida university, tells us, ""One of the major reasons why students are turning to food trucks is because one gets a variety of cuisines at these trucks with a new twist. College canteens hardly ever rework their menus.""IT'S FOOD TIME, FOLKS (BCCL)Food trucks are gradually becoming the dating adda for couples who come here to relax, share a meal and have some private conversations. Rajat and Namita, who visit the food trucks near their college frequently, say, ""When we want to bunk classes or have some private time, we go to the food trucks near Sector 150 and order a plate of chilli potato or quesadillas. Sometimes, we go to those food trucks even twice a day - for breakfast and evening snacks. Restaurants mein woh feel kahan hai? Yahan par khaane ke maamle mein hum blessed hain."" Tanisha Tiwari, a resident of Noida sector 37, who studies at a Noida university, says, ""Eating near a food truck is less formal and more relaxed. It's a refreshing break from claustrophobic college canteens.""Pulak and Meenakshi Aggarwal, who run a food truck called Flip on Wheels near Amity University, say, ""Sixty-seventy per cent of our customers are college students. Our outdoor seating arrangement is what draws them to our truck."" Pulak adds, ""After parking outside the university, we move to the market in Sector 50. Sometimes, we also move to Sector 45 market, where we cater to nearby residents, but the maximum sales are during peak college hours, from 10.30am to 5pm.""Nakul Malik, who co-owns a food truck at Sector 125 with his brother Mukul Malik , says, ""Eighty per cent of our customers are college-goers, while 20% are corporate professionals from nearby IT firms. There is a growing demand for Continental cuisine among youngsters. Since college canteens do not serve any such dishes, so students prefer going to the food trucks that not only serve Continental dishes, but also serve a great variety of Chinese, north Indian and south Indian delights.""Akanksha, Silky Singhal and Anushka Sharma prefer to take Continental cuisine from the food truck (BCCL)Neha Yadav, 28, who runs three trucks in Noida and two trucks in Gurgaon, says, ""Sixty per cent of my daily income comes from students. During the first half of the day, all my trucks are parked near prominent colleges in Noida, and the response that we get from the students is overwhelming."" Raghav Dembla, a student of Symbiosis Centre for Management Studies, who is a frequent customer at the food trucks near his college, says, ""Hum sab kuch try karte hain at these food trucks. From biryani and burgers to momos and chowmein, there are different options available at these trucks. After a point, ghar ka khaana or the canteen food gets monotonous.""Shelly Sharma, a student at a university in Sector 63, says, ""I prefer eating at food trucks over eating in the college canteen. College ka khaana boring hota hai. The food served at the trucks is quite filling, affordable and hygienic.""Aman Varma, owner of Doggy Style , who parks his truck near Amity in the first half and later moves to Sector 51, opposite Manav Rachna International School , says, ""About 80% of our customers are students from nearby colleges and universities. Even for food delivery, if there are 120 orders, 100 are from students during college hours."""

(Express photo by Vasant Prabhu)As the March 31 deadline for depositing unaccounted money under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) draws closer, the Income Tax department has started raiding small Surat traders who deposited huge amounts of cash. Surat has so far seen disclosures amounting to Rs 100 crore under the PMGKY.The traders who have faced I-T action include cosmetics sellers, chicken shop owners, grocers, footwear shop owners, tobacco and cigarette traders, vegetable vendors and airconditioner repair shops, after officials collected data of those who had deposited more than Rs 2.50 lakh in bank accounts post-demonetisation, and not responded to I-T notices or summons.The city saw over Rs 18,000 crore of deposits after old notes were scrapped. The Surat district cooperative bank topped among all the banks, with deposits of Rs 340 crore.The first small trader in I-T net was a tea and snacks seller, Kishore Bhajiyawala, from whose house and office the department claimed to have seized Rs 3.54 crore. Officials said they found he was a financier, running a firm in the name of his son Jignesh Bhajiyawala. Enforcement Directorate officials arrested Jignesh on January 20 from Surat and he remains in judicial custody.On Monday, I-T officials raided a potato chips distributor in Katargam area of Surat, reportedly after he deposited Rs 1 crore in cash in his bank account after demonetisation.

We do not make much profit. This is the first time the I-T Department carried out raids on my shop. Now we are on guard and will maintain clear accounts.Sagar Modi, who runs an airconditioner and refrigeration services shop in the basement of a building in Sagrampura, was also raided reportedly after failing to reply to an I-T notice. Sources said the firms account books disclosed a monthly income of Rs 1 lakh but Modi had deposited Rs 17 lakh in his account post demonetisation. Sources said Modi was also a contractor for servicing of ACs and refrigerators.Modi said they had never been raided before. We have suffered huge losses, and are afraid some other agency will also target us.Top sources in the tax department said they were also investigating the case of a 65-year-old woman who had a Rs 5,000 balance pre-demonetisation in her bank account, and later, saw a Rs 25 lakh cash deposit in it.

""Being on Instagram helps bridge the gap between so-called 'urban' and 'rural',"" says Malika.The Instagram channel has also generated interest among online communities, from tourists, food bloggers, and social enterprises. ""They've shown interest in staying with us to experience the mountain village life, participate in organic farming and birdwatching, and savour our traditional food,"" says Malika. Many village women double up as hiking guides for tourists.Some say they too would like to be on Instagram, but worry if they are tech-savvy enough. ""We can barely pronounce Instagram correctly, how can we use the app?"" says Bina, sitting in Maati Sangathan's one-room office. Her companion, Basanti, chuckles.

EU governments were asked to vote on the future of two grades of GM maize, Pioneers 1507 and Syngentas Bt11, which kill insects by producing their own pesticide and are also resistant to a particular herbicide.However, the votes against were not decisive in blocking their introduction because the opposition did not represent a qualified majority  also including countries that make up at least 65 percent of the EU population. The governments were also asked to determine whether to extend authorisation for Monsantos MON810, an insect-resistant maize that is grown mainly in Spain, but banned in a number of other counties. More countries voted against than in favour, but again the vote was not considered decisive.Mute Schimpf, food campaigner for Friends of the Earth Europe, said the decision now rested with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker. He can put himself on the side of the majority of countries, citizens and farmers who do not want genetically modified crops, or he can back the mega-corporations behind the industrialisation of our countryside, she said.At the end of last year, 55 GM crops were approved for import as feed and food into Europe. While approved for human consumption, in practice the crops are used as animal feed.

Speaking to The Hindu, State Agriculture Minister Purnendu Basu said he was unaware of any potato farmer committing suicide in Bengal due to losses.On Friday, a potato farmer Chandan Paul (40) committed suicide by consuming pesticide at Memari in Bardhaman district. Locals said that following heavy losses in farming, Paul consumed pesticide last Wednesday and was admitted to a district hospital. He died this past Friday. According to district CPI-M leaders, Paul was under severe pressure as he had incurred a debt of nearly Rs. 50,000 from potato farming in 2.80 acres.The Superintendent of Police of Bardhaman, Kunal Agarwal, could not be reached for comments.Heavy lossesLast week another potato farmer allegedly committed suicide in Paschim Medinipur districts Keshpur block. According to family members, Swapan Hajra (45) committed suicide by consuming pesticide following heavy losses. However, district officials said they were not sure about the reasons behind the suicide.Three other potato farmers committed suicide in Paschim Medinipur district. Badal Hati (51) committed suicide in the Bandipara area of Chandraka II Block on March 6. Locals said he consumed poison as he incurred a debt of nearly Rs. 1 lakh for cultivating potatoes in 3.60 acres. On February 13 also a similar incident took place in Khadikasuli village of Garbeta I Block. Locals said Gopal Nandi (50) committed suicide after being unable to repay a debt of nearly Rs. 1 lakh which he incurred from potato farming. He cultivated potatoes in about four acres.Potato farmers in Bengal are facing a severe financial crisis this year as prices have decreased sharply due to heavy production.Potato merchants said that while last year the total production of potatoes was 95 lakh tonnes, this year it has gone up to 1.50 crore tonnes. While last year potatoes sold at the rate of Rs. 550 per 50 kg, this year it has gone down to Rs. 200 per 50 kg."

Also, raw green potatoes should not be served at all.Recently, seeing the potato glut in the market, Punjab government has proposed its export to other countries. Also, government schools were ordered to enhance potato purchase for mid-day meals and gurudwaras for langars.Speaking to The Indian Express, Dr Manju Wadhwa, head of animal nutrition department, GADVASU said, We have studied potential of potatoes as livestock feed. It can be a good source of cattle feed that improves the milk yield without any adverse effect on milk composition or body weight (BW) of the animals.As per GADVASU study, potatoes should be thoroughly washed and introduced gradually into animals diet with increasing amounts over period of 2-3 weeks. At start, feeding should be 1.52.5 kg/day with gradual increase to 4.56.5 kg/day for calves, 1011 kg/day for yearlings (above one year) and 1618 kg/day for 500 kg cows.We should not feed potatoes higher than 30% of the DM (dry matter) intake or 2.5-4.0% of body weight (BW). In any case it should not exceed 10% of their BW in any case. Frozen potatoes should not be fed because animals cannot chew them and are likely to choke while attempting to swallow them whole. They should be mashed or chaffed with roughage, added Wadhwa.The study has also found that  nutritional value of 4.55 kg potatoes are equivalent to 1 kg barley or corn grains. But this does not mean a farmer should feed cattle with 4-5 kg potato at once. It has to be fed very carefully beginning with limited quantity, she said.Feeding higher levels may cause milk fat depression, indigestion and bloating among animals, cautions Wadhwa. In no case, fungal infested, sprouted, sun burnt (green) potatoes should be fed. Frozen potatoes should be brought to room temperature and then fed, she added.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd"

5904714a7be9e04154df6d07,Don’t cry for me India,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/strategic-insights/dont-cry-for-me-india/,2017-03-30,"The recent shootings of Indians or of people of Indian origin in the States has raised many of them to fear: Do we really belong there?The shootings have also caused a considerable hue and cry in India. Are Indians safe in the US? Are their children safe? Is this all happening because of the seeming hatred engendered against immigrants by the new American administration?Lets deconstruct the issue. There are Indian nationals in the US and there are American nationals of Indian origin. What does a sense of belonging mean for each group?Unlike most Europeans who immigrated to America in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most Indians who migrated to the US in the latter part of the twentieth went, yes, due to economic reasons, but their hardship was nowhere in comparison to say that of the Irish.After the Great Irish Potato Famine of the mid-nineteenth century, millions of Irish faced a stark choice: Starve or go to the new country. In the new country, they were known as the Dirty Irish. The first generation had a distinctive accent. It was not until the third generation that they started blending in.In addition they were Catholic in an overwhelmingly Protestant country, which looked upon the old faith with disdain. A similar story could be said of the mafiosi Italians, or the Polish, or the Russians, or the Hungarian. In their case, assimilation was even more difficult as they spoke no English and there were hardly any English as a Second Language Classes to help.Still they had no way of going back, and had to make their way in their new land. Did they miss home? Sure. But the inescapable realization was that you were in America to stay, whether it felt like home or not.For many whites, America became a true melting pot, and by their third generation, intermixed whites certainly felt America as home. The point being that it can take a generation or two for an adopted country to feel like home.For non-whites such as African-Americans, the migration was not just harder, but brutal. They could not go back to where they were ripped away from. Colour prejudice kept them away from any integration with whites. Even after a black president, and tens of generations after the first slave was brought to America, African-Americans still feel queasy in America.Why then should the Indian community expect that America will open its gates of heaven for them? Most are educated and came to America out of choice. Most have the means to return back to the home country whenever they want. For sure, they have a few things going against them.Colour prejudice. A different, esoteric religion. A heavy or sing-song accent, whichever way you hear it. Strange customs and different food. But they also have advantages. Their Indian education and English skills enable them to get higher education and highly-paid jobs.Everywhere you look there are Indians in leadership positions: academia, politics, industry, even as motel and hotel owners. Indians could well argue that they have worked hard for their gains, and nothing was handed to them for free. Sure, but seeing such a particular community suddenly getting prosperous breeds resentment.Then the question of a sense of belonging comes in. The prized green card allows you to stay ad nauseam in the US, while retaining your Indian passport, and is the preferred choice of many Indians. But many Indians have crossed over to the other side, by becoming American citizens.Now, while they are still called Indians in the US, they are technically Americans of Indian origin. They have now lost their Indian citizenship and have come under Americas jurisdiction. The transition is not just that a piece of paper; it is mental and emotional as well.In my case, an Indian friend with a green card coerced me to adopt American citizenship. I said no, no, no. India was where I would change the world, and where my ashes would be set forth in the Ganges, as I did for my fathers, and he did for his fathers.Dont get emotional, cautioned my friend. In the post-9/11 situation, the US could stop awarding its citizenship. So what, I responded? Then he remarked, pragmatically, just use the American passport as a travel document.I reluctantly heeded his advice and went through the naturalization process. But I had checked before, that with the Overseas Citizenship of India, I could regain my Indian citizenship in a few years. That was most encouraging, but I was wrong.A few years ago, I returned to India, in part to regain my Indian citizenship. I learned that I could rewin it, but would have to renounce my American one. What a convoluted way to go about life. And then my American citizenship came in handy where I least expected it, as protection against tough times in India.I would go for an evening walk in a neighbourhood park. Pollution made me wear a mask, which no one in my colony did. I had a beard, was dark-skinned, and tall. I quickly became known as a rapist in the park. One guy went around spreading the jolly news that I had quit the States because I had a rape record there.Women started looking at me with trepidation. I complained to the colonys president. He said he could do nothing. Only when I told him that I would moan to the American embassy that he promised to do something. Still nothing. I stopped going to the park.I had returned to India to live and work, to look after aged parents, and guard my ancestral property. But my cousins, with whom I shared the inheritance, were miffed upon seeing me. Hadnt I made enough money in America?Thats the other thing. India embraces only those NRIs and people of Indian origin who have achieved signal success in the West. The media gets into the act, praising them to the high heavens. Arent we Indians so smart, outsmarting the whites even?For many ordinary Indians returning, the experience can be harrowing, as exemplified by the New York Times article here. They find resentment, disdain. The poor returnee is already struggling with his new life in what has now become a strange land. His teenage daughter returns home crying every day that she is treated as easy meat in school. Finally the returnee puts up his hands in despair: If India does not need me, I dont need India.Americans of Indian origin also dont need Indian ministers bawling over their plight, which is done mostly for the consumption of domestic audiences. For sure, they should help afflicted Indians, but please leave us Americans alone. The American justice system is sufficient to take care of us.Strong words, eh? So where is home really? Home is where the hearth is. And that for me now is America. Unless India awards me dual citizenship. Like the Beatles song goes, Indians might perceive me as a nowhere man. Maybe I am. Or maybe I have become a nomad, an everywhere man.But please, dont cry for me India."

More than 4,000 varieties are grown in Peru, Bolivia and Ecuador, where potatoes have sprouted even in cold, barren lands.The Peruvian scientists didnt have to go far to find high-salinity soil similar to that found on Mars, though with some of the organic material Mars lacks: Pampas de la Joya along the countrys southern coast receives less than a millimeter of rain a year, making its terrain somewhat comparable to the Red Planets parched ground.International Potato Center researchers transported 700 kilos (1,540 pounds) of the soil to Lima, planted 65 varieties and waited. In the end, just four sprouted from the soil.In a second stage, scientists planted one of the most robust varieties in the even more extreme conditions of the simulator, with the soil  Mars has no organic soil  replaced by crushed rock and a nutrient solution.Live-streaming cameras caught every tiny movement as a bud sprouted and grew several leaves while sensors provided around-the-clock monitoring of simulator conditions.The winning potato: A variety called Unique.Its a super potato that resists very high carbon dioxide conditions and temperatures that get to freezing, Valdivia said.The super potato resists very high carbon dioxide conditions and temperatures that get to freezing levels. (AP Photo)Nasa itself also has been doing experiments on extraterrestrial agriculture, both for use on spacecraft and perhaps on Mars.Ray Wheeler, the lead for advanced life support research activities at Nasas Kennedy Space Center, said plant survival in the open on Mars would be impossible given the planets low-pressure, cold temperature and lack of oxygen, but showing plants could survive in a greenhouse-type environment with reduced pressure and high carbon-dioxide levels could potentially reduce operating costs. Most research on growing plants in space has focused on optimizing environments to get high outputs of oxygen and food.But understanding the lower limits of survival is also important, especially if you consider pre-deploying some sort of plant growth systems before humans arrive, he said.In the next stage of the experiment, scientists will build three more simulators to grow potato plants under extreme conditions with the hope of gaining a broader range of results. They will also need to increase the carbon dioxide concentrations to more closely imitate the Martian atmosphere."

Around 4 lakh transport vehicles in the State have stopped loading and unloading operations and joined the strike, said APLOA general secretary YV Eswara Rao. He stated that they had exempted emergency services like milk and water tankers from the strike. We will intensify our strike if the government neglects our demands, he said.Contrary to expectations, the lorry strike did not have any remarkable impact on the economy on the first day of the indefinite strike across the State. There was no effect on the prices of perishable goods such as vegetables and essential commodities. Oil filling station staff in Vijayawada and Guntur said they would fill fuel till the existing stocks last.When contacted, M Ramesh Babu, estate officer of Rythu Bazar in Patamata, said there was no problem in procuring vegetables on Thursday. Most of the vegetables come here in small trucks and autos which are not participating in the strike. Since Friday is a holiday for the market, there might be some problem on Saturday, if the strike continues. Even then, only a few vegetables like carrot, beetroot and potato which are transported by lorries will get dearer, he said.The lorry delivered vegetables in the morning as usual on Thursday. Most of us in the vegetable market are unaware of the strike. We have to wait and see how things will turn out on Friday. If the vehicle does not turn up, there might be a problem, said V Veerababu, a vegetable vendor at Kaleswara Rao Market in the city.Speaking to TNIE, Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna made it clear that petrol dealers are not participating in the indefinite strike and it is only limited to transport operators. Only 2 per cent of petrol tankers operated in the State on Thursday and the total operation will be stopped from April 1.Though there will be no impact on diesel sales, two-wheelers might face a harrowing time from Friday with insufficient stock of petrol at the filling stations. The indefinite strike of transport operators will be a great loss to the government rather than the operators, he said."

It networks the existing agricultural produce marketing committees to create a unified market for agricultural commodities. Officials said Koraput is one of the 10 districts to be included under e-NAM.According to officials, in the first phase ginger and potato produced in the district have been included under e-NAM and traders can buy those through online bidding. Till date, 1,700 farmers of the district are growing ginger and potato and 51 traders have registered with e-NAM. The highest bidder will be allowed to purchase the commodity if the farmer agrees to the price, said Susant Kumar Padhi , secretary regional market committee, Koraput.It is expected that through online bidding of products, the monopoly of local traders will be checked in determining the price of a product and the farmers will get the highest price for their products, he added. Anyone from across the country can obtain a license to participate in the online bidding process by paying fee of Rs 1,100 at the respective market committee.According to official data available annually, around 20 tonne of ginger and eight tonne of potato are grown by farmers in the district. Also, farmers are optimistic that through online bidding they will financially benefit and will not be forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices. ""Last year, we sold ginger at Rs 8 a kg to local traders but in bordering Andhra Pradesh it was sold at Rs 35 to 40 a kg. However, through online bidding we are hopeful to get the maximum profit for out products,"" said Chandra Chepadi, a ginger grower of Bodotema village under Pottangi block, who has registered with e-NAM.Apart from Koraput, the e-NAM project will be operational at Puri, Nayagarh, Cuttack, Balangir, Sambalpur, Nabarangpur, Gajapai, Rayagada and Phulbani districts.

But this time it is not the big brand ambassadors who are doing image building, but professional influencers who are trying to tap bloggers who could be opinion makers.The New Indian Express has learnt that the cola major has hired a Chennai-based influencer to reach out to bloggers with good following for an image revamp.Chennai-based Digital Influencer or Dinfluencer is currently conducting a telephonic survey and sending out questionnaires on behalf of PepsiCo to hardsell its Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives.Since the cola major has been in the news for all wrong reasons, with protesters holding them responsible for depletion of ground water table, Dinfluencer told that objective of the survey was to change that perception.There is a perception that Pepsi is depleting groundwater and not doing anything to the farmers, but actually it is not true. They (Pepsi) are giving more to farmers. We need to create awareness about their new CSR initiatives, the marketing representative says.Heres how the conversation goes: Do you know that PepsiCo helps around 25,000 potato farmers in Punjab by buying their produce for its popular snack, Lays? Do you know that PepsiCo sources about 65 per cent of all fruits used in their products like Tropicana from Indian farmers?

Wisps of smoke rise in the air and disappear in the medley of sound and colour that this street around Jama Masjid in Old Delhi is known for. You see men, old and young, grilling kababs on their small barbecues. Crowds gather in the evenings, just as the sun sets, for an evening snack or an early dinner.The Walled City has its own rules. Lanes devoted to vegetarian food open up at dawn. Thats when you get breakfast fare of crisp kachoris and runny potato curries, or juicy jalebis and thickened, creamy milk. In other parts of the Old City, the food stalls come to life in the evenings. Thats when the grills come out, along with the skewers and marinated meat.In this street called Urdu Bazaar, there is a small counter at the end of a lane. Thats where you find Anmol Chicken Corner, where the grilled chicken is so good  and so deliciously sinful  that you dont forget it once you have had a taste of it.Untold delightsAround the lanes of Jama Masjid, you can see spot eateries with little hillocks of marinated chicken pieces or whole chicken hanging from iron rods. They are cooked in different ways  grilled in a tandoor or on a rack over an open fire or simply fried. For many die-hard chicken lovers, these lanes promise untold delights.But Anmol is different. It sells butter chicken, which is not to be confused with the butter chicken  tandoori chicken in a tomato-and-cream based sauce  that Delhi is known for. Anmols butter chicken is just what the two words imply  chicken in butter.Relatively newIn Old Delhi, where some eateries are over a 100 years old, Anmol is relatively new  they have been at the spot for the last 20 years or so. Every day, some 100 kilos of chicken are grilled and served. It has become quite a rage in the city, popular both with local residents and distant tourists and food walkers.If you are there any evening, you will find at the counter a mound of marinated pieces of chicken, boneless or with bone, in a huge wide-bottomed vessel known as a paraat. Next to is a large slab of butter. The ustad at the counter grills the chicken on a skewer over a coal fire. Once done, the pieces are put in a bowl. A masala is sprinkled over it  a mix of chillies, dried mango powder and chaat masala  and a spoonful of chutney. In a pan, a slab of butter is heated and once it melts into a golden liquid, it is poured over the chicken. The pot is given a good shake, and Anmols butter chicken  hot, spicy, buttery and juicy  is ready. It is served with sliced onions and some green chutney prepared with chopped coriander leaves and chillies.The butter softens the meat, seeping into it and giving it its own distinct flavour and aroma. Eaten there and then, hot off the grill, Anmols butter chicken is heavenly.Long after the last morsel has been eaten, the taste stays within you. And the aroma haunts you like a fragrant ittar."
58f52f1f7be9e01a3579b239,10 burning hot dishes to try right now!,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/10-burning-hot-dishes-to-try-right-now/articleshow/57942021.cms,2017-04-01,"They say that the chilli, like the potato and tomato, was brought to our shores by firangs from the Americas. Those conquistadors  the Spanish and the Portuguese  sailing in on their schooners, clippers and frigates, touched down in India and brought with them these fruits of labour from the New World. With the infusion of these vegetables  especially the chilli  Indian cooking techniques were never the same again.While that's history for you, here is a lesson in statistics. India produces the highest quantity of chillies in the world. We are also the world's biggest exporter and consumer of the product. Over one-third of the country's chilli is produced in one region  the Andhra Pradesh-Telangana belt, which also gives us one of our most prized peppers, the diabolically hot Guntur chilli.From Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Nagaland to Rajasthan , our soil produces some of the world's most bewildering variety of chillies. Take the examples of the Kashmiri mirch (flavourful yet zingy) or the byadagi from Karnataka (pungent and eye-watering). And then there are those northeast bombshells  the dalle from Sikkim and the dhani lanka from Meghalaya, Tripura and Bengal.And finally, above all else, is the bhoot jolokia. Cultivated across the northeast, especially in Assam , Nagaland and Manipur, it is also called naga mirch, u-morok and ominously, the ghost chilli. Consistently proven to be one of the hottest peppers in the world, it was at one time being considered for use in tear gas shells. A bite of the bhoot jolokia can numb your mind and transport you into an otherworldly zone of intensely painful euphoria. It's not for the faint-hearted. All of this is to point out that whether the chilli came from Mexico or wherever else, nowhere is it as celebrated as in India. From curries and pastes, to pickles and salads, there's some mirchi in almost everything we eat. Chillies are a rich source of Vitamin C and are loaded with antioxidants that help fight cancer. They act as digestives and have no calories. It's time we stopped being apologetic about our hot and pungent food and embraced its fiery goodness. After all, what's life without a little mirchi?This is amma's special recipe from the kitchens of Andhra and its not for the faint-hearted. Andhra cuisine is famous for its spicy dishes and mamsam guntu, as the name suggests, uses the eye-watering Guntur chilli in liberal doses. Made with chicken or mutton, this delicacy really rubs it in with a pungent mix of chillies and ground condiments and also a generous helping of green chillies to top up the heat. As you bite into the succulent pieces of meat, be sure you'll shed tears. Whether these are of joy or regret depends on your capacity to weather hot food. You can try this dish with steamed rice and a dollop of ghee. Trust us, it will be an unforgettable experience.Taco is a traditional Mexican dish composed of a corn or wheat tortilla folded or rolled around a filling. This chicken tinga taco's filling has shredded chicken, slow roasted tomato salsa and chipotle chillies. These blazing hot chillies turn the predictable tacos into loaded, sizzling time bombs. Chipotle chillies are imported from Mexico. Since they come as dry chillies, they are first reconstituted to make a sauce, which is used in this spicy taco.Here's something for the vegetarians. This starter is a Vietnamese speciality of potatoes tossed with herbs and hot Sriracha chilli sauce. Sriracha chillies come from the coastal city of Si Racha, in Chonburi Province of eastern Thailand . The beauty of this dish is that the hotness of the chilliesexplode in your mouth before dissolving in a haze of piquancy.This is a Spanish prawn dish cooked in a spicy peri peri sauce made from fiery red and ripe bird's eye chillies. The prawns are fried in olive oil with garlic and cloves and then cooked in the spicy sauce. It is served with Spanish seafood paella rice sauted withsaffron to balance the hotness of the prawns.This oh-so-hot starter is prepared with lantern chillies, ginger and green onion. These chillies come from China and are used for not just its flavour but also for the special heat they add to the dish. The chillies are revered for their intense pungency and take the typical chilli chicken to a zone of untasted white-hot flavours.One of the staple dishes of Kerala, mutton pepper dry has boti pieces of mutton roasted with crushed Malabar pepper and Kerala spices. The tadka also consists of dhani chilli powder, which adds to the spicy taste of the dish. The dhani or bird's eye chilli is tiny but packs a punch in terms of spiciness. It is used not only for cooking but also in chutneys and pickles.It will set fire to your taste buds, but is worth a try. Tenderloin cooked in roasted, blended spices with Andhra chillies, which adds that extra spicy kick to this bestseller at Bodega. It is served with soft ladi pav.It embodies the simplicity and beauty of the people it represents. Not for nothing is ema datshi known as the national dish of Bhutan. Ema is chilli and datshi means cheese. It is made from different types of hot chillies (green, red or white) and cheese (datshi, the local Bhutanese cheese). This hot stew of chillies and cheese is unique and can be had as a soup or a dip. The melted cheese and the punch of chillies leave a beautifulaftertaste. It is a big hit with youngsters and vegetarians who throng this restaurant. A word of caution: if you are not used to hot spices, you might want to have a fire extinguisher handy, or some other form of quick relief, when you try this out. Also, The Blue Poppy's momos are as famous as its momo sauce. The extremely spicy momo sauce has a pinch of dalle chilli (from Sikkim) paste  one of the hottest chillies of the northeast known for its sting and flavour.Laal maas, which literally means red meat, is a traditional Rajasthani dish that combines royalty with hotness. Succulent pieces of lamb are cooked only with roasted dry red chillies (locally called tikha laal), pounded in desi ghee and fragrant whole spice mixture or khada masala. It isprepared in a huge handi by simmering for hours together, letting the spices penetrate the chunks of meat and allowing them to be perfectly cooked. It is indeed not for the faint-gutted! The Rajputs used to have this with makkai ki roti, but you could even try it with roomali rotis or jeera rice.This is a Spanish prawn dish cooked in a spicy peri peri sauce made from fiery red and ripe bird's eye chillies. The prawns are fried in olive oil with garlic and cloves and then cooked in the spicy sauce. It is served with Spanish seafood paella rice sauted with saffron to balance the hotness of the prawns."

58fee0307be9e0413616042e,Dine here with fish hovering around,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/604200/dine-here-fish-hovering-around.html,2017-04-02,"Mrityunjay Bose in Mumbai 0:46 ISTCafe Hydro is one of its kind in the country. Owners have invested money to realise a dreamBorivli is a suburb located along the western suburban line of Mumbai and has several eating joints, including themed restaurants. As one stands in front of the well-known Esspee Tower near the Borivli railway station, an aquarium shop, a rather big one, lit up well and spic and span, stands out.As one approaches the shop, the visitor would see Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd, one of the biggest aquarium shops of Mumbai and Caf Hydro, the first aquarium-themed caf in the country with the biggest fish tunnel.Such aquarium cafs or ocean restaurants are quite common in some of the big tourist destinations in the world. In India it is the first of its kind with a fish tunnel or an aquarium tunnel. In the country, there are several restaurants with an aquarium or a fish tank or an aquarium wall.For 41-year-old Rupesh Sakpal, the director of Utekar Fisheries Pvt Ltd and Caf Hydro, this was not the first time that he had made an aquarium tunnel. The dream project of Rupesh is at Rajendra Nagar at Dattapada Road at Borivli East. In fact, Borivli is a bustling tourist destination and a happening place in the suburbs. When the Taraporewala Aquarium on Marine Drive was refurbished a few years ago, Sakpals company was tasked to create a 180-degree acrylic glass tunnel of 10x15 sq feet.A restaurant was on the back of my mind. We thought why not to make it more interesting. An aquarium always attracts crowd. In fact, in a restaurant where there is a fish tank, people prefer to sit by its side and dine. I thought of giving a different experience altogether, said Rupesh, explaining his pet project.The 17x15 sq ft fish tunnel is at the level-2 of Caf Hydro. The level-3 has a huge wall aquarium. Setting this up was a challenge and we decided to give it a try, adds Rupeshs uncle Manohar Sakpal, who is the chairman and managing director of Bhagirathi Group.With a variety of colourful, exotic, big and small fish of over a dozen varieties gliding around and excellent lighting, you are in a different world. When you have a meal, there is nothing like it, said Shaibal Gupta, a foodie who had dined at Caf Hydro.Manohar supported Rupesh, who has a Bachelor of Fisheries Science degree, when he started a 100 sq ft aquarium shop on September 9, 1999, near the Borivli railway station. His three-storeyed aquarium shop and caf now are spread over 10,000 sq ft.The ground floor or level one is filled with youngsters and has a feel of Mumbais local trains. It has been constructed using train tracks, train floors, sleepers, racks, ladders and a blue-coloured staircase. The roof has several artwork and bottles.The one-stop pet mall restaurant has been set up at a cost of nearly Rs 25 crore. We have made investments to realise the dream. We are very clear that aquarium is our core business and everything will revolve around it, said Rupesh, who is also developing a public aquarium in Ranchi in Jharkhand. We have to look at hygiene and service and nearly 100 people work round the clock in three shifts, he said as he attended phone calls.After Caf Hydro was inaugurated on January 26 this year, the number of calls have increased. Several corporate houses want to visit, do group bookings or have a similar aquarium in their offices and workplaces, he said. Nowadays people are looking for what is known as a stress-buster aquarium.Paste food, which is made of proteins of fish, is the unique concept of this restaurant. There are variety of delicious dishes like fish bao, fish burger, fish hotdog, fish bullets, fish cake roll.I stay in Borivli and came to know about it and decided to visit the place. I found it interesting and it is something new. Visiting this place gives you a different feeling, different excitement and thrill, said Vinod Yadav, a resident of Borivli.We constantly innovate, said Rupesh as he rolls out the extensive menu that looks like a tabloid-sized newspaper.Caf Hydro will soon become happening place for Mumbaikars, said Rupesh. The menu has been designed looking at the taste of patrons and we constantly take their suggestions, he added.Mouth-watering itemsSome of the fast-moving food items include dishes from surimi, a paste made from fish or other seafood meat, which can be used as a primary ingredient for several dishes. Fish onion ring is another interesting mouth-watering item and so is Thai fish cake.The list also includes fried fish balls, cholli garlic fish bullets, crispy chicken pops, seafood har gow, grilled chicken and prawns shanghai, grilled fish cake bao and peri peri chicken roll. Vegetarian items include bao, hand-cut potato batons, herbed potato wedges and cheesy onion rings.Besides Continental and Thai cuisine, the restaurant also offers simple Indian food like rice and chicken curry. There is a big spread of desserts and mocktails as well.As of now it is a no-liquor restaurant. Asked about this, Sakpal said: As of now we are on the launch mode. The aquarium shop is huge. On display are 425 fish tanks and over 325 species of marine and freshwater fish. After a meal at the caf, one can see and buy fish tanks, aquarium lights, tank decoration equipment, artificial waterfall, etc. Spa for pets is the another interesting thing.Asian Arowana is the brand ambassador of Caf Hydro. Arowana basically seen in various Asian countries like Thailand, Malaysia, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, Cambodia. The shop has a wide range here. One can purchase a pair of guppy for around Rs 50. The shop also fish species ranging between Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 3 lakh.Some of the commonest ornamental fishes include guppy (lebistes reticulatus), molly (mollienisia latipinna), sword tail (xiphophorous hellerii), platy (xiphophorus varitus), siamesr fighter (betta splendens), angel (pterophyllum scalare), tiger barb (barbus tetrazona) and widow tetra (gymnocorymbus ternetzi)."

However, the situation might change, if the strike continues, warn experts.As many as three lakh lorries in the State went off the roads from Thursday pressing for their demands which include withdrawal of the Centres order increasing the third-party insurance and high toll tax collection on State highways. Though the lorry owners association has exempted essential services like milk, medicines, water and petrol from the purview of the stir, some sections of petrol tank operators have joined the stir across the State on Saturday.""Of the total 1,500 petrol tankers, only 500 were operated on the third day of the stir. Already the petroleum sales have dipped by 60 per cent from Monday, the petrol tankers association has also decided to join the stir in a full-fledged manner. If this happens, the petroleum users across the State might face a serious problem, said Andhra Pradesh Federation of Petroleum Dealers (APFPD) president R Gopala Krishna.Speaking to Express, Rythu Bazar estate officer M Ramesh Babu said that indefinite lorry strike has no impact on the vegetable prices. Most of the vegetables are procured from the nearby villages across the city through auto rickshaws and APSRTC buses. Moreover, the vegetable prices are slashed by Rs 5 on each variety as this is the harvesting season for all the horticulture crops, he said.Veggies turn dearer as arrivals declineThe prices of vegetables also remained stable in Visakhapatnam, Guntur and Rajamahendravaram, but the situation was different in Kurnool. The strike has created artificial scarcity of essential commodities, especially vegetables and their prices are going skyward.As Kurnool city depends on vegetable imports from places like Delhi, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and other places, the supply constraints due to lorry strike burnt holes in the pockets of consumers.Kurnool imports potato and ginger from Delhi, Agra, Gujarat and nearly 100 tonnes arrives every day to the local markets. Because of strike, potato prices have doubled from Rs 15 to Rs 30 per kg, while ginger too saw similar price hike from Rs 25 to Rs 50 per kg. Tomatoes which were regular imports from Kadapa, Chittoor and Mahabubnagar districts also had its prices doubled from Rs 15 per kg."
590471547be9e04154df6d19,Game of Thrones: A medieval finale,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/treasurehunt/game-of-thrones-a-medieval-finale/,2017-04-02,"Yesterday we were driving along the North Antrim coast, on our GOT treasure hunt. And today, we are headed for the undulating County Down, with its little green hills (Drumlins), deer farm, sheep and the Quoile River, also touching a Christian heritage trail passing through Inch Abbey, dedicated to the patron saint of Ireland, St Patrick.Before I continue with the GOT trail story, let me confess that it came as a great relief to learn that forty per cent of GOT trail visitors here may not even have watched the HBO series that has acquired cult status. But wait, they say they wish to be part of the experience and then some day they hope to see the entire series and savour it. What about spoilers? Ah, never mind, with social media going berserk, its spoilers all the way, anyway.Interestingly, corporate groups come here to bond and engage in confidence building activity, including learning to wield the bow and arrow (very useful, post nukedom). An Indian IT group that won the trip in a contest was here recently, and were told they relished the experience. The only challenge was controlling their selfie-taking sprees, including one that involved clicking selfies in front of an approaching helicopter! Imagine, getting decapitated at Winterfell, not by the sword but by a helicopter blade!Winterfell aka Castle WardForty minutes by road from Belfast, is the 1,000-acre Castle Ward, overlooking Strangford Lough, now better known as Winterfell of GOT fame, capital of Westeros, the seat of the ruler of the North and the traditional home of House Stark. We are welcomed and given those huge robes with fur collars that envelop you like a tent. How did they stay agile under such a bulbous garment?Ah, the Tower. The backdrop of many an episode, but hey, it looks rather different. Thats because GOT used Castle Ward and its Tower as props that were propped by extensive computer generated imagery (CGI), completely transforming the place into a living, breathing, medieval scene.William, who runs Winterfell Tours, takes us around, reliving certain scenes in GOT episodes, playing relevant clips on his iPad even as he explains how the imagery was done. Very interesting, indeed.Robbs Archery Range & DecapitationNext, we all have a go at shooting arrows at targets  and losers (who are far off the mark) undergo decapitation by winners, as they place their heads on a log of wood! Shooting an arrow looks very easy indeed but when one actually tries to do it, it is very difficult, having to coordinate vision, arm, aim and what not  it obviously requires a great deal of dedicated practice. This is where Bran, Rob and Robb practice archery in the courtyard with their father, Ned Stark, and Arya, bored with her sewing lesson, abandons it, grabs a bow and annoys Bran by out-shooting him. (Yay!).Castle Ward, they say, has become synonymous with Winterfell, even though it was the filming location only for Season 1. So it made quite an impact, apparently. And is now a much-frequented tourist destination.Audleys Field & CastleRobb Starks Camp, Oxcross was filmed here at Lecale, bordered by Strangford Lough and the Irish Sea on the north, east and south coasts. The castle originally belonged to a Norman family that came here in 1210.On the grassy clearing before the Castle (what remains of it) and overlooking the beautiful Irish Sea, all 17 of us in the group are encouraged to fight  were given (rubber) swords and of course, were already wearing our medieval cloaks, so theres no stopping us as we fly at each other, raging and screaming, pushing and stabbing. Good fun.Inch AbbeyBack to the coach and on our way to Tollymore Forest we pass through Inch Abbey and Downpatrick Cathedral, the final resting place of St Patrick. The Cistercian Abbey ruins here formed part of the location of GOT and many scenes of GOTs Season 1, Episode 10, Fire and Blood, used Inch Abbey as Robb Starks camp at Riverrun.Tollymore ForestWe drive to the ancient forest where by a brook, Ned Stark and his sons find a dead stag which has gored to death a female Direwolf that has given birth to pups. The Stark children take the pups home. The location where all of this happened is right there, before us! William plays the video on his iPad, making us relive the experience. Next, the clearing in the forest where the deserter from the Nights Watch finds those dismembered Wilding bodies  Very graphic indeed.We also take a look at the Vampire Tree, a gnarled, ancient tree with its limbs spreading out in crooked directions.Parts of the film Dracula and Frankenstein were shot here. The 800-acre forest once belonged to one family, but is now taken over by government. The forest inspired C S Lewis to write the Chronicles of Narnia; he is said to have spent a lot of time here at the Mourne Mountains and Tallymore Forest, shaping the plot to his story.Medieval Banquet & WhodunnitThe action-packed day that began at 8:30 am culminates in an extraordinary dinner, with theatre actors chipping in at The Cuan, a charming Guest Inn with bar and restaurant and a charming couple that owns it, Caroline and Peter. We are welcomed at the entrance by Jon Snow, King of the North and Tormumd Giantsbane, leader of a band of Wildings and trusted lieutenant of The King Beyond The Wall.Inside, the dimly-lit hall has tables with medieval earthen goblets (designed from the GOT series) in which wine is served, and stone plates and serving dishes straight out of GOT. As the only vegetarian there, I get a special menu that is simply delicious, potato and blue cheese cutlets with veggies and rich, nut-filled bread slices.All through the dinner, the actors weave in and out of tables, mouthing dialogues from GOT, and finally, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister, falls down suddenly, gasping, clutching her throat, and  dies. Who killed her?Were given a form to fill with our answer and the reason we came to this conclusion.Excellent finale to a wonderful experience of The Game of Thrones locale-hopping in Northern Ireland. And you can be sure I shall watch avidly the upcoming Season 7 of GOT in July, perhaps, now that Ive had first hand locale-and-more experience!"

We are paying out of our own pocket,"" said Kuldeep Tyagi of the BKA.Earlier, in March, the West Bengal government announced a support price of Rs 4.60/kg for potatoes and promised to buy 28,000 tonnes of potatoes, after the state faced a similar situation.The BJP Kisan Morcha actively campaigned for the provision of a support price in West Bengal. It has, however, so far, refrained from a similar campaign in UP.""The situation is same in UP. Farmers are only getting about Rs 200 per sack for potatoes. While his expenditure on cultivation, transportation and cold storage is much more. So, the farmer is in fact suffering losses. The state must announce a support price on potatoes, just like West Bengal. Farmers have been suffering and the government has not bothered to do anything,"" said Rakesh Tikait, BKU president.""When we include all costs involved in production, the total cost comes to Rs 7 per kg. The farmer is getting only Rs 3-4 kg in the market. So, there is a huge discrepancy. The government should announce a support price of atleast Rs 10 per kg"", said Pushpendra Singh, President of the KSS.Farmers are also disappointed that while the BJP's Kisan Morcha raised the same issue in West Bengal, it has failed to do so in UP, where it is in power. ""Politics supersedes everything it seems. It is an issue for the BJP in West Bengal, but not so in UP because they are in power themselves"", said Kuldeep Tyagi of the BKA.The BJP's Kisan Morcha on its part assured the farmers that the issue will be raised soon, and they too will demand a support price for potatoes. ""We agree that there should be a support price. We will raise the demand soon with the newly formed government"", said Naresh Sirohi, General Secretary of the BJP Kisan Morcha."

The unprocessed version was a savoury and there was nothing sweet about it,"" says Mumbai-based Zeba Kohli of Fantasie Fine Chocolate who was in Chennai recent ly for a chocolate tasting session.""The present idea of having chocolates as a savoury is a fun fad that tickles the palate and makes people inquisitive about the ingredients,"" she says.Her tryst with sambar powder was one such fun experiment for a chocolate tasting session in Bengaluru. ""People did not realise that sambar powder was used in the ganache but they were excited that the combination worked so well,"" says Kohli.To tingle the taste buds, Chenddyna Schae, owner of Bengaluru-based chocolate store Jus' Trufs, created sea salt chilli bars, cheddar cheese, and balsamic vinegar truffles. The idea is to go with one's intuition and palate into newer territories. ""Some people are pleasantly surprised and some combinations shock the system, but it creates a range that caters to different palate profiles,"" says Schae, whose white chocolate with jalapeno dip, and potato crisps with chocolate fondue have led many of her customers into the exploratory path.The Indian market is still nibbling at the edges when it comes to savouries, feel some in the industry, as most people still see a bar of chocolate as a substitute for sweets.

But it shows that chefs are willing to learn and people are ready to try,"" says Chennai-based chocolate taster L Nitin Chordia . In 2014, he worked with a city hotel to lay out a five course meal with chocolates, down to the drink and appetizer. ""Such events are fantastic as experiences but they are not yet mainstream,"" says Chordia.It is herb infusions like masala chai, lemongrass, cori ander and thyme which are the flavours to savour, according to him. ""These are natural inclusions and not about a shocking ingredi ent. These are off the beaten track but do not really push the envelope,"" says the owner of Cocoat envelope,"" says the owner of Cocoat rait, which holds chocolate appreciation classes and brings fine chocolates to consumers.On the spice route are young chocolatiers like Sanjoy Solomon of Bean Therapy . The Guntur chilli and Malabar peppercorn under his label provide the kick and crunch of local spices, which he agrees are experiments and risks worth to at least initiate the idea of spiciness in a largely sweet product.It's the pairing that makes the flavours distinctive and interesting, feels Kohli. ""For me, savoury chocolates work best as marinade and in beverages,"" she says. Her wasabi chocolates and peppered wafers are to be seen as palate cleansers paired with wine or a dish, which is too sweet, she adds."

(Source: Express photo by Vishal Srivastav)KEEPING A key poll promise of the BJP, Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, at the first meeting of his cabinet on Tuesday, announced his governments decision to waive loans of Rs 36,359 crore taken by about 94 lakh small and marginal farmers in the state. The waiver amount includes Rs 5,630 crore loans of 7 lakh farmers whose accounts were declared non-performing assets (NPAs) by banks. In its Lok Kalyan Sankalp document 2017 for the assembly elections, the BJP had promised to waive crop loans of small and marginal farmers. During the poll campaign, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too had promised loan waiver of farmers if his party were to come to power in the state.According to government records, out of 2.30 crore farmers in the state, 1.85 crore are marginal and 0.30 crore are small farmers. The cabinet on Tuesday decided to waive outstanding crop loans adding up to Rs 30,729 crore taken by about 86.68 lakh small and marginal farmers till March 31, 2016, up to a maximum limit of Rs 1 lakh per farmer. In addition, the state government will also settle the dues of 7 lakh farmers with NPAs under a one time settlement scheme.All farmers with land holdings of less than one hectare, or 2.5 acres, will be considered marginal farmers, while those with land holdings of 1-2 hectares will be considered small farmers. The farmers were unable to repay the loans due to crop failure caused by hailstorm, drought and floods. Cabinet Minister Siddharth Nath Singh said the state government would bear the cost of the loan waiver and no financial support would be sought from the Centre. He said the state would raise the funds through the Kisan Raahat Bond.Finance Minister Rajesh Agrawal said farmers who have paid their loans will not benefit from the scheme. An eight-member committee, under the chairmanship of the chief secretary, has been set up to finalise the modalities of the scheme. Meanwhile, the cabinet also decided that illegal slaughterhouses would not be allowed to operate. Singh said the cabinet was informed that 26 such slaughterhouses had been shut down so far. The cabinet also approved the proposal regarding formation of anti-Romeo squads at police stations.The government also decided to draft a new industrial policy to increase investment in the state. A group of ministers led by Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma will visit several states like Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharahstra to study their industrial policies. Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya will head another committee of ministers to look into illegal mining. The committee is expected to hand in its report within a week.With the state recording a bumper wheat crop, the cabinet decided to open 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the state. While about 40 lakh metric tonnes of wheat will be procured in the first stage, the total target will be about 80 lakh metric tonnes. Along with the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 1,625, farmers will be paid Rs 10 per quintal for transportation and loading.

PTI PhotoDelivering on BJP's poll promise to small and marginal farmers, the Yogi Adityanath cabinet today decided to waive their crop loans up to Rs 1 lakh, totalling a staggering Rs 36,359 crore, at its very first meeting.The move will benefit over 2.15 crore farmers, besides 7 lakh others who had secured loans which turned into non- performing assets (NPAs).The Yogi Adityanath cabinet decided to float Kisan Rahat Bonds for raising Rs 36,359 crore required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers who form 92.5 per cent of the total 2.30 lakh farmers in the state.The decision comes a fortnight after Adityanath took over the reins of the state on March 19 after BJP and its allies stormed to power in the 403-member Assembly capturing 325 seats, an over three-fourth majority.Briefing mediapersons after a 90-minute meeting of the cabinet, senior minister Siddharth Nath Singh and Srikant Sharma said Rs 30,729 crore was required for waiving loans of small and marginal farmers.Besides, there were about 7 lakh other farmers who had taken loans which turned into non-performing assets ((NPAs). In order to bring them back into the mainstream, their outstanding dues of Rs 5,630 crore have also been written off.The loan waiver promise was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and state party president Keshav Prasad Maurya and it is the duty of the government to fulfil the promise made in BJP's 'sankalp patra' (manifesto) and the Yogi government was moving ahead in this direction, the two ministers said.In the past, farmers in the state had suffered because of successive drought and hailstorm.Singh said Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act mandated that no state can allow its fiscal deficit to grow beyond three per cent of its GDP. Hence, funds for meeting the expenditure on loan waiver would be raised through Kisan Rahat Bonds.Taking into account the problems faced by potato growers, who face immense hardship in case of bumper crops, the cabinet decided to set up a three-member committe headed by Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to see how they can get adequate remuneration for their produce.The ministers said the committee will also look at how to help the potato growers.The ministers said the cabinet also decided to raise by Rs 10 per quintal the minimum support price for wheat procurement as loading and unloading charges. The MSP for wheat it Rs 1,680 per quintal.A target of 80 lakh metric tonnes of wheat procurement has been fixed for this season and, in the first phase, half of it will be procured, they said. The ministers said instructions have been issued to ensure direct procurement from farmers and that they should not be harassed.In order to check illegal mining, the cabinet decided to constitute a group of ministers. The GoM headed by Maurya will give its report in a week.The ministers said the cabinet also took up the issue of investments in UP for setting up industries so the youth get better employment opportunities in the state itself.For this, a five-member GoM headed by another Deputy Chief Minister Dinesh Sharma has been constituted. It would visit other states and study their industrial policies.The GoM will study the policies of BJP-ruled states like Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh among others for preparing an industrial policy for UP for enhanced investment through a single window system."
5922c2377be9e01fe6dfa621,Has Pakistan walked into a Saudi trap?,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/apr/04/has-pakistan-walked-into-a-saudi-trap-1589681.html,2017-04-04,"Its now official: Pakistans much acclaimed former Army Chief, Gen. Raheel Sharif is heading for Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, to take up command of the yet-to-be-formed and Saudi-led 39-country Islamic Military Alliance to Fight Terrorism (IMAFT). The alliance has been variously described by pundits as an Islamic Nato.Defence Minister Khawaja Asif informed the Pakistanis in a television interview, over the weekend, that the government had conveyed its formal no objection to the generals new assignment to the Saudis in response to an official request from them to requisition his services for whats still, in a sense, a pie-in-the-sky.The news about the Saudis luring General Raheel, whod stepped down as army chief last November, had first surfaced earlier in January this year. But at that time the government took the babu (bureaucratic) line of defence and claimed it hadnt received any thing formal in that respect.The uproar, then unleashed, didnt focus on General Raheel donning a new mantle within months of his retirement. Rules of business in Pakistan, otherwise, frown on any soldier taking up a foreign governments employment before two years of retirement.The uproar, instead, was centred on a Pakistani military chief heading a clap-trap conjured up by the Saudis whod tried earlier, but failed, to rope in Pakistan, militarily, on their side in the ongoing war against a hapless Yemen.Much to the chagrin of Nawazwhose abiding and unquestioning loyalty to the Saudis is an open secret in Pakistanthe Pakistani parliament had, unanimously, shot down the idea and forbidden Pakistan from assuming any role in the Yemeni imbroglio. The lawmakers objection had a ring of authentic visceral reading of the pan-Islamic crisis the Saudis had spawned off their own bat against a weak and dirt-poor Yemen.The Yemenis, according to the Saudi narrative justifying their flagrant violation of the Yemeni sovereignty and territorial integrity, had been blamed for working as Iranian proxies to challenge Saudi Arabia at its traditional turf in their underbelly Yemen.The Pakistani lawmakers, as well as the much-maligned chattering class of the intelligentsia not in hog to the Saudi-servile and pusillanimous Nawaz regime, however had no problem in seeing the Yemeni adventure as a product of Saudi-Iranian tug-of-war for one-upmanship within the Islamic Ummah. IMAFT smacked too brazenly of the Saudis beefing up their ranks, with as many followers as they could cajole, coax or coerce, in their war of nerves against the Iranians.Pakistan, the nay-sayers argued, was a majority Sunni Muslim state with a sizeable Shiite Muslim minority, numbering at least one-fourth of its total population. On top of it, Pakistan shared a longand lately increasingly troublesomeborder with Iran, while sharing none with Saudi Arabia. Pakistan, common sense dictated, shouldnt burn its fingers in joining an alliance that didnt include an Islamic state as important and sensitive as Iran. Walking into the Saudi trap would be suicidal for Pakistan.At that time, some mealy-mouthed pundits had reasoned that General Raheel himself, wasnt in favour of becoming the head honcho of any scheme palpably calculated to become a divisive force and had so informed the Saudis.But the latest turn of events suggests that either the general had no such reservations to begin with, or had since been won over by the Saudis and the Nawaz government working in unison. A defence ministry spokesperson literally seemed to put a stamp of authenticity on it by telling the media that smoothening the way for Raheel to head IMAFT was part of the state policy.According to official sources, the general will be taking up the command of his still-nebulous force in Riyadh in April, weeks ahead of a May meeting in Saudi Arabia of defence ministers of participating states in the alliance to chalk out its structure and modalities. They will arguably be fleshing out the putative alliances bare bones.However, putting the general in harness before the Ministerial conclave seems apparently motivated by the Saudi tactic to pre-empt any move from any quarters to have some other soldier, from some country other than Pakistan, heading the alliances command.That, Raheel-specificity, precisely, is the sore point for the visceral Pakistani pundits, lawmakers and intellectuals objecting to what they see as a crooked Saudi scheme to rope in Pakistan against a neighbour of such sensitive dynamics as Iran. They may have lowered their guard in the months since the idea was first mooted but are losing no time to scramble to it in the face of the Nawaz clique succumbing to crude arm-twisting of their Saudi mentors.It makes sense for a beleaguered Nawazwhose fate hangs in the balance with the apex court still sitting on its judgment in the case about his and his childrens corruption and wholesale money-makingbeing desperate to do a last service to his Saudi mentors. He may, if the throw of the dice goes against him, still end up seeking another refuge with them, as he did earlier in 1999.But really perplexing is the military brass change of heart. Earlier the generals were in sync with those who loathed any idea of Pakistan going out on a limb in an intra-Islamic feud; it was a hot potato they rather shouldnt relish. What has transpired in just two months, since last January, to have made such a sea-change?The Pakistani pundits are lost for a logical answer other than a premonition that their civil and military leaders may blindly be walking into an abyss of national shame.Karamatullah K GhoriFormer Pakistani diplomatEmail: K_K_ghori@yahoo.com"

With summer in full swing, most vendors in the city expect the prices to skyrocket even further.The price rise is seasonal, said Balu, a vegetable vendor at Begumpet. Balu, who buys his vegetable stock from Gudimalkapur Rythu Bazaar, said:The present rise is not due to lorry strike. There were a lot of trucks supplying vegetables to the market on Monday. Farmers are not releasing stock and there is a shortage of supply in the market, said the vendor.The retail price of potatoes have shot up by `4 and are now being sold for `12 a kilogram. The price of ladies finger, carrots, beans, cauliflowers too have gone up.Sem beans have become unaffordable for us vendors. Two days ago the price was `35 a kg but now it is selling at `50 per kg. I decided not to stock the vegetable, said Ravindra Reddy, owner of Hindupriya Vegetable shop at Begumpet. The prices do keep changing every few weeks but a steep rise usually happens in the summer, he added.Interestingly, the rise in potato prices in Telangana comes at a time when the prices have gone down in West Bengal and other states due to bumper crop resulting in over supply.The Centre-owned National Horticultural Boards data for the second half of March also showed a 25 per cent decline in wholesale vegetable prices across many states. The reason for the falling prices has been attributed to farmers rushing to sell off their stock fearing spoilage of vegetables due to summer."

The chefs at the roadside joints knew the palate of their customers. They did not have to imagine hard for a hybrid snack, having earlier successfully tried their hands at recreating an aloo-da-paratha or mooli paratha or a gobhi paratha with chicken, mutton or fish stuffing. The plain, innocent pakoda is the worst victim. It had seen lacto-vegetable stuffing earlier, but lately has to bear with the more thriving non-vegetarian filling such as the chicken pakoda or the fish pakoda.Now the saddest part. The ubiquitous golgappa, which also goes by the name pani puri or gup-chup in the West and the East of India respectively, are being sold with chicken stuffing in metros like Mumbai and Calcutta. The mashed potato is the victim again. The days are not far when the same will be sold in your neighbourhood joints. These innovations lack creativity and are simply brazen acts of stealing from the recipes of our great-great-grandparents across India.""If it was not for the chicken stuffing inside it, I would never try it in the first place,"" a friend, relishing chicken samosa at a roadside joint, once confided in me in a whisper. I appreciated his sensibility. He perhaps whispered to avoid offending the simple, authentic samosa on my plate. That's guilty consciousness there. I had to return the gesture. I contained my aversion for the metamorphosed food on his plate and reciprocated with a smile. I said okay. Long live our Indian snacks!

Let the Centre show some gesture by waiving farm loans,"" Banerjee said after the administrative meeting held at Kharagpur on Monday.According to sources, the CM's farmland tax waiver doesn't apply to the agricultural cess that applies to all landholders irrespective of their holdings. As of now, small farmers having a holding of 4 acres in irrigated areas or 6 acres in rain-fed areas have been kept outside the agricultural tax ambit. But they have to pay agricultural cess like others. The cess is likely to continue.The salaried class may fret, but the decision sounds more political than economic. Banerjee, who has been accusing the Centre of discriminating against Bengal, has used this sop to take the wind out of BJP's sails.""I don't mind Andhra Pradesh getting a special package from the Centre. But Bengal was denied its due on the Backward Region Grants Fund (BRGF) in Jangalmahal. The Rs 1900-crore Ghatal Master Plan is awaiting the Centre's nod. Why this discrimination? Why are banks sitting on projects submitted by self-help groups? The Centre has to give money to the people, not just go on riot-mongering,"" the CM said.Banerjee said her government had covered as many as 11,000 beneficiaries in West Midnapore under several state government schemes. She also handed over the first 50,000-rupee compensation cheque to a person who lost his job and returned home after demonetisation.While announcing the sops, Banerjee wanted the people to make a promise. ""Wadah koro  danga nehi karunga (make a promise you will not take part in riots),"" the CM said in a bid to combat the saffron challenge days ahead of the Ram Navami celebrations beginning in the state from Wednesday, when Hindu religious groups are planning an armed show of strength across the state.The chief minister also took note of polarisation. ""They are using social networking to spread rumours. Can you imagine, a Union minister has been claiming that the Trinamool government has stopped mangalarati in Dakshineswar temple? I request you to cross-check facts before making up your mind,"" she said.Taking on opposition CPM that has been alleging a nexus between the state government and the Centre, Banerjee gave it back to CPM. ""CPM and BJP are hand in glove. Many CPM activists are joining BJP. Do you know why? They think they can oust Mamata Banerjee by tying up with BJP. CPM has turned out to be BJP's main advisers. Those who are CPM in the morning turn BJP at night. They won't be able to remove us as long as people are with us,"" the CM said."

Wholesale traders noted that the market received only 220 truckloads of vegetables against its daily share of 300 lorries on Monday. This had led to short supply of vegetables such as carrot, brinjal, beans and beetroot.Lorries mainly from southern parts of the State refrained from transporting goods even though the Tamil Nadu State Lorry Owners Federation had announced that essential goods supply would not be affected. Dry weather and drought conditions in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka were also cited to be another reason for the steady increase in the cost of some vegetables.P.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Fruits, Flowers and Vegetables Market, said on Monday, some vegetables, including cabbage, carrot, beans and broad beans were costlier by 25% than last week due to short supply. Vegetables such as brinjal and carrot were priced between Rs. 30-Rs. 40 a kg. The prices doubled in the initial two days of the strike as residents bought more to stock owing to strike. However, prices of onion, tomato and potato remain stable. They are sold at less than Rs. 25 a kg in wholesale market as most of the stock is procured from Maharashtra and other parts of north India. Meanwhile, about 200 traders participated in a demonstration in support of the farmers demands for loan waiver and drought relief fund."

To avoid middlemen, farmers can sell their produce directly to such centres by showing Aadhaar cards or land sowing papers.Calling it a coincidence that thetook nine decisions on the festival of Ram Navami, cabinet minister Siddharth Nath Singh said that a proposal on illegal slaughterhouses was also discussed. He said 26 illegal slaughterhouses in the state had been closed till date.Announcing the decisions after a 90-minute meeting, Singh said loans of up to Rs 1 lakh taken by small and marginal farmers, with land holdings of less than five acres, until March 31, 2016, would be waived.

It had promised to write off farmer loans and never spoken about any limit,"" he tweeted minutes after the waiver was announced.Replying to Akhilesh, power minister Shrikant Sharma said the BJP government was working towards fulfilling its poll promises but the opposition is habituated to being critical.Sharma also said anti-Romeo squads were doing good work and have been praised by all.

The government would finalise the financing arrangements based on the recommendations of the committee.The government's decision to purchase wheat in first phase up to 40 lakh metric tonne with a target of purchasing up to 80 lakh metric tonne is significant, it plans to do so through 5,000 wheat purchase centres.""If needed, these numbers could be increased,"" Sharma said, adding that over and above the MSP of Rs 1,625 per quintal, the government has also decided to give an additional Rs 10 per quintal as transportation and loading charges to farmers.The government decided to form a committee headed by deputy CM Keshav Prasad Maurya to study how potato farmers produce could be utilised so that they continue to grow it regularly. Other members of the panel include agriculture Surya Pratap Shahi and forest and horticulture minister Dara Singh Chauhan.Similarly, a committee headed by Deputy CM Dr Dinesh Sharma would visit other states to study their industrial policy before a new industrial policy is formulated in the state.

Kaustubh belongs to Vadodara, Gujarat, while Mohit is from Uttar Pradesh. A peeved Kaustubh told Pune Mirror, ""As I am a Gujarati Brahmin, I do not eat non-veg food. I never expected this kind of an experience at such a prominent restaurant, that too, during Navaratra, I was served a non-veg dish with pork. In fact, the restaurant served us the bill as well for the dish, which we hadn't even ordered. Both of us are law students, so we wanted to take legal recourse. We contacted student activist Pranay Ajmera and he suggested that we approach the consumer forum and file a complaint."" Both filed a complaint with the consumer forum on Monday.According to the police complaint, ""They went to the German Bakery Wunderbar on March 30 (Thursday). They ordered veg lasagna and hot chocolate for dinner, but were served a German Potato and Bacon Salad instead, by the restaurant's waiter. After having a bite, Dighe realised that the dish was not vegetarian. Soon after, a waiter came to their table again and served their original order. When they asked the waiter about the previous dish, he replied that it was non-veg and that they were served the wrong dish.""Shocked, they dialled 100 and called the police.

Friend Mohit added, ""When we asked the manager, Gaurav Baraskar, about the issue, he misbehaved with us and replied arrogantly. That's when we called the police. When we asked Baraskar to give us a written apology, all he wrote was that the order was wrongly served.""When Mirror contacted Gaurav Baraskar, he said, ""I was not present in the restaurant at that time. A new waiter had served them a non-veg dish by mistake. The police called me and I gave them my statement.""

An allocation of Rs 30,729 crore will be made by the state government for this purpose, said health minister Sidharth Nath Singh, announcing the decision. He told a news conference that Rs 5,630 crore worth of loans of seven lakh farmers in the state that had been categorised as NPA (non-performing assets) had also been waived. ""These loans had been taken from all banks,"" Singh said. Bankers are already grappling with bad loans worth over Rs 9.5 lakh crore on their books mainly because of loan defaults by several large corporate houses. The Uttar Pradesh government's decision, which fulfils an election promise of the BJP, has triggered fears of copycat demands from elsewhere in the country. In Maharashtra, the government is already under pressure to announce a complete farm loan waiver. Health minister Singh said there were 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers, out of a total of about 2.3 crore farmers in Uttar Pradesh. But sources said there were 86 lakh farmers with harvest loan dues of up to Rs 1 lakh. About 1.29 crore farmers would be disappointed by the first cabinet decision of the BJP government, the sources added. Former chief minister and Samajwadi Party president Akhilesh Yadav tweeted that the state government had ditched poor farmers. ""The promise was to waive total loan, not up to a limit. Crores of farmers feel cheated because of the limit of Rs 1 lakh. The poor farmers have been betrayed,"" he wrote. But BJP chief Amit Shah tweeted: ""Congratulation to Yogi Adityanath and cabinet for historic decision of loan waiver of 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers...."" Singh said it was a coincidence that the first cabinet took nine decisions on the occasion of Ram Navami, celebrated today. The cabinet reaffirmed its March 19 decision of closing ""all illegal slaughterhouses"". ""So far we have closed only 26 illegal slaughterhouses. But it has been resolved that no illegal units would be allowed to continue. Those interested may renew their licence,"" the minister said. Buffalo and goat slaughterhouse owners had alleged that the government was forcing all of them to shut their units. Srikant Sharma, the power minister who jointly addressed the news conference with Singh, said the cabinet had also decided to continue with the anti-Romeo squad. ""It is doing a very good job. But some political parties are trying to malign it. Police officers have been warned that action will be taken against them if the squad demanded identity cards from couples sitting in parks and roaming anywhere else. The innocent would not be harassed and the guilty must not be spared,"" Sharma said. The cabinet also decided to buy 80 lakh MT of wheat at the minimum support price this year and formed a three-member committee under deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya to study how potato growers could get better price for their produce. Maurya will head one more committee of three members to report within a week how to check illegal mining. A five-member panel under deputy chief minister Dinesh Sharma will study how to attract industrial investment in the heartland state through a single-window system. The other cabinet decisions include a sports complex in Ghazipur and a proposal to thank Prime Minister Narendra Modi for forming and giving constitutional status to the National Commission for OBCs."

Styled much like a British gentlemans club, it is situated on the ground level at Peninsula Redpine Hotel in the busy neighbourhood of Marol, which straddles the commercial with the residential.Its pretty much mandatory to go thirsty to a cocktail tasting, especially one that requires you to stir, shake, and get down to the dirty. We are at The Stables to attend a masterclass conducted by the bars mixologists. The bar/pub is is all done up in dark wood, and antique style with eye-catching chandeliers. Photographs of famous horses like The Secretariat dot the walls along with trivia, some examples of which are: Did you know the Seattle Slew had a habit of tiptoeing before a race, a move that came to be known as the war dance, and The Secretariat had a heart, two-and-a-half-times the size of a normal horse.Mixologist James Birch, who has come from the bars Dubai outpost, begins the workshop with two cocktails. The first one is Wind Suck (Rs. 400), a vodka-based drink, with fresh cucumber, lemon juice, honey, orange juice and lemonade. It is cool, refreshing and has a prominent kick (pun-intended). Wind Suck is so named as it is what the horse does when it is happy. It sucks in wind, he says, taking another empty glass to stir Stables Grog (Rs. 300), a drink named after Franky, a famous jockey. He is an ex-Godolphine club member, one of the biggest derby clubs in the world, owned by the Sheikh of Dubai. He once requested for a rum-based drink, which he grogged in under two minutes! exclaims Birch.Play on the palateNext up is mixologist Stephan Jovanovic who whips up the Oscar sangria named after yet another award-winning derby horse. The bright blue drink has a mash-up of Merlot martini, brandy, gin and orange curaao. While the backstory and ingredients sound promising, we dont like the drink for its jumbled mess it creates on our palate, its just too dry and sour. We pay keener attention to the last drink, Cribber Ascot (Rs. 450) made with white rum, dark rum, orange curaao, orange juice, lemon juice, grenadine syrup  all of which has a smoother play on the palate.Experts Birch and Jovanovic are done showing us their skills and it is time for us to try our hand at making Stables Grog. It isnt easy as it looks  we throw in Jamaican rums, pineapple juice, lemon juice, passion syrup and Angostura bitters, topping up the mixing glass with crushed ice and give it a good shake.But shaking cocktails is hard work and we discover that we need some sustenance, which comes in the form of the perennially busy popcorn machine; Loaded Nachos (Rs. 300), guacamole, sour cream, beans and cheese, and crisp potato skins (Rs. 300) topped with cheesy. The Portobello Mushroom Burger (Rs. 325) has marinated button mushrooms and tangy tomatoes sans a patty with freshly baked bun. Highway 55 (Rs. 400) is a wholesome, cheesy baguette sandwich with pork loin, with onions and mushrooms. The BBQ chicken pizza (Rs. 450) has juicy strips of grilled chicken and sweetened red onions.Since we are not indulging in a full menu tasting, and are concentrating on the drinks, we must mention the Smooth Mouth (Rs. 700), which looks like a cold coffee. We are not fans of milk-based drinks, solely because a shoddy rendition can ruin the night. We eye this one with contempt, though one sip and we claim it a stunner: its loaded with vodka, Amaretto, Baileys, Kahlua, brandy, orange curaao, milk and fresh cream. The comfort of Amaretto, the citrus punch from orange and the creamy Bailey makes it a comforting drink likely to get repeat orders. Dessert is a wholesome brownie (Rs. 399), drizzled with a thick, caramelised toffee sauce, with a vanilla scoop melting alongside its warm companions.The Stables, Peninsula Redpine Hotel, Andheri East; 40912345"

In Melbourne, they are racing at nearly 16 percent.The feverish pace of price increases prompted APRA to announce measures asking banks to limit new interest-only loans to 30 percent of total new mortgages, from 40 percent now. It also demanded that banks limit investor credit to ""comfortably remain below"" a previously set cap of 10 percent annual growth.""This latest step is a tactical response to current market conditions - we can and will do more, or less, as conditions evolve,"" he said at an industry conference in Sydney.""Our role in the current environment is to promote a higher-than-normal degree of prudence - definitely by lenders and, ideally, also borrowers - in both credit decisions and balance sheet strength.""Just this week, Australia's corporate watchdog joined the fray, introducing a new round of industry surveillance to ensure banks and brokers were not recommending overly expensive interest-only loans to customers.The measures come as regulators grow increasingly worried about a run-up in borrowing at a time when household debt is already at record highs, risking a damaging pullback in home prices.Australian banks are among the world's most profitable lenders with strong capital levels. They emerged out of the global financial crisis relatively unscathed and regulators want to ensure they remain safe.Banks have largely welcomed the recent measures.""I don't think any of us want to see house prices going backwards but more a leveling off of the trajectory would be a good thing,"" said Catriona Noble, Managing Director, Retail, ANZ. ""The 30 percent cap is good and... we can manage that.""""UNQUESTIONABLY STRONG""APRA was also looking at bolstering capital levels to ensure major banks are ""unquestionably strong"" to withstand a repeat of the global financial crisis. It had held off a decision on implementing new measures until an agreement was reached in Basel for global lenders. Although Basel has now extended its deadline APRA is pushing ahead.""It is important to remember that neither we nor the banking industry has stood still in the meantime,"" Byres said.""Without clarity as to a deadline for an agreement in Basel, we have decided it does not make sense to wait any longer to deal with the question of 'unquestionably strong'.""Byres expects APRA to announce new capital rules by mid-2017 and analysts say it is increasingly likely the watchdog will introduce tighter rules on assessing mortgage risk.""We believe a combination of macro prudential measures and higher risk weights could be viewed positively by APRA, the central bank and the government,"" said Richard Wiles, analyst at Morgan Stanley.""Higher capital requirements and slower investor property loan growth would enhance financial stability,"" Wiles said, while higher mortgage rates for property investors ""may remove the case for RBA rate hikes.""On Tuesday, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) held interest rates steady at a record low 1.50 percent for the eighth straight month.(Reporting by Jamie Freed; Writing by Swati Pandey; Editing by Richard Pullin & Shri Navaratnam)"

The view of the skyscrapers from the hotel room ensured the Dubai feeling soaked in. We headed off to Global Village. Well, before we get into food, let me brief about the worlds only place where we find America and Russia under one roof. Wondering how? Global Village has pavilions of all the countries representing their culture, food and shopping activities. Guess what! Indian pavilion represented our country in the real sense of the term. While the other countries co-existed in silence, Indian pavilion had Prem Ratan Dhan Payo and Kajarare playing in high decibels.The special tea at the African pavilion awakened all my senses and I was all set for the surprises Dubai was throwing at me. After some adventure with roller coasters, I went to Thailand arena just to relish those fresh-cut exotic fruits like dragon fruit, wild pineapple and peaches. Well, they are available at every supermarket in our city, but the Thai fruits were bigger and juicier. They were organic and tastier. While walking through the sprawling Fun Park, I stumbled upon Turkish ice cream stall and the magic that they weaved with it won me over. Nutella donuts to nutella icecreams and tarts, the hazelnut and chocolate lovers can go crazy. We stopped by the Grand Barbeque, anIndian restaurant to have our dinner along with our new Syrian friend, an employee of Global Village. The joy of making him taste the spicy panipuri and Afghani paneer with masala kulcha was thrilling beyond words. Just like in the movie Queen, he got teary-eyed when he first tasted the spicy pudina and imli pani, but later he couldnt resist from eating more. Well, I felt good turning into the panipuri wala bhaiya temporarily. The dinner was complete at the Chinese pavilion with some steaming hot jasmine tea.Ripe Market:After a scrumptious breakfast at the hotel, we went to Zabeel Park and were introduced to a concept called Ripe Market. Here farmers and food creators from the world over gather and exhibit what they offer to the world. Well, I got to taste caramel and lotus-flavoured iced-tea and cow milk icecream, various hybrid varieties of olives, white honey, queens honey, mountain honey, Mexican pina colada, organically grown fresh fruits, vegetables and more than 90 varieties of cooking oils. In addition of all these raw food, we got to indulge in some doughnuts, cupcakes and brownies.Beach Canteen:We Indians are used to eating at the beach. Arent we? Bhajjis, peanuts, corn and what not but the experience of having organised stalls of gourmet brands from across the globe. Well, what else can a man ask for! Clean beach, plethora of food and of course some music and dance. The live cooking sessions too were attractive, but surely not for the vegetarians. Beach Canteen at the Kite Beach had everything one could die for. Waffles with fresh cream and fruits to Japanese veg sushi to Lebanese style of cheese samosa,the authentic Emirati sweet delicacy- Luqaimat. It is fried dumplings with some date syrup or caramel syrup on it. I bet, one cant stop with one. It is as addictive as Lays or Kurkure. Some cold pressed organic drinks containing vegetables, fruits and herbs with names like Better than Botox replaced the regular aerated drinks. I tried all their flavours. Haagen-Dazs ice cream completed the beach experience.Street Night:The pop culture in Dubai is just beyond imagination. After having the taste of global platter at the Beach Canteen, the evening began with some street style food trail. Battle of BBoys welcomed us to the Street Nights where people thronged to get some chilled out vibes and sample the hottest street food vendors. Regions top graffiti artists too jammed in a live graffiti, adding to those vibes. Guess what was the best part of Street Night, Kaapi.. Kaapi Filter Kaapi! We Indians always manage to mark our presence and stand out. Well, coming to food, a young South Indian boy owns a food truck called Wokinakki, where he serves you the recipe of happiness. The fusion of Thai and Indian veg rice bowl made the non-vegetarians turn green in envy. Yes! The falvours of Thai curry with exotic vegetables and a pinch of Indian masala made the dish stand out among all the other rolls and sandwiches. Moving to the Egyptian stall, I was wondering, if I would get something non-meaty and to my surprise, a dish called Kushdari, made of rice, noodles and crispy macaroni with the right amount of spices gave me an insight into the fact that there are vegetarians in every country and it is not always about meat. Just to add fun to my goal-worthy food trails, I tried some lemon-mango popsicles. Oh wait, the Poland stall offered me some charcoal lemonade and Dutch offered me some cheese sandwich. Perhaps it is a global tradition to end the meal with a dessert and at Street Night, it was at Cryspes. It was fritters with preferred flavour topping. The toppings varied from caramel, nutella to the famous Lotus biscuits of Dubai.Comptoir 102The third day at Dubai started off on a healthy note. Comptoir 102 on Jumeriah road offered us more than just healthy food. Winner of the Whats On Award of the best Healthy cafe in Dubai, Comptoir 102 is one among the favourite places for healthy eating. The philosophy behind the caf is to offer a more conscious and healthy lifestyle by bringing more sustainable and nutritious food. The cafe had French ambience and arty stuff around were a delight to eyes. The cafe sources ingredients from local organic farms, sugar-free and dairy-free, with raw, vegan and gluten free options menu, changes daily according to harvest, just like at home. The smoothies and juices are vitamin-packed. We were served Skinny Boast- a smoothie made of cucumber, banana and basil, Heaven on earth- a smoothie made of cinnamon, cocoa and banana. Acaio, almond butter porridge, chocolate porridge and pancakes surprise my tummy that was full of junk.City Walk:From a simple milk chocolate to exotic dark chocolate, the mall had chocolates from all parts of the world. If this is not called heaven, then what is! Just when I was relishing those chocolates, I was introduced to a new snack called French fries. Puzzled? Well, these were sweet potato french fries. This just goes to prove that no matter how ugly potato looks, the output of it is delicious and addictive.Kak:At the Lebanese canteen, we tasted Kak. It is a bread with sesame seeds and a filling of our choice. For the sweet tooth, it was nutella Kak and for the chessy people, it was the herb and cheese. This authentic Lebanese dish has a history of being the most favourite street food of the middle eastern countries.We had dinner at Rang Mahal at JW Marriott Marquis Hotel Dubai on the last night of our trip and it was exotic. Chef Atul Kochhars team ensured we were served unique dishes. The yam starter was simple, but most memorable. Wait a bit to know more about his venture and food.(The writer was invited to get familiarised with the Dubai Food Festival by Dubai Tourism)"

A shipment of potato seeds (which were to be distributed to farmers for sowing in the coming season) had arrived at Whitefield Railway Station from Punjab. The delicate seeds had to be taken to a cold storage facility close to Hoskote within a few hours, else they would become duds. We did not have the time to remove our seats to increase capacity of our buses. We rushed 20 buses within half hour, he said.Nearly 100 trips were done to and from Whitefield station, and the whole load  crammed into luggage spaces, on and under the seats  were transported.As the transporters strike intensifies, more associations have joined the strike against the hike in insurance premiums for goods vehicles.With the strike expected to continue longer, KSRTC has geared itself for all exigencies.We have instructed all our district offices to ensure buses to help farmers transport their agricultural produce. The last two seats of the bus can be removed if needed to increase the transport capacity.

593ba9007be9e0066b6f608a,Rahul farmer salvo,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170406/jsp/nation/story_144836.jsp,2017-04-06,"New Delhi, April 5: Rahul Gandhi today asked the BJP ""not to play politics with farmers"" by waiving loans in Uttar Pradesh alone as agrarian distress was a national crisis and the Centre should come up with a ""national"" response. Although Rahul described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""step in the right direction"", he alleged inaction by the Narendra Modi government by tweeting: ""I am happy the BJP has finally been forced to see reason. But let's not play politics with our farmers who are suffering across the country."" Contending that the Congress has always supported loan waivers for farmers in distress, Rahul said in another tweet: ""The Central Government must have a national response to the widespread distress and not discriminate amongst states."" In the context of Uttar Pradesh too, he said the relief was only ""partial"". The waivers apply to harvest loans up to Rs 1 lakh. Rahul had petitioned Prime Minister Modi seeking loan waivers for farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab before the recent elections in these states. Although he has often demanded a national policy to provide such financial relief, the demand letters he submitted to the government were from the farmers of Uttar Pradesh and Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh decision is bound to have repercussions and the Congress appears to have fuelled the discontent with Rahul's response. Sharad Pawar has criticised the selective relief and exhorted the farmers of Maharashtra to intensify their agitation and ""make the life of the government miserable"". Devendra Fadnavis, the chief minister of Maharashtra which has witnessed the maximum number of suicides in recent times, was compelled to issue a statement that his BJP-led government was examining the issue of loan waivers. The Congress has also pointed to the drought in the southern states and asked the Centre not to address the agrarian crisis according to pressures of political exigencies. Rahul had recently joined the farmers of Tamil Nadu who have been protesting at Delhi's Jantar Mantar for more than 20 days. The Congress is also planning to raise the issues of farmers in Gujarat, which goes to the polls later this year. The Prime Minister had made a public commitment to waive loans of farmers in Uttar Pradesh and, at the state's first cabinet meeting yesterday, the promise has been partially fulfilled. The Yogi Adityanath government decided to waive loans worth Rs 30,700 crore while the total outstanding debt of farmers is Rs 92,241 crore. In Congress-ruled Punjab, an expert committee has been set up to prepare a proposal. The Congress, aware that Punjab's finances are in a mess, expects the Centre to step in. Chief minister Amarinder Singh has already met the Prime Minister seeking assistance for fulfilling the loan-waiver promise. Congress spokesperson Rajeev Gowda said the agrarian distress was the outcome of the policies of the Centre and a national scheme was needed to ameliorate the farmers' plight. Congress communications chief Randeep Surjewala described the Uttar Pradesh government's decision as a ""mirage"" that skipped the need for addressing the real crisis. ""There are 2.33 crore farmers in UP, of which 2.15 crore are marginal farmers. The proposal will cover barely 86 lakh farmers. The government should have waived the total debt, including term loans. Nothing was done for sugarcane and potato farmers,"" Surjewala said."

We should move to being lightly regulated and well governed, where the efficient and honest are encouraged and the inefficient and dishonest are penalised, he said, addressing the graduating students of the Indian School of Business.A well-known face of the Indian industry, Mr. Bajaj mentioned this while outlining what he believed politicians should do. There is no place for crony capitalism, he said.Attributing the relatively low per capita income to a misdirected socialist pattern of industrialisation, especially between 1970 and 1990, he said resources were wasted on the public sector while the private sector stymied. We developed a language of rights, not responsibilities, and created a huge burden of distortions and subsidies in the economy.Politicians should realise the damage done by the socialist clap trap and essentially dismantle the old system. If the private sector has progressed it is because it functions on the basis of merit.Public sector banksTracing other issues such as inefficiencies and corruption, labour laws, and collapse of public education and healthcare, Mr. Bajaj said, Public sector banks have been repeatedly looted by politicians and businessmen in collusion with banks officials. This, he explained, was done to create bad loans, whose cost is ultimately borne by the honest tax payer, leaving us with the hot potato of the twin balance sheet problem.The focus of politicians should be on efficient provision of services in health, education, agriculture, and infrastructure, besides a light but effective regulation of the private sector. Emphasising the need to minimise the role of black money and criminals in elections, Mr. Bajaj said public funding of elections and simultaneous elections at the Centre and the States were a necessary step in this regard.On their part, businessmen should first and foremost run their businesses well, growing in size, reach and capability. We must set and achieve the high standards of governance we expect from the government.Underscoring the significance of teamwork, he told the large gathering of students their families that leadership is about performance, consistent behaviour, and trust worthiness.Chairman of ISB Board Adi Godrej and dean Rajendra Srivastava urged the new graduates to focus on building a better society and be conscious of the need for utmost integrity and diligence. The graduation day marked the graduation of of the largest group of students  1,014  from the institute."
593ba8cc7be9e0066b6f601b,Bengal wall on cold store subsidy,https://www.telegraphindia.com/1170408/jsp/bengal/story_145244.jsp,2017-04-08,"Cooch Behar, April 7: A Left Front government policy to control the rent of cold stores in Bengal has come in the way of subsidy doled out by the Centre for such facilities. Officials at Nabanna pointed out that though cold stores in Bengal are owned by private agencies, their rent is fixed by the state government. The investors will be eligible for the subsidy only if the state withdraws the policy. ""The policy framed during the Left Front tenure is still continuing. It is posing a barrier for fresh investments in the cold store sector,"" an official said. The officials said the range of central subsidy for cold stores depended on the type of the structure and their store capacity. A Bengal government minister said it was not ready to reconsider the rent control policy as that would hurt the interest of small and marginal farmers. ""Store owners can demand any rent. Farmers may not be able to afford that,"" he said. A delegation of businessmen today met Cooch Behar district magistrate P. Ulganathan and demanded subsidy for those interested in setting up cold stores in the district. The businessmen pointed out that if more storage facilities came up in the district, farmers, particularly those facing losses from a bumper potato crop and lack of space to store the produce, would benefit. Officials said similar demands had been made earlier by the state-level body of cold store owners, but to no avail. ""Cold stores might not ideally be industrial units but such facilities largely help the agricultural and food processing sector. As of now, 10 to 12 investors here are ready to set up such stores but are feeling discouraged because of the lack of subsidy,"" said Rajendra Kumar Baid, the general secretary of the Cooch Behar District Chamber of Commerce and Industries. Sources in the agriculture department said more cold stores were needed in Cooch Behar, which has 12 such facilities with a total storage capacity of around 1.5 lakh tonnes. ""The district produces a little over 8 lakh tonnes of potato annually. Considering the production, Cooch Behar needs more cold stores,"" an official said. Businessmen in the district rued the lack of cold stores. ""Potato farmers who could not find space in the existing 12 cold stores have suffered losses. If 10 to 12 more cold stores come up, this problem can be resolved to a considerable extent. This will also create direct and indirect employment,"" a businessman said. The district magistrate said he would speak about the demand with the agriculture department. ""Members of the business fraternity here want the state to provide subsidies to investors who intend to set up cold stores. We will forward their memorandum to the officials concerned,"" Ulganathan said."

The approval is in tune with the state cabinet's decision to procure potatoes so that the farmers are not forced to sell it at throwaway prices in summer.The purchase will be made at Rs 4,870 per MT. The agriculture ministry will provide an additional Rs 1,217.50 per MT for overhead expenses such as transportation charges, mandi tax and godown charges. Purchase centres/areas will be decided by the state government in consultation with the state procurement agency.The move comes days after the UP government's decision to waive farm loan of small and marginal farmers and speed up wheat procurement drive at minimum support price (MSP) in the state.""The decision to procure potatoes is expected to provide a big relief to farmers who have, otherwise, to sell their produce at low price due to intervention of middlemen. Absence of cold chain in many parts of the state forces farmers to sell their produce within months of its harvest once temperature rises and this led them to get lower prices"", said an official.Announcing the decision, the agriculture ministry said, ""The MIS will be implemented by the state agency. The potatoes will be purchased from the cooperative societies, farmers' organisations or directly from the farmers to eliminate the possibility of middlemen taking advantage of the scheme. The state government will ensure that the produce is purchased from genuine farmers only"".It is decided that the procured stocks will be disposed of in the open market to ensure maximum realizable price. ""If necessary, this can also be sold to processing units within the state. The state agency would also make efforts to export the procured potatoes after processing"", said the ministry.""In order to avoid recycling, the stock would not be sold in the same market/state from where it has been procured during the period of the scheme. However, if the prices are better it can be sold locally"", said the official.The ministry made it clear that barter payments or payments in kind to farmers for procurement will not be allowed. It said, ""Payment to farmers as far as possible will be made through non-cash transaction and receipts for sales must be through banking channel only, preferably through demand draft""."

(Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav) CM Yogi Adityanath arrives at Lucknows Lok Bhawan to chair the Cabinet meeting on Tuesday. (Express Photo by Vishal Srivastav)THE STATE Cabinet on Tuesday decided to allow central audit agencies such as the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) to audit development authorities in the state, which included the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA). The previous Akhilesh government had denied permission to the CAG to audit GDA.In the second Cabinet meeting chaired by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the government decided that if the CAG seeks permission to audit any development authority in UP, the government will not object, Minister Sidharth Nath Singh said.Additional Chief secretary (Housing and Urban Planning) Sadakant said that in all, 29 authorities had been set up under the UP Urban Planning and Development Act, which provides for the audit of these authorities. A state government agency, Sthaniya Nidhi Lekha Pariksha in Allahabad, also audits these development authorities and its report is presented in the state Assembly, he told mediapersons.The CAG had requested the state government to audit some authorities Their communication was especially regarding Ghaziabad but then the (previous) state government had the view not to grant permission because UP has its own system of audit. The Governor too had intervened and had written letters in this connection. Last year, Governor Ram Naik had written to the PM and the President about denial of permission to CAG by the UP government for conducting audit of Ghaziabad Development Authority, said Sadakant.The Cabinet on Tuesday decided that if CAG requests for audit, the state government should not have any objection. I have issued the order that like Ghaziabad, CAG can audit anywhere it wants to, he added.The Cabinet, meanwhile, also decided that consumers will have to pay only the principal amount of their electricity bills, as surcharge would be waived for domestic and commercial consumers belonging to lower and middle classes. Small scale industries, both in urban and rural areas, would also be able to avail the same benefit.Moreover, farmers could now pay electricity bills in four installments in a year, if the amount is above Rs 10,000, Energy Minister Shrikant Sharma said.He added that during summer, the government will ensure that villages get power for 18 hours, tehsil headquarters and Bundelkhand area for 20 hours each and district headquarters for 24 hours. An official said power supply during evenings will be ensured in villages from April 6 and the state was purchasing electricity worth several crores every day.The previous governments too had decided to roster power supply for villages, tehsil and district headquarters but the decisions were not implemented at ground level Poor villagers are VIPs for the current government thus, the state government has decided that any laxity in implementation of the roster at the ground level will not be tolerated and action would be taken against officials responsible, said Sharma.Admitting that rural areas were not getting power at night, Sharma said the government was working to ensure 24-hour power supply in villages by October, 2018. He added that defective or burnt transformers of tubewells will be replaced within 48 hours in rural areas.Other Decisions* To sign a pact with the Centre under Power for All mission. The pact, to be signed on April 14, will help in supplying power to every village before 2019.* Purchase one lakh metric tonnes of potato from farmers in the current crop season to ensure that they at least recover their production cost. Government will open procure centres to purchase potatoes from farmers.* Sugarcane farmers to get pending dues from mills within 120 days.

In the last 15 days, prices of many vegetables have more than doubled barring that of potato and onion.In retail markets and shops in Satellite area, except potatoes and onions, no other vegetable is available at rates below Rs 50 per kg. While in Agriculture Produce Market Committee, (APMC), Ahmedabad, brinjal is selling somewhere between Rs8-Rs16 per kg in wholesale, the same is selling in retail at Rs 60 per kg in city localities.The prices of vegetables at APMC have gone up by around 15%, while in retail the prices have almost doubled. Officials from APMC said that all vegetables, except potatoes and onions, are in short supply.According to Gujarat agriculture department, the sowing of vegetables, which was normally done across 1.24 lakh hectares was done only across 82,000 hectares. The department however claims that the sowing of vegetable was around 9,000 hectares more than that in last year.Prices of several vegetables had crossed the Rs 100 mark in retail market in 2016, but had eased after demonetization.Agriculture minister, Chiman Sapariya, however, said, ""The shortfall in sowing has no relation with demonetization. The sowing was delayed because there was less rainfall in 2016, and hence farmers moved away from vegetable to crops that needed less water.""""We hope that prices will likely come down within the next fortnight when the summer crop starts to arrive. The prices are generally on the higher side during this period,"" said D M Patel, secretary, APMC, Ahmedabad.Patel said, ""During demonetization, bulk buyers were away from the market. As a result, farmers were forced to sell their produce at throwaway prices. But now the market has stabilized.""APMC officials said that supply of potato to the APMC each day was 370 kg more than what is normal at this time of the year, and the supply of onion is 415 kg more than expected, daily."

However, due to perishable nature of fruits and vegetables and more dependency on climatic factor, many times these crops face either glut or shortage thereby affecting farmers as well as consumers.""The glut situations are observed in many crops like tomato, onion , potato as well as garlic which lead to heavy fluctuations in area and production in subsequent years. The seminar will focus on various issues related to the topic and formulate policies and strategies to avoid the problems faced by the farmers,"" said an official from NHRDF.The prices of vegetables are decided on the demand and supply ratio. Onion prices go up if demand is more as compared to supply and the prices crash if supply is huge as compared to the demand.The average wholesale onion prices have declined to the range of Rs 400 to Rs 500 in the past six months due to arrivals of onions in large quantity at the Agriculture Produce Market Committee markets. It costs Rs 1,000 for producing one quintal onion. Accordingly, farmers incur losses if the prices go below that. Hence, this workshop will help farmers understand the glut management for vegetables particularly onions.Divisional revenue commissioner Eknath Dawale will inaugurate the event."

On Tuesday the government decided to purvchase potatoes directly from farmers in a bid to cut wastage and provide maximum monetary benefit. UP is the largest producer of potato in the country and Agra was the largest potato producing district in the country for many years till Gujarats Banaskantha displaced it this year.One of the biggest problems faced by the agriculture sector is large-scale losses of crops after the harvesting period. Farmers toil in the rain and sun only to see their hard work being wasted due to shortage of storage facilities across the country. As per a 2015 study commissioned by the ministry of food processing, quantitative harvest and post-harvest losses of fruits and vegetables ranges between 6.70% to 15.88% for fruits and from 4.58% to 12.44% in vegetables. The reasons range from sorting/grading and packaging to transportation and storage channels.In a first, UP govt to purchase potatoes from farmers directly https://t.co/U941AArind  TOI Lucknow News (@TOILucknow) April 12, 2017As per data available from parliament, India has 32 million cold stores (Bulk & distribution hubs) but requires additional 3 million more. As far as reefer trucks are concerned, India needs around 62,000 units compared to the current number of less than 10,000. If we look at the larger picture, almost 8679 tonnes of food grain was damaged across FCI godowns in 2016-17 as compared to 3115 tonnes for the previous year of 2015-16.

On Sunday night, about 100 Bengalis will assemble for a potluck meal, and this time, non-vegetarian delicacies will be included.This year, Good Friday coincides with Vishu so a few Malayalis will spend April 14 in prayer. Apart from an elaborate 'sadya' or vegetarian feast, the highlight of Vishu is the 'vishukani' arrangement. Elders assemble an image of Lord Krishna, betel leaves and nuts, uruli vessel, mirror, haldi, kumkum and the yellow kanikonna flower that blossoms in April. Early morning, each member of the family is blindfolded and led to the vishukani which is the first thing he is made to glimpse after unravelling it.Around 1,500 Malayali families in Airoli, Navi Mumbai, will celebrate with the Kairali Airoli Malayalee Samajam. Its president R C Pillai said, ""At 5.30am, we will arrange the 'vishukani' and carry it around the homes of a few community members.

In this district of north Gujarat, 459 villages were provided with tanker water during 2011-16.Banaskantha was followed by Bharuch in South Gujarat with 406 villages getting water through tankers. River Narmada passes through this district.The other districts where sizeable number of villages received drinking water by tankers were Kutch (330 villages), Junagadh (335), Rajkot (302) and Dahod (231). In fact, all the 231 villages in the predominantly tribal district of Dahod were provided water through tankers during 2015-16.This year too, at the very onset of summer, the Gujarat government has announced that it would be providing drinking water to 102 villages using 72 water tankers. On Thursday, the government announced that it would be providing water tanker services to these 102 villages in districts of Kutch, Surendranagar, Porbandar, Dwarka, Jamnagar, Junagadh, Amreli, Patan and Banaskantha.The use of water tankers to supply drinking water has always been a political hot potato in Gujarat, which over the years has developed an elaborate water-grid that is largely based on River Narmada. This water grid has a 2,727-km bulk water pipeline managed by the state-run Gujarat Water Infrastructure Limited (GWIL) and an additional 1,20,000 km pipeline for supplying drinking water under the Gujarat Water Supply and Sewerage Board (GWSSB).The implementation of the water supply scheme in Gujarat is based on Narmada canal and executed under two different programmes  Sardar Sarovar Canal Based Project (SSCB) and Sujalam Sufalam Yojana (SSY).The state has also taken up bulk pipeline packages under Mahi and Narmada bulk water transmission pipeline projects. By the end of October 2016, the work on bulk pipelines of 2,727 km has been completed and commissioned.Water tankers are used mostly in special cases and on humanitarian grounds. Most of the villages that are covered with tankers are either located in remote areas or might have reported some technical problem or breakdown regarding water supply, said Tushar Dholakia, member secretary, (GWSSB), a statutory body set up by the state government for development, regulation and control of drinking water sector in the state.State government officials said that tankers were usually used as the last resort in villages where other sources of underground water were unavailable largely due to salinity ingress. Tankers were also used in places that have difficult geographical terrain (or on a gradient), sources said.According to the latest edition of Socio-Economic Review (2016-17), at present 12,000 villages are connected to this water grid under the Rural Regional Water Supply Scheme. Apart from this, The Government of Gujarat has formulated, sanctioned and implemented a master plan amounting to Rs 13,990 crore for the Sardar Sarovar Canal-based drinking water supply project covering 9,633 villages and 131 urban centres.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App now"

But when chef Alexander offers you his steaming canary-yellow pumpkin soup, you are instantly tempted. It comes with a subtle, silky texture, enhanced by the sweet, familiar flavour of coconut milk. And, instead of the traditional garlic bread arrives regular baguette garnished with cinnamon and pepper. The chef brilliantly brings in three Kerala elements in this international dish- cinnamon, pepper and coconut milk.If you ever fancied a slightly tweaked or spicier version of gourmet cuisine, a little hatke from the regular fare, the Taj Gateway Hotel at Varkala is the place to visit. The newly-joined chef Alexander specialises in fusion cuisine, giving continental delicacies a desi twist. Its crucial to maintain the balance while replacing dairy cream with coconut milk. If the flavour is overpowering, it will totally ruin the character of the classic English soup, he says. The roasted pumpkin soup is a slow preparation where the pumpkin undergoes oven-roasting before pureeing to lock in the flavour and nutrients.Milk from all coconuts are not suitable for creaming a dish. Certain parts in Kerala like Varkala and Alappuzha are known for creamier coconuts. The quality of a coconut is dependent on the soil it grows and its distance from the ocean, chips in Ashirbad Praharaj, general manager.He calls it a western-recipes-meet-Indian-ingredients menu as some risottos with red-spicy prawns roll in. While making risotto, the rich creamy Italian rice dish, the chef opts for bamboo rice, another local specialty. The short organic rice grains add a unique edge to its taste and consistency.We find the risottos super yummy, and the prawns fried in Syrian Christian style juicy and sharpened with the right amount of spices. Here most of our guests are Europeans and they normally indulge in western cuisine. But the new menu I created is a blend of local and global culinary elements, he says.Next comes grilled fish on a bed of green peas, fennel and potato mesh. Usually its sea bass, a neutral-flavored fish thats used for the preparation. But here we are using a denser, full-bodied local fish, he says.The dish, that comes with fine raw papaya ribbons on top of it, is soft and moderately spiced. Another item on menu is Rack of lamb, a New Zealand dish for which the chef uses a sauce made of demy glaze and red wine.  I do mild alterations to many original recipes without taking away the authenticity. By customising it to suit local taste, we create a little drama around the same old dish. Some call it fusion cooking, I call it personalisation, he adds.Choco mocha walnut brownie de milky ganache, a dessert so divine, turns out to be the perfect finale for our fusion dinner. But this time there is no local tweak. There are some preparations that are too perfect for customisation and this one belongs to that league, says the chef."

However, most of the agreements signed during the previous two editions of the Progressive Punjab investors' summit are yet to see the light of the day.The previous SAD-BJP alliance had organized the first investor summit in 2013 and claimed to have signed agreements worth Rs 67,000 crore. The second edition of the event in 2015, focused on attracting investments in manufacturing, IT agro-processing , healthcare and bio-sciences, and garnered promises of Rs 1.13 lakh crore investment.According to Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion, a total of 519 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) were inked at the two summits of the previous regime. Of these only 22% have materialized so far, several agreements remain only on paper. The first summit witnessed 128 MoUs and of these 62, around 48%, have actually materialized so far. Similarly, at the summit held two years back, of 391 MoUs were inked. Of these, barely 53 or 13%, translated into investment.There was lot of euphoria over the initial interest shown by the big companies to invest in the state. An official of the bureau said that some agreements were in the process of being converted into investment and the final figures would go up. These include 17 projects from the 2013 summit and 64 from the 2015 summit, he said, citing ADLABS amusement park worth Rs 1,200 crore, and Rs 1,400 crore integrated food manufacturing unit as examples.Some of the key projects that have construction work completed include ITC's Rs 680 crore food-cum-logistics center at Kapurthala and Mahindra & Mahindra's Rs 18 crore seed potato project in Mohali. However, there are certain projects that have been put on hold due to various policy issues, including a Rs 50 crore frozen meat project in Mohali, and Rs 80 crore food processing project in Ludhiana.A private university with investment of Rs 350 crore, super speciality hospital for Rs 900 crore, medical university and hospital with estimated cost Rs 1,200 crore, are also in the pipeline listed under the ""Active Conversion Projects"" even though the MoUs were signed after the 2013 summit.The previous government had offered a slew of incentives including cheap power to new investors at Rs 4.90 per unit for five years, VAT retention, exemption from stamp duty, and electricity duty as per the 2013 industrial policy."
5905da7d7be9e04154e03cba,Why Easter is actually a bigger deal than Christmas...,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/hyderabad/why-easter-is-actually-a-bigger-deal-than-christmas/articleshow/58195310.cms,2017-04-16,"During childhood, Christmas is easily everyone's favourite season. And why not, there's Santa Claus and gifts; marshmallows and cookies; reindeers and snowmen. But as one grows older, and wiser, it dawns on every Christian that Easter indeed, is the real deal. These Hyderabadis tell us why:For Christians, Easter is more important than Christmas. While most cultures make a bigger celebration of X'mas, rejoicing the birth of Jesus, Easter is more significant because it celebrates the Resurrection of Christ, which led to the birth of Christian faith. It is Easter that gives Christmas it's true meaning and therefore, it calls for a bigger celebration.As children, we looked forward to going to our grandparents' house for breakfast in the morning. And lunch was always at the residence of our other set of grandparents. Ours is a multi-cultural family, so our feast is a potpourri of multiple cultures. For breakfast we haveappam, stew and a lot of sausages along with bacon, ham and stuff like that. Appam and stew is everyone's favourite.The lunch is typically a Hyderabadi fare with korma and biryani. For dinner at our home, we prefer to keep it light, with garlic bread, chicken roast, pie, macaroni and cheese. Salad is a must, keeping in mind the season. And that's how we end our day. I make a lot of special Easter eggs and cake. I make two-three varieties of cake like cream cheese cake, carrot cake and a special date and walnut cake which is my kids' favourite. Melanie Gabriel , home bakerAs children, you learn that Lent is a solemn time. While the adults in the family didn't touch meat or alcohol for 40 days, the children too abstain (from meat) on Wednesdays and Fridays. So Lent was never a fun time for us; we waited very eagerly for it to end. But with time, I understood the importance of Easter  it is the time to reflect and help those in need and resolve to change for the better.As for the celebrations, they begin early Sunday morning. My children are still young enough to believe in the Easter Bunny and jump out of their bed looking for their basket of eggs and candy. It's like Santa Claus all over again!Easter Sunday itself is time for family and very close friends. We head to the morning mass that symbolises the end of period of mourning and the beginning of celebration of the resurrection of Christ. Lunch and dinner are an intimate close knit affair. Early evening is party time for the children as they invite their friends over for an easter egg hunt and egg decorating that goes on for a couple of hours. By the end of it all, you feel a sense of peace and satisfaction and look forward to seeing through the resolutions made during Lent. For me, Easter is the Christian New Year. Sabina Xavier , socialiteThe very foundation of Christianity revolves around the Holy Week (which starts from the Sunday preceeding Easter). Unlike Christmas, which has become more about gifting than the humble beginnings of Christ, Easter still retains the very essence of the faith. After the 40-day period of Lent, which includes abstinence  from meat, alcohol, smoking  and days of fasting and prayer, Easter is celebrated with a feast. At our household, the day begins with a breakfast spread of eggs sunnyside up, sausages, and potato mash. But the feast takes on a new avatar during dinner with korma roast, spuds, coleslaw and trifle pudding.As a child, I remember Easter being all about Easter Bunnies and Easter Eggs. We used to make our own little eggs with egg shells and paint on small faces like that of Humpty Dumpty. I think children do those kind of things now. Jack Jigg , biker, DJEaster for me has always meant spending time with family. The first thing we do is attend the sunrise service and then come home to eat delicious food cooked by mum and grandma. We make all kind of dishes  kheema and roti for breakfast followed by chicken biryani for lunch. That is followed by beef salad and cutlets for dinner.And of course, there are Easter eggs! My best childhood memory of Easter was when I would stay awake the night before for the Easter eggs to arrive so that I can eat them secretly without anyone knowing about it (laughs).

However, potatoes are far from fattening. Heres busting some myths about potatoes:Myth: Potatoes contain only carbohydratesMedium baked potato is an excellent source of potassium, vitamin C, and vitamin B6; plus, its a good source of fiber, folate, and the essential minerals phosphorus and magnesium. Add to that the 4 grams of protein and you will get super powerful nutrition.Myth: potatoes will make you FATThe truth is that there is no scientific evidence to suggest that potatoes will make you fat.Myth: Potatoes are high in carbohydrates and will spike your blood glucose.Carbohydrates are a fuel for your all tissues in your body.Your brain runs off of glucose for 99.99% of your life.Carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in your muscles for use during exercise.Carbohydrates are stored as glycogen in your liver, to provide your brain with a drip-feed of glucose 24 hours a day.Myth: Potatoes are low in micro nutrientsPotatoes have a large vitamin and mineral content. They contain vitamins A, C and E, and these vitamins protect against ageing, aid in skin repair, maintain optimal liver health, and flood your blood with essential antioxidant compounds.Antioxidants are potent chemicals in plants that help control oxidative damage (hence anti-oxidants) in the body. They also help regulate your immune system, protect you against viruses and reduce inflammation in tissues all throughout your body."

5922c2f47be9e01fe6dfa723,Blowing hot and cold over spy saga,http://www.newindianexpress.com/opinions/2017/apr/17/blowing-hot-and-cold-over-spy-saga-1594264.html,2017-04-17,"The pot of simmering tension between India and Pakistan has been stirred to another spasmodic boiling point with the death sentence of Kulbhushan Jadhav, an alleged Indian spy on the payroll of Indias prime intelligence agency, the RAW.Jadhav, said to be an in-service Indian Naval officer on loan to RAW, was handed down the capital punishment by a military court in Rawalpindi on April 10. The charge sheet against him alleged he was running an extensive spy network in Pakistans strife-torn Balochistan provincewith hundreds of locally-recruited agentsfrom his sanctuary in neighbouring Iran. Hed been nabbed in Balochistan last year. His trial lasted for more than three months.Briefing the Senate in Islamabad on April 11, Pakistani Defence Minister Khwaja Asif said Jadhav was working against Pakistans integrity by promoting terror and by spying for India. He defended Jadhavs trial and conviction by being charitable at the same time. Under Pakistans Military Act of 1952, Jadhav has 40 days to appeal to a higher military court and has also the right to move a higher civilian court if his sentence is maintained. A mercy appeal to the president of Pakistan for clemency will be a last resort for him.Understandably, the harsh penalty to Jadhav has touched a raw nerve in India. Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj, decrying it as pre-meditated murder, warned Pakistan to beware of its fallout on Indo-Pakistan relations. She also assured an irate Lok Sabha that India will go out of its way to ensure Jadhav's return. Of course she didnt elaborate what that out-of-the-way would be.Not surprisingly, Jadhavs sentencing is being hailed in Pakistan as convincing evidence that a BJP-controlled India, swayed by its Hindutva ideology that professes hate against Muslims, has been pursuing a conspiracy to unhinge and destabilise Pakistan. The nerves in Pakistan have been badly rattled by the BJPs victory in the recent UP elections.The complete eclipse of Muslim influence in what has traditionally been seen as the cradle of a millennium-old Indo-Gangetic culture has rubbed the Pakistaniswith many still having families in UPthe wrong way. The Jadhav saga has only fuelled their abhorrence of Hindutvas exclusivist agenda. But theres certainly much more to this cloak-and-dagger saga of an Indian spy caught red-handed as per the charge against him.Giving a macabre twist to the unfolding drama of two countries with a hot potato on their hands is the disappearance of a retired colonel of the Pakistan army from Nepal, close to the border with India.The strange story of this ex-serviceman strains credibility and sounds too apocryphal to be true. He was called for a job interview to Nepal by an Englishman with a presence in that country. The phone number used turned out to be computer generated from India. The man hasnt been heard from since April 9, from his last location near the India-Nepal land border.But the bizarre twist has many takers in Pakistan. Conventional wisdom on the grisly episode is already hooked on the belief that the RAW has engineered this drama, enticed the Pakistani ex-soldier to walk into their trap and abducted him. The bets are on that there would, eventually, be a trade-off between the two countries.Pundits are already refusing to hedge their bets on their prognosis that Jadhav will not be hanged. A spy swap will be an ideal scenario to bring down the curtain on all the commotion-filled drama. It will be a solution with a lot of necessary face-saving for both countries. And face-saving will have to be an essential and unavoidable part of any rancour-free settlement.Once again, the dyarchy of the Pakistani establishment hasnt failed to manifest its role in this spy saga, too.The GHQ-inspired gung-ho chauvinism is looking for a lot of fodder in it to feed its nationalistic pride. It isnt jingoism, exactly, but something bordering on it. Sushmas tough talk hasnt gone unnoticed and invited a quick and robust backlash from those not prepared to ever remove their blinkers. They arent mincing their words on paying back India in its own coin if New Delhi follows through on its warning of a dire fallout from the saga.But Nawaz Sharif seems still unswayed and unscathed by the wave of swashbuckling riposte to India in the face of Sushmas harsh words. Addressing the passing-out parade of officers at the Air Force Academy on April 12, Nawaz still seemed poised to extend an olive branch to India. Without ever mentioning the Jadhav episode, he said Pakistan believed in being on good terms with all its neighbours.The Jadhav episode, since his arrest last year has, in fact, been wielded by Nawazs political opponents as a whip to lash him with publicly. Nawaz has been accused of being pusillanimous, vis-a-vis a jingoistic India. His opponents accused him, for instance, of getting cold feet in his address to the UN General Assembly last September, and not making a pointed reference to Indias blatant meddling in Pakistan and its alleged sponsorship of terrorism.So Nawaz is apparently treading a very fine line, not only in the context of this spy saga, but in relation to the totality of Pakistans strained relationship with India. He must always keep an eye on how a robust parochialism, whipped on the theme of a confrontationist India, is distancing his softer approach from the popular wave. Nawaz is obviously on thin ice. But to his abiding dismay, if not alarm, his stance is getting no help from an India itself consumed by Hindutva fanaticism.Someone has got to throw him a lifeline.The author is a former Pakistani diplomat.Email: K_K_ghori@yahoo.com"

All four have been under siege for years, their fate linked through a series of reciprocal agreements that the UN says have hindered aid deliveries.Rami Abdurrahman, who heads the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, and Hezbollahs Al-Manar TV, earlier said that 3,000 people will be evacuated from Foua and Kfarya, while 200, the vast majority of them fighters, will be evacuated from Zabadani and Madaya.Abdurrahman and opposition activist Hussam Mahmoud, who is from Madaya, said the evacuation has been delayed. Abdurrahman said no permission was given for the evacuation to go ahead while Mahmoud said it has been delayed for logistical reasons.It was not immediately clear if the evacuees feared attacks similar to Saturdays bombing. Abdurrahman said Saturdays blast which hit an area where thousands of pro-government evacuees had been waiting for hours  killed 126. He said the dead included 109 people from Foua and Kfarya, among them 80 children and 13 women.No one has claimed the attack, but both the Islamic State group and the al-Qaida-affiliated Fatah al-Sham Front have targeted civilians in government areas in the past. A wounded girl, who said she lost her four siblings in the blast, told Al-Manar TV from her hospital bed that children who had been deprived of food for years in the two villages were approached by a man in the car who told them to come and eat potato chips. She said once many had gathered, there was an explosion that tore some of the children to pieces.Anthony Lake, UNICEFs executive director, said in a statement Sunday that after six years of war and carnage in Syria there comes a new horror that must break the heart of anyone who has one. We must draw from this not only anger, but renewed determination to reach all the innocent children throughout Syria with help and comfort, he said.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App now"

The vada pav is the answer to a riddle from the last century: What filling snack can you offer a mill worker with just a few annas and no time to sit and eat?Even before the vada pav, its ingredients  chilli, garlic and potato  were already favourites, says food historian Kurush Dalal. What the stalls of the 1960s did, was take the migrant workers average meal and package it to go. And that just worked. It soon became a hit with students or whoever had little money to spend, but wanted a good snack. It is only later that it has become an identity of Mumbai itself. Now, everyone who comes to Mumbai tries the vada pav, he says.Today, you cant turn a corner without running into fresh, hot vadas served with garlic powder, teekha-meetha chutneys (imli and green chilli), and fried chillies on the side.You already want one, dont you? Chances are youve had at least one in the past month. And it may not have been at a pavement stall either.You can now order Mumbais favourite snack at trendy cafs and casual fine-dining restaurants in the city. Sometimes itll come to you in the form of a slider; other times, its deconstructed.Its a fairly well-travelled little fellow too. You can now get a vada pav in London, New York or Sydney  granted, you will have to ask for the Bombay burger when you order.Its been a symbol, snack and political icon. At each stage of the citys transformation, it has acted as a mirror  going corporate at the turn of the century, saffron in the oughts, and taking to casual fine-dining in the early parts of this decade.Its a migrant too!Interestingly, the vada pavs core ingredients arent really local. The pav is a legacy of the Portuguese; the potato and groundnut came to us from the Americas, also via the Portuguese. The garlic is localand the chickpea batter.Like any good Mumbaiite, the snack is supremely adaptable. Its many things to many people, often at the same time.In 2008, for instance, it became a political statement when the Shiv Sena launched more than 100 Shiv Vada Pav stalls across the city. As Sena legislator Anil Parab puts it, It is a part of Mumbais culture. Several people who had vada pav stalls were Shiv Sena supporters already, so the party felt it would do well for the business and the city to turn it into a brand.These stalls werent the snacks political debut either. Theres a theory that the vada pav has its very roots in the Senas battle to establish a Marathi identity as the basis of Mumbais melting-pot culture.In the 1960s, some Shiv Sena protest signs read Idli dosa bhagao [Stop idli and dosa], referencing the two iconic snack foods of Tamil Nadu, as Sainiks attacked South Indian Udipi restaurants because the party founder, Bal Thackeray, accused south Indians of taking jobs that rightly belonged to the Marathi manoos, says Harris Solomon, a professor of cultural anthropology at Americas Duke University, in a paper titled The Taste No Chef Can Give: Processing Street Food in Mumbai, published in 2015.It was then, as a counter to the increasingly popular idlis and dosas and as a way to promote entrepreneurship, that the party first encouraged Maharashtrians to start their own vada pav stalls.It was about encouraging the Marathi people to turn entrepreneurs instead of hunting for jobs, says Parab.#MumbaiMeriHai What does Mumbai mean to you?

The rest of the mill workers would pass their former colleagues on the streets selling vada pav, and buy from them, Solomon writes.Then came the post-liberalisation boom. In 2001, Dheeraj Gupta launched Jumbo King Vada Pav, with its first outlet outside Malad railway station.This was followed by trendy kiosk-style outlets with names such as Goli Vada Pav (2004) and Wow Vada Pav (2012).With their shiny clean interiors, quirky combinations and customisable toppings, they soon became popular.All three now have scores of outlets across the country  from Jharkhand to Uttarakhand and Hyderabad to Delhi.Somewhere in Ranchi, then, there is someone eating what started out as a mill workers snack, now available in local flavours  with chhole, for instance, or achari-flavoured.We think of the vada as the ultimate finger food, says Gupta. And weve expanded our menu options accordingly, through the years.That same spirit of experimentation is visible in the khau gallis of Vile Parle, Churchgate and the CST area, where the snack is getting a new avatar all the time.In these parts, you can get a Schezwan vada pav made with Chindian spices; one with dollops of cheese coating the patty; or even a paneer vada pav, in which paneer replaces the potato.Dont expect any of this at the original home of the vada pav, around Dadar railway station.The railways were a lifeline for the mill workers, so it was logical for the earliest stalls to be here, says food historian Kurush Dalal.There is still a stall here that has been around since 1967. I inherited it from my father, Ashok Vaidya, says co-owner Narendra Vaidya. Our stall has a few loyalists, who have been coming here for decades. But, we keep getting new customers.

Street food, which was once for the poor, has now become emblematic of a culture and entered the restaurants. As it travelled indoors from the streets, there has been a transition of the snack too.So you now get the vada in a bao, as a salad, or made with chicken!But these, loyalists like to say, are fads.After all, the mills are gone and soaring glass-and-steel office buildings have taken their place, but the snack of the mill labourer still thrives, in exactly the same form.It must now compete with meals in a box, dosa stalls, street Chinese and packaged snacks. It still wins. Unlike the meal in a box, its cheap. Unlike bhel and chaat, its filling. The packaged snacks arent piping hot. And you cant eat a dosa on the go. As Gresham Fernandes, head chef at Impresario, puts it, When in Mumbai, I still like to have my vada pav on the street.If anything, it feels odd to sit down at a faux Irani caf and order a platter of your favourite street food.

5923077f7be9e01fc00712f2,Wholesale inflation decelerates to 5.7%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-business/wholesale-inflation-decelerates-to-57/article18089491.ece,2017-04-18,"A decline in the prices of fuel and manufactured products helped inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI), to moderate to 5.7% (provisional) for March 2017 despite hardening of food prices, data released by the government on Monday showed.The WPI inflation had touched a 39-month high of 6.55% (provisional) in February while it was -0.45% in March 2016.Compared to last month (February), WPI Inflation declined by 85 basis points (bps) to 5.70% in March17 due to sharp decrease in prices of items like potato (-17.07%), onion (-10.78%), non-food articles (4.91%), oil seeds (-0.9%), said Soumya Kanti Ghosh, chief economic advisor, Economic Research Department, SBI.Earlier, the largest decline in month-on-month inflation was in August 15, Mr. Ghosh added. The decline was accentuated by decline in fuel and power inflation and manufactured products.... Fuel prices were significantly cut on March 31 while rupee has been on an appreciating trend since February 2017.These two factors have pushed down fuel and manufactured product prices, he said.Primary food inflation trended higher as vegetable inflation emerged after six months of deflation although food price pressures are not yet a concern, as prices of cereals, pulses and spices have fallen sequentially in the last two to three months, said an analysis by Nomura.Fuel price inflation moderated on favourable base effects and a fall in most market-linked fuels. Furthermore, manufactured inflation moderated sharply to 3% in March from 3.7% in February as prices for manufactured food, non-metallic minerals and machine tools declined sequentially while other categories experienced muted increases, it said.Food inflation has increased a bit and this would require greater monitoring in light of the evolving weather conditions, said Pankaj Patel, president of the industry body FICCI.The government is keeping a close tab on the progress made on irrigation projects, cold chain projects etc. and improvement in these areas is likely to yield positive results.The focus on drip irrigation and micro-irrigation along with improvement in the efficiency of cropping patterns and water use mechanisms will strengthen agri-production and productivity, he said. Commodity prices  crude as well as metal prices  had been edging up putting pressure on wholesale prices over the past few months. However, the WPI based inflation announced today shows a decline from the previous month and this can be attributed to softening of inflation in fuel and power and manufactured goods segments. Further, the recent strengthening of rupee vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar will also contribute towards limiting imported inflation, he said.Output pricesThe analysis done by Nomura research analysts Sonal Varma and Neha Saraf said: Despite the surge in input cost inflation since January, firms have been reluctant to raise output prices, likely reflecting uncertainty over the demand outlook after demonetisation.As demand recovers, we expect firms to start passing on past input cost increases to consumers and the sharp drop in perishable food inflation to reverse. Yet, we believe February marked the peak in year-on-year WPI inflation and it should gradually taper off over 2017 on base effects, they added.Considering the higher-than-expected WPI inflation in Q1, we are raising our 2017 forecast to 4.7% (from 4%) they said."

He retained former chief minister Akhilesh Yadavs set-up, but warned officers against laxity.He effected his first major administrative reshuffle on April 12, three weeks after taking charge, and shunted 20 senior IAS officers, putting eight of them on the waitlist. He transferred 44 IAS officers on Tuesday, the eve of his one-month completion in office.A list of his key decisions and directives:1) ASSET DECLARATION: An hour after he took oath on March 19, Adityanath ordered all ministers to declare their income, movable and immovable properties within 15 days. He asked them to submit declarations to the CM secretariat.He also made them take an oath of cleanliness and honesty. He made it clear that his government will have zero tolerance on corruption and law and order. Though not all ministers and officers have come forward to declare their assets, Adityanath is unrelenting and has demanded adherence to the new deadline.2) CLEANLINESS: Adityanath administered an oath of cleanliness and honesty to his ministers. He has fixed Friday as the day when the state staff must tidy up workspaces. He asked them to devote two hours per week to cleanliness. He also asked them to read the BJPs 2017 poll manifesto and mull over how to implement them in their respective departments, besides making budgetary provisions for it.3) PAAN BAN: On the second day as CM, Yogi ordered a ban on paan masala and gutkha consumption in government offices, hospitals and schools.4) MEAT CRACKDOWN: He ordered a crackdown on illegal slaughterhouses, meat shops and cow smuggling. Some meat shops were burnt, and traders went on strike, drying up supply. The government has clarified that only illegal abattoirs were targeted.5) ANTI-ROMEO SQUADS: The CM also asked for setting up of anti-Romeo squads across the state to check harassment of women. When the anti-Romeo action created an outrage with the way police responded, Adityanath on March 25 ordered framing of guidelines and said the police should not be inhuman while implementing it.Polices anti-Romeo squad questions a couple in Jhansi on March 22. (HT FILE PHOTO)6) SETTING THE AGENDA WITH MODI: On March 21, Adityanath went to Delhi to meet Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss distribution of portfolios to his ministers. He also informed the PM that MPs were lobbying for transfers, postings of officers. Modi, on March 23, ordered all MPs not to interfere in transfers and postings.7) CLOSING POTHOLES: On March 25, Adityanath set a deadline of June 15 for making all UP roads pothole-free.8) METRO IN GORAKHPUR: The new CM has also announced Metro train projects for Gorakhpur (his Lok Sabha constituency) and Jhansi.9) CRACKDOWN ON LAXITY: During a visit to Gorakhpur, Adityanath said those officers who cannot work 18-20 hours were free to leave. He also said that the state will promote regional dialects. The state government staff began sticking to 9am-6pm duty hours in office following surprise inspections by various ministers.10) FARM LOAN WAIVER: At its first meeting on April 4, the state cabinet waived farm loans up to Rs 1 lakh each of small and marginal farmers. This waiver was among the top promises in the BJP manifesto.The decision is projected to cost the state exchequer more than Rs 36,000 crore and benefit approximately 2.15 crore small and marginal farmers across the state.The cabinet also approved the construction of a sports stadium in Ghazipur in eastern Uttar Pradesh. The region has been Adityanaths area of political influence. He is a five-time MP from Gorakhpur since 1998.11) WHEAT AND POTATO PROCUREMENT: The government announced setting up of 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the state and projected that it will buy 80 lakh metric tonnes from farmers. It also announced it will buy potato at Rs 487 per quintal from farmers.12) INDUSTRIAL POLICY: The government has announced that it will form a new industrial policy soon.13) POWER SUPPLY: Last week, the Adityanath government also signed an agreement with the Centre assuring 24-hour power supply to the district headquarters, 20-hour supply at tehsil level and in Bundelkhand region, and 18 hours in rural areas.

Potato output would be around 47 million tonnes this year,"" National Horticulture Board (NHB) Managing Director A K Singh told .Initially, NHB had projected 43.88 million tonnes output for this year. But this will be revised after assessing the arrival, he said.Singh further said that total area under potato was more or less at last year's level. But, good weather conditions coupled with recent unseasonal rains just before the harvest gave boost to the crop prospect and improved yields, he said.The crop condition in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar -- the top three potato producing states -- is in very good condition.As per the state data, the output in Uttar Pradesh -- the country's top potato producing state -- is projected to be higher at 15 million tonnes this year as against 13.8 million tonnes last year, he added.So much potato is grown in UP that the centre has started procurement operation to ensure farmers avoid distressed sale.The output in West Bengal and Bihar is also expected to be better than last year. In 2015-16, the output stood at 8 million tonnes and 6 million tonnes, respectively, in these two states. LUX BAL"

Prices are generally lower in western UP than in eastern parts of the state.In 2016-17, the state produced a record 155-160 lakh metric tonnes of potato. Adityanath has also reached out to the Narendra Modi government for help, asking Union agriculture minister Radha Mohan Singh to impress upon other states to procure potato from UP and immediately call a meeting of state agriculture ministers in this regard. The UP chief minister also wants potato crop from the state to get prominence for procurement in the Centre's e-National Agricultural Mart.This comes after a top-level committee set up by Adityanath last week submitted a report. As per the report, potato prices in 19 key markets of UP as on April 10 vary widely between Rs 290 per quintal in Farukkhabad and Rs 690 in Lucknow.In nine mandis including seven in western UP in Agra, Saharanpur, Moradabad and Meerut, the wholesale price is less than Rs 400 while it is above Rs 500 in six other mandis including ones in eastern UP in Varanasi, Gorakhpur and Gonda.""If an arrangement is made to transport potato produce from low-price mandis to the highprice ones, then farmers can get a proper price. District collectors of these districts should coordinate, publicise the mandi prices in newspapers daily and inspire farmers to shift their produce from the low-price offering mandis to the high-price ones,"" the UP government said in an order issued on April 18."
5922c9be7be9e01fc006ec82,For an aah experience!,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/for-an-aah-experience/article18187867.ece,2017-04-22,"So whats new, I am often asked by friends. They are, of course, talking about food. I always tell them that there are places that are not new  in fact, some are as old as the hills  but they are still new to us.But since the question pops up every now and then, I made my way to Sham Sweets at Bud Shah Bullah the other day to find out more about these old, but still unknown little places in Old Delhi.Tell me, I asked my friend there, where do I go for samosas in Old Delhi. The owner, Sanjay Aggarwal, thought for a bit, and then urged me try out a small samosa shop in Galli Anaar. They fry samosas with a filling of bhindi, or okra, he said, and my mouth started watering at once.He gave me the directions, and I hopped on to a passing rickshaw. Its easier to reach Galli Anaar from the Chandni Chowk side of Old Delhi. From Chandni Chowk, get into Dariba Kalan. Then turn right into Kinari Bazaar. After some 20 shops or so, you will pass Hazari Lal Jains khurchan shop on your left. Turn left immediately after that into an old and narrow lane. Keep moving on that galli till you spot Jain Saabs shop on your left. Keep an eye for it, because its a nondescript little place thats easy to miss.The shop, I was told, has been there from 1944. Though locally known as Jain Saab kachoriwaley, the formal name is Jai Tara, or Badri Prasad Tara Chand Jains shop. The address is 2283 Dharampura, Dariba, and the phone numbers are 011-23260425 and 9811008716.Jain Saab is no more. The shop is run by one of his younger sons. I asked for my bhindi samosas. The two assistants there were taken aback, because that was the first they were hearing of it. They didnt make bhindi samosas, I was informed. And being Jains, they didnt do potato samosas either. They used to earlier fry samosas filled with green bananas, but there were not too many takers for those. So these days, their samosas were filled with a mash of peas and spices.That sounded good, too, but unfortunately it wasnt my day for samosas. They prepared their samosas only in the evenings, they said. The daytime was for kachoris.At the back I could see a big kadhai filled with bubbling oil, and a new batch of kachoris being fried. The smell was heady, and the kachoris looked delicious. So I asked for a khasta kachori and had a wonderful early lunch.Crispy and lightThe kachori was truly crisp, and had been fried so well that there was no trace of oil on it. Of course, it is deep fried, so a kachori is by definition heavy in oil. But a good kachori stands out when it is not dripping in oil. And this one stood out.Second, the filling of a dal paste was excellent  with just the right spices and seasoning. Third, it came with some yummy methi (fenugreek) chutney and chholey. There was a time when the kachoris were only served with the chutney, but market demands prompted the owners to give a helping of chholey on the side. The chutney is also good for those with diabetes, one of the assistants helpfully added.Kachoris and samosas are for Rs. 15 a piece. They also sell sweets, but have a limited menu. On it are gulab jamuns, balushahi , besan and atta laddoo, gujiya and ghewar during the rains. Among the savouries they have khasta mathri and kurkurey. And, of course, they prepare samosas every afternoon and kachoris in the mornings.Though I had been salivating over the image of a samosa filled with fried, spicy okra, I wasnt unhappy with the kachori at all. The outside was crunchy and the stuffing was soft. I broke off a piece of the kachori, scooped out some chholey with it, and then topped it with the chutney. I can describe the experience in one word  Aah!I must remember to thank Sanjay of Sham Sweets. For now, I have an answer to that question, So whats new."

He has done a wide-ranging research on potato and the diseases affecting it.He said Uttar Pradesh was the biggest producer of potatoes in the country amounting, to 29-35% of the total national production.Ground reports said 2016-17 saw potato cultivation in an area of 6.14 lakh hectare across the state with an expected production of 155 to 160 lakh metric ton.With the BJP having made huge promises to farmers during assembly polls, handling of the potato harvest will be the first true test of the Yogi government, especially in light of UP being the largest producer of potatoes in the country where lakhs of farmers cultivate this cash crop. Last year, thousands of potato farmers were forced to dump their crop, leaving it to rot owing to very poor price being offered for their produce in the market.To ensure that all promises are kept, the state government, based on recommendations of an expert committee, has come up with a market intervention strategy to handle the potato harvest in the state.Based on it, the principal secretary (horticulture) Sudhir Garg has shared that a scrutiny of the 19 bulk markets or mandis of the state has shown that on April 10, 2017, the bulk price of potatoes varied between Rs 290 and Rs 690 per quintal.Garg has communicated this information through a government order sent to director (horticulture and food processing department).Potato sold at Rs 290 per quintal, the lowest in the state, in Farrukhabad and at Rs 680 per quintal, the highest, in Lucknow.Further scrutiny of the markets has shown that in districts like Agra, Aligarh, Bareilly, Moradabad, Allahabad, Kanpur, Farrukhabad, Meerut and Saharanpur the bulk price of potato was Rs 400 or less per quintal on April 3, 2017. Its price was Rs 500 or above in districts like Gonda, Faizabad, Gorakhpur, Jhansi, Mirzapur and Varanasi.The order says that the government believes that timely and adequate supply of potato from low-priced markets to high priced ones can help achieve a balance in pricing that benefits both farmers and consumers.The government wants the district magistrates and the district horticulture officers to not just get the potato prices printed in local dailies but also through coordination with their counterparts of other districts facilitate flow of potato from low priced districts to markets in high- priced ones.The state government also plans to send potato to other states with support of their agriculture ministers via respective distribution agencies and marketing federations and tapping the e-NAM or e-national agriculture market.Welcome step but support price too low: ExpertExperts believe that extending support price for potato, which is the most important cash crop of UP, is a welcome step. However, they say the support price of Rs 487 per quintal is too low, especially as a bulk of the potato farmers are small scale cultivators.Out of the states total production, around 75 lakh metric ton is consumed by the people and around 7 lakh metric ton is used for processed food. Another 20 lakh metric ton is used as seed. The surplus is exported to other states and even abroad, including Nepal, said prof Pradeep Bhargava, a noted development economist.Uttar Pradesh has 1708 private and government cold storages at present with storage capacity of 130.26 lakh metric ton, amounting to 81% of the expected produce.The state government has said that till March 31, 2017, 96.49 lakh metric ton of potatoes, 74% of the storage capacity, had already been achieved.When there is a bumper harvest, the governments move will enable farmers to get at least the minimum support price. This is a welcome step. However, the support price should have been much higher so as to ensure a decent minimum earning for small-scale farmers who farm on 1 to 5 bigha land so that it justifies their investments and helps make enough money to promote farming and also support their livelihood, he added.Prof Bhargava says that on the face of it, the fact that cost of production on average is Rs 28,000 per hectare and the return is Rs 84,000 per hectare seems impressive. However, when the farmer is small scale and sells potato at a price of Rs 4.87 per kilogram earning hardly Rs 8,400 per bigha, he ends up with hardly enough to justify his investments and labour of three-four months. A better support price therefore is needed, he added."

Many families lost their valuables, but no one was injured.This was the third major fire accident here in the last six months.The fire broke out around 5.10am, and 18 fire tenders rushed to the spot within 30 minutes. The haphazard placement of the huts made it difficult for the tenders to reach the spot, so the fire brigade decided to use pipe extensions and contain the fire from three different directions. They managed to control the blaze before it could do further damage in the area.Local residents, upon hearing the commotion, rushed outside. Some managed to salvage their valuables, but a majority could not.The fire brigade ran into some resistance from the residents, who were desperate to save their homes. A few youths broke the water pipe on a fire tender and tried to douse the fire in their homes; a few miscreants took advantage of the confusion and made off with the tender's copper nozzles. A few others tried to take the pipes away.Ansarbhai, a local resident, was sleeping in his home with his wife and two children. ""We heard noises like fireworks, and woke up. We ran outside the house, and there was pandemonium outside. I am happy that we all are safe,"" he told TOI.However, Ansarbhai lost all of his earthly possessions. ""I recently, put up new tin sheets on the roof. But now everything is gone,"" he said.Fire brigade officials suspect a malfunction in a potato chip-making unit nearby as the cause of the fire, which was fuelled by the oil stored in the unit. Local residents say the unit was being operated illegally. A detailed report on the incident will be submitted to municipal authorities.All the huts in the locality were built using tin sheets. A few structures were used to store timber or other wooden objects. They were all destroyed in the conflagration.Six months ago, about six timber shops were gutted in a blaze. Three months ago, three shops, a few houses and five four-wheelers were charred in a fire in the same area."

One day, just a few days ago, one part of my memory suddenly went blink-blink, emitting a warm and happy light. I dont know what triggered it, but a picture popped up in my mind of a small, nondescript shop in Old Delhi. And I recalled that it sold the most delicious bedmi sabzi.Theres an old Chinese saying which states that when memory calls, you must respond. So I responded and rushed off to Purani Dilli one sunny day. I took the Metro, got off at Chawri Bazaar, and then started walking towards Bazaar Sitaram, for, as I recalled, the bedmi shop was there.I found it to my left after walking down the lane for a while. It is still small and nondescript and, as I discovered in the next 10 minutes, it still sells the most delicious bedmi sabzi.The name of the shop is Ram Swarup Halwai. The address is 3294, Bazaar Sitaram, near Lal Darwaza. The phone numbers are 9210040054 and 9310804526. It is not a very well-known shop, but the local people know all about it. And, as I saw, quite a few people stop there for a morning meal.The shop, run by brothers Ajit Kumar and Anil Kumar, was set up 80 years ago by their grandfather. There is a small counter which holds a few different kinds of sweets  chamcham, gulab jamun, rasgulla and barfi.But the shop is really known for its bedmi sabzi and nagori halwa. In a kadhai on the side, you can see bedmis being fried. There is a runny and reddish potato sabzi in a large utensil. In a paraat on the counter you will find small nagoris, and in a huge paraat next to it, theres halwa.Let me tell you whats so special about Ram Swarup Halwais fare. One, the food is excellent. The bedmis are small but crisp, and the potato curry is spicy and mildly tart. The brothers carefully put a slit green chilli in the potato sabzi, so that makes it nicely hot. The small nagoris, again, are delightfully crisp. You pierce it with your thumb, stuff it with a good helping of halwa and pop it into your mouth. Life really looks up after that.The nagori is prepared with maida, or flour, mixed with suji, or semolina, which adds to its crispness. The halwa is excellent, and I thought the suji had been really well roasted  which to my mind is the test of a good halwa.I have always believed that nagori halwa is one of the best breakfast meals you can ever have. You can also dunk your nagori in some sabzi and eat it, if you like to alternate between sweet and savoury tastes.The second important point is that prices havent really gone up much at Ram Swarup Halwais little shop. A plate of two bedmis with potato sabzi comes for Rs. 15, while two pieces of nagori with halwa are for Rs. 10. The rate in the bigger shops in Old Delhi is five or six time higher. Of course, the better known bedmi sellers enhance their bedmis with side dishes, such as chholey, fenugreek chutney and pickled vegetables. Ram Swarups fare is simple  but finger licking good.I ate some bedmis and nagori halwa, packed some to be consumed later and made my way home. I gave my memory cells a little pat on their backs and urged them to carry on with the good work. The next time they go blink-blink, I am sure there will be another happy memory to be revisited."

Official data shows three-fold increase in the number of farmers employing micro-irrigation techniques in just a year, underscoring the need for judicious use of available water through alternative systems.In 2015-16, only 300-350 farmers applied for subsidy under the Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchayee Yojana (PMKSY) for micro-irrigation systems. A year on, the number rose sharply to 1,257 in 2016-17. Officials from the Agriculture department link the spurt to the drought that has gripped the State.According to the Tamil Nadu Horticulture Development Agency (TANHODA), subsidy is given for growing horticulture crops like vegetables including potato and onion, and non-horticulture crops such as cereals and pulses, based on the area of cultivation.The cost of devices ranges between Rs 31,000 to a few lakhs depending upon the acreage. Those having up to 5 acres are classified as Small and Marginal farmers and provided full subsidy for installing micro-irrigation systems such as drip or sprinkler units. Large-scale farmers are also included in this scheme, and given 75 per cent subsidy, R Mohankumar, Assistant Director of Agriculture told Express.Selected farmers will be offered a choice of 34 government approved companies to choose their equipment from.Officials, however, point out that a majority of farmers employ micro irrigation techniques, despite the subsidy, only as the last resort.February and March saw maximum enrollment of farmers for subsidy. Drip and sprinkler irrigation systems are thought of only during drought and as a last recourse, an official said.The success stories of farmers who reaped benefits of employing micro irrigation techniques are inspiring scores to adopt the same. Such was the reception that farmers who installed the drip and sprinkler system to irrigate horticulture crops are now extending its usage to non-horticulture crops by making minor modifications, officials added.Speaking to Express, M Peter James, a black gram farmer from Manickapuram village near Manachanallur, said, Prior to installing a sprinkler unit in my 4.5 acres of black gram and ladys finger fields, I had to operate the borewell for nearly 4 hours a day per wetting. With sprinklers in place, the running time of borewells has come down to 1 hour per wetting. Drip irrigation for paddyTiruchy-based Anbil Dharmalingam Agriculture College and Research Institute, in September 2016, cultivated multiple varieties of paddy using drip irrigation on experimental basis at Manikandam where the soil is alkali (less permeable, saline) and ground water saline. It turned out to be a success and harvest was done in January 2017. Paddy varieties such as ADT36 and TRY2 were found to viable for drip irrigation.Maintenance of the system is also very important. Agriculture department officials urge farmers to carry out routine maintenance.In the case of saline water, accumulation of salty substance in drip nozzles have to be regularly cleaned for better results, they say."

With the melting of snow and higher temperature, they had started cultivating cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, peas, potato and many other varieties. Dinesh, a farmer from Shansha village of Lahaul, said that, ""Cabbage and peas have been damaged after snowfall. I shall have to cultivate it again. Farmers have suffered huge losses."" Another farmer Prem from Jahlama village said he had cultivated peas, cauliflower and lilium (flower) on five bighas,which has rotten after the snowfall.According to the meteorological centre, Shimla, the minimum temperate at many places in Himachal was below the normal temperature at this time of the year.

But JD(U) washed its hands off the political hot potato when the partys Rajya Sabha member RCP Singh, considered close to Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, made it clear on Sunday that his party was under no compulsion to defend anybody.JD(U) sources said Nitish Kumar, facing BJPs continual taunts about his silence over the allegations Yadav faces, finally deployed Singh to put forward his partys stand. We (JD-U) are not responsible to speak on this matter (BJP charges against Yadav familys assets). People who face the charges should answer, Singh said.Modi has named three shell companies that came into the total ownership of Yadavs family members in recent years and thus handed them prime land. He has also accused Yadav of having taken prime land and house as gifts for his two sons from two senior RJD leaders - Raghunath Jha and Kanti Singh - in return for making them ministers in the UPA-1 government. RJD leaders have rubbished these charges even as Modi demands a probe by the state government.RCP Singh is no real leader He was a bureaucrat who was brought into politics. They (JD-U) must not make the mistake of thinking that we (RJD) are weak. It is on our votes that they are in power today, said Bhai Birendra, a senior RJD legislator close to the party chief. RJD has the largest number of MLAs in Bihars three-party alliance government. He also said most RJD legislators are unhappy with the government led by Nitish Kumar as JD(U) leaders, he said, were getting officials posted as per their wish.JD(U) reacted sharply with spokesperson Sanjay Singh asking RJD to muzzle leaders like Birendra. If the snake-charmer himself becomes snake, he must be immediately killed, he said, adding that Bihars people handed victory to the JD(U)-RJD-Congress alliance due to the leadership of Nitish Kumar.RJD leaders were also angered by Singhs statement on BJPs charges of Yadav promoting dynasty politics. While RJD leaders have been strongly defending the posts occupied by Yadavs family members, saying they are all duly elected leaders and peoples spontaneous choice, Singh said JD(U) is against dynasty politics. yadavs two sons are ministers in the State government - deputy chief minister Tejaswi Yadav and health minister Tej Pratap Yadav - and his daughter Misa Bharti is a Rajya Sabha member, while the RJD chiefs wife Rabri Devi is an MLC."

However, the Opposition has rejected the argument and accused the government of coming up with absurd theories to hide its failure to meet the requirements of the people and justify the shortage. BJP vice-president Pratap Sarangi said: ""It exposes the lack of sincerity of the state government. How many urban centres are there in Odisha? Mostly the people in rural areas depend on the potatoes, which is an essential vegetable for them. It is never interested to boost potato production and its marketing in the state."" Director horticulture Srikanta Prusty in a letter to the state government cited that the demand for potato has gone up due to change in food habits. ""Due to gradual change in food habit the demand for potato consumption is increasing especially in urban areas for snacks and fast food where potatoes play a significant role in way of value addition in the processing sector,"" said Prusty. Prusty said the state requires 12 lakh MT potatoes per annum to meet its need. ""As it is unable to produce the required potatoes, most of the state's shortfall is met by neighbouring states such as Bengal,"" he said. In 2016-17, potato was cultivated over an area of 25,218 hectares and the production was 3 lakh MT. ""At present, the state produces around 20-25 per cent of its requirement,"" he said. He said the potato mission was a success in the state. Before starting the potato mission, he said, there were 27 functional cold storages in the state with a storage capacity of 1.37 lakh MT. After completion of the mission, the number of cold storages has increased to 35 with a storage capacity of 1.68 lakh MT of potatoes. On the price regulation of potatoes, he said: ""The wholesale market price of potatoes depends on the all-India mandi prices and the real market price is fixed accordingly."" At present, the potato is currently being sold at Rs 12 per kg."

While the court's Wednesday ruling upholding the lower court's decision in the criminal case is final, two civil cases to determine ownership of the land are still winding through the courts.Newmont put plans to build its Conga mine on hold after violent protests broke out in Peru's northern Cajamarca region, one of the country's poorest and its second-largest in gold production. Environmentalists said the mine would poison local water sources and displace people living and farming there.Acuna had said her home was destroyed as part of the mine's construction, and that the family's attempts to rebuild it have been blocked. Newmont's Peruvian unit Minera Yanacocha SRL, in which Peru's Buenaventura SAA is a junior partner, took her to criminal court, saying she had ""usurped"" its land.""I feel happy and relieved that here in the capital [the court] has also provided justice,"" Acuna, who won the Goldman Prize for environmental activism last year, said after the court hearing on Wednesday. ""I only hope not to suffer more abuse from the company.""Speaking to reporters after the court decision, Yanacocha lawyer Christian Schroder said the company considered the disputed lands part of its property. Yanacocha is open to ""dialogue with the family to not continue all these cases underway,"" he said.Yanacocha's namesake mine, also in Cajamarca, has historically been the country's largest, but production has fallen in recent years. Conga has been expected to offset dwindling output at the aging Yanacocha, and Buenaventura told Reuters earlier this year it was studying a long-term business plan with Newmont that could include Conga. In a statement, Yanacocha said it would respect the Supreme Court decision and would ""continue defending the company's rights"" through the pending civil court cases.

Picture by Animesh Sengupta N-Road in elite Bistupur is paradoxically Jamshedpur's dark underbelly, where hooch is sold and gambling is routine a stone's throw from the local police station. That this half-a-kilometre stretch is a den of illegal activities came to the fore after a 28-year-old bank intern was found murdered in an under-construction building along the road last week. Preliminary investigations have revealed that Ankush Thakurta, a native of Rourkela, Odisha, was killed over a drunken brawl with employees of a beer bar, which was open beyond designated hours. Also, the beer bar in question is allegedly an umbrella for several unauthorised hooch outlets in the vicinity, according to local vendors. ""People who come to buy vegetables here think N-Road is the safest stretch of Bistupur, with a thana within a kilometre and routine patrolling. Very few know what goes on here after sundown. Hookah bars mushroom to offer ganja (marijuana) and matka (organised gambling with links to cities like Calcutta, Mumbai and Nagpur) is run openly. Roadside eateries sell hooch; sometimes even foreign liquor at a premium. Licensed hotels help them for a cut,"" said a potato vendor, not willing to be named. Don't the police know? ""Of course, they do. It happens right under their nose. In fact, local fruit vendors had complained against gamblers and tipplers who create nuisance, but police do nothing,"" another vegetable seller on N-Road told this correspondent on the condition of anonymity. Sources said matka is played using special cards through a local agent who has links with the main operator in Mumbai or Calcutta. The minimum investment is Rs 100. There are two forms of the game - one that draws a profit of nine times and another promises a big bonanza of 100 times of the invested amount. Assistant excise commissioner, East Singhbhum, Manoj Kumar conceded that several eateries along a 200-metre stretch of N-Road served liquor despite not being authorised to do so. ""Following a tip-off, we had conducted raids in February. The owner of one such eatery, Shakti Hotel, was caught red-handed and sent to jail. It is difficult to say if the grey market for booze continues to boom on N-Road,"" Kumar said, but expressed his ignorance about ganja dens in the area. ""We shall, however, keep tabs and bust gangs involved in illegal activities."" DSP (crime control) Sudhir Kumar did not respond to calls.

Whats more, the Agriculture Department will bear half the cost as subsidy, making the compost available at throwaway prices.Though the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) set up six waste processing plants two years ago, it has failed to market the compost generated there. Today, the plants have a stock of more than 30,000 tonnes of compost of various grades. Officials said this is taking up all the available space and has rendered the plants non-operational, leaving the BBMP with no choice but to launch a special drive to sell the compost.The civic body has already delivered 1,542 tonnes of fine compost (less than 4 mm) to farmers in Chickballapur, Tumakuru and Kanakapura in the past week. While it has set the price at Rs. 1,600 a tonne, farmers need to pay only Rs. 800 as the Agriculture Department will bear the remaining amount. Taking the transportation cost into account, farmers get the compost at an effective price of Rs. 300 a tonne, said N. Manjunath Prasad, Commissioner of BBMP.C.N. Chandru, a farmer from Chickballapur who grows capsicum and potato on 20 acres, has bought 60 tonnes of compost. Delivering it to the farm is a good initiative. The quality is very good, he said.B.Y. Srinivas, director of the Department of Agriculture, said the response has been overwhelming; in the open market, a tonne of compost would cost more than Rs. 3,000 a tonne.Different sizesApart from the fine-grade compost, the BBMP has over 12,000 tonnes of compost of medium lumps (16-35 mm) and over 10,000 tonnes of larger lumps (above 35 mm). Agriculture Minister Krishna Byre Gowda recently visited some of the plants and cleared sale of the remaining compost, said officials. However, they are yet to work out the modalities.Leading organic farmer L. Narayana Reddy said even the compost lumps can be used for agriculture as they act as good manure. Lumps have to be broken into finer particles before use, as they will not disintegrate easily in the soil. It would be better if the civic body breaks the lumps before offering them to farmers, he said. He also said farmers need to be educated on avoiding excess usage. I would recommend that farmers not use more than three tonnes for an acre, he said."

Thirtysix-year-old Ayaskant Badpanda of Dangarpada village under Jujumura block of the district has turned 50 acres of agriculture land into a profitable integrated-farming model for others to emulate.Ayaskant grows paddy, vegetables and fruits besides undertaking poultry farming and pisciculture. This season, he has cultivated vegetables like potala (pointed gourd) in two acres, potato in three acres and chilly in half an acre of land.He has also planted watermelons in five acres and banana in half an acre.While Ayaskant owns five acres of land, he has taken the remaining 45 acres on lease from fellow villagers. Only during kharif season, he grows paddy in the entire 50 acres as the village depends on monsoon for paddy cultivation.A Matriculate, Ayaskant said he earns around `7,000 per acre from paddy cultivation in the land owned by him while he gets about `3,000 per acre from the land taken on lease during kharif season. Apart from paddy, vegetables and fruits, he generates around `1.2 lakh annually from poultry farming and about `50,000 annually from pisciculture in the tank spread over one acre. Altogether, his annual income from farming comes to about `7 lakh.Ayaskant was attracted towards farming at the age of 16 years and learnt the nuances from his father Nirakar Badpanda.He said his father was cultivating paddy in five acres besides potala and watermelon in half-an-acre each. However, he started farming independently in 2001 with cultivation of paddy in five acres besides potala and watermelon in one acre each. At present, he has engaged 20 labourers who work in his farm land throughout the year.He draws water from lift irrigation project set up on the banks of Bhutel nullah passing through the village besides a deep borewell for cultivation of vegetables and fruits. He had procured a tractor, a power tiller and dug up the borewell with support from National Horticulture Mission.Selling the farm produce has never been a problem for Ayaskant. His fresh vegetables and fruits are much in demand among people and traders, who often come to his village to procure his produce. He also sells vegetables and fruits at Golebazaar, the main vegetable market in Sambalpur, situated at a distance of about 25 km from the village."
5922ec357be9e01fc7f5bc91,The man who launched a thousand Darshinis,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/the-man-who-launched-a-thousand-darshinis/articleshow/58557709.cms,2017-05-07,"Coffee or kokum sherbet? Rava or ragi dosa? Even as newbies wonder what to order at Upahara Darshini (UD) in Jayanagar, Manasa Harish buys tokens for her staple - masala dosa, picks up her plate and settles with it and a glass of water at the small stainless steel table. She sniffs at the ragi dosa eater who is picking at her food and quickly finishes her crisp dosa filled with a mildly spiced potato masala. ""Every time I come to the maternity hospital nearby for consultation, I eat masala dosa here,"" smiles Harish.Eating at a Darshini is an exercise in minimalism. There is no time or lengthy menu to plot the next culinary adventure. Once you give the order, you should be prepared to hop from one counter to the other in quick succession, and eat your food standing while sharing the table with office-goers, offduty security guards and moms with cranky school children in tow.So it is better to stick to tried and tested food as the kitchen at UD churns out dosas and thatte idlis in full view of its diners.This is how Prabhakar R envisioned the ideal Indian fast food restaurant when he started the first Darshini in 1983 where now UD stands. ""Darshini means to see and select food (from a menu) as in a KFC or McDonald's,"" says Prabhakar. In this case, one gets to order south Indian staples at pocketfriendly prices just like he saw during a trip abroad. ""Simple and fast. That's what we needed to beat MNC restaurants and high food prices,"" says Prabhakar, sitting at his Banashankari residence.Today, three decades later, Baba Ramdev wants to start a chain of Indian QSRs or quick service restaurants to gain nationalist mileage and profits while beating 'foreign competition'. Prabhakar, who calls himself a consumer activist and a consult ant, says the more the merrier.""Maybe, Ramdev will be able to do it na tionally,"" he says.Prabhakar is underplaying the impact his Darshinis have had on the eating-out culture. The city has hundreds of Darshinis, most of them mentored for free by the 64-year-old. The model is so popular that the city cor poration has been issuing trade licenses for ""Darshini type hotel"" since the mid-2000s.At the heart of a successful Darshini eatery is pricing. And that is achieved by scaling up operations while keeping things sim ple. ""Earlier, people used to put money on fancy interiors and charge food at three times its price.There was no quality and affordable food for students and working population,"" recalls Prabhakar.At the age of 27, he was already a businessman running a grocery store in Basavanagudi. Prabhakar, whose father G Ranganath ran Udupi hotels in Mumbai and Solapur after leaving Kundapur , had insights into the food industry after helping manage the familyowned Nithyanand Coffee Bar in Basavanagudi. Adulteration and high prices bothered him. A trip to Singapore, Malaysia and Europe helped him come up with a solution. ""I saw KFC and McDonald's and realized that we needed south Indian fast food restaurants,"" says Prabhakar.Back home, Prabhakar adapted the self-service restaurant model at his brother-in-law's Cafe Darshini, which required minimal investment in real estate and labour. ""No body took it seriously as they thought fast food won't work. Then they saw the rush and high turnover,"" smiles Prabhakar.A number of Darshinis came up and Prabha kar became the go-to mentor for food entre preneurs.G Srini vasa Rao, chairman and MD of Mayura Group, still recalls Prabhakar's suggestion to serve 120 ml soup for Rs 5 in 1996. ""I was new to Bengaluru and he was called Darshini Brahma by then. I followed what he suggested and it was a big hit,"" says Rao. That suggestion built the iconic Cool Joint in Jayanagar. ""He knows three things: how to ensure quality of food, what kind of food locals will like and at what price.Cool Joint's sandwich and soup menu was revolutionary,"" he says.Entrepreneurs like R Vasudevan of Hot Chips sought out Prabhakar when the time came for expansion. ""He advised us to keep the price low with no compromise on quality,"" says Vasudevan. But how to sell coffee for Rs 3 in 1995 and make a margin? ""He asked us to focus on volume; that is to sell 2,0003,000 coffees a day,"" says Vasudevan. Prabhakar also told which Coorg coffee to buy and sent experts to train the team in coffeemaking. The experiment worked, says Vasudevan whose 30 self-service restaurants now have a turnover of Rs 100 crore.""This is the model he created even before KFCs and others came to India. By the time the international chains came in, we realized how good his foresight was. He had prepared us even before the competition came in,"" says Vasudevan.Innovations didn't stop there. There was food by weight concept, food trucks, dosa camps, the rural-themed Halli Mane, much ad mired by writers like UR Ananthamurthy, and jazzy new outlets like Taaza Thindi and South Kitchen. ""The interiors and hygiene have to be good to appeal to young sters. There are many north Indians in Bengaluru who are homesick. So food has to appeal to them too,"" says Prabhakar.Despite a nerve problem leading to vision loss, Prabhakar remains active. ""His latest project is South Kitchen. Finally , the family owns something that he has created, after he sold off the original Cafe Darshini all those years ago,"" says Santhosh Prabhakar, his son, who runs cafeterias for corporates.At one point, Prabhakar was so focused on helping others that he stopped running his retail business. Then there were threats from people whom he exposed through media campaigns as adulterators.""My family wanted me to stop my consulting and campaigning. But I didn't stop,"" smiles Prabhakar.His children Seema and Santhosh say that they understand their father's passion for social justice. Santhosh says his father was shaped by the ups and downs any businessman goes through.Though his lack of interest in profit-making occasionally puzzles him, he is happy that Prabhakar tried to make the food industry more process-oriented.There is no quiet retired life for Prabhakar. He continues to consult and remains vocal about 18% GST being ruinous to small eateries. As for the ambitious plan of Karnataka government to start affordable canteens, he is blunt. ""It is going to be a 100% failure as there is no planning,"" says Prabhakar. Unlike in Chennai, which pioneered the popular Amma canteens, real estate is costly in Bengaluru. But where to cook food hygienically? It might work if they have a centralized kitchen and food trucks to sell the items,"" he says.As they say, it is all about the process with Prabhakar."

Vattavada, the largest cool-season vegetable cultivating village in the State has started sowing seeds for another season thanks to the rains. The village in the rain-shadow area was undergoing a severe drought delaying the sowing for the prime season of harvest in August/September. Rainfall last week prompted the farmers to sow the seeds.The main vegetables cultivated in Vattavada are potato, cabbage, carrot, beetroot, garlic and beans varieties.The cultivation is dependent on the rainfall with the shrinkage in cultivation in two seasons followed by the prime season.As per the Agriculture Department estimate 1,530 ha of land in Vattavada is under cultivation in the main season.Farmers confine the area of cultivation in the next two seasons to the low-lying areas where water sources are available,This time, the sowing was delayed due to the rains, said Gunasekharan, a farmer.The traditional way of cultivation is followed and the sowing is done when the farmers feel that the rains will sustain to germinate and help the growth of plants.The normal sowing season is April. However, this time the summer rains were poor and it was a long wait for them to start farming activities.A few farmers who had sown beans suffered losses as there were no rainfall after two days of drizzle.For beans, 60 days of growth is enough for harvesting the crops. However, three months of growth is required for all other vegetables. According to Horticulture Mission field assistant Shanavas T.B., the government move to bring more land in Vattavada under cultivation is showing good results.Large areas could also be brought under cultivation and potato is the main crop there.Farmers say that the large-scale cultivation of grandis was the main reason for shortage of water on the upland areas.The perennial streams started drying up and as it is in the rain-shadow area, the impact was severe. The delay in rainfall often happened in the past too and there is not much decline in the level of rainfall, said Mr. Gunasekharan and added that the main problem was the drop in the groundwater level.The Onam market is the main focus of farmers and the cool climate and fertile soil is enough for a good crop and pesticides and fertilizers are avoided.This make the quality of Vattavada vegetables better than those arriving from outside the State."

""Now, she is less enthusiastic about resuming school,"" says her mother Tina.Preetha Sharma, a 12-year-old student, echoes Alisha's sentiments. ""I usually buy vada pav, chips and chocolates almost thrice a week from the canteen . I will miss eating all these items if they ban it. Though I carry lunch from home, I love eating fast food during the short break. All my friends do it, too. My parents tell me about the ill-effects of eating junk food , and it's only at school that I have it. Once I reach home, I anyway drink milk and then eat fruits in the evening, followed by dinner. So why can't I have my favourite foods once in a while at school?"" she asks.Alisha and Preetha are among the many kids in the city who are upset about the ban, which came into effect after the Maharashtra government issued a Government Resolution (GR) on Monday, asking schools not to sell items that are 'High in Fat, Salt and Sugar' (HFSS).Now that items like potato chips, noodles, aerated drinks, pizzas, burgers, cakes, biscuits, buns and pastries might no longer feature on canteen menus, parents are happy that this will keep childhood obesity and other related disorders in check. Arundhati Chavan, president of Parents Teacher Association (PTA), shares, ""We've been fighting for this for the last five years. While some schools anyway don't encourage sale of junk food and have their own midday meal programmes, others instruct parents on what they need to pack for tiffins. Some parents do give their kids snacks like noodles and wafers in their dabbas, but that's only when the children throw a tantrum. We don't recommend junk food because kids tend to feel hungry soon after consuming it and lose concentration as well.""There are some parents who believe that despite the ban, kids will eat junk food outside the premises. Radhika Kochhar, mother of a 13-year-old boy, shares, ""Kids may be forced to eat healthier items in school from now on, but when they step out of the premises, they will buy junk food from vendors. So, how do we control that?""Anushka Desai, teacher at a suburban school, adds that it's not just school authorities who are responsible for what kids eat. Parents, too, need to be strict when it comes to their diet. After all, the GR does not stop children from carrying junk food in their lunch boxes. She says, ""Parents should resist giving in to the demands of kids and try to limit intake of unhealthy food items even at home. They can control consumption of junk food by ensuring that the kids have a balanced, nutritious diet throughout the week  be it at home or in school. Kids can be allowed to indulge in their favourite food items once a week. They need to be taught why junk food is called 'junk' and emphasise on the unhealthy aspects of it. If they start at an early age, it is easier for kids to make correct food choices.""Dietician and sports nutritionist Sakina Patrawala believes banning all junk items from the canteen is not the solution. ""Schools need to get a nutritionist on board to review the canteen menu and make healthier changes without compromising on the taste. This will help improve the quality of food served at the canteen. The school also has to ensure complete hygiene among canteen staff and also in the premises. Also, seminars on health need to be regularly organised for children as well as parents so that they can learn about healthy eating habits.""Nisha Ranganathan, mother of a teenager, adds, ""While I believe that the ban is a first step in the right direction, parents and school authorities should come together to ensure kids eat healthy. I think seminars and talk sessions on food habits must be made compulsory. Also, make healthy meals interesting for kids by presenting them in innovative ways.""> Instead of maida in frankies, use whole wheat to make the rolls.

5922e1b17be9e01fc7f5b1bb,Here's how Wajid Ali Shah made the Kolkata biryani,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/heres-how-wajid-ali-shah-made-the-kolkata-biryani/articleshow/58622647.cms,2017-05-11,"You could take the Nawab out of Lucknow, but could you ever take Lucknow out of the Nawab? Back in May 1856, Wajid Ali Shah, the 10th Nawab of Oudh, came to what was then Calcutta with much disquiet in his heart. The British had confiscated his lands, his treasury , his comfort -indeed, they had even banished him from his beloved Luc know. So what was he left with? On the outskirts of Kolkata, in Metiabruz , the Nawab rebuilt a repli ca of his beloved capital, complete with grand Islamic structures, his beloved parikhana of damsels, a zoo of exotic animals, kite-flying, kabootarbaazi and yes, food from the royal kitchen.But the purse strings had been tightened. The table was set, but the grandiose banquets were un der quite a bit of financial strain.So the Nawab's enterprising chefs thought of an ingenious way to deal with the shortage of meat. They added potatoes and eggs to the royal repast -and thus was born the Kolkata biryani.We were hearing the history of this dish from Manzilat Fatima , the great-greatgranddaughter of the Nawab. ""The only difference between Awadhi biryani and the Kolkata biryani is that the latter has aloo. When Wajid Ali came to Kolkata, he did not have enough funds to feed his entourage in an elaborate way . But his culinary heritage was his biggest treasure and he was both khaane ke aur khilaane ke shaukeen. So, after a few years in Kolkata, the potato was introduced in the biryani. The tuber had been brought to India by the Portuguese and was considered a novelty, since it was imported. It was also quite expensive, though not as much as meat.Apart from bringing down costs, the potato also helped to maximise the volume of the dish,"" Manzilat told us.We met Manzilat on a warm summer afternoon at the Sibtainabad Imambara, in the heart of Metiabruz. The building houses the tomb of the Nawab and in that sense, is a great place to hear the story of the biryani's evolution. ""The taste of the biryani available in restaurants differs from what I cook at home. They use artificial colour, meetha attar and definitely there's no saffron. It is also a bit spicy. But the one that we make at home has to be mild and we use saffron to get that perfect colour. The biggest difference is that we use mustard oil, which was always very popular in Bengal , to cook the korma,"" said Manzie, as she is fondly called by her friends and family members. Manzilat should know what she's talking about. After all, the tradition of cooking the dish has been handed down to her by her mother, who, in turn, learnt it from her grandmother, Farrukh Ara Mehdi Begum, who was the wife of Meher Qudr. Meher was the only son of Birjis Qudr, Wajid Ali Shah's eldest son.Apart from sharing family history, Manzilat also con sented to cook the special Nawabi biryani that she makes at home for CT.""Every time I place a layer of biryani in the handi, I have a habit of saying Bismillah, which means in the name of Allah. As Muslims, we start any aus picious work by taking his name and I feel that's the secret behind my biryani coming out so well,"" said Manzilat, as she put the meat in mustard oil on low flame at her Mirza Ghalib Street residence.""To get rid of the pungency of mustard oil, I smoke or burn the oil completely till it turns a dusty-grey in colour,"" she added. The rice has to be soaked in water for some time, before it is cooked threefourths. Then, when the meat is medium soft, the potatoes fried golden brown and the rice half-cooked, it's time to put the biryani on dum. From homemade biryani garam masala to a mixture of saffron strands and milk to kewra water and ghee, everything is poured into the handi with utmost finesse.And then comes the crucial part -the dum. ""Biryani ko dum dena is the most difficult part. It requires the most con centration and during this time I don't let anyone talk to me since the slightest of mis takes can spoil the zaika of the dish,"" said Manzilat. She apparently calls this the jhat pat biryani as it doesn't take more than two hours to make. Also, having mas tered the art of making biryani over 35 years, Manzilat has everything on her fingertips.Once the lid is removed, her entire apartment filled with a heavenly aroma as Manzilat turned to us with a smile and said, ""It's ready."" She makes it a point to serve her biryani with a generous helping of boorani, a type of raita or ghol, that's made from mint leaves, green chillies, rock salt, roasted cumin and curd and also acts as a palate cleanser.Over the years, this member of the royal family has turned her love and passion for cooking into a part-time profession. She takes house party , birthday and small corporate event orders, for a headcount that doesn't exceed 25.Apart from the biryani, she also makes chicken or mutton rezala, dum ki machhli and different kebabs. ""I prefer doing everything on my own, since I don't want to compromise on quality . If the order is for more than 25 people, it's difficult to cook the food at home. At times, there's a mixed order for chicken and mutton biryanis. I then have to make both simultaneously so that they remain equally fresh,"" Manzilat said.She also does pop-up cookery shows in Kolkata and has even travelled to Lucknow for some.Though she wants to start a catering business, she's in two minds since this requires hiring and training people and sharing her secret recipe. ""Perfecting the art of making biryani didn't happen in a day , but took several years of trying and testing. Also, my children, Aman and Asna, have been my biggest critic. When they started having the biryani, they would find one fault or the other and that helped me improve my skills. Now that they've grown up, they tell me, Mamma you make the best biryani ever,"" smiled Manzilat. The Nawab's heritage is in safe hands."

This is the first big project by a foreign national in the recent years in Punjab.The state government is hoping that would lift industry sentiments in the debt-ridden Punjab that has largely seen shutdown of units and flourishing of sand and mining mafia in the past few yearsA PepsiCo delegation, led by its chairman & CEO India Region Shiv Shivakumar and vice-president (global procurement) V D Sharma, met chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday to discuss major expansion and investment plans in the state.The company, which already has Asia's largest potato minituber lab in Zahura in Hoshiarpur district and a state-of-the-art bulk storage in the state, has offered technical support to the Congress government to develop Punjab as a premium citrus fruit producing state.""In this project, PepsiCo will now help realize the government's vision of farm diversification to steer farmers from paddy cultivation to the cash-rich citrus fruits,"" said Amarinder.Horticulture specialist James H Keithly from USA, who was also part of the PepsiCo delegation, unveiled a five-year plan for the production of high-yielding quality processing varieties of citrus plants at Jallowal nursery in Hoshiarpur.The delegation showed interest in collaborating with the state government to revive the horticulture project initiated during Amarinder's previous tenure, besides exploring the possibility of sourcing citrus fruits for their juices and concentrates from the state.Total 1,125 acres of area would be covered under the citrus plantation across the state. According to the plan, 55 acres would be brought under plantation of citrus plantation varieties of Kinnow, Daisy and W Murcott. In 2018, 170 acres would be brought under Carrizo, JattiKhatti and Carrizo rootstock liners. Likewise, 300 acres of area would be brought under Carrizo, JattiKhatti and Volk liners during 2019, 2020, and 2021, to expand the ambit of citrus cultivation in order to tap the land potential in the state.The chief minister, while reiterating his government's commitment to farm diversification to improve the lot of the state's beleaguered farming community, directed additional chief secretary, horticulture, Himmat Singh to work out the modalities for the citrus project in collaboration with PepsiCo.The chief minister urged the delegation to further explore opportunities for the farmers of south Punjab to be a part of the project while directing the horticulture department to give liberal subsidies for schemes like drip irrigation. He also asked the department to prepare a comprehensive action plan to adequately enhance the capacities of the two existing Punjab Agro juicing plants, at Abohar and Hoshiarpur, to meet the juicing demands of PepisCo.Amarinder directed the CEO Punjab Bureau of Investment Promotion to make the proposed new industrial policy conducive to the juicing industry to enable the state's farmers to reap the maximum benefit by getting a remunerative price for their crop. He also asked the principal secretary to take up the matter of ensuring eight hour uninterrupted power supply to the orchards with the chairman-cum-managing director, Punjab State Power Corporation."

At the worst, traders say the prices may continue to soar for at least the next two months when supplies are expected to improve.Prices of vegetables like bean, carrot and brinjal have increased, forcing buyers to be economical with their purchase. While bean is the most expensive, carrot is selling for Rs 60-70 per kg. Even beetroot, which was selling for Rs 20 per kg is now selling at double the rate.Ladies finger, sold at Rs 20 per kg, has also gone up to Rs 30 per kg.

The UNI canteen on Rafi Marg was a particular favourite of mine. We used to live in the building next to that of the news agency, so breakfast often meant a plate of idli with sambar and chutney at UNIs open air canteen. Some afternoons I used to stroll down there for a plate of lemon rice or curd rice, pickle on the side, and evenings meant a plate of besan coated potato fries or a crisp vada.The PTI canteen, on the side of the road from where we lived, was not that exciting. I did go there now and then, and had a dosa or some upma, but the fare at the UNI canteen, we all agreed, was far better.Then, of course, we moved out of Rafi Marg. The last time I went to the UNI canteen some years ago, I found that it was not being run by the rotund Swamy we were familiar with, but somebody from Himachal Pradesh. And my last visit to the old PTI canteen (James canteen, it was called) would have been sometime in the late eighties.Actually, I did go there a few days ago, but this time it was to a brand new canteen that has just opened up in PTI. Apparently, its not a canteen, but a caf  PTI news caf. It is on the ground floor of the PTI building on Parliament Street. It caters to the news service housed in the same building, but is open to the public, too, from 8 in the morning till 10 at night.I found a lot of office-goers from the neighbourhood when I went there around lunch time. We had thought wed have a special thaali (Rs. 100) with a plate of chicken (Rs. 100), but it was a Tuesday, so I was told by the man at the counter that there was no chicken on the menu. So we had the special thaali and a plate of idli.I must say it was rather nice. The helpings are large, and the thaali consisted of two tandoori lachcha parathas, paneer, kadhi pakori, bhindi, raita, salad and rice. The parathas were excellent  crispy on the outside, and soft within. The pakori was prepared with spinach and besan, and was pretty good. The paneer, in a light tomato-based gravy, was mildly spicy, while the bhindi, a bit too mashy, reminded me of home. The idli was soft, the sambar was fresh and the coconut-dal chutney wasnt bad either.I am told the evening snacks there are excellent  the samosa is crisp and flaky, and the stuffing of potatoes is tasty without being overly spiced. The aloo bonda, again, has a nice crisp casing, and a stuffing of spiced, mashed aloo. The samosa and bonda are for Rs. 12 a piece, and come with coriander chutney.The menu is a comprehensive one, and has dishes such as chholey bhaturey, rajma chawal and chicken biryani on it. But there was no chicken that day, as I said, and chholey bhaturey and rajma chawal werent a part of the days menu, a helpful gentleman at the counter informed me.I saw that the menu listed moong dal halwa. So I rushed to get some, only to be told that there were no desserts that day. But I suppose since it has just started, they will face some teething trouble. And the lunchtime crowd can get a bit chaotic.Like old Arnie, I shall return. But I will make sure that its not on a Tuesday."

However, farmers in Meerut say they have been unable to sell their produce as they are being turned away from procurement centres for one reason or the other.""Sometimes we are told that the policy has ended. Sometimes we are told that they don't have any place to keep the potatoes. Other times, they tell us that the potatoes are not the shape, size and colour that is required,"" said Inderpal Singh, a farmer from Batipura who has brought 120 quintals of potatoes to the procurement centre and is being turned away each time over the past six days.This is despite the fact that on his recent visit to Meerut, chief minister Yogi Adityanath had raised this point during his public address and categorically mentioned that he had directed the procurement agency to buy all potatoes irrespective of shape and size.Trying to clear the confusion among farmers, potato and vegetable development officer in Meerut Vineet Kumar said the order to purchase potatoes was only till May 7 and since then no fresh order has been issued. ""The order to buy potatoes was only till May 7. Now, there has been no further order. Also, the quality of potatoes is very bad,"" he said.Last month, farmers had thrown potatoes on the road in Meerut in protest against the procurement norms wherein the tubers were being checked for their shape, size and ""fairness"". Only potatoes which had a circumference between 30 and 55 millimeters were being bought. Potatoes which were not ""well-rounded"" were being rejected. In addition, potatoes which were not ""fair"" were also not being bought.""Now, when we go to the procurement centres, they turn us away saying that the centres have been shut down or that they have no place to store the potatoes. From my village, every farmer has been turned away every day. We carry our potatoes daily to the procurement centres, but it is not bought,"" said Kunwar Neeraj Singh of Amarpur village.Some farmers said after the government had announced that it would buy potatoes, many of them had brought their produce out from cold storage hoping to sell them. ""When the government announced the procurement policy, I brought all my potatoes out from the cold storage. I thought finally I will be able to get some money for these potatoes. But now the government is not buying these potatoes and they are not even in a cold storage. They will go bad in a few days and it will be a huge loss for me,"" said Honey Singh, a potato farmer of Amarpur village."
593bc9317be9e04956d788b0,Let a billion ‘uttam santatis’ bloom,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-opinion/let-a-billion-uttam-santatis-bloom/article18449895.ece,2017-05-14,"Last week, on the very day a new entertainment channel was being launched, I was trying to feed my baby. I dipped his baby spoon in the baby bowl and shovelled into his mouth a spoonful of the amorphous white goop that babies eat.He chewed on it for a bit, made a face, and said, farrago.When I didnt react, he shook his head, and looked at me sadly. As I moved closer to wipe his dripping chin, he ejected the entire contents of his mouth into my face, saying once more, farrago.I had assumed it was baby talk. But, thanks to the great Shashi Tharoors tweeted description of a programme on the aforementioned entertainment channel, I realised, belatedly, that my infant son had been trying to tell me not to feed him a confused mixture of banana, dosa, potato and Cerelac.Speaking farragoNormal babies start speaking simple words when they are 18-24 months old. This little fellow is all of ten months old. And his first-ever spoken word was not amma or appa or poda but farrago. A word I didnt even recognise, despite being a self-proclaimed man of letters. A word no one in our extended family or clan or neighbourhood had ever heard of. So how come his vocabulary is so advanced? You probably know the answer: garbh sanskar .Frankly, Im appalled at the recent brouhaha over efforts to revive the ancient Indian tradition of garbh sanskar . Some have even branded it as some sort of racist quackery inspired by Nazi Germany.But garbh sanskar , as the website of the organisation promoting it states, is a scientifically proven fact and an amazing way of teaching/educating and bonding with unborn baby in womb during pregnancy. Its objective is to produce uttam santati who would help build a Samarth Bharat .The benefits of garbh sanska r are well-documented in the Vedas. To mention just a few: Your uttam santati super-baby would cross development milestones such as crawling, speaking, and opening a Facebook account much sooner than ordinary babies.It would be more creative, less stubborn, and do potty at regular intervals between 9.30 a.m. and 5 p.m. only on weekdays and alternate Saturdays. And, it would fall asleep the minute you want it to. I promise to transfer Rs. 15 lakh to the savings account of anyone who can point to one thing thats objectionable in any of this.The science behind garbh sanskar is quite simple. The ether is full of jobless divine souls who are like venture capitalists (or angels) looking for investment opportunities. If you, as a couple, are planning to engage in conjugal activity with some kind of tangible output in mind, you must convince these investor souls to invest in your combined gene pool.Do your mathTrust me, this isnt as difficult as it sounds. All you need to do is spend three months purifying your sperm (or egg) by eating the right ayurvedic herbs, doing surya namaskar and restricting your carnal engagements to the time prescribed by planetary configurations.In addition, if you can demonstrate sustainable growth in your good karma at a CAGR of 18%-20% or above, not only would your bursts of coition turn more productive, they would also be more likely to entrap a divine soul, which would, in due course, materialise as a high-performing super-baby.Fine-tuning neededTo my mind, there is only one flaw in the super-babies programme. Take my own case, for instance.I am counting on my son to pay off my home loan, sponsor my post-retirement world tour, and finance the publication of my controversial autobiography.Thanks to garbh sanskar , I am certain that he will grow up to be taller, fairer, and, unlike me, intelligent enough to clear IIT-JEE by the age of 13 and become Director (Global Operations) at Goldman Sachs by 21. But there is no guarantee that he wont quit his job to become a human rights activist, or worse, live in sin with an anti-national.In other words, the baby customisation process needs fine-tuning. I therefore urge the government of India to scrap the MGNREGA and invest the money saved in modernising Indias super-babies programme.As for the deluded souls who cant stop criticising garbh sanskar , Im sure they either dont have kids or dont plan to have them or are such terrible parents that their offspring, once they grow up, would waste no time in despatching them to a geriatric home after diddling them out of their gold, property, and biometrics."

Compost Santhe , the weekly fair held by the BBMP in collaboration with civil society activists and environmentalists, is emerging as the cornerstone of the civic body's efforts to promote segregation at source and organic/eco-friendly waste-disposal solutions.The santhe held at Sri Ram Mandir Grounds, Rajajinagar, on Sunday was marked by a unique display of daily-use commodities made from recycled goods. The products made by artisans from across Karnataka covered a wide range -- pencils made of recycled newspapers, cutlery made of sugarcane waste and kitchen bags made of potato starch.Another initiative, 'Plant the paper', promoted the need for planting trees using handmade paper, with seeds embedded in it, which, on disposal, would sprout plants. The seeds included those of flowering plants, methi and dhaniya.Among the other attractions at the event were solar and terracota waste-composting units, and a large variety of handmade bags, envelopes and reusable sanitary napkins.By Samiha Nasir Ahmed & Aieman Zoha"

And it is the Knights who have come to the rescue of cricket's paradise. The Kolkata Knight Riders have tied up with the South Asian Forum for Environment (SAFE) for a clean drive. Since the first IPL 10 match at Eden on April 13, SAFE has been overseeing the collection, segregation and separation of the 900-odd kg of waste that a typical IPL match at the stadium generates. The efforts have borne fruit but more needs to be done to ensure that the stadium remains spick and span and attains the waste management credentials of other renowned sports venues, several of which use state-of-the-art technologies to harvest rainwater and produce energy from waste. Metro takes stock at the Eden Gardens a day after the season's final match in the city. Clean-up From May 4, the day after the penultimate IPL 10 match at Eden, to today, a day after the last match between KKR and Mumbai - the change was evident. Below the galleries, where the food courts are situated, the difference was stark. On May 4, the entire area had been littered with leftover noodles and bits of pizza. Everything from luchi-alur dum to paper plates, aluminium foil containers and plastic packets lay strewn on the floor around the walkway. The entire place had been reeking of rotten food. In stark contrast, only the stray paper plate or water pouch could be spotted in the food court area today. The state of the stands, however, told a different story. Empty water pouches, potato wafer packets and cola glasses had been pushed under the chairs, just like on earlier occasions. Bin 'n' bag Before the season's last match between KKR and Mumbai yesterday, 60 new 150ml dustbins were placed across all blocks of Eden, in addition to the 50 existing ones. ""We have asked the vendors to request customers to dump waste in the dustbins,"" said Amrita Chatterjee, a part of the Eden waste management project named Trash to Cash. Yesterday's match also saw water pouches being handed out in bags made out of recycled cloth instead of plastic packets. Vendor Rahul Kumar Shaw had to shell out around Rs 32,000 to make the switch. Nearly half the amount was paid by KKR, he said. Result: no sign of plastics packets strewn across the stadium and beyond. Missing link Trash cans have to be placed somewhere near the seating area if spectators are to throw their food packets and glasses into them, agree all stakeholders, but the Cricket Association of Bengal (CAB) allegedly won't allow bins to be placed in the stands. ""You can't expect people to remember to pick up their paper plates and glasses at the end of the match, carry them to the food stalls and dump them,"" Kashi Mali, who was overseeing the cleaning of blocks B to F, said. A senior CAB official confirmed that SAFE had not been allowed to place trashcans in the galleries. ""What if someone hurls the bins at players?"" he asked. When reminded about the eight-feet-high perimeter wall around the stadium, he expressed fear that spectators could throw the bins down and hurt other spectators seated below. But can't the bins be chained to pillars? ""We don't want to take any risk,"" the official responded. In the face of resistance, SAFE and KKR are mulling hanging paper bags to substitute for trashcans from next year. The one area where Eden's cleanliness should improve is... Tell [email protected]"

Heres the list of things that are of foreign origin but now very much Indian.1. Samosa, the most common evening snack in India is something that doesnt belong to us and has its origin in Middle East, where it was called Sambosa.2. Chai  its sad to know that our favourite most drink was originated in China and later popularized by the Britishers in India.3. Kites, were flown to India from China via Korea through traders. With time, each region developed a distinctive style of kite flying and cultural purpose for the same.4. The famous north Indian delicacy rajma-chawal became a possibility once the kidney bean arrived in the subcontinent from Central Mexico and Guatemala.5. Cricket, our most favourite sport, which nothing less than a religion for us was invented in England. And now, we are the biggest nation playing the sport.6. You will be shocked to know this one. Potato or aloo, the widely eaten vegetable in India, originated hundreds of years ago in southern Peru and north western Bolivia.7. Hand Knitting, that always reminds us of our childhood days when our grandmothers were often seen with their wool and sticks, is actually an art developed in the land of the mummies  Egypt.8. Biryani, the most common party main course originated in Persia and might have taken different routes to arrive in India. The name is derived from the Farsi word Birian. And now we have hundreds of Indian varieties popular in India.9. Ever wondered where those delicious Jalebis that we hungrily devour came from? Yes, we are talking about the Jalebi, which is one of Indias favourite sweet delicacies. The word Jalebi is derived from Arabic word zulabiya. This sweet is said to have been brought to Medieval India by the Persians.10. Bata Shoes, every house in India will definitely have at least 2 pairs of shoe from Bata, but did you know Bata Shoe Company was founded on the 24th of August 1894 in Zln (Moravia, today the Czech Republic) by Tom Bata.Check out this thread for more interesting stuff on this topic."

Manju told reporters here on Wednesday that MLA H S Prakash is unnecessarily confusing people.He is a member of Hassan Urban Development Authority (HUDA) and is aware that even if farmers go to court, it will not help them. The aspirants would be allotted sites through draw of lots at Kalabhavan at 11 am on Thursday. Besides, the farmers who have lost their lands for the Outer Ring Road will be soon compensated as per the law, he said.The minister said that suitable action would be taken against Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) officials and traders if complaints are lodged and the allegations proved that they are indeed cheating farmers. Manju said that potato is the commercial crop of the district and around 2,771 farmers who had enrolled would receive certified seed potatoes.Taking a dig at MLA H D Revanna, Manju said that the previous governments had distributed potatoes used for cooking to farmers. As certified seeds are being distributed now, they are levelling allegations because they are unable to tolerate it. The APMC president and the traders are supporters of JD(S). Is it not possible for Revanna to rectify the problem by speaking to them, he questioned.Those who get certified seeds will be given 50% discount on pesticides and crop insurance facilities. The farmers should get receipts for the seeds they procure. The administration is ready to supply the required amount of seed potatoes but farmers should enrol in advance, he said.Stadium neededManju said that the district does not need an airport or golf course but needs a stadium of international standards. The stadium would encourage sportspersons and also increase the value of the land which will help in the overall development of the district, he said.Vacant posts to be filledThe government will fill the vacant teachers posts in the district soon, he said. He lamented that the overall percentage in the SSLC results had slumped as compared to the previous years. The schools should hold monthly meetings to discuss the preparations with teachers, he suggested."

Swaminathan Research Foundation (MSSRF) and the UNICEF came together on Thursday to launch the Tamil Nadu Nutrition Alliance.The alliance will attempt to bring together multiple stakeholders for an all-hands-on-deck approach to tackle malnutrition. Thursdays meeting at the MSSRF in Taramani saw the participation of representatives from various government departments, NGOs and academics, among others.Speakers at the event pointed out that all is not rosy when it comes to the nutrition levels of the people of the State. The fourth round of the National Family Health Survey (NFHS), for example, says that 55.4% of non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years are anaemic. In NFHS-3, this figure stood at 53.1%. At the same time, the all-India figure for this category dropped from 55.2% in NFHS-3 to 53.1% in NFHS-4.Job Zachariah, Chief of UNICEFs Office for Tamil Nadu and Kerala, said that the alliance was necessary as factors like sanitation, child marriage and women empowerment  which have a greater say in nutrition than conventionally thought factors  are usually overlooked. The newest evidence shows that nutrition-specific interventions only have a 20% say in reducing malnutrition. The other 80% is decided by nutrition-sensitive or social determinant interventions, he said.Triangular relationshipMSSRF founder M.S. Swaminathan said that nutrition literacy should be a priority for the alliance.Many nutritional problems were considered medical problems. Even in our country, the National Institute of Nutrition is with the Indian Council of Medical Research. Nothing wrong with that. But the idea was that it was a medical problem. Today, we realise that the triangular relationship between agriculture, nutrition and health is extremely important, he said.In Africa, a new variety of sweet potato with a high degree of Vitamin A has helped overcome Vitamin A deficiency...This is an agricultural pathway to a nutritional problem....An agricultural remedy for a nutritional malady, Mr. Swaminathan said.Darez Ahamed, mission director of the National Health Mission in Tamil Nadu, participated."

In a state with the highest rate of crimes against SCs, with three recent attacks on Dalit weddings, it took a funeral for this wedding to happen.Its a happy day for the Bairwa household in Mehndipur village, around 100 km from Jaipur. The walls of Ranjeet Bairwas modest house sparkle with fresh white paint, and a heart drawn in red paint, enclosing the names of the bride and groom, Pooran and Khushi, adorns the entrance.Pooran is a graduate who went on to do certificate courses in teaching and library management. At 27, he is older than most Dalit grooms in this area. Pooran says he got a little late waiting for a job, and is now preparing for the Rajasthan governments recruitment exam for sub-inspectors.Pooran sits patiently as a group of women perform wedding rituals, placing dhania (coriander) seeds in his hand, while singing traditional folk songs.There have been several instances recently of Dalit weddings being disrupted by upper and dominant castes in Rajasthan and in other states, but the Bairwas are not worried about that today.Khushi walks out to welcome him in what will be their first meeting(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Khushi walks out to welcome him in what will be their first meeting(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)It is a funeral, instead, that everyone talks about; a funeral two years ago that led to a Dalit protest, which eventually made the Rajputs of the village relent, and made wedding celebrations like Poorans possible.How can we forget? says Santram, Poorans 47-year-old cousin. It happened on March 14, 2015. Jaise hi unhone hamein arthi le jaate dekha, hum par hamla kar diya aur arthi ko dhakka diya. Murda zameen pe gira diya. Hum sabko bada gussa aaya (The moment they saw us carrying the body on a bier, they attacked and pushed it. The body fell. We were furious), he says.In the violence that followed, Santram and 15 other Dalits were assaulted by Rajput members of the village. There had been clashes before but this time, Santram decided not to let go and filed an FIR. Eighteen persons were booked and five arrested.It was then, he says, that the Rajputs relented. They called me and said you do whatever you want, we will not bother you anymore, says Santram, the relief still showing through the triumph in his voice.The same year, Santram contested the 2015 panchayat elections but could not win, though the Bairwas constitute the majority by far, with 150 households compared to 20 Rajput and three Jogi homes. They didnt even let Kanshi Ram (the late BSP founder) win. Who am I? he says with a wry smile.According to the National Crime Records Bureaus Crime In India report 2015, Rajasthan has the highest rate of crimes against Scheduled Castes in the country (57.2, calculated per lakh population). However, says Karauli DSP Prakash Chand, under whom Mehndipur falls, the incidents have come down significantly in the past few years. It is chiefly due to education and awareness about legal provisions. We usually try to solve such situations by talking to both parties, and it works most of the time. Two months ago, we received a complaint from Mehndipur so we sent some forces in plainclothes.Baraatis dancing to a local band, which was also once denied to Dalits by upper castes Baraatis dancing to a local band, which was also once denied to Dalits by upper castesRajkumar Bairwa, sarpanch of Sankarwada, under which Mehndipur falls, says, There have been practically no incidents since the 2015 funeral. The Rajputs also know that the legal provisions in such cases dont even allow bail. That has proved to be a major deterrent, besides education.Since 2015, the village has seen 8-10 weddings without any disruption, including Deendayals. Last year, the 33-year-olds baraat was taken out under heavy police protection. Baraatiyon se zyaada khaki vardi wale they. Aisa lag raha tha jaise kisi VIP ki shaadi hai (There were more policemen than baraatis, like it was a VIP wedding), he laughs. Police say they deployed the force more as a precaution.That was the last wedding in the village that required such protection.Today, as Poorans baraat wades through the Rajput area, children come out on the rooftops to watch. Pooran is riding a horse, wearing a turban and carrying a sword, all traditionally upper caste symbols, and unthinkable at a Dalit wedding until recently.The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh. If swords cant be had, the Dalits use a stick to hit the toran (auspicious decoration) while entering the brides residence, as part of a wedding ritual.The wedding will cost Poorans father Ranjeet Singh Bairwa, a construction contractor based in Delhi, around Rs 2 lakh. The horse and the DJ/band cost Rs 15,000. A wedding band is also a newly acquired indulgence for the Dalits. The Bairwas have paid Rs 10,000 for a local band, which includes a small pick-up truck with a music player and large speakers loaded in the back.Pooran in the Tavera hired for the wedding, with cars a safe mode of travel(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Pooran in the Tavera hired for the wedding, with cars a safe mode of travel(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)While he studied only till Class V, Ranjeet has managed some amount of financial security for his family. Among the achievements he is most proud of is the small Vaishno Devi temple he has got constructed near their house. Pooran stops here to pray before getting on the horse.Poorans mother Rampati and eldest sister Guddi smile, as a village woman comments, Forget the turban. Earlier, we had to carry our jutis (shoes) on our heads before upper castes. But now there is no problem. Now we have a band, a horse, everything.While Guddi did not study, Poorans three younger sisters studied up to Class 12.Yahin giraya tha murda us din (This is where the body fell that day), says Ranjeet, as they cross the family temple, shouting to make himself heard over the auto-tuned songs set to electronic beats being played by the DJ.The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh. The sword Pooran is carrying had been used by his elder brother Ram Singh.As the baraat sets out, a mild dust-storm rises. The overcast sky mutes the evening sun and a strong breeze brings some respite to the wedding party.The wedding band is playing the songs of local favourites Raju Rawal and Shambhu Meena, which encompass everything from the timeless love of Radha and Krishna to demonetisation. The two singers have been creating waves across East Rajasthan, in the faultlines between its rural and urban areas, with their paeans to the Prime Minister.Tonight, the hundred-odd baraatis burst into a brisk dance to the beats of Waah re Mhara Modiji. Achha achha kanjoosa ki neend uda di re/ waah re mhara Modiji ka lehar chala di re; Paanch sau, hazaar upar rok laga di re/ kaala dhan ki tijori ki vaat laga di re; Ek raat mein paaso paltyo koi samajh ni paayo/ arre suntan hi TV mein news ghano paseeno aayo; Surgical strike se Pakistan hilayo/ greeban ki samajh bhavna dukh mein saath nibhayo; Arre kerosene ki kaala bazari band karwa di re/ waah re mhara Modiji kai lehar chala di re (Modiji has made the stingy sweat, sent the black marketeers running, turned the tables in a night, stunned Pakistan, heard the poor, ended the black market in kerosene).Bemused at the choice of song, Poornas cousin Suresh Bairwa says the band culture has only taken off in the last eight-10 years among Dalits. Before that, it used to be quiet. The groom would leave with women singing auspicious songs, and stop at homes of elders for blessings.Despite the song, the demonetisation cash crunch is itself a thing of the past. Pooran flaunts a three-layer garland of the new Rs 500 and Rs 100 notes, placed around his neck by relatives.The baraat waits for the bride to get ready at Khushis home(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The baraat waits for the bride to get ready at Khushis home(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Poorans brother Ram Singh, who is with the Army Medical Corps, has come for the wedding from his posting in Manipur. The 35-year-old says one major driver of the change in caste equations in the village are government jobs, preferably ones that come with a uniform, providing the Dalits a level playing field and social privilege.That is perhaps why the three young Dalits with jobs in the Army, BSF and CRPF in the village are role models for the community. Vardi vale ko haath lagane se pehle dus baar sochega koi (One will think ten times before laying a finger on a person in uniform), says 21-year-old Sanjay, who wants to join the Army.While most elder Dalits have had partial or no education, they are keen that their children study. However, though several young men want to join the forces, only a few make it. The preparation for the exams, the books, the coaching etc cost money.Sanjay is apprehensive about his chances. Mushkil hoti hai, coaching ke bina nahin ho paata. Maine physical clear kar liya tha, lekin merit list mein nahin aa paaya (It is difficult without coaching. I had cleared physical but couldnt make it to the merit list), he says.After riding around 40 minutes on the horse, Pooran disembarks and gets into a rented Chevrolet Tavera, decorated with artificial flowers and strips of satin. He rides with a young nephew and three relatives, who are coming along to take care of logistics that might arise on the way.The vehicle has been hired for Rs 3,100. The family has also hired 10 Jeeps to ferry guests to the brides village. Some relatives use their own cars while most others cover the 12-km distance on their bikes.There are 8-10 families in Poorans village that own a car. They are well-to-do. Some are contractors. We couldnt afford to buy one because we had to marry off four daughters, says Ranjeet.Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation. Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation.It is cars that have truly liberated Dalit weddings. Non-traditional, they have become a standard since riding a horse could invite trouble from upper castes.In 20 minutes, the baraat reaches Darjapur Patti, the brides village. Darjapur Patti lies adjacent to a Meena-dominated village and some guests mistakenly stop at a wedding there. We just had water, clarifies a baraati later.The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities. The Meena caste panchayat took that decision. Since we dont have a direct approach road to our settlement, we have to go through their area. That means we cant play any band music either, says a Dalit villager, not wishing to be named.A carpet is laid on the road outside for the groom party to sit on, while waiting for the bride to get ready. Younger family members burst crackers while the baraatis are served rose-flavoured milk.Pooran waits in tremulous anticipation. It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.With some moments to spare for the rituals to begin, Nanakram, 70, from nearby Pakhar village, is in a pensive mood. We dont want any of this the mare, the band. Why should the community waste time and money on these things when all they lead to is conflict? he says.However, says Sanjay, its not as simple as that. The older generation doesnt want to change anything. But we have decided to challenge them (the upper castes). Why cant we do what we want? Its our country too. Everyone understands the language of the fist Only then will our condition improve, he says, taking a walk through the village lanes bathed blue in the moonlight.The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The reception is low-key since Darjapur Patti has banned loud bands or DJs for all communities.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Interestingly, unlike the other upper castes, the Dalits find Brahmins more than willing to pitch in for their weddings. Most of them come from the Mehndipur Balaji temple area, and can earn around Rs 1,100 in dakshina at a wedding like this. We have no issue with them. They dont discriminate, says Suresh Bairwa.If Brahmins are not available, a relative with basic knowledge of Sanskrit fills in. Pooran and Khushis wedding will be conducted by his fathers brother Gulab Chand.The Bairwas say they would have liked their upper caste neighbours to attend. We do invite them but they dont come since they dont want to eat with us. They will accept uncooked stuff but wont share a cooked meal, says Suresh. In the city, my upper-caste friends eat with me, at weddings etc. But when theyre back in the village, they stay away, he says.Dalits, in turn, are almost never invited to Rajput weddings.Pooran and Khushi exchange garlands.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) Pooran and Khushi exchange garlands.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)There is some restlessness among the guests now. Its a hot, humid night with barely any breeze and they have been waiting outside Khushis house for two hours. There is some problem with the toran. They are trying to fix it, says Ranjeet.Paper plates loaded with sweet halwa made of coconut and lauki (bottle gourd) along with deep-fried potato snacks are passed around among the guests by the brides side. The naashta pacifies the restive baraatis for a while.Many, including the young and old, light up, puffing on bidis and cigarettes. There is no alcohol though. This is one upper caste convention they dont want to emulate, the Bairwas insist. We dont have alcohol or non-vegetarian food at our weddings. But those who want to drink make their arrangements anyway, says Sanjay, with a twinkle in his eyes suggesting his own little arrangement.The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)At about quarter to 11, Pooran and his baraatis enter the arched gateway erected to welcome the guests. The brides side looks relieved, with the first hurdle  the safe arrival of the wedding procession at their door  out of the way.Khushis father Ram Khiladi, a Grade III government schoolteacher earning around Rs 5 lakh a year, has got their three-room house painted in light-green pistachio hue  Khushis favourite colour  for the wedding. The railing of the roof is adorned with lights, with two electric lotuses flanking the palace-style decoration on each side.You cant upset the baraatis, Ram Khiladi says. I have already spent Rs 5 lakh. Her dress alone cost Rs 20,000.After a couple of minutes, Khushi arrives, dressed in a purple lehnga with a transparent dupatta covering her face. Girls in the village have started going to parlours to get ready, but Khushi has got dressed on her own. Pooran and she exchange garlands.The baraat passes a Meena village along way(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) The baraat passes a Meena village along way(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)As the women from the brides side sing songs welcoming the groom, everyone moves to the open area where dinner has been laid out. While Khushi goes back inside the house, Pooran heads towards the reception area with his friends.At about midnight, Khushi again emerges. Women from her family surround her under the mandap and help her put on jewellery gifted by the grooms side  a mor for her hair, a rakhdi for her forehead, and an intricate necklace.She then comes to sit on the stage along with Pooran, and a wedding photographer takes their pictures, dictating various poses.Ram Khiladi says he wasnt worried about any upper caste interference at the wedding at their village. Education has changed the attitude of upper castes and more so us. Besides, there are legal provisions safeguarding us. So people want to avoid getting into trouble, says the 49-year-old.Khushis village is dominated by Meenas, who have about 200 households. There are only 20 Dalit families.Ram Khiladis son Rakesh (22) too got married this February without any trouble. We went with a ghodi, band etc, he says.It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand) It is an arranged marriage, and it is the first time he will be meeting Khushi, 24, who is in the second year of her B.A. course.(Express Photo by Oinam Anand)Left to himself, like other community elders, he too would go for simpler, less expensive weddings, he adds. We have been trying to bring down unnecessary expenses, like serving alcohol or other extravagant practices. But the girls side inevitably has to spend more.Vishnu Singh Sisodiya, the up-sarpanch of Gharoli village nearby and a Rajput himself, says they have also been trying to get community members to rise above symbolic and contentious matters. Earlier these symbols were claimed exclusively by the Rajputs because it was a matter of prestige for the bigger gharanas. It still happens in Rajput-dominated villages. In Mehndipur too, there was an issue related to a funeral. But times have changed. Im a Rajput myself but personally I feel these things should not happen. Whats the point? Cases are filed, people go to jail.Those who arent queuing up to get their pictures clicked with Pooran and Khushi have begun digging into the vegetarian spread: pooris, aalu ki sabzi, salad, raita and sweets. Most of the baraatis leave after dinner, with only those closest to the family sticking around till the pheras. That will be a while. It will probably be morning by then, sighs Ram Khiladi.Around 5 am, Khushi and Pooran finally leave for his home, in the rented car. It has been the grandest day of their lives.Santram says when they look back, thats what would matter, and not as much what all they could do despite the upper castes. Everyone realises these things, band, turban, horse, cost a lot, he says. Given a choice, we would not even want to follow these rituals. But the point is how can we not be allowed to follow them?Band, baaja, banApril 4, 2017Sanjay Kumar was beaten up reportedly for riding a mare in his wedding procession, in Sanjarwas village of Charkhi Dadri district in Haryana.

In fact, ads have a two-way link with society. Firstly, ads reflect the prevailing social mores and preferences of the people.For example, the matrimonial ads in India at one time used to seek as groom in order of preference: doctors, engineers, chartered accountants and, as last resort, professors. Some were even more categorical in specifying that the brides family would consider only doctors having degrees from UK and engineers from IITs. Then, over time, with the rising flow of Indian IT professionals abroad, such people working in USA, and Europe began to occupy the pride of place in the list.For some families, apart from enjoying a better material standard of living, staying abroad had the further attraction that it would enable the bride to stay away from the in-laws family. More recently, with MBAs  particularly from the top IIMs  typically earning more than engineers, IIM MBAs have entered the list. Also, an increasing number of matrimonial ads are asking for working brides, instead of housewives, to supplement family income. At the same time, the proliferation of fairness cream ads testifies the premium that the Indian society, by and large, still places on fair skin.It is also interesting to observe how the products promoted by the ads have changed over time. With rising affluence (and aspirations) of the new generation along with easier availability of bank loans for consumer products, the ads for simple consumer goods like basic soaps, detergents and tooth pastes are giving way to more upscale products like body perfumes, air conditioners, motor bikes, cars, LED TVs, smartphones, jewellery, diamonds, flats and villas.Secondly, advertisers  through their ads and promotional campaigns  try to change the tastes, habits, choices and the aspirations of the public. They would make you believe that life is largely meaningless if you dont have a smart phone, shoes, watch, perfume, motorbike, car of a specific brand to distinguish you from the hoi polloi or to make a fashion statement for you.Advertisers particularly target children as, apart from being more impressionable, they are having an increasing say in family purchase decisions in todays society. In addition, investing in changing their preferences is likely to yield higher returns as their life span is longer.In this game of marketing and promotion, celebrities play a significant role. This is an age-old technique. Older people would remember seeing ads in newspapers and movie theatres (long before the advent of TVs) depicting film stars like Nargis or Madhubala using Lux soap every day. The same tradition is continuing, except that the range of products promoted by film stars and sports personalities has widened enormously. Even some state governments are employing such personalities as brand ambassadors for the purpose of attracting tourists or investments.Why do companies pay enormous sums to hire the services of such celebrities to promote their brands? There are two possible reasons. One, the face of a celebrity attracts the viewers attention immediately to the ad and the product stays in the mind of the viewer through association.Second, the fact that a company can afford to pay the huge sum to the celebrity implies that the product must be a good one bringing a lot of revenue. That helps establish the quality of the product in the minds of prospective buyers.Should celebrities be held accountable for the quality of the product or the service being advertised by them? True, it is not possible for an outsider to know fully about the quality (including any fraudulent claims made by the company).Product qualityYet, the celebrities  because of their celebrity status being used to sell the product or service to unsuspecting people  should exercise due diligence before endorsing. Since they are earning huge money, at least they should be made to pay some monetary penalty if they are found endorsing a product making false claims. That would make them more circumspect.Do companies have to spend on ads to survive? In theory, if the products being sold by different firms are identical in quality and consumers also think so, then it does not pay for any firm to spend on ads. Since the identical products would sell at the same price, the extra cost incurred on ads cannot be recovered.That is why we dont see ads for potatoes or tomatoes but find ads for different brands of potato chips and tomato ketchups (as these are not considered identical by consumers). At the other extreme, a monopolist  because he gets 100% market share by definition  cannot gain by spending on ads except when the ad helps expand the total market of the product by making more consumers aware of the product or an improved variety of the product or by enhancing the image of the company by advertising its CSR activities.Is so much spending on ad socially justified? Here a distinction needs to be made between ads to disseminate information and ads to take away sales from the competitors. The first type provides some useful service to the society. The second does not add any net social benefit. One firms gain is cancelled by another firms loss.While ads at tax payers expense aimed at changing social attitudes like open defecation, child marriage, demanding dowry etc are justified, wastage of national resources occurs when politicians use page-long ads to promote themselves under the pretext of informing the public about the laying of foundation stone for a project.If providing information is the objective, a simple press note in the media or a smaller ad without the names and photos of the numerous ministers and politicians should do.(The writer is former Professor of Economics, IIM-Calcutta)"

Together with the Consumer Food Price Index released by the Central Statistics Office, this would help monitor the price situation of food items better,"" a government statement said.As per the numbers, inflation in the fuel and power segment was 18.52 per cent while that of manufactured products was 2.66 per cent in April.Last month, the Reserve Bank had left the key policy rate unchanged at 6.25 per cent for the third review in a row, citing upside risks to inflation. It had, however, increased the reverse repo rate -- which it pays to banks for parking funds with it -- by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent, narrowing the policy rate corridor.As per the new series data, industrial output growth slowed to 2.7 per cent in March as against 5.5 per cent a year ago.

It seems the State is not keen on taking the financial burden to protect farmers from selling their produce at distress price, Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh told a BJP delegation from Odisha.The basic objective of MIS is to provide remunerative prices to farmers in case of glut in production and fall in prices. However, the MIS is implemented on specific request of the State Government willing to share the loss with Central Government on 50:50 basis, Singh said.It has been brought to my notice that Odisha farmers are incurring huge losses due to fall in prices of onion which is being sold at `3-4 a kg. But there is no proposal yet from the State Government for market intervention under MIS, the Union Minister told the delegation.The Uttar Pradesh Government has taken the benefit of the scheme this year to protect potato growing farmers, Singh said and added that Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu had successfully gone for market intervention under MIS last year.Stating that MIS is for procurement of agricultural and horticultural commodities which are generally perishable in nature, the Union Minister said though funds are not allocated to the States, the Centre shares the loss of farmers based on specific proposals received from them.With a bumper harvest of onion this year, the State is staring at a possible crisis of the vegetable due to lack of storage facility. As the Centre expects about six per cent decrease in onion production against last year, it has advised the State Government to take timely ameliorative measures to tackle any potential crisis in onion during the lean season.On the day, the State Government advised the Horticulture Department to give stress on informing farmers to store their produce to meet the demand during crisis time.Though the State Government is giving 50 per cent subject to a maximum of `87,500 for construction of onion storage facility under Horticulture Mission, there are hardly any takers.While a 20-tonne onion storage facility costs about `1.75 lakh, the farmers have to bear the cost to reimburse the subsidy amount later. Most of the onion growers do not have the financial capability to spend such a huge amount, official sources said."

In a reply to a question in the Assembly on May 9 2016, the CM had informed that 11.09 lakh hectares were covered under assured irrigation in 2015-16 kharif season. This is only 18 per cent of the total agricultural land of the State, BJP MLA Pradip Purohit told reporters here.Though many farmers in the State committed suicide due to crop loss and debt burden, the Government refused to accept the fact to cover up its failure. Nothing could be more unfortunate than to claim that farmers of Odisha do not commit suicide. This shows the apathetic and insensitive attitude of the BJD Government, Purohit said.What happened to the State Potato Mission after three years of its launching? the BJP legislator sought to know from the Government.As per the Mission target, the State was supposed to be self sufficient in potato production. With its annual requirement of about 12 lakh tonnes of potato, Odisha had produced 2.68 lakh tonnes last year. Purohit attributed the failure to lack of storage capacity in the State.Quoting a reply of Agriculture Minister Damodar Rout in the Assembly, Purohit said only five cold stores of the Cooperation Department are functional while 13 have remained defunct. The Government has failed to revive a single cold store during the last 17 years.Even as the State has achieved self sufficiency in onion production, the farmers are selling their produce at throw away price due to lack of institutional support from the Government, he rued.Similarly, the State is way behind the national average in egg and milk production, Purohit added."

For this to be true, our dishes need to be prepared using hand-ground masalas and mud pot.I began cooking when I was seven. I used to help my mother with cooking and that's when I decided to take this as my profession. It was hard to accept when people addressed me as cook while I wanted to be called 'chef'. I had to earn the title. So, I spent 20 years to carve my identity.Now, I hold three Guinness World Records, one for the longest cooking marathon by an individual. I cooked 617 dishes weighing 190 kg in 24 hours 30 minutes and 12 seconds, using 486 kg of raw material. The other one was for making a 48.2 ft dosa with the help of 22 dosa masters. We sold that dosa for `10 lakh via auction and we donated the amount to orphanages.I set another record by cooking 15.4 tonnes of curry which fed 1.4 lakh people. Now, I plan on making 275 kg of idlis that can feed around 7,000 people. I am working on this and should be doing this by August.I love to experiment.

Through online bidding of products, the monopoly of local traders will be checked in determining the price of a product and farmers will get the highest price for their produce. According to official data, around 20 tonnes of ginger and eight tonnes of potato are grown by farmers in the district annually.According to a ginger grower, Sukdev Naik of Bankaput village under Pottangi block, last year he sold ginger at `8 per kg, while this year he sold the produce at `31 per kg through online bidding.

The admiration for the elephant would become manifold if it happens to be a mother with her calf, the baby elephant enjoying freedom to move within the reach of the superintending mothers long trunk.And so it happened that my daughter and son were looking with wide open eyes at the mother-kid duo in theforecourt of the Kamakshi temple in Kanchipuram. Can we give these bananas to the young elephant? my plucky daughter asked the wiry minder, taking a bold step towards the pachyderm. Alarmed, my son, the younger one, took a few steps backwards and clung to his mother.The mahout was emphatic. No, no bananas or coconuts for the junior. He has a digestion issue. My daughter was puzzled. What do you mean, no bananas and coconuts? Arent they the favourite snacks of elephants? What can we give instead? Pop corn? Potato chips? Roasted peanuts? Or candies?I thought I saw a twinkle in the eyes of the mother jumbo. Since she would not be able to ask what she wanted for the son, the mahout said with a broad grin, Both like biscuits. Yes, you wont believe, biscuits. That too, Marie. And nothing else.We quickly went out of the temple and bought from the shop outside two big packets of Marie. My daughter gave both the packets to the mahout. He opened one and strewed the circular biscuits near the baby elephants forelegs. Without any ado, or a formal nod of thanks, the frisky calf began to make short work of the biscuits, swishing her little tail in happiness. The mother elephant seemed to apologise, Pardon him, folks. He is too young to know he should say thanks.Before long, the mother put her foot down and stopped her kid from eating any more. But the growing young one would not listen, having an elephantine craving for snacks. The mother nudged him away firmly from the biscuit heap. And let out a curt monosyllabic command that made the calf perceive its mothers ire on its disobedience.Though the big one also adores biscuits, she will not touch them when her kid is nearby fearing she will set a bad example, the mahout said and added. Mothers will be mothers, whether bipeds or quadrupeds. My daughter nodded and asked. What about a drink to wash down the biscuits? I bet they would not prefer water but maybe a Pepsi or a Coke? The mahout grinned broadly and said, Neither. They guzzle Mirinda. You are welcome to get it from the same shop. But not ice cold, please."

One of the young men is wearing a long embroidered purple skirt. A glittering rhinestone necklace peeks out from below the collar of another boys checked shirt. A huge neon green turban is perched precariously on the head of a young woman. They sway joyously, unselfconsciously to the beats of megahit Hindi pop song Kala Chashma.A man with a big tray of drinks and a bigger smile ambles towards the customers, takes their orders, and introduces himself. His name is Sambhav Dehlavi and he is owner, head chef and matre d all rolled into one. If you seem to want company, hell sit down with you, share a cigarette and tell you how he set up Chez Jerome last year to create a safe public space for the LGBTQ community.Are there not already places in Delhi where queer people can hold hands or dress the way they want? Theres difference between being tolerated and being welcomed, Dehlavi says, between feeling like an outsider and feeling at home.When you enter, you realise that youre free here, says 18-year-old Nitish Anand, who defines himself as gender-fluid and asexual. Your choices of being different are okay.Pulkit Sharma, a 19-year-old Delhi University student who identifies as queer, says the cafe serves as a safe haven and represents a giant leap for the city.Its an idea that took shape as Dehlavi backpacked across Europe a few years ago and worked as a chef to pay his way. Every city he visited boasted a vibrant queer culture with at least one public space for the community.In India, where sex between people of the same gender is outlawed and where queerness is normally shunned, Dehlavi feels the need for spaces such as Chez Jerome is even greater.He is quick to point out that exclusion is not his aim. I want this to be a safe space for women, too, Dehlavi says, for anyone who wants to be part of an inclusive culture.A version of the Spanish pincho, strips of meat and potato tied to garlic bread and topped with cherry tomatoes. (Facebook/ Chez Jerome - Q Caf)Even Dehlavis menu is a study in unconventionality. Its a free-wheeling assortment of foods from across Europe: Frances famous croque monsieur; a version of the Spanish pincho, strips of meat and potato tied to garlic bread and topped with cherry tomatoes; Greek omelettes with feta cheese, baby spinach leaves and chopped red onions; and a white Italian pizza with Dehlavis personal twist  a layer of potato chips and cream cheese.And theres more left off the menu that Dehlavi will whip up for you if you fall into conversation with him.

Apart from the religious sentiments involved, the fact remains that such cattle are treated extremely cruelly during and of course after such sales. Those who feel that the government is interfering with their eating habits should keep in mind that this law does not prevent the sale of cattle to government registered slaughterhouses, where quality and other issues can be better monitored.However, the government should have considered the impact this will have not just on the export of beef, but also the leather industry, which earns around $6 billion in exports annually. Mounting protests from the leather industry is snowballing into a hot potato and the Centre may be forced to remove buffaloes from the ban-on-sale list. Since most of the cattle trade for slaughter takes place through markets, the new rules make it difficult for farmers to dispose off their aged cattle.Traders usually buy buffaloes from cattle markets and then transport them to slaughter houses. State governments including Kerala, Bengal and Karnataka have termed the order a violation of the spirit of federalism, and it appears the issue is headed to the courts, with the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday staying the notification.The other aspect is the increasing number of cow vigilantes running amok, even in states where cow slaughter is not an issue. The manner in which a group of self-appointed gau rakhshaks beat up two men of a New Delhi-based firm which was legally transporting milch cows at the Bhubaneswar Railway Station last week is just one example. While Union Minister Venkaiah Naidu insists that cow vigilantism is neither a policy of the government, nor the BJP, the state governments need to back that up by taking strict action against any such acts."

The total production is estimated at 295 million tonnes, 3.2% higher than in 2015-16.The estimate shows that 2016-17 will be the fifth straight year when India's horticulture production will outstrip that of foodgrains. The foodgrain production for 2016-17 is estimated at 273.38 million tonnes.The agriculture ministry released on Tuesday the second advance estimate for horticulture production, noting that even the area under horticulture crops had recorded an increase  from 245 lakh hectares in 2015-16 to 249 lakh hectares in 2016-17. The second advance estimate has, in fact, revised the production figure upward from the first, which had put the figure at 287 million tonnes in February. The higher production this year is attributed to a good monsoon in 2016.According to the ministry's estimate, based on information provided by states and Union territories, fruit production for 2016-17 is estimated at 93 million tonnes, 2.9% higher than the previous year, and vegetable yield at 175 million tonnes, 3.5% higher than the 2015-16 production.Most vegetables, including onions, potatoes and tomatoes, will record an increased production this year.

We got our usual supplies. The situation will be the same tomorrow too. The problem will start if the strike doesnt end by Saturday. The wholesale markets are shut on Sunday.

(Source: PTI Photo) Ahmednagar: Farmers spilling milk on the road during their state-wide strike over various demands at a village in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra on Thursday. (Source: PTI Photo)Day one of the farmers strike in Maharashtra saw supplies of fruits, vegetables and milk being hit in major cities like Mumbai and Pune. While members of Kisan Kranti, the umbrella organisation of farmers which spearheads this unique strike, maintained that theirs was an apolitical movement, Sadashiv Khot, minister of state for agriculture and marketing, said the protest was politically motivated and was being fomented by people who have failed in their political career.Farmers across Maharashtra had decided to go on strike from June 1 as repeated talks with the state government had failed to resolve the stalemate. Yogesh Rayate, state level coordinator of Kisan Kranti said complete loan waiver of the farmers and implementation of the Swaminathan Committees recommendation about fixing of agricultural produce were their main demands. As the state government failed to respond to our demands, we had no other option but to go on strike, he said. In response, farmers across the state took to stopping vehicles of fruits, vegetables and milk towards urban areas. A call was also given to farmers not to provide milks to dairies and not to sell their agricultural produce in the wholesale markets.As a result of the call, wholesale markets in Mumbai and Pune reported a sharp dip in arrival of fruits and vegetables on Thursday while markets in Nashik, Aurangabad and Ahmednagar were completely closed. Rajendra Shelke, president of the potato and onion sellers in the Vashi wholesale market in Mumbai, said there was a dip of 35 per cent in the arrival of vegetables. Dilip Khaire, chairman of the administrative board of Pune wholesale market, said there was a dip of 50 per cent in arrivals.The onion market of Lasalagon in Nashik district was completely closed as not a single farmer came to sell his produce. Vashi traders maintained that in case the supply continues to get hit, the rise in the prices of commodities could not be ruled out. Stray incidents of violence were reported from Nashik, Ahmednagar and Pune where farmers took to damaging milk-carrying tankers as well as vandalising trucks carrying vegetables. In many areas, farmers emptied milk containers and dumped vegetables on the road. Police had reportedly taken action against some protesters in Nashik, Aurangabad etc.Dairies across the state had reported a dip in procurement of milk as farmers refused to provide milk and at places stopped milk tankers. R S Sodhi, managing director of the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation (GCMMF)  the proprietor of Amul  said their milk procurement was hit in Maharashtra. Amul sells around 19 lakh litres of milk per day in the state and Mumbai is one of the major markets of the brand. We procure around 10 lakh litres from the state and the procurement was less today.In many places, the tankers were stopped, he said. Sodhi said while they were able to deliver milk on Thursday, if the strike continues, milk shortage could not be ruled out. Kolhapur-based Warna Cooperative Dairys milk tanker was attacked allegedly on Wednesday night near Satra, when it was transporting milk to Mumbai. B B Bhandari, general manager (transport) of the dairy, said they supply around 2.5 lakh litres of milk to Mumbai and procurement of the same was hit. We shall be transporting milk under police protection to Mumbai, but procurement has been hit, he said.An unfazed Khot said the state government will be able to ensure smooth supply of milk and vegetables to the urban areas. The people who are behind this strike are failed politicians who do not want the farmers to prosper, he said. Khot said the government was ready to talk and the on-going strike was not the solution. Rayate and other Kisan Kranti members, however, refuted Khots charges.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

It succeeds fairly well.Canto replaces Karma The Liquid Lounge, popular in the early 2000s for filling a gap between nightclub and fine-dining restaurant. In its new avatar, it has a chilled-out, easy vibe. In the midst of families out for a mid-week lunch and noisy kitty-partying women, one does spy the odd office-goer at a quick, solo lunch.Divided up into a voluminous main area on the ground floor and a tiny mezzanine level, the sense of space was apparent the moment we walked in. Comfortable tufted couches and wrought-iron-legged tables sit atop black-and-white tiles. Adding a touch of whimsy, two giant paintings of dancers in voluminous skirts dominate one wall. There are pendant lights and wall sconces; and plenty of natural light streaming in from the large windows.The Thai curry bao was disappointing.

Our next drink, the sour Melodies, was too high on lime juice and too low on gin.

The suitably straightforward juicy grilled chicken breast with a buttery potato mash on the side was the poster dish for comfort food.The desserts lacked imagination. A competent but boring combination of molten chocolate lava cake and vanilla ice-cream did little to outshine the creamy brilliance of the wobbly blueberry cheesecake with crumbly shortbread base.

Vada pav, the most popular street food of Mumbai, is also equally famous in the financial capital of India. The popularity of the poor mans burger is slowly catching up. No wonder, vada pav is growing in demand and popularity as the foodstuff will turn 50 this year! Interestingly, it has crossed the shores and slowly making waves in the US and the UK.The liking for vada pav actually cuts across class and generations as it is savoured by common man to celebrities. And the story of Mumbai is incomplete without vada pav, its signature dish. Celebrities have endorsed vada pav as their best fast food. Seeing a vada pav being made is one of the finest aromatic experience. Vada Pav is fresh, available 24x7 and a fast-moving food item.Batting maestro Sachin Tendulkar's love for vada pav has been well documented and he had narrated how he used to eat it at Shivaji Park-Dadar, where he got the lessons of cricketing. I and my son (Arjun) love to eat vada pav at Shivaji Park Gymkhana and there is nothing that can beat this snack, laced with chutney, he once said, talking about one of his favourite snacks.In fact, on August 23 every year, the Vada Pav Day is celebrated. Most of the well-known travel and cuisine writers have covered widely about vada pav.It's not very clear as to who and when vada pav was first sold. But most believe that it was sold first in public somewhere in the mill heartland of Mumbai in the mid-60s, catering to the workers of what was earlier known as Girangaon, where at one point of time there were over 100 textile mills. Subsequently it spread to other parts of Mumbai and soon became a hit.Another version is that it started at a small stall owned by Ashok Vaidya outside the platform No 1 of the Dadar station. My father started it around 1966-67 and slowly it evolved, said his son Narendra.Most of the cafes and restaurants serve vada pav in Mumbai and there are several stories and tales attached to vada pav and anecdotes of celebrities. Aaram, the iconic restaurant located at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus, gives Aaram vada pav. A stall outside Dadars Kirti College, has been attracting customers and is popular among celebrities. This is very popular among the celebrities.Among office goers of the Fort-Flora Fountain area, one of the famous places, is the CTO vada pav located near the Central Telegraph Office. There are several stalls along the maidans of Mumbai-- Shivaji Park, Oval, Azad, Cross Maidan, among others and these are fast food for the players.One of popular vada pav stalls was the khidki vada pav in Kalyan in Thane district, which was started in the late 1960s by the Vaze family, who used to sell vada pav from a window of their house facing the road. The Jai Maharashtra stall at Azad Nagar is another such place. Gajanan vada pav in Thane sticks to the traditional vada pav but what makes it different is their chutney.The vada pavs in inter-city trains like Deccan Queen (Mumbai-Pune), Flying Ranee (Mumbai-Surat) too have their own importance. Trains and food go hand in hand...and for trains arriving and departing from Mumbai it is about the taste of vada pav and how it changes from station to station, said foodie and independent journalist Ajit Joshi, one of the experts on Mumbai's business history. Vada pav in railway stations like Thane, Igatpuri, Karjat, Kasara, Khopoli and Virar are famous and people prefer it during their journeys as they go out of the city limits of Mumbai, added Joshi.The price ranges between Rs 10 and Rs 20 in street stalls and fast food joints.Vada pav has been part of the culture of this metropolis. People of Mumbai love it and it has now spread to most of the important cities of India, says veteran tourist guide Raj Suri, who also publishes tour guides and maps of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region.Nowhere across the world such a food item has been so popular,"" said Sanjeev Sabde, veteran culinary expert and food writer. The taste of vada pav also varies from stall to stall and shop to shop, restaurant to restaurant....the vada pav of Kirti College would be different from Aram vada pav, he said.If fact, there are aspects of social and political colour to it as well. The Shiv Sena used vada pav stalls and haath-gaadis (push carts)to promote itself, said Prakash Akolkar, who has penned Shiv Sena  Jai Maharashtra. When a factory or a mill laid-off workers, the Shiv Sena would help the jobless to set up vada pav stands outside the factory, he said.The party, of late, had been encouraging the Shiv vada pav stalls. However, some organisations have challenged the Sena taking advantage of food stuff in the Bombay High Court.The Marathi compound word batata vada means potato fritter. Pav which is a variant of Portuguese po is sweetened bread. As far as calories are concerned, it is close to ameal. A 200 gram vada pav would have 290 calories, 25 gram fat, 25 gram carbohydrates and 5 gram protein, said chef Hiralal Patel. The ingredients in a vada pav allows you to keep on working for hours, he said.There was a serious need for a filling, light, nutritious, easy-to-carry snack for the morchas of millworkers, shipping unions, Shiv Sena rallies, said Ashok Thakur of Kirti College vada pav.Today vada pav selling has become an organised business. Chains like Jumbo King and Goli Vada Pav are catering to not only Mumbaikars but also people in different parts of India. Vada pav is available in some places in the US and the UK. Now, there are samosa-pavs, bhajia-pavs, usal-pavs, misal-pavs, variants which are also equally popular, especially among youngsters."

However, operations at Bhopal mandi were hit on Monday as the quantity of vegetables reaching from western MP went down.Abdul Raqib, president of the association of fruits and vegetables said, ""A large quantity of vegetables comes from western MP. Trucks bringing vegetables from Indore via Sehore did not arrive today, reducing the inflow by 50%.""Farmers' organisation RKMS, that joined the strike two days ago, protested at Nasrullaganj. State general secretary of Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) Anil Yadav was arrested from his house late on Sunday.SP South Bhopal Siddharth Bahuguna said, ""Yadav and Ramnaresh Yadav were arrested under section 151 of CrPc and 505 of the IPC (creating public mischief).

He alleged that the CM was not addressing the ""real issues"" of loan waiver and support price of vegetables.Bhopal mandis are not affected much by the strike although Karond Mandi that supplies to other areas of the city has seen a decrease in supply by 25%.

While earlier forms of adulteration, including mixing sand, marble chips, stones, chalk powder and brick powder with spice and food grain were harmful to the digestive system, doctors warn plastic rice can increase risk of cancer by 15-20 per cent, apart from wreaking havoc on digestive and reproductive system. If consumed regularly, plastic rice can choke the intestine, leading to bloating and acute stomach ache. This will require surgical intervention too, doctors said.Plastic rice can either be made from potato carved in shape of rice grain and covered with a coating of cheap plastic or made in shape of rice granules carved out of plastic sheets. In either case, consumption can trigger havoc in the digestive system. ""While other forms of adulteration like mixing sand or crushed stones are easier to spot and sift, plastic rice is not only difficult to differentiate from real rice, but also affects digestive enzymes.It can even cause changes in the hormonal system and affect the entire reproductive system,"" said Dr Sudarshan Reddy , general physician at Continental Hospital.Worse, diagnose is delayed as doctors fail to pinpoint the cause of gastritis. It's only when patients don't respond to antibiotics that adulteration and poisoning is suspected as cause ,"" said Dr Reddy.Doctors, meanwhile, point out how plastic rice is the worst form of food adulteration as it is present in hard granular form of plastic, which is difficult to cook.""It's in fact worse than thin plastic bags consumed by stray animals as thick plastic in the shape of rice is very difficult to digest. When mixed with rice, it effectively contaminates rice and decreases nutrient value. It is also very tough on the digestive system and even the gastric juices can only digest 5-10%,"" said Dr B Prabhakar, gastroenterologist, Apollo Hospital."

Customers had bought extra stock earlier. Few bought vegetables over the past three days owing to the rise in prices. Today, however, there has been a substantial increase in the supply, compared to the past few days, said Gangadhar, a vegetable vendor from Matunga market.Vendors at the APMC market in Turbhe, Navi Mumbai, reported that supply had returned to normal and prices had reduced on Wednesday. (Bachchan Kumar/HT)Ashok Walanj, APMC director who also represents the onion and potato market, said the market received 125 trucks carrying onions.Over the past few days, there was a shortage in supply. Today, however, we received a good supply of onions and potatoes. We got onions from all over Maharashtra except Nashik. We also got 50 trucks of potatoes. Prices are low, he said.Vendors said the supply of fruits had not been hit much. As it is the holy month of Ramzan, the middlemen cannot afford to stop supplying fruits. They have somehow managed to deliver a certain quantity of fruits daily. There has been some shortage, but our sup, said Prakash, a fruit vendor at Matunga market.The supply of fruits to Navi Mumbais markets was not affected much during the statewide farmers strike. (Bachchan Kumar/HT)The strike took an ugly turn in Madhya Pradesh on Tuesday after protestors took to violence and police had to resort to open firing, in which five farmers were killed.As many as 350 trucks carrying vegetables arrived at the Navi Mumbai APMC market on Wednesday. Only 15 of these were from Maharashtra. About 320 vehicles supplied the market with vegetables on Tuesday.Parts of Maharashtra are only supplying us with minuscule quantities. However, there are arrivals from outside the state, which are taking care of the demand, said wholesaler Ganesh Pingle. He added that prices have not dropped much as supply is yet to return to normal in wholesale markets. In retail markets, however, prices have reduced.Prices in retail markets are expected to drop in the next few days. (Bachchan Kumar/HT)Mukund Pawar, a retailer, said prices may reduce over the next few days owing to steady supply. There should be a further drop in prices by Thursday."

One day I was experimenting by hollowing out the potato and filling it with spices and lemon juice, he says. It tasted nice and I started selling it along with our other items. We named it after kulhar, the earthen vessel we traditionally use to drink tea in. Our customers appreciated the new recipe. Later, I added boiled chickpeas. That made it more popular. To make the chaat colourful and tasty, I later also introduced pomegranate seeds into the filling.The eatery is named after Mr Kushwahas father but it was founded by his grandfather, Rati Ram, who had moved to Delhi many, many years ago from Najibabad, a town near the Himalayan foothills. The former farmer began his life in this city by selling fruit on the pavements of Chawri Bazar. Today, Mr Kushwaha, assisted by his two brothers, is carrying forward the legacy.Although the stall serves classics such as golgappas and paav bhaji, you need to focus only on these scooped eye-catchers  they stand out thanks to the juicy pomegranate seeds glistening like pink diamonds.

Government health officials participated in the meeting.Outlawing momos, however, would accomplish little.The substance at the root of Aroras claims, monosodium glutamate (MSG), also known as the brand name Ajinomoto, is frequently used in the preparation of dishes with East Asian flavouring such as noodles, fried rice, chilly paneer, and chilly chicken.The flavour enhancer is also naturally found in vegetables such as potato, tomato, and mushroom, as well as several fruits and wheat and dairy products. It is added into a variety of grocery items.MSG came to the limelight in 2015 when samples of Nestles Maggi were found to include the flavour enhancer despite Nestles claims to the contrary. Maggi was also shown to have higher than permissible quantities of lead.India does not stipulate a maximum limit of MSG in food. The Food and Safety Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) requires that it should be used in accordance with a general set of good manufacturing practices and only in certain types of food.To help people make an informed choice about what they eat, the FSSAI also says that food items that do contain MSG must announce its presence on their packaging.What is MSG? Monosodium Glutamate (MSG) is a flavour enhancerIt is commonly found in Chinese food, soy sauce, parmesan cheese, potato chips, and frozen foodsIt also occurs naturally in items such as potatoes, tomatoes, milk, mushrooms, and wheatThough consumption in large quantities may cause headaches, numbness, chest pain and sweating, and eventually lead to elevated blood pressure, it is still basically safeCan it really cause cancer?It is popularly believed that MSG causes sluggishness, headaches, nausea, increased thirst, skin rashes or excessive sweating. Scientific studies around the world, however, have failed to establish any negative health impact associated with MSG, let alone cancer. The Food and Drug Administration, the premier regulatory body of its kind in the United States, categorises MSG as generally recognized as safe.If consumed in higher quantities or regularly, it is also known to have caused palpitations and chest pain in some people, said Ritika Samaddar, chief dietician at Max Super Speciality Hospital. It is an approved flavour enhancer; even the US allows its use. We just suggest that as a precaution, pregnant women and infants not consume it.It definitely does not cause cancer, she adds."

There is no end to the problems we face. We will also join the fight,"" said Rakesh Tikait, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.His views have been echoed by leaders of other farmers' groups.Another faction of the BKU submitted a memorandum addressed to the prime minister to the Lucknow district magistrate on Wednesday, demanding an FIR against officers responsible for the ""unfortunate police firing"" in Mandasur and a CBI probe.They have threatened to stop supply of milk and vegetables from their villages to cities from Sunday if their demands were not met, BKU spokesman Alok Verma told PTI.The national president of the Rashtriya Kisaan Manch, Shekhar Dixit, said the Yogi Adityanath government must address the basic problems of farmers at the earliest or prepare to face a ""Mandsaur-like situation"" in the state.Taking a dig at the crop loan waiver scheme announced by Adityanath at his first cabinet meeting, he said the basic issue is of minimum support price that most farmers are unable to get.""If the Uttar Pradesh government is really serious about addressing the problems and plight of the farmers, then it must start resolving their problems lest a Mandsaur-like situation grips the state and unrest fans out,"" he told PTI.During the 2017 election campaign, the BJP had promised that if it came to power in UP, sugarcane dues to farmers owed by mills would be paid quickly. But, farmers say they are yet to get back their dues.Sugarcane Development Minister Suresh Rana, however, said that till date Rs 22,190 crore payment has been made and Rs 3,196 crore were yet to be cleared.""In future, payment will be made to farmers within 14 days of the commencement of the crushing season,"" UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said.Cane farmers have often complained about how mills harass them.""The mills have subsidiary businesses like distilleries.

There is no end to the problems we face. We will also join the fight,"" said Rakesh Tikait, president of the Bhartiya Kisan Union.His views have been echoed by leaders of other farmers' groups.Another faction of the BKU submitted a memorandum addressed to the prime minister to the Lucknow district magistrate on Wednesday, demanding an FIR against officers responsible for the ""unfortunate police firing"" in Mandasur and a CBI probe.They have threatened to stop supply of milk and vegetables from their villages to cities from Sunday if their demands were not met, BKU spokesman Alok Verma told PTI.The national president of the Rashtriya Kisaan Manch, Shekhar Dixit, said the Yogi Adityanath government must address the basic problems of farmers at the earliest or prepare to face a ""Mandsaur-like situation"" in the state.Taking a dig at the crop loan waiver scheme announced by Adityanath at his first cabinet meeting, he said the basic issue is of minimum support price that most farmers are unable to get.""If the Uttar Pradesh government is really serious about addressing the problems and plight of the farmers, then it must start resolving their problems lest a Mandsaur-like situation grips the state and unrest fans out,"" he told PTI.During the 2017 election campaign, the BJP had promised that if it came to power in UP, sugarcane dues to farmers owed by mills would be paid quickly. But, farmers say they are yet to get back their dues.Sugarcane Development Minister Suresh Rana, however, said that till date Rs 22,190 crore payment has been made and Rs 3,196 crore were yet to be cleared.""In future, payment will be made to farmers within 14 days of the commencement of the crushing season,"" UP BJP spokesperson Rakesh Tripathi said.Cane farmers have often complained about how mills harass them.""The mills have subsidiary businesses like distilleries.

5a0494419855b76bf13bdf22,Farmers’ ire not about loans alone,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//india/farmers-ire-not-about-loans-alone/articleshow/59078066.cms,2017-06-09,"The farmers'agitation in MP, and before that in Maharashtra, has pushed a simmering agrarian crisis into the spotlight.Earlier, the newly elected UP government announced a loan waver for small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra government said it was exploring the possibility. The Centre itself had announced that it would strive to double farmers' incomes by 2022. All these were raising expectations of farmers, especially after enjoying a good monsoon and record harvest in 2016-17, after two consecutive years of drought.Yet why are farmers - the lifeline of India - angry and resentful?One of the key factors fuelling agrarian anger is that good year or bad year, they are unable to earn enough. There is always a mismatch between their cost of production and what they get in the mandis. A quick comparison of cost of production and farm harvest prices as data collected by the agriculture ministry reveals the mismatch for 2014-15, the last year for which such information is available.In several states, for several widely cultivated produce like paddy and wheat, prices at which farmers are selling their harvest are actually lower than what they spent in cultivating the crop. In Madhya Pradesh, the epicenter of current agitation, paddy was fetching 15% less than cost of production while wheat was giving them just 2% profit.MP has emerged as a major player on the national scene exhibiting an agricultural growth rate of 9.7% between 2005-06 and 2014-15 compared to 3.6% for India as a whole. Share of agriculture in MP's gross state domestic product has increased from 25% to over 30% in this period. Area under vegetables and fruits has increased by 78% since 2010-11. According to a study done by Ashok Gulati and his colleagues at ICRIER, expanded irrigation, strong procurement system for wheat and bonus over its minimum support price and expansion of all-weather roads to connect farmers to markets have led to this boom in agriculture.Yet, after enjoying the boom for several years, the state's farmers have ended up in the same trap that has been haunting their brethren in other states. The reason why farmers don't get suitable margins is because of their input costs  water, diesel, fertiliser, etc. For cultivating wheat in MP, Rs 1,241.34 were spent on fertilisers per hectare in 2004-05 which has more than doubled to Rs 2,695.27 per hectare in 2014-15. Similarly, cost of seeds used in one hectare increased from Rs 998 in 2004-05 to Rs 2,653 in 2014-15. Even cost of irrigation has jumped from Rs 1,961.50 to Rs 2,599.55 in this period. These and other costs like labour, agricultural machinery hiring charges, pesticides, rents, have all gone up while prices that farmers get have lagged behind.As recently reported, support prices may be higher than what farmers get but getting payments is so difficult that farmers often have to sell to traders at lower prices. This dire situation is also causing mounting indebtedness of farmers with over half of agricultural households in debt as per an NSSO survey for 2012-13. MP was reported to have 46% debt ridden farmers.Should farmers diversify to get more value for their crops? This would appear to be a way out except that even in those cases, farmers' margins plummet after some time. UP's potato farmers were getting a measly 5% profit, while in Punjab, cotton farmers have suffered enormous losses of as much as 20%."

A Telegraph picture Calcutta, June 9: Bengal has emerged as the first destination for PepsiCo to churn out its entire range of snacks in India with the launch of the nacho chips line at its Sankrail factory in Howrah. The company has invested Rs 100 crore to manufacture Doritos - one of the billion-dollar brands of the American food and beverage giant - from the Bengal unit that produces all the other snacks Pepsi sells in India. The installed capacity of the new line, tucked inside the factory located on National Highway 6, will be 3,000 tonnes per annum - enough to meet the initial demand of the product. Explaining the rational of the fresh investment in the plant, Niteen Pradhan, vice-president (supply chain & operation) of PepsiCo India, said it was logical for Pepsi to choose Sankrail. ""It is one of the best we have globally in terms of capabilities. Close proximity to the source of corn also helped,"" Pradhan said after the launch of Doritos in Calcutta today. Pepsi, which works with 12,000 potato farmers in Bengal to manufacture Lays potato chips, is sourcing two special varieties of corn from Bihar's Purnea. Going forward, the company may procure from West Dinajpur district in north Bengal. ""We are always keen to procure raw material close to the plant. As volume picks up, we hope to start procuring from Bengal too as it would bring down the logistic cost,"" he said. The Sankrail plant, which came up in 2004 at Sudha Ras food park of West Bengal Industrial Development Corporation, also produces Kurkure and Cheetos - two other snacks from the PepsiCo stable available in India. PepsiCo has 62 manufacturing facilities in India, 43 for beverages and 19 for snacks. However, only a handful of them are owned and operated by the company, the majority being contract manufacturers. Roll-out plans PepsiCo started test marketing imported Doritos in select markets before it started producing from the Bengal plant. Available in two varieties - cheese and sweet chilli - the company plans to leverage its distribution network to reach out to traditional and modern trade in 40 cities, apart from offering online. Jagrut Kotecha, vice-president (snacks) of PepsiCo India, said nachos is the fastest growing category in the Indian salty snacks segment. ""The market size is Rs 200 crore (about 4,000 tonne in terms of volume) and growing by 40-45 per cent,"" he said. Doritos would be the third master brand from PepsiCo in India. ""We have come with three pack sizes, targeting the 18-24 age category in urban and semi-urban localities,"" Kotecha added. Cornitos of Greendot Health Food is the market leader in tortilla corn chips, popularly known as nachos."

You're tempted, aren't you? According to new research conducted by Stanford scholars and published in the Journal JAMA Internal Medicine, you are more likely to choose and favour vegetables if they are labelled with exciting and indulgent descriptions. For instance, adding words like 'caramelized' , 'dynamite' or 'sizzling' may make them sound more delicious and tempt you to eat them.To test the impact of labelling on the consumption of healthier food, researchers collaborated with the Stanford Residential & Dining Enterprises and conducted their study in a large dining hall on campus. They changed the labels for certain vegetables and made them sound more enticing using four types of descriptions: basic, healthy restrictive, healthy positive or indulgent. For example, beetroots were labelled as 'lighter choice beets with no added sugar' (healthy restrictive), green beans were simply called 'green beans' (basic), carrots were described as 'smart-choice vitamin C citrus carrots' (healthy positive) and they were not just sweet potatoes but 'zesty ginger-turmeric sweet potatoes' (indulgent).They made sure there was enough variety with a choice of vegetables like beetroot, butternut squash, carrot, corn, courgette, green beans and sweet potato that were rotated weekly. Researchers monitored the number of diners who chose the particular vegetable and how much of it was consumed for lunch over a period of 46 days (an academic quarter). No changes were made to the way the food was cooked and presented. They were only labelled differently but the diners were not aware of the fact that different sounding choices were the exact same item.It was found that vegetables with indulgent labels were preferred 25 percent more than basic labelling, 35 percent more than healthy positive and 41 percent more than healthy restrictive labels. In terms of per day consumption, vegetables with indulgent labelling were consumed 16 percent more than those labelled healthy positive, 23 percent more than basic and 33 more than healthy restrictive labels. It is believed that people consider healthy food to be less tasty and therefore, using delicious sounding descriptions and names can change their perspective and impact their sensory experience.The results of the study provide insights on how to encourage people to eat well by making healthy food more appealing. This simple strategy of changing the descriptions and making healthy food sound more indulgent and drool-worthy could have a significant impact on the food choices we make."

Onion was being sold for just Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh till the state government stepped in to buy, potato is still being sold for 80 paise in Haryana and pigeon pea (tur dal) is fetching no more than Rs 40 in Maharashtra.The glut and plunging prices is the sum total of the crisis staring at farmers across the length and breath of the country. Last week, matters came to a head after farmers protest in Mandsaur of Madhya Pradesh turned violent, resulting in six deaths.Like everywhere else, Mandsaur farmers were agitating after they were forced to sell onions at just Rs1 a kg. The prices are well below what they fetched in 2016: Onion for Rs 1 as against Rs 7, turmeric for Rs 50, half the price in 2016, soya bean at 33% lesser than the rate in 2016 and so on.Farmers blame their plight on demonetisation and the failure of the government to impose adequate import duty on time.Farm economy runs on cash and traders say they have no money to give us. We are forced to sell the produce at whatever price they (traders) are offering, said Jasbir Mamumajra, a sunflower grower from Yamunanagar in Haryana, who blamed demonetisation for his woes.Most of the agriculture trade used to run on cash, mostly unaccounted money, and on credit. With cash being sucked out, the traders have less liquid asset to take risks. In some places they are seeking a commission of up to 2% to make payment in cash.A farm trader in Indias food bowl of Punjab, Devinder Singh, agrees, saying note-bandhi has disturbed the trade cycle. Entire trade shifted to no-credit system. It has hit us hard, he said.An agriculture expert with Bihar government, Anil Kumar Jha, said input costs such as labour, fertilisers and pesticides have gone up significantly this year. This added to the miseries of farmers, already facing cash crisis due to demonetisation.Maharashtra farmers, who were first to protest after prices of pigeon pea (tur dal) fell, blamed the Centre for not imposing high import duty on pulses.The production cost of the tur per quintal is more than Rs5,000 for farmers. With the Union government allowing the import of lentil at Rs 3,700 a quintal, the farmers are not likely to recover their cost, said Vijay Jawandhia, farm activist and Shetkari Sangathana leader.Same was the complaint by farmers in Haryana, who have been forced to sell sunflower at Rs 2,500 per quintal as against the minimum support price of Rs 3,950 even though the cost of seeds have increased by almost 50% in 2016.We could have been saved had the government increased import duty on edible (palm) oil, said Balwinder Singh, a Karnal-based farmer. However, state government officials blamed poor quality for the low price.In Asias largest grain market in Khanna, Punjab, the prices of maize have plummeted with traders like Sanjeev Kumar saying the farmers are bearing the brunt. In Uttar Pradesh, farmers sold wheat at less than the minimum support price, saying government agencies were not willing to buy the produce because of the record production this year.Wholesale traders in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh said the prices of onion, tomato and potato have crashed.The per quintal wholesale prices of the onion in Maharashtra was down to Rs 600-800 from Rs 1,000-1,250 in 2016. Potato in Haryana was sold at Rs 80 a quintal on Tuesday. Farmers sold onion for Rs 1 in Madhya Pradesh after which the government announced a procurement price of Rs 8 per kilogram.P Chengal Reddy, founder-chairman of the Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations (CIFA), said: The Centre takes into consideration the average production of past three years and not the current years production cost, in deciding the MSP. If it continues, time is not far when farmers across the country will revolt, he said.(With inputs from state bureaus)"

A few months back, the state government had formed a special committee to study possible electoral reforms in wholesale markets.In what is seen as the phase two of market reforms, the state government has decided to from a special committee to give suggestions for the formation of a new board of directors of Mumbai wholesale market. The committee, headed by marketing director Sunil Pawar, has been asked to submit its report in a months time.The trade in agricultural commodities in the terminal wholesale market of Vashi in Navi Mumbai is carried out mostly between traders. With an annual turnover of around Rs 18-20,000 crore, the market sees the arrival of agricultural commodities from across the state as well from other parts of the country. Vashi market is one of the few markets whose catchment area has little or no agricultural activities.Subhash Mane, the then marketing director, had suspended the board of director of Vashi market on charges of corruption in 2014. At present, a board of administrator is running the market and talks are on for appointing an IAS officer as the chairman of the market. Other than Pawar, the new committee has representatives from Solapur and the deputy secretary of the Mumbai market.Wholesale markets, which have been traditionally controlled by either the NCP or the Congress, has been on the radar of the Devendra Fadnavis government. Delisting of fruits and vegetables and changing the manner of election of directors for the market committees have been two major reforms carried out by the present government. Traders in the Mumbai market were at the forefront of the protest against delisting of fruits and vegetables last year.Earlier this year, the state government had given in-principle nod to allow for elections of directors from gram panchyats in the catchment areas of the wholesale markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the onion and potato traders and commission agents union, said the new body should ensure the directors should know about the functioning of the markets. The committee should be balanced and work without political interference, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

The reading was 2.10 per cent in December 2016.The Reserve Bank, in its monetary policy review this month, had revised downwards retail inflation forecast for the first half of the fiscal.WPI is now based on the new base year 2011-12, which was revised last month from 2004-05, with an aim to reflect the macroeconomic picture more accurately.Government data showed that prices of food articles shrank by 2.27 per cent in May on an yearly basis.The inflation print for vegetables read (-)18.51 per cent.

Balu, president of Vellore Town Nethaji Market Kaikari Vyabarigal Sangam, the prices would continue to be high for at least the next two months.As of now, the production is less. The prices are shooting up as the demand is high as there are muhurtham days this month.

Tomato, carrot and beetroot were priced less when compared to other vegetables, he added.A kilo of tomato was priced at Rs. 15 to Rs. 20, while earlier the previous rate was Rs. 20 to Rs. 22.

Potato prices slipped more than 44% and onion too went down close to 13%.Protein items such as eggs, meat and fish also declined over 1% year-on-year in May. Only cereals in the food basket saw an uptick in prices. Pulses got cheaper.The new figures are based on the base year 2011-12. The base year was revised last month in order to reflect numbers more accurately.There was deflation in the fruit basket to the tune (-)0.73%.Commenting on the WPI based inflation numbers industry body Ficci said, the trend in inflation is in line with the broad expectations - both wholesale and retail prices remain benign. Food inflation has softened considerably over the past couple of months. Further, with global commodity prices remaining subdued and the monsoon this year expected to be normal, inflation should continue to be within RBIs comfort zone.The central bank has revised downwards its own projection for inflation in the months ahead. I think the case for supporting growth is getting stronger and we hope that RBI will take a relook into its monetary policy stance in the light of these new numbers. We need to boost investments and growth, which is so essential for employment generation across the economy."

In all five instances, the families of those who killed themselves said the farmers were under heavy debt - from government institutions and private money lenders. Two of the suicides have happened in Kanpur district, and one each in Mahoba, Banda and Kaushambhi. The government has ordered inquiries into the suicides.The spate of suicides come after the state's BJP government, led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, waived off loans to the tune of Rs 35,000 crores in April. The waiver was part of the BJP's promises in the run-up to the state assembly elections. However, there is confusion among farmers over which loans are covered by the scheme, and which are not.""This government does not have a framework. They did not say whether there would be a limit or a condition to the waiver"", said Samajwadi Party's Basudev Yadav, who was sent by former Chief Minister Akhilesh Yadav to visit the Dwivedi family in Kaushambhi.The state's deputy chief minister Keshav Prasad Maurya hit back at the Samajwadi Party.""SP is doing vendetta politics. We are committed towards working for the farmers and the loan was waived in the first cabinet meeting,"" the minister said.At Kaushambhi's Bakhtiyara village, 60-year-old Ram Babu Dwivedi committed suicide on Wednesday morning. The potato farmer recently received a loan recovery notice from a local cooperative. He had accumulated over seven lakh rupees as loan from government banks and crop worth 300 quintal rotted away in his fields.""I used to ask him about the loans but he would always say that he would take care of it,"" said Devendra, Ram Babu's son.Yesterday, a farmer in Kanpur, Shiv Kumar, died at a Kanpur hospital. He had consumed pesticide three days ago.His family has said Mr Kumar had lost money on a substandard crop after taking a loan of a loan of 70,000 rupees. His meagre earnings supported his wife, and four young daughters.""In his condition, 60 - 70 thousand rupees was no less than 6-7 lakh rupees,"" said his younger brother Ravi Shankar, also a farmer.Neighbouring Madhya Pradesh has been witnessing violent protests by farmers who are demanding loan waivers and better prices for their crops. The protests abated this week after the government announced some relief this week and paid a compensation of Rs 1 crore to the families of each of the six farmers killed in Mandsaur on June 6. Prohibitory orders have been lifted from Ratlam today - a day after they were lifted from the epicentre of the protests in Mandsaur."

Most of these farmers claimed to be followers of Brahmeshwar Singh or Mukhiya, who headed the banned, upper caste militia Ranvir Sena in the state.""The condition of farmers in Bihar is quite bad and soon there would be cases of farmers' suicide in Bihar as well, if the government won't act. We blame Nitish Kumar as well as Narendra Modi for our plight as both are doing nothing to help us financially and in other ways. Both are thugs,"" said Vivek Sharma, state convenor of the farmers' body staging the dharna.The agitating farmers also took a dig at Nitish for organising Kisan Samagam programme at S K Memorial by ignoring their plight. ""Who organises meeting with farmers in AC hall? While we have to sell our farms due to financial crisis, the CM invites select farmers to his programme. Such programmes are just aimed at deceiving the common people and ignoring serious issues,"" said Awadhesh Nandan Sharma , district president of the farmers' outfit.Earlier this week, Nitish had slammed the Narendra Modi-led NDA government at the Centre for its failure to resolve the nationwide farmers' protest. ""Farmers are in a bad condition, but the central government is indifferent to them. The government's failure to enforce MSP for farm produces has forced the farmers to protest. The country has been facing an agrarian crisis due to the low price of farm produces,"" Nitish had said on the sidelines of his Lok Samvad programme on Monday.In Friday's protest, the farmers demanded minimum support price of Rs 50 per litre for milk, Rs 100 per kilogram for pulses, Rs 3,000 per quintal for paddy and Rs 4,000 per quintal for wheat.""RJD chief Lalu Prasad never fails to term himself garibo ka neta, but he never supports milkmen, his traditional vote base,"" said Vivek."

Express Photo by A Aggarwal Farmers block the NH-1 (GT Road) at Ambala Cantt Friday. Express Photo by A AggarwalAFTER BLOCKING national highways for two to three hours in Haryana on Friday, farmers have threatened to gherao New Delhi with tractor trolleys if their demands for loan waiver and profitable prices were not met.It may happen that a bigger agitation can be announced. We can go for an indefinite jam of roads, gherao of Delhi with tractor-trolleys and jail bharo agitation, said Gurnam Singh Chaduni, president of Bhartiya Kisan Union, Haryana, while addressing hundreds of farmers, who had blocked the National Highway-1, which connects New Delhi with Chandigarh, near Ambala.As part of the call for nationwide agitation on Friday, the farmers blocked national highways in different parts of Haryana apart from blockage of roads at four other places. And, to avoid confrontation with the farmers, police did not stop them from blocking roads, making it a smooth affair for the agitators. The authorities, though, diverted traffic routes to avoid long jams on the national highways.We had coordinated even with the authorities of Patiala, Karnal and Panchkula to divert routes of heavy vehicles far way from Ambala, said Prabhjot Singh, Deputy Commissioner, Ambala, who kept monitoring security arrangements for hours when the farmers were sitting on the national highway. Despite that, there was a near traffic jam in Ambala when traffic was not being allowed on the national highway because of the farmers stir. The farmers also blocked National Highway 71A which connects Panipat-Rohtak near village Rukhi (Sonepat) with another highway, which connects Chandigarh and Hisar, near Barwala town. Haryana DGP BS Sandhu said the agitation was completely peaceful throughout the state.A senior officer said Chief Minister Manohar Lal Khattar was taking feedback about the agitation from the district authorities every five minutes. In support of farmers, former CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda held a panchayat at Pipli (Kurukshetra) while INLD held protests at district headquarters in support of the agitating farmers.Farmers, who had reached the protest site in Ambala district on their tractor-trolleys, were perturbed over the manner in which their crops were not purchased at reasonable prices. Harbhajan Singh (52), a farmer from Nalvi village in Kurukshetra, said, We opted for sunflower and potato hoping good prices as the government keeps stressing on crop diversification. But, lack of appropriate arrangement for better procurement dashed our hopes.Explaining in depth, Jogender Singh, an owner of five acres of land at Mamumajra village in Kurukshetra, said, Last year, we had paddy but we were offered Rs 200 per quintal less than the minimum support price for it. Then, we opted for potatoes but we were offered just Rs 1 per kg in the market while its production cost was Rs 7 per kg. Now, the government has announced Rs 3,950 per quintal MSP of sunflower. But, the government says it will buy only 25 per cent of the production of farmers at the rate of MSP. Where can we sell our rest of the crop now?Another sunflower farmer, Rajbir Singh, who has 4.5 acres of land, said, The government is ready to buy only 25 per cent of the sunflower crops at MSP and to sell rest of the crop, the farmers have to depend on traders, who offer only Rs 2,500 per quintal for this crop in the open market.Echoing similar sentiments, farmer Jasbir Singh said, If we sell the sunflower crop at the rate of Rs 2,500 per quintal, then we will be able to meet just our expenditure and there would not be any saving for us.Chaduni said, We will hold a panchayat in Shahbad on Saturday to demand MSP for the entire crop of sunflower.Haryana police, meanwhile, have filed FIRs against hundreds of farmers in connection with the blockage of roads by them in different parts of the state on Friday. The police in Rohtak district have filed two FIRs in connection with the blocking of highways  Rohtak-Panipat and Rohtak-Jind. Rohtak SP Pankaj Nain said 42 farmers have been named from about 120 others in two cases lodged in this connection.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Few are comfortable with track pants or the stretchable joggers or shorts. A runners group in south Bengaluru has therefore come up with an interesting solution  run in whatever, even sarees, just get running.Jayanagar Jaguars or JJ is one of the oldest running groups in the city has been organising various fitness events, such as marathons and workshops here. Started about nine years ago, this group has evolved and grown into one of the largest running groups. The motto of the group is fitness is fun.Their next event, titled Breaking Stereotypes, allows a fun saree/ traditional attire run for women to overcome social discomfort in embracing fitness.Anjana Mohan, the organiser, says, What stops a woman who wants to run is two things. One is that they consider taking time off for themselves as a luxury. And second is they dont think fitness is necessary. She wants women to realise that fitness is a necessity not a luxury.JJ has held many workshops and orientation programmes to bust myths around womens fitness. They discuss food and exercises during their sessions.Periods and thigh chaffing too keep women off running. JJs organises workshops to address these issues, says Anjana.The JJs have tied up with the Sports Authority of India.The Olympic team runners have been a part of their earlier events and encouraged the cause. Coach Pramod Deshpande, who trains the JJs emphatically adds, Everybody can run. Women make more enduring runners than men.Got familys backingVani Rajendra started running about a year and half ago. She runs with her daughter Preksha. I and my daughter run together. My mom who is 73 years old will be joining us for the next event. If you have to run your house, you have to run to keep yourself fit, says Vani.Most women do not take up running as they are not comfortable wearing the runners gear. Because of the outfits, many women dont take to running, unlike other forms of exercise, adds Anjana.Jayashree Mudaliar, who started running two years ago says,Most women use their social obligations as an excuse. I have been a couch potato all my life and took to running just two years ago. I wanted to get some time for myself. When asked about her familys opinion about her participation in marathons she says,My husband was always supportive, my 13-year-old son is super proud that I can run faster than him and play football with him.Shesin, another runner who has participated in many other saree runs, says, We were just seven to eight members when we started running and now its great to see 62 women who will be running in saree and salwar.Anjana says, One woman who said she cannot get permission to run is now running ultra marathons.

These efforts have included hectic parleys with the Swiss authorities.With its long-standing banking secrecy walls crumbling under global pressure, Switzerland has finally agreed to share tax information on automatic basis with several countries including India, but wants adherence to strict data protection and privacy requirements.Officials from the Switzerland government and leading groupings of Swiss banks told PTI that data protection and a level playing field need to be ensured by India and other jurisdictions with whom the AEOI regime would be implemented.The Association of Swiss Private Banks said the main concerns with respect to AEOI relate to data protection and level playing field.""We would like to ensure that bank data that will be transmitted in 2019 is used for tax verification purposes only... if data received from another country has been misused in a jurisdiction, Switzerland is unlikely to send data to that jurisdiction,"" the grouping's manager Jan Langlo told PTI from Geneva.The Geneva-based association has nine member banks employing around 7,500 people worldwide, as per its website.On whether there are any particular concerns related to India with respect to privacy and protection of data, Lango replied in the negative.""We have no particular concern over India, where the rule of law seems to be properly upheld,"" Lango added.Further, the association said that since Switzerland would start exchanging data one year later than most other countries, the banks would be able to verify that the other financial centres also exchange with India and the 40 other jurisdictions.A Swiss government official said that if states do not meet certain requirements of the standard, then the Federal Council would suspend AEOI.While emphasising that banks agreed to the plan of the government, SIF (State Secretariat for International Financial Matters) spokesperson Frank Wettstein from Berne said banks there only had concerns about the way the AEOI is activated and wanted to do so only only with jurisdictions that are sure to fulfil the requirements of the standard.""The Swiss authorities will make sure that the partner states meet the requirements of the standard. If not, the Federal Council will suspend the AEOI according to the MCAA,"" Wettstein told PTI.The exchange of information would be based on the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on AEOI, which is in turn based on the international standard for the exchange of information developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Asserting that the banks in Switzerland are fully committed to implement AEOI, Swiss Bankers' Association (SBA) said the banks have suggested a specific clause for data protection, security and to guarantee a level playing field in terms of competitiveness.SBA's Head of Public Relations Sindy Schmiegel told PTI from Basel that for reasons of data protection and data security and to guarantee a level playing field in terms of competitiveness, the banks have suggested a specific clause which demands that the federal council verifies that these two factors are considered.""This clause will be integrated in Swiss legal provisions to implement the AEOI. India is one of many other countries and not addressed in particular,"" Schmiegel said.SBA has around 296 institutional members and thousands of individual members.The Swiss Federal Council would soon notify India about the exact date from which the automatic exchange would begin.Besides, the council would prepare a situation report before the first exchange of data with India and other jurisdictions.The Association of Swiss Private Banks is also in ""close contact"" with Swiss authorities to better understand how the standard must be implemented and to ensure consistency with the other financial centres.""Of particular concern is the reluctance of the United States to apply the OECD standard, since their FATCA agreements provide other countries with far less information,"" Lango noted.The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is aimed at ensuring that details of financial assets of American citizens are available to the US authorities."

Though potato dealers are not sure about the exact GST, which will imposed, they apprehend that it could be between 20%-28%. Nijjar said presently there was no VAT or duty on farm machinery, but they apprehend that the government could impose 28% GST on farm implements used for potato cultivation.Stating that presently there was nil duty on agriculture implements, Nijjar said that if the tax structure of GST was not corrected it could destroy the future of lakhs of people directly and indirectly involved in the potato industry.""First it was demonetization that took a toll on the farmers and dealers, and now the GST,"" said J P Singh Gill , another office-bearer of JPGA. He said that in Punjab more than 25 lakh tonnes of potato seed was used annually, especially in Jalandhar, Nawanshahr, Hoshiarpur, Kapurthala and a few districts of Malwa ""It's strange that the government gives 25% subsidy on setting up cold chain, cold storage and tissue culture labs but it has proposed to levy 28% GST,"" said Gill.

5a0601119855b76bf13c2c23,Drought  low yield drive vegetable prices up by 40%,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/drought-low-yield-drive-vegetable-prices-up-by-40/article19097340.ece,2017-06-18,"Drought across the State and low yield in neighbouring districts of Chennai have hit the supply of vegetables to the citys wholesale market at Koyambedu. The prices of several vegetables have spiralled this month, as a result. Even a bunch of mint and coriander leaves costs Rs. 40 due to the severe water crisis in places in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka where the plants are grown.Traders at the Koyambedu market said the market now receives only up to 250 truck loads of vegetables daily compared to the usual 350-400 trucks. S. Chandran, president, Koyambedu Market Licensed Merchants Association, said several vegetables are now at least 40% costlier than last month. Usually, the prices of vegetables that escalate during summer begin to drop from mid-June. But, as the drought situation continues across the State and also in neighbouring States, vegetables may remain expensive till July, he said.Onion, tomato and potato are the only vegetables that are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 25 per kg. Cabbage and snake gourd are also being preferred more by some customers as they are priced at Rs. 20-Rs. 30 a kg in the wholesale market. Several customers have cut down on their volume of purchase. Beans and carrots are expensive.Low yieldP.Sukumar, joint secretary, Koyambedu Vegetables, Fruits and Flower Merchants Welfare Association, said: Even the locally grown green chillies and brinjals are priced high this month as the yield is less across the State. Vegetable prices have been increasing for three months. But Ramzan has helped to keep sales up, he said."
5a05fe7b9855b76bf13c2ab8,Adulteration provides food for thought,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-tamilnadu/adulteration-provides-food-for-thought/article19097316.ece,2017-06-18,"Last week, the city witnessed a video of MTC staff purporting to show plastic rice being served in their canteen. The clip, showing men in khaki bouncing small balls of rice off the walls and tables at the canteen of the Ayanavaram bus depot, spread like wildfire on social media. The footage also came close on the heels of information shared on WhatsApp regarding the seizure of alleged plastic rice in other parts of the country.In a State where its own Dairy Development Minister came out with the shocking allegation that private milk producers were adding chemicals to their products, similar claims pertaining to adulteration of rice with plastic seemed ever more probable. So, is there really plastic in rice and sugar, and are there chemicals in milk? Could eggs be made of plastic? Was there any truth to the messages circulating on WhatsApp or were they merely old wives tales that no one in the position of authority was prepared to debunk?As one scare story after another finds prominence through social media platforms, questions are asked, and sometimes answered, with knee-jerk reactions. As adulteration has long remained a tool of choice for unscrupulous traders looking to make a quick buck, only the adulterants have varied with time. Consumer activists point to the need for a proper system capable of answering these questions in a scientific manner, and wherever necessary, allaying rumours and suspicions about food safety that arise periodically among the public.The term plastic rice came into being after a scandal was exposed in China in 2010, in which pellets were made by mixing sweet potato powder with poor quality rice. A resin was found to have been used for the bonding. But this was banned.But in India, although there have been several complaints and allegations of rice being mixed with plastic, tests conducted on so-called plastic rice have conclusively proved that there had been no plastic element in such rice samples, said A. C. Mohan, secretary, Federation of Tamil Nadu Rice Mill Owners and Paddy-Rice Dealers Associations.As regards the clips showing rice balls being bounced off the walls, Mr. Mohan said that gelatine, which is found naturally in rice, could make it bouncy if rolled into balls. Boiled rice has more of gelatine, which retains more of its germinal matter. While raw rice varieties including Basmati are not sticky, varieties grown in Tamil Nadu such as Ponni , ADT 36 and Adhisiya Ponni are more sticky than the usual boiled rice. Rubber samba and Maappilai samba are rare varieties that have even more starch and gelatin and are suitable to make kall dosai . These varieties take longer to grow (in some cases six months) and are more healthy, he explained.Federation president D. Thulasingam said that rice merchants were also consumers in the first place, and that they will not sell such adulterated products. Various government agencies had taken samples and conducted tests but so far, no plastic has been found in rice anywhere in the country. Plastic cannot be cooked, it will only melt in the heat. Rice will sink in water, whereas plastic will float. Any home-maker can differentiate between boiled and raw rice by mere feel, smell and sight, he said.It also does not make economic sense to mix plastic with rice, he said. Plastic pellets available in the market are costlier than rice. A kilo of plastic costs anywhere between Rs. 80 and Rs. 100, whereas rice costs Rs. 30-Rs. 60 a kilo. How can someone use a costlier item to make something cheaper? Also, we have at least six months worth of stocks of rice and there is no need for importing rice, let alone plastic rice, Mr. Thulasingam added.R. Kathiravan, designated officer, Food Safety department, Chennai, said that 20 samples of rice were collected and sent for analysis. While 16 of them were sent to the food analysis lab at the King Institute campus in Chennai, four samples were sent to a lab in Thanjavur . Of the 15 results received till date, there has been no evidence of any plastic content in the rice in Chennai, he said.Chemicals in milkUntil a few days ago, milk vendors too had to ward off such queries from consumers after State Dairy Development Minister K.T. Rajenthra Bhalaji levelled allegations against certain private milk brands, saying they were adding chemicals to milk.In the wake of the controversy, district administrations stepped in at places such as Madurai and Coimbatore and tested milk samples submitted by the residents. In Madurai, the electronic milk adulteration tests showed that out of 217 samples taken on three different dates in the city and two other locations in the suburbs, 25 samples were found to be of sub-standard quality, while another was found to be unsafe for consumption. District Collector K. Veera Raghava Rao said that awareness was high among rural people as well.Maheswari of Jawahar Nagar, Thirumangalam, in Madurai, said she purchased milk from a vendor who supplied it in quantities of 100 ml and 150 ml. Since it was not branded, we decided to provide a sample of it for testing and found that it was safe to consume, she added.Madurai-based consumer activist Andrews pointed out that the government officials carried out tests only after the Minister for Dairy Development raised the issue of adulteration, adding that such tests should be conducted on a regular basis. Not just milk, the officials should also carry out periodic tests on all items including oil and rice as there have been complaints of sub-standard goods coming in, he added.Adulteration of milk is being monitored on a monthly basis, said a senior Food Safety department official. Of the samples we collected, only one from Madurai was found to be unsafe, as soap oil had been mixed with it. With regard to the other samples, some were found to be sub-standard  containing water, for instance, in milk, but they were not unsafe in terms of health, he said. While sub-standard milk can attract a penalty, unsafe milk can lead to a case in court, a fine and imprisonment, he noted.A milk industry expert said that so far, in samples lifted by the Food Safety department, only samples of unpackaged milk have been found to contain traces of detergent or soap oil.The soap element may have even been due to improper cleansing of utensils at homes. Private milk producers know that their customers are brand-conscious and loyal to their brands due to certain factors, the most important being quality. At times, when it comes to favoured brands, consumers wont even bother about the cost. Companies will not compromise on quality and end up losing the loyalty of such consumers, he said.However, the Milk Commissionerate has stopped taking samples of milk ever since the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) stepped in and began collecting samples.Plastic eggs scareIn the wake of the recent plastic eggs scare, acting on a State-wide directive and complaints from consumers, checks were conducted on eggs in Coimbatore district. All of the 161 samples collected in April this year were found to be safe. Samples of popular White Leghorn were tested at the government laboratory in Madurai, said O.L.S. Vijay, designated officer, FSSAI, Coimbatore.Adulteration not newWith plastics and chemicals prevalent in pretty much everything we use, the adulteration scare is here to stay. In the 1980s food adulteration was something that people had just begun hearing about  it used to mean stones in rice, water in milk, sawdust in tea and brick powder in chilli powder. But all that is pass now.Adulteration has taken on a new avatar. It now comes in the form of non-permitted colours being added to snacks like bhajji and pakoda sold on the roadsides, maida bleached with chemicals, oil-soluble red colour added to chilli powder and cheap palm oil mixed with other cooking oils to reduce the price, says G. Santhanarajan of the Consumer Association of India (CAI).Even the word adulteration is not to be found in the Food Safety and Standards Act. The Act talks about safe foods, sub-standard and unsafe foods. You can simply pay a fine and get off the hook unless the product is deemed unsafe. We now have to be afraid of plastics, especially those that come in the form of food packaging. Packing hot food items in plastic bags is bad for health as the heat causes the plastic to react. Everything from oil to water to pulses that we buy comes in plastic packs. But since nobody has time for anything, people dont even bother to carry their own bags to department stores to avoid plastic bags, he rued.Enforcement failureAfter the Food Safety and Standards Act came into force, though a separate set-up came into being to check food standards, the very same officials of various local bodies have been implementing the norms. Consumer activists feel that the department is failing at enforcement.Nirmala Desikan, chairman and managing trustee, CAI, said that the new Act was a detailed and more comprehensive one than the one that it replaced. There are so many things that are adulterated, but the problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rules. We also dont know how many complaints it (Food Safety department) receives or how many are dealt with. The department is not transparent, she said.Food Safety officials have refused to provide the exact data on adulteration of milk in the State to The Hindu . Only rough figures of complaints and samples collected were provided. Each laboratory gets around 500 samples a month. Just 100 samples are collected from milk products, said a source.Many residents have registered complaints with the Food Safety department through its WhatsApp number 9444042322. We will increase random sampling to study the trends. The analysis is done in three days. Samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints, said an official.But activist T. Sadagopan is far less optimistic. The very few checks that are done hardy matter since very few people are penalised. And those who adulterate will continue to do so. For the consumer, this would only mean unchecked adulteration leading to an adverse impact on their health.( With inputs from Aloysius Xavier Lopez and Zubeda Hamid in Chennai, L. Srikrishna in Madurai and Wilson Thomas in Coimbatore)Food samples are collected within 24 hours of receipt of complaints.Food safety officialThe problem is that they (officials) are not strong enough in implementing the rulesNirmala DesikanConsumer Association of India"
5a0467ff9855b76bf13bd378,Are we robbing our streets of their charm and identity?,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/mumbai/are-we-robbing-our-streets-of-their-charm-and-identity/articleshow/59209300.cms,2017-06-18,"The streets have invaded the restaurants. Chinese bhel, vada pav sliders, pav bhaji fondue, college van spring rolls, bread pakoda with teriyaki glaze and potato sphere galangal chaat  these are just a few of the menu options that we are likely to find today. The new kind of Indian eatery seems to revel in a playful take on the foods that the streets have made famous.It is perhaps just a passing fad, a new distraction that will enthrall us for a while before quietly expiring. Or it could be a sign that we are beginning to integrate our influences with a new confidence. Think of it as a double subversion  with our primary allegiance being to our taste buds. We pick and choose the best parts of all our options and mash it together without embarrassment.Fusion food extracts the street from our lives and relocates it in an exotic form of play.However, it seems quite clear that the street is beginning to recede from our lives, particularly in our larger cities. Not just in terms of food, but even as an essential part of our experience of urban living, the street is no longer as central to large cities. The coming of malls, the growing incidence of gated communities where 'the hawker menace' is controlled, the rise in personal vehicle ownership, and our new imagination of what public spaces should look and feel like are some of the reasons why this is happening.A recent visit to Karol Bagh, one of Delhi's premier markets, was a deeply dispiriting experience. The once bustling streets carry more memory than energy. And this is true of many other traditional bazaars in the larger cities, which have begun to sag with a lack of self-belief, even as the modern malls bazaarify.A sanitised form of the street and bazaar is being made available to us. We can sit in fancy restaurants and eat a cool version of a street food instead of standing in a street rubbing elbows with strangers or while sitting in a 'sweet shop' and devouring samosas and chutney with a battered steel spoon. We cannot escape the street, for it stirs our blood like nothing else can, but we can tame it.To be sure, some traditional street spots become nostalgic monuments, must-dos on a list of a city's hot spots. This is an exaggerated homage to the past, a very conscious act of consuming with great care a replica of a cherished experience. Every city has its appointed places of pilgrimage, but this is no longer a natural way of life. We now act as tourists in our own home, as we look upon these as artifacts to be marveled at.Nothing underlines the drying up of cities as much as the gradual decline in the number of neighbourhood street vendors. The neighbourhood hawkers, advertising their merchandise or services with a distinctive aural signature are harder to come by. Of the range of services available at one's doorstep which included the locksmith, cobbler, knife sharpener, raddi wala, kalai wala (re-tinner of brass utensils), pillow and mattress fluffer, carpet seller, vegetable and fruit wala, among many others, only a few survive.The street vendors were the rivers of a city, flowing with services and merchandise. Seasons came to us through these daily messengers of merchandise. They brought to our lives flavours from the city and beyond, and made us all citizens bound in trade. They represented the aggregate collective memory and stored wisdom of the city, a moving map of its desires and tastes. As a fluid, fluent, time and market-tested chronicle of a city, street vending operated as an organic document of a lived reality.A city starts dying when its streets lose meaning. It becomes a shell of functionality, a discrete collection of commercial and residential quarters without any dialogue between its parts. In effect the city secedes from itself in little islets, choosing to trade its specific character for a homogenous form of modernity. It now belongs to its users, who reconfigure it according to their needs rather than to its residents who worked with and added to what the city had to offer. It disowns what got it here and borrows a destination that it envies. The past, other people, other modes of living become unfamiliar exotic objects to be briefly cooed at admiringly but otherwise to be pushed away to the periphery. The balance between the old and the new, the raw and the ordered, the artisanal and the manufactured, the small and the large, the real and the simulatedthis is what will determine the true health of a city. The city must gather its past, and all the people and the ideas that have made it what it is, and integrate this into its vision for the future. The street which is the city's most accomplished theatre of change, needs to be a central part of a city's future."

Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.Farmers agitations are spreading across many states. It is the culmination of the acute distress in the farm sector that many observers have written and spoken about in the last two years. Two years of drought in many states was the main cause. The governments cannot be blamed for the occurrence of drought, but governments are solely responsible for the mismanagement of the consequences of drought. Apart from the natural calamity of drought, there were man-made calamities, and this column is about how the two have brought about the explosive situation in the country.The bulk of farmers in India have no choice but to do farming. Land is the only asset they have, farming is the only skill they possess, and unless they grow food many of them will face starvation. Agriculture, despite its declining share in total output (GDP), is also the largest employer. In Indias economy, the agriculture sector has primacy.The Price of NeglectUnfortunately, the NDA government lost sight of this basic truth. The agriculture portfolio is the Cinderella of this government. The Minister of Agriculture, unchanged since May 2014, is a political lightweight with little clout within the government. (How many of you can name Mr Sharad Pawars successor?). The minister has been neither seen nor heard by most people. The only memorable statement on agriculture that I can recall was when he repeated the Prime Ministers promise to double farmers income in 6 years and when asked if they had meant real income or nominal income, there was deafening silence.On the other hand, the government erred grievously on the issue of minimum support prices (MSP). In its manifesto and in the election campaign, the BJP had unequivocally promised that it would implement the M S Swaminathan Committees recommendation that MSP should be cost plus 50 per cent. In government, the BJP not only reneged on its promise, it dealt a body blow to farmers by denying them even a reasonable increase in MSP in its first three years. The numbers speak for themselves:The ostensible reason for denying a fair MSP was that higher MSP fueled inflation, which is partly true, but to lean in favour of inflation control against the interest of Indias farmer-producers was the height of folly. Some inflation is inevitable, and the government and the RBI must use other instruments to moderate inflation rather than reduce the farming community to penury.Errors galoreThe second grave error was demonetisation. Mr Harish Damodaran has convincingly demonstrated how demonetisation has crippled the post-harvest agricultural economy (see The Crops of Wrath, Indian Express, June 12, 2017). Agricultural products are bought and sold largely in cash. Demonetisation dried up liquidity and prices have crashed. According to Mr Damodaran, never before have prices of tomato, potato and onion crashed at the same time. Same is the situation with soyabean, arhar, garlic, methi (fenugreek) and grapes. Saying that farmers have resorted to fire sales, Mr Damodarans conclusion is, We have entered deflation territory in farm produce, whose proximate trigger clearly has been demonetisation.The third error was when the Prime Minister announced, on behalf of the yet-to-be-elected Uttar Pradesh government, that all farm loans in UP will be waived if the BJP formed the government. More likely, it was just an election promise in a state that the BJP perhaps did not expect to win, but it was an unequivocal promise that has returned to haunt the BJP in several states. Farm loan waivers are neither intrinsically good nor bad. As Dr M S Swaminathan said a few days ago, Loan waivers, though temporarily necessary, do not provide for a secure long term credit system (emphasis supplied). When farmers do not get a fair and reasonable price and are unable to repay their loans, they demand a loan waiver. The holder of the highest political office promised a total loan waiver, why blame the farmers for demanding that the promise be implemented?In February 2008, the fiscal situation was excellent, growth had found a new momentum, and a one-time loan forgiveness to small and medium farmers was justified. The central government was confident it could fund the waiver and so it went ahead and announced it. In 2017, however, every prudent norm was turned on its head. The Prime Minister promised a loan waiver on behalf of an yet-to-be-elected state government, no one seems to have examined the capacity of UP to bear the burden, and no one seems to have factored the fallout in other states. Having mounted a tiger, the BJP does not know how to dismount it. Meanwhile, the tiger is galloping through Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Haryana, Maharashtra and Gujarat.Jobless youth angryThe last straw was jobless growth. Young men can find no work on farms or off farms. Micro, small and medium businesses are not offering new jobs. Tier 2, 3 and 4 towns are full of jobless youth and their anger has turned against the central government. The BJP will not admit its mistakes. Nor will any BJP leader tell the Prime Minister that mistakes were made. Will the Prime Minister pull a rabbit out of the hat?

5a05169b9855b76bf13bf9e6,Farm protest rages across India,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/617965/farm-protest-rages-across-india.html,2017-06-18,"Devinder Sharma, Jun 18 2017, 1:06 ISTAgrarian crisis: Only a holistic, pragmatic policy can end the tragedy unfolding in rural areas since decadesFarmers anger is spilling over. The violent agitation that erupted in the Malwa belt of Madhya Pradesh, resulting in the death of five farmers in police firing, has now spread to Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Chhattisgarh. The demand for farm loan waiver, accompanied by higher crop prices, is now gaining momentum.More than 3.18 lakh farmers have committed suicide in the past 21 years. Every 41 minutes a farmer commits suicide in the country. While I agree that farmer suicides are a symptom of a bigger malaise that afflicts agriculture, policymakers have failed to take the massive death toll as a sign of terrible economic depravity that plagued the rural landscape. How long could we expect farmers to take the hit silently? It had to happen one day, and no one knew what will trigger it.For nearly three decades, more so after the economic reforms were ushered in, agriculture has been a victim of neglect and apathy. Following the World Banks prescription of moving 400 million people from the rural to the urban areas by the year 2015, successive governments deliberately created conditions to turn farming unviable, thereby forcing an increasing number of farmers to abandon agriculture and migrate to cities. To keep food inflation under control, farmers have been routinely paid less, not even to cover the cost of production, thereby driving them against the wall.With each passing year, the crisis worsened. The 2016 Economic Survey tells us that the average annual income of a farming family in 17 states, roughly half the country, is a mere Rs 20,000 or less than Rs 1,700 a month. Such a dismal income, merely enough for subsistence, was the outcome of economic policies over the years. I shudder to think how these farming families must be surviving all these years. After all, it is not even possible to rear a cow in less than Rs 1,700 a month.But I doubt if such details mean anything to mainline economists and policymakers. With the markets crashing after every harvest, and with the government reluctant to save farmers by ensuring that they get at least the Minimum Support Price (MSP), farmers are pushed deeper and deeper into a never-ending cycle of debt. Even the MSP is often less than the cost of production. In Maharashtra, the production cost of tur dal has been worked out at Rs 6,240 per quintal. The MSP was Rs 5,050 per quintal, but the price at which farmers were able to sell tur, and that too after waiting for nearly a week in the mandis, was between Rs 3,500 and Rs 4,200 per quintal.Take another case. A farmer in Haryana toils hard for three months, putting all his labour to reap a bountiful harvest of potato only to find the prices crashing, thereby forcing him to sell 40 quintals of potato for just 9 paise a kg. The shock often turns fatal. But the fact remains that the government has rarely come to his rescue. Compare this with the fall in stock markets, and the finance minister promises to monitor the crisis on an hourly basis, holding a press conference to assuage the investors. Have we ever seen the finance minister or the agriculture minister monitoring the deplorable condition when farm prices crash?The poor farmer has been left to live in indebtedness, which keeps multiplying with every passing year. The crisis is compounded by the denial of a rightful income to farmers for their produce. To keep food inflation under control, it is the farmers who have paid the price. In reality, it is the farmers who have been subsidising the nation all these years. Successive governments have therefore deliberately kept agriculture impoverished. An estimated 58% of the farmers go to bed hungry every night.After Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath announced a farm loan waiver worth Rs 36,359 crore, which will benefit 92 lakh small and marginal farmers, Maharashtra announced a loan waiver worth Rs 30,500 crore. Punjab is expected to take over at least Rs 30,000 crore of the bad loans. Though I am not in favour of loan waivers but in a deplorable situation that agriculture has been pushed into, a waiver is a short-term relief.It is an emergency measure to bail out millions of small and marginal farmers in distress. IndiaSpend estimates a total of Rs 3.1 lakh crore of farm loan that needs to be waived. This is still far less than the Rs 4 lakh crore bailout package that the telecom industry alone is seeking. Another Rs 1.7 lakh crore of bad debt is what the steel industry hopes will be written off.Holistic approachLoan waiver must be followed by policies that ensure loans dont pile up again. A tinkering here and there is not going to address the crisis. It needs a holistic approach and a paradigm shift in economic thinking.To begin with:The effort should be to make farming economically viable.The Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices, which works out the MSP for crops, should be directed to factor in four allowances being paid to farmers  house allowance, medical allowance, educational allowance and travel allowance. So far, MSP only covers the cost of production. Government employees get a total of 108 allowances.Since MSP benefits only 6% of the farmers, it needs to be understood that the demand for providing 50% profit over MSP will benefit only these 6% farmers. For the remaining, who are dependent on the exploitative markets, the need is to set up a National Farmers Income Commission, with the mandate to provide a minimum assured monthly income package of Rs 18,000 per farmer family.Public sector investments must come in urgently for constructing Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee mandis and also for storage godowns. At present, there are only 7,700 APMC mandis. What India needs is 42,000 mandis for every 5 km radius. And like in Brazil, where it is mandatory for a market yard to procure anything a farmer brings, APMC mandis should be equipped to do the same.(The writer is a commentator on issues relating to farmers and agriculture)"

Reuters File PhotoIndia will have to ensure strict confidentiality of information about its citizens' Swiss bank accounts received through the new automatic exchange window, failing which the Alpine nation will stop sharing the data.Switzerland and its banks will also keep a close watch on the data protection measures taken by India regarding the details received from other jurisdictions and want all other global financial centres to implement the global framework for automatic exchange of information (AEOI) on financial matters.On Friday, the Swiss Federal Council ratified the AEOI with India and 40 other jurisdictions to facilitate immediate sharing of details about suspected black money.The pact with India would not be subject to referendum and is planned for implementation in 2018, with the first set of data to be exchanged in 2019.Bankers in Switzerland said this rollout plan will give them enough time to study the implementation by other global financial centres and the adherence to confidentiality and data protection requirements by India and other recipients.They also clarified this exercise would be followed not just for India, but all countries with which Switzerland will share banking information under the automatic route.Switzerland competes with Singapore, Dubai, Hong Kong, London and New York among the major global financial hubs.Black money issue has been a political hot potato for long and the Indian government has stepped up its efforts in recent years to clamp down on this menace. These efforts have included hectic parleys with the Swiss authorities.With its long-standing banking secrecy walls crumbling in under global pressure, Switzerland has finally agreed to share tax information on automatic basis with several countries including India, but wants adherence to strict data protection and privacy requirements.Officials from the Switzerland government and leading groupings of Swiss banks told PTI that data protection and a level playing field need to be ensured by India and other jurisdictions with whom the AEOI regime would be implemented.The Association of Swiss Private Banks said the main concerns with respect to AEOI relate to data protection and level playing field.""We would like to ensure that bank data that will be transmitted in 2019 is used for tax verification purposes only... if data received from another country has been misused in a jurisdiction, Switzerland is unlikely to send data to that jurisdiction,"" the grouping's manager Jan Langlo told PTI from Geneva.The Geneva-based association has nine member banks employing around 7,500 people worldwide, as per its website.On whether there are any particular concerns related to India with respect to privacy and protection of data, Lango replied in the negative.""We have no particular concern over India, where the rule of law seems to be properly upheld,"" Lango added.Further, the association said that since Switzerland would start exchanging data one year later than most other countries, the banks would be able to verify that the other financial centres also exchange with India and the 40 other jurisdictions.A Swiss government official said that if states do not meet certain requirements of the standard, then the Federal Council would suspend AEOI.While emphasising that banks agreed to the plan of the government, SIF (State Secretariat for International Financial Matters) spokesperson Frank Wettstein from Berne said banks there only had concerns about the way the AEOI is activated and wanted to do so only only with jurisdictions that are sure to fulfil the requirements of the standard.""The Swiss authorities will make sure that the partner states meet the requirements of the standard. If not, the Federal Council will suspend the AEOI according to the MCAA,"" Wettstein told PTI.The exchange of information would be based on the Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement (MCAA) on AEOI, which is in turn based on the international standard for the exchange of information developed by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Asserting that the banks in Switzerland are fully committed to implement AEOI, Swiss Bankers' Association (SBA) said the banks have suggested a specific clause for data protection, security and to guarantee a level playing field in terms of competitiveness.SBA's Head of Public Relations Sindy Schmiegel told PTI from Basel that for reasons of data protection and data security and to guarantee a level playing field in terms of competitiveness, the banks have suggested a specific clause which demands that the federal council verifies that these two factors are considered.""This clause will be integrated in Swiss legal provisions to implement the AEOI. India is one of many other countries and not addressed in particular,"" Schmiegel said.SBA has around 296 institutional members and thousands of individual members.The Swiss Federal Council would soon notify India about the exact date from which the automatic exchange would begin.Besides, the council would prepare a situation report before the first exchange of data with India and other jurisdictions.The Association of Swiss Private Banks is also in ""close contact"" with Swiss authorities to better understand how the standard must be implemented and to ensure consistency with the other financial centres.""Of particular concern is the reluctance of the United States to apply the OECD standard, since their FATCA agreements provide other countries with far less information,"" Lango noted.The Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) is aimed at ensuring that details of financial assets of American citizens are available to the US authorities."

And if market labour charges are deducted, their net earning is just 9 paisa per kg. This is not just an allegation by farmers but a fact verified by a Market Committee of the Haryana government. Documents accessed by The Indian Express show that Sukhpal Singh, a resident of village Mangoli (Kurukshetra), sold 43.20 quintal potatoes for Rs 900 at grain market at Pipli on May 25.He paid Rs 520 as labour charges in the grain market for cleaning and unloading of the potatoes. The arthiya (commission agent) paid him just Rs 380, which means he earned just 9 paisa per kg, mentioned the document. The commission agent in this case, Ram Kumar Saini, told The Indian Express there could be many cases like of Sukhpal. Sukhpals potatoes were not good in quality. But even the good potatoes were purchased at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg. This time, there was no demand of potatoes from Bihar. Probably, they (Bihar farmers) had cultivated enough potatoes this year, said Saini.A farmer from village Mamumajra in Kurukshetra, Jasbir Singh, said, I also sold my potatoes for Rs 20 paisa per kg. There was no buyer in the market. In fact, it was an outcome of notebandi. The traders had no money. But ultimately the farmers are being forced to bear the brunt of notebandi. I had cultivated potatoes in 40 acres of land. We were forced to sell even the early variety potatoes at the rate of Rs 1.5 per kg in December and January. I agree potato produce this time was a little high in comparison to the previous year. But where is the government which keeps saying it will facilitate export of potatoes and other products.Why was there no arrangement to export potatoes to Pakistan, Bangladesh or Sri Lanka? questioned Jasbir Singh.Another farmer from the same village, Jogender Singh, said, The potatoes are bought at throwaway prices from farmers. We fail to understand how the same potatoes are sold by rehriwalas to the people in urban areas at the rate of Rs 15 per kg. The cultivation of potatoes proved a business of huge loss this year for farmers as the average production cost of potatoes was Rs 7 per kg, he said. Bhartiya Kisan Unions Haryana unit president Gurnam Singh Chaduni said, The farmers blocked national highways on Friday to demand profitable prices of their crops. Now, we will discuss the next strategy on June 19.Former Haryana CM Bhupinder Singh Hooda, who along with other Congress MLAs met Haryana Governor to seek his intervention to solve problems of farmers on Saturday, said, This is an anti-farmer government. BJP leaders who used to stage half-naked protests to demand implementation of recommendations of Swaminathan Commission report to ensure 50% profit on the cost input of crops are now MLAs and ministers in the Haryana government. But now they have nothing to do with the farmers.However, Haryana Finance Minister Captain Abhimanyu said, Hooda, who is now protesting (for) the report of Swaminathan Commission, should tell the people of the state what he had done regarding this report. He has forgotten how, apart from forced acquisition of the land of farmers, they were offered cheques for Rs 2 or Rs 3 as compensation for losses due to crop damage during his regime, which just served to rub salt into their wounds. Abhimanyu said the present government was taking consistent action on the report of the Swaminathan Commission report, which had been appreciated by Chairman of the Commission, Prof. M S Swaminathan himself.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

We pick and choose the best parts of all our options and mash it together without embarrassment.Fusion food extracts the street from our lives and relocates it in an exotic form of play. The city becomes an affectionate joke, to be consumed with a wink, between taco shells. The menus of these restaurants burst with a particular kind of creativity as our uncapitalised past, our little sins of the tongue, gets a coating of our newly discovered global selves. We sneak in the pleasures we have grown up with into the pleasures we have learned to enjoy.However we read this new burst of creative energy, it seems quite clear that the street is beginning to recede from our lives, particularly in our larger cities. Not just in terms of food, but even as an essential part of our experience of urban living, the street is no longer as central to large cities. The coming of malls, the growing incidence of gated communities where the hawker menace is controlled, the rise in personal vehicle ownership, and our new imagination of what public spaces should look and feel like are some of the reasons why this is happening.A recent visit to Karol Bagh, one of Delhis premier markets, and the place where much of my adolescence was spent, was a deeply dispiriting experience. The once bustling streets carry more memory than energy. There are still shoppers around, but the awareness that this is no longer the place to be infects everyone. And this is true of many other traditional bazaars in the larger cities, which have begun to sag with a lack of self-belief, even as the modern malls bazaarify.A sanitized form of the street and bazaar is being made available to us. We can sit in fancy restaurants and eat a cool version of a street food instead of standing in a street rubbing elbows with strangers or while sitting in a sweet shop and devouring samosas and chutney with a battered steel spoon. We can shop in air-conditioned comfort at a mall, but feel more comfortable if it is noisy, crowded and appears to be filled up. We cannot escape the street, for it stirs our blood like nothing else can, but we can tame it.To be sure, some traditional street spots become nostalgic monuments, must-dos on a list of a citys hot spots. This is an exaggerated homage to the past, a very conscious act of consuming with great care a replica of a cherished experience. Every city has its appointed places of pilgrimage, but this is no longer a natural way of life. We now act as tourists in our own home, as we look upon these as artifacts to be marveled at.Nothing underlines the drying up of cities as much as the gradual decline in the number of neighbourhood street vendors. The neighbourhood hawkers, advertising their merchandise or services with a distinctive aural signature are harder to come by. Of the range of services available at ones doorstep which included the locksmith, cobbler, knife sharpener, raddi wala, kalai-wala (re-tinner of brass utensils), pillow and mattress fluffer, carpet seller, vegetable and fruit walla, among many others, only a few survive. The city rarely comes visiting any more.The street vendors were the rivers of a city, flowing with services and merchandise. Seasons came to us through these daily messengers of merchandise. They brought to our lives flavours from the city and beyond, and made us all citizens bound in trade. They represented the aggregate collective memory and stored wisdom of the city, a moving map of its desires and tastes. As a fluid, fluent, time and market-tested chronicle of a city, street vending operated as an organic document of a lived reality.A city starts dying when its streets lose meaning. It becomes a shell of functionality, a discrete collection of commercial and residential quarters without any dialogue between its parts. In effect the city secedes from itself in little islets, choosing to trade its specific character for a homogenous form of modernity. It now belongs to its users, who reconfigure it according to their needs rather than to its residents who worked with and added to what the city had to offer. It disowns what got it here and borrows a destination that it envies. The past, other people, other modes of living become unfamiliar exotic objects to be briefly cooed at admiringly but otherwise to be pushed away to the periphery.The balance between the old and the new, the raw and the ordered, the artisanal and the manufactured, the small and the large, the real and the simulated- this is what will determine the true health of a city. The city must gather its past, and all the people and the ideas that have made it what it is, and integrate this into its vision for the future. The street which is the citys most accomplished theatre of change, needs to be a central part of a citys future."

Farmers say there is no point selling the produce as they are not even able to get back their investment due to the low price. It is estimated that around 6 crore sacks of 50 kg each, totaling 30 lakh ton, are stored in Agra region alone. State horticulture department has now appealed to farmers not to hoard the tuber. Recently government determined minimum support price for procurement of potato at the rate of Rs 487 per quintal, but farmers said it is too low to benefit them.There are around 240 cold storage units in Agra. All of them are completely filled with potatoes, with farmers refusing to take them out till the prices become better.According to horticulture department officials, In August the potato crop of Karnataka will hit the market. This may result in a sudden fall in the price of the stored potatoes. Therefore farmers in the state have been advised to continue selling the stored produce to avoid even worse losses.Potato is a major crop in the district, cultivated in around 72,000 hectares of land. Agra division, which includes Agra, Firozabad, Mathura and Mainpuri, is one of the major producers of the tuber, which is supplied to states including Maharashtra, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Delhi, Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh.District horticulture officer Anita Singh said, ""The current potato prices are much lower than in previous years. In the near future, there is no significant scope for increase in potato prices. To avoid major losses, farmers should slowly continue to sell their produce. Depending on quality, the present market rate of potato is Rs 300 to 600 per quintal whereas it should be between Rs 800 and Rs 1,000 per quintal.""According to department officials, increased in production of potato and a stop on supply to Pakistan and some other neigbouring countries is one of the reasons behind the drop in prices.Rakesh Goyal, secretary of Agra Cold Storage Association said, ""Compared to previous years, this time around 12% more potato came for storage. But due to low prices, few farmers are taking away their produce.""According to market experts, till June 20 around 25% of the produce should have been sold. But business has witnessed fall of 12%.Khandoli farmer Sharvan Singh said, ""Government has turned farmers into a joke. The minimum support price is not reasonable at all. It doesn't even pay for the investment we made in the crop.""Agra Potato Business Association general secretary Aamir Bhai said, ""Ever since demonetization, business has continued to be derailed. Farmers will be forced to throw their produce on the roads, but the government does not seem to be concerned.""Farmer Gyan Singh Sikarwar said, ""Next year I will not produce potato at any cost. I am thinking of sowing some other crop but that needs money too. I already have a pending loan of Rs 5,000 and banks have told us we will not get further loan till the previous ones are waived by the government."""

The farmers of main crops such as rice, turmeric, millets, bajra and all horticulture crops could manage only 50 % of their regular production this season. This has affected the arrival of vegetables to the farmers shandies and other markets in the district.Due to the steep fall in the arrival, the prices of vegetables have shot up by about 30 % in the shandies, according to official sources.Small onionThe price of small onion remained as high as Rs. 100 per kg in the shandies and also in the open markets.The price of tomato that stood at Rs. 15 last week, rose to Rs. 22 per kg on Friday in the shandies; the price of carrot has gone up to Rs. 72 from Rs. 60 last week.Similarly the price of beans stood at Rs. 70 per kg; brinjal stood at Rs. 36 per kg; ladies finger Rs. 30; chillies Rs. 46; potato Rs. 24; raddish Rs. 25; beans Rs. 70; snake gourd Rs. 28; flat beans Rs. 50; beetroot Rs. 40, and cabbage Rs. 28.However, the price of big onion has registered a downward trend.

Keep lying and mislead people. Make good gimmicks. (They say) Sab ka sath sab ka vikas. Now, it is sab ka sath sab ka satyanash, he said. Aiyar was speaking at a symposium organised by the Telangana Congress on Indian Agriculture  Contribution of Smt Indira Gandhi and a review of present scenario as part of former Prime Minister Indira Gandhis birth centenary celebrations.The minimum support price (MSP) for farmers this year has come down compared to last year, Aiyar claimed. Sixty per cent of Indias population is in agriculture. What is their condition? I will tell you the condition. Indiraji started Minimum Support Price.That means, you (farmer) should get more than this. If that is not available, we will support you. Arhar  MSP is Rs 5,050 per quintal. It is being sold at Rs 2,700, he said. Giving out figures, he claimed that other crops like garlic, onion, potato are also being sold at a price less than last years price.The input costs in agriculture have increased substantially thus offsetting any rise in price for the produce, he said. They say we will get (farmers) income doubled. How will you double? This helpless man goes to market and sees that his expenditure is rising. Somebody told me that there is a 700 per cent rise in expenditure of inputs compared to 1991, Aiyar said.Recalling that Rajiv Gandhi, when he was Prime Minister in the 1980s, personally visited villages during a crisis in agriculture, he alleged that the present government spoke only rhetoric.Hailing the leadership of Indira Gandhi in improving agriculture in the country, the Congress leader said she was instrumental in the success of Green Revolution. C Subramaniam (Agriculture Minister), MS Swaminathan (scientist) and Sivaraman (bureaucrat) made stellar contributions to green revolution then, but incumbent Union Agriculture Minister Radha Mohan Singh suggested doing Yoga as a way to address distress in agriculture, he said.Under the present NDA regime, situation in Kashmir worsened and Indias relations with neighbouring countries like Pakistan, China, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have suffered, Aiyar claimed.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

This is the second type of assistance announced by the state government. The government had earlier announced a transport subsidy for potato farmers Deputy chief minister Nitin Patel, while speaking to reporters, said that the state government has implemented a new scheme and has allocated Rs 100 crore to provide assistance of Rs 1 per kg and Rs 50 per 50-kg gunny bag to farmers growing potatoes or onions.In Gujarat, the total potato produce is about 39 lakh metric tons and that of onions is about 10 lakh metric tons. Patel said that a committee headed by him had been formed to assist farmers growing potato and onion. The committee also has the agriculture minister Chiman Sapariya, health minister Shankar Chaudhary, minister of state for agriculture Vallabh Vaghasiya and irrigation minister Nanu Vanani.Patel said the committee decided that the government should also provide assistance to farmers who have restored their potato and onion produce in cold storages. Apart from this, the farmer will get Rs 1 per kg for exporting the produce from the state.Officials said that if a farmer sells 300 quintals of the crop in Gujarat he will get Rs 30,000 as subsidy. If he sells the same amount outside Gujarat, he will get an additional export subsidy of Rs 30,000.Ashish Guru, president of the Gujarat Cold Storage Association, said, ""This subsidy will be come as a major relief for farmers who decided to stock their crop for lack of a good price. This subsidy will help farmers to at least make good their storage cost.Sources said that the subside was announced keeping in view the election scheduled for later this year. Many farmers who had failed to get remunerative prices for their crops had earlier this month thrown their produce on the streets."
5a03b1219855b76bf13b9315,"In a UP village, after the loan-waiver, preparing for the next loan",http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-up-village-after-the-loan-waiver-preparing-for-the-next-loan/story-9gpdOlMVlnqxa6WxTkDhdM.html,2017-06-21,"Hori Lal is worried. At 70, he is old and frail. He speaks, but is not easy to always comprehend. He walks slowly. But it is not just about himself that he is anxious. He is more concerned about the well-being of his family comprising three sons, their wives and 10 grand children.If one person falls sick, we are in trouble. There is no money, says Lal, a farmer in Barabankis Tindwani village. Though just 20 kilometres from Lucknow, if you go by the lack of infrastructure and housing, the state of roads and power, the village could be anywhere in the remote interiors of UP.Lal has a loan of Rs 70,000, taken in 2015, and displays his Kisan Credit Card. He is also a potential beneficiary of the UP governments loan waiver. Even as he waits to see whether his loan will indeed get written off as assured by Yogi Adityanath, the states new chief minister, he is already thinking of the next loan that he will likely be forced to take.The fact that he may have to take another loan underlines the limitations of a loan waiver: it at best can be a temporary relief and is not a solution to the problem of low income farmers plagued by recurrent losses.The economics of investmentLal, for example, has 6 bighas, an acre and a half, of land. The single-most important challenge for him, every season, is finding the resources to invest.Take the economics of potato farming.For an acre of land, Lal - like other potato farmers in Tindwani and elsewhere - has to first buy 20 sacks of seeds, with each sack containing 50 kg. Each kg costs around Rs 24. And so the total cost for seeds is Rs 24,000.He then has to buy fertilisers of different kinds - a 5 kilo pack of zinc sulphate for Rs 300, two packs of urea for Rs 330 each, and five sacks of DAP (Diammonium Phosphate) for Rs 1150 each. The total cost of fertilisers comes to Rs 6710.Lal then has to till and level the land, for which he hires a tractor for Rs 500 per hour. Ten times, for two hours each, the tractor works on preparing the soil and land. Lal shells out another Rs 10,000 for it.He then sows the seeds, for which he has to hire the tractor again, which costs him Rs 2000.The farmers of Tindwani depend on pumps, run on diesel, for irrigation. Engines (which includes diesel rates) can be rented at  150 per hour; every acre requires at least four hours of irrigation; and it has to be irrigated seven times. The total cost for Lal on this head works out to Rs 4200.The next step is the use of pesticides. Along with labour, which can be hired at Rs 250 per day, the costs of this would come to Rs 1500.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The final step in the cycle is harvesting. A tractor is hired, at Rs 2000 per acre. Ten labourers are hired for the day, which costs Rs 2500. And 250 sacks have to be bought, at Rs 20 each. Together, the entire harvesting exercise costs about Rs 9500.But the cycle is not yet complete, for the farmers have to now transport and store their produce. Each sack is now packed in with 50 kgs of potato. The total produce from an acre, if all goes well, for Lal is about 125 quintals. The total cost of transporting and storing is close to Rs 30,000.And so what constitutes for Lal his basic investment, in one crop cycle, for an acre of land, from the stage of seeds to storing the produce, is approximately Rs 87,910. With miscellaneous costs, this would go up to around Rs 90,000.Potato farmer Kishan at his field in Bandi ka Purva village in Barabanki. (Deepak Gupta/HT Photo)The lose-lose ventureAnd then how much does Lal - or any other farmer of his kind - earn?Till Yogi government came to power in March in UP, there was no Minimum Support Price for potato. In the last season, prices had fluctuated. Local Tindwani farmers told HT that it varied between Rs 120 per sack of 50 kgs to Rs 750 per sack. On an average, this would mean about Rs 4.85 per kg of potato. At 125 quintals, this would mean a return of Rs 60, 625 for an acre of potato produce.But it was erratic. Sometimes, we just left our produce at the storage because it cost more to pay them storage fees than what we would have recovered. So we got no money, says Lal.To offset this problem of wild fluctuation in prices, the Yogi government has introduced an MSP of Rs 487 per quintal. But even if all his produce was acquired at this rate, it would give a farmer like Lal for an acre of his produce Rs 60,875.But remember his investment. It is close to Rs 90,000. And so every acre of potato he cultivates, Lal is actually losing Rs 30,000.The vicious cycleIt is because of this gross mismatch between investment and income that farmers such as Lal end up taking loans. They do not have money for the seeds, the fertilisers, the irrigation, the pesticides, the sowing, the harvesting, the transport and storage because they have actually lost money.Weddings in the family and emergencies like illnesses force them to sell part of their land holdings. Novembers demonetisation did not help. It left even lesser money for investment and so the crop produce for some of the potato farmers of Tindwani went down.The Yogi governments decision to waive off loans up to Rs 1 lakh, for small and marginal farmers with less than a hectare of land, may benefit Lal. But it wont solve his problem.Where would he get the money to make a fresh investment? I will take a loan again. What else can I do?Why did he then cultivate potatoes in the first place?Lal says he has no other option. What else can we do? This is what my family has always done. This is all we know. At least, it gets us some vegetables for the home. Lal says sending his sons out to work is not a solution: they were unskilled and would get Rs 250 as labour charges for a day, which they could get in the village too. At least we are together.It is this underlying driver of despair - limited cash reservoir to make investments, losses on produce because of low price, and thus a further push into deprivation - which is causing despair. The UP governments decision to waive off loans has triggered a nation-wide demand for the same, but Lal knows it is only a matter of time before he is back, standing in the queue for another loan.This is Part 3 of our series, #BeingAFarmerNow. Part 1 focused on the new age farmers of Madhya Pradesh while Part 2 examined how big-ticket projects cheat farmers out of their land."

Food costs around 30% more in AC restaurants.Now that AC restaurants will have 18% GST , even those seated in non-AC sections, which is common among 60% restaurants in Mumbai region, will also have to pay 18%, hoteliers said on Wednesday.Taxation on tentative average pricing in city restaurants in the GST regime suggests that average Mumbaikars eating in non-AC sections will have to pay a lot, leaving not much of a difference in pricing between them and those in AC restaurants.The hotel industry is angry over basic differentiation being made between AC and non-AC, arguing that AC is a necessity and not a luxury in Mumbai, as even local trains are going AC. GST is applicable only on food, and not liquor.Adarsh Shetty, president of Ahar, an association of over 8,000 restaurants in Mumbai, want a uniform 12% tax on all restaurants/bars to avoid disparity. In non-AC restaurants only, the benefit of 12% GST will be passed on, but there are only 20% such restaurants.""Manmohan Singh, as Union finance minister, had announced in his budget speech withdrawal of hotel expenditure tax, citing that in a city like Mumbai, AC was a necessity due to humid conditions. We have moved back in time now even after almost 25 years of development, when Metros are coming up all over the country with AC comfort,"" said Adarsh.""The same facility is not considered a luxury in other businesses, such as pharmacy. This is a legacy of the past wherein the government, unable to define restaurant sales as a service, surreptitiously decide to levy a service tax on AC restaurants,"" said another hotelier and former Ahar secretary Sukesh Shetty.Sukesh said a uniform 12% will avoid complications and make compliance easier. He said an additional 6% tax would be a pinch on commoners, who avoid AC sections. Adarsh said in most restaurants, non-AC sections have more seats.'Chakna to take a hit'Chakna' (snacks) during liquor consumption will cost you more. The GST Council announced a 12% rate for Indian traditional namkeen, savories, farsan, potato chips and banana chips. The rate should be reduced to 5% to maintain uniformity with the rate for sweets, the Snack Food Association of Maharashtra has demanded. The rate for namkeen is double the present tax but industry hardly receives any input credit as its raw materials are agro-based. There is no tax on raw materials like potato, banana, maida, besan, salt and pulses. There is only a marginal tax on masala. Namkeen and sweets are sold from the same shop and are inter-related products for the common man. With 12% GST, the effective prices of all products will increase by 6-8%, the association said."

Little had he thought that the issue would gather momentum just five months down the line and force the Narendra Modi government to consider loan waiver for small and marginal farmers.In a way, the demands for farm loan waiver could be BJPs own doing. Maharasthra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis, who had been steadfast in his opposition to a loan waiver, admitted that he was forced to announce writing off debts of small and marginal farmers due to immense pressure from the farmers whose expectations had risen manifold following similar moves by Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.The Congress had already raised the pitch for farm loan waiver with vice president Rahul Gandhi undertaking a month-long kisan yatra across Uttar Pradesh in September last year. Though the yatra did not benefit the Congress politically, it did raise expectations of the farmers. The BJP too responded by mentioning farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers in its manifesto for Uttar Pradesh.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his election rallies, went to the extent of saying that the BJP government in Uttar Pradesh will take a decision on farm loan waiver in its first cabinet meeting. The pressure on the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath for announcing the loan waiver was telling as he kept delaying the meeting of the cabinet that usually takes place within hours of the new government assuming office. The council of ministers met a couple of times informally as bureaucrats put together proposal for the loan write off for the cabinet to consider in its first meeting.The announcement by the Uttar Pradesh government led to demands for a farm loan waiver from other states such as Maharashtra, Karnataka, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu among others. Maharashtra bowed to the demands from farmers and declared a farm loan waiver for needy farmers. The state government put stringent conditions to exclude well-off farmers from the loan waiver scheme to limit its expenditure.As soon as Maharashtra announced its farm loan waiver, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley made it clear that the state government will have to fund the initiative from its own resources and not expect any bailout by the Centre. The Punjab government became the third state to announce a farm loan waiver for small and marginal farmers on June 19, a promise made by the Congress during the poll campaign in the state. In a bid for political one-upmanship, Chief Minister Amarinder Singh also announced loan waiver up to Rs 2 lakh  double than what has been offered by UP and Maharashtra.At the heart of the crisis is absence of remunerative prices for farm produce. In simpler terms, a person dependent only on agriculture as a means of livelihood finds it difficult to make both ends meet as he does not earn enough. As prices of pulses, fruits and vegetables shot up during the past two years due to drought, the government had put in place stringent curbs on exports and stockholding by traders. The same were not eased after a spell of good monsoon led to bumper production.The glut of pulses and onions saw farmers making a beeline to market yards to sell their produce leading to a sharp reduction in procurement prices. In Maharashtra, stagnant milk prices had irked farmers who threw milk on the roads instead of selling it to dairies. In Uttar Pradesh, potato growers threw their produce on roads as wholesale prices dipped on account of better production. Similar was the case with onion growers in Madhya Pradesh.The simmering discontent among farmers in Madhya Pradesh led to protests in Mandsaur where six farmers were killed in police firing on June 6. Things took a political turn as leaders made a beeline to Mandsaur to express solidarity with farmers.Delicate issueIn both Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh, the governments hastily reached out to a section of favourable farmer leaders, agreed to some of their demands and called off the strike. Such handling of a delicate issue further angered the farmers who looked towards leaders such as Shiv Kumar Sharma alias Kakkaji in Madhya Pradesh and Raju Shetti in Maharashtra to take their struggle to a logical conclusion.While Sharma heads the breakaway faction of the RSS-backed Bhartiya Kisan Sangh, Shetti leads the Swabhimani Shetkari Sangathan in Maharashtra. Sharma was thrown out of the BKS following his frequent run-ins with Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. Shetti, a Lok Sabha member from Hatkanangale near Kolhapur, is part of the NDA but is increasingly disillusioned with Prime Minister Narendra Modis farm policies.Shetti believes that Modi has lost the script when it came to tackling the agrarian distress as the government, instead of addressing pressing issues such as remunerative prices, was busy pursuing soil health cards. His consistent demand  Modi should fulfil the poll promise of implementing the M S Swaminathan Committee Report that has recommended a 50% margin over the cost of cultivation incurred by the farmers.Farmers were already operating on thin margins, which have dipped even further over the last three years. The poll promise on MSP has remained just that  a promise, with neither the agriculture minister nor the prime minister making any reference to it. The much-touted agri-market reforms too have floundered and so has the flagship programme to provide irrigation facilities to every farm. As many as 23 of the 99 delayed irrigation projects were to be completed by March 2017. The government has missed the deadline.On the political front, the strain on the NDA is showing. Modi had run a tight ship since coming to power in 2014, but allies such as Shiv Sena and Shettis Swabhiman Paksha have been growing restless and have raised a banner of revolt. The agriculture sector is desperately seeking new vigour and fresh leadership to pull it out of the crisis."

The state government will have to bear a burden over around Rs 36,000 crore to repay these loans on farmers behalf to various banks including cooperative.We will raise the waived amount through the States own resources by floating Kisan Rahat Bonds in the wake of the provisions of Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act, 2003, said government spokesman Siddharth Nath Singh while addressing mediapersons after the States first Cabinet meeting.As per the FRBM Act provisions, the States fiscal deficit cannot be more than three per cent of its GDP. So we have tried to balance the fiscal deficit by raising the money through Kisan Rahat bonds, Singh maintained.He, however, clarified that the decision would be implemented immediately after getting it passed in the upcoming budget session of the State Assembly. The other major proposal to get the Cabinets approval was setting up of 5,000 wheat procurement centres across the State.Fulfilling its other poll promise, the Yogi cabinet moved to set the wheat procurement target of 80 lakh tonne in the current fiscal of which the government aims at purchasing 40 lakh tonne in the first phase. The State government has made the provision of giving Rs 10 per quintal as loading charge over the MSP of Rs 1625 per quintal to the farmers. It has been made clear that at the procurement centres, all the purchases will be done by the farmers themselves instead of the involvement of any middleman.The money will directly be credited to the bank accounts of the farmers on the basis of their Aadhar Card, said the government spokesman. Prominent among other major proposals approved by Yogi cabinet, included cabinets stamp on regularisation of illegal slaughterhouses. The state government claimed that it had closed down only 26 illegal slaughterhouses across the state so far. While it decided to redress the issues related to licensing process and renewal of expired licences of meat sellers, the cabinet reiterated its resolve to implement SC order and the recommendations of National Green Tribunal (NGT) in letter and spirit in curb the illegal meat trade in the state. Apart from approving the phenomenon of anti-romeo Squads for the safety of women, the Cabinet also set up a three-member ministerial committee to take care of the interest of potato growers."

Gurmukh Singh, 44, is one of better-to-do farmers of Pandrali, a quiet, well-groomed village in Fatehgarh Sahib district with several newly-built houses, smooth streets and girls on scooters. Its a picture that could well be captioned prosperous Punjab. But the genteel faade hides the struggles of the states farming community.I am a farmer, have never done anything else, but its not sustainable any longer, Gurmukh clears his throat. A former village head, he is clearly uneasy about sharing his troubles with strangers. The price of potato, the crop he grew on part of the land hes leased, has crashed. It means more debt for he has to pay a rent of Rs 40,000 for an acre though his potato crop has fetched him only Rs 25,000. This is what happens when you diversify, he fumes.This week, the Punjab government announced a waiver of crop loans up to Rs 2 lakh for small and marginal farmers (up to five acres). Gurmukh is relieved that he falls in this bracket but wishes the government had announced a complete loan waiver. I know the state has limited funds, but the Centre should rescue farmers, he opines.Like most farmers in the state, this matriculate grows wheat and paddy, the two crops with a guaranteed minimum support price (MSP). Paddy has leached the land of water leading to fears of desertificationthe water table at Pandrali has breached 70 feet, and is falling at the rate of three feet a yearyet farmers refuse to grow other crops. I have tried turmeric, sugarcane, maize and vegetables, but marketing is a problem. The sugarcane mills dont pay us for months and prices of other crops are erratic, explains Gurmukh.RISING COST OF PRODUCTIONBut now even the MSP of the two main crops, he rues, is becoming unviable due to the spiralling cost of inputs. Its simple maths. In 1992, says Gurmukh, diesel cost Rs 4-5 a litre, a sack of diammonium phosphate (DAP) Rs 200, while wheat cost Rs 5 a kilo. Now while diesel is pegged at Rs 58 a litre and DAP is 1100 for a sack, but wheat has failed to keep pace at Rs 16 a kilo. Add to it the cost of boring tubewells every year due to the dipping water level, the steeply priced pesticides scarcely used in the past, and the cost of labour from UP and Bihar in the absence of local helping hands, says Gurmukh, explaining the high cost of production. A bore costs anywhere between Rs 10,000 and 1 lakh.Watch | Farmers have to borrow money to farmGroundwater irrigates over 73% of land in the state. This has led to a sharp decline in the water table. According to the Central Ground Water Board, of the 138 administrative blocks in Punjab, 110 blocks are overexploited, four are critical and two are semi-critical. Only 22 blocks are safe, but they have other problems such as arsenic, fluoride and uranium contamination.One reason for the indiscriminate use of groundwater is free electricity for farmers introduced in 1999. Also, the Punjab government hasnt placed any restriction on the depth of tubewells. Nor does one need any permission to dig up a well.Inadequate rainfall in the last few years is only increasing the general dependence on groundwater. The year 2014 was very rough on us, so was 2015, recounts Gurmukh. In 2015, Punjab received only 50% of the monsoon rainfall, and the next year it was 36%.Little wonder then that any mention of digging up Satluj Yamuna Link (SYL) canal to provide water to Haryana raises hackles. The Bhakra canal flows 1.5 km from here; the Sirhind feeder and Narwana branch are also close but all the water flows to Haryana and Rajasthan, gripes a friend of Gurmukh.Haryana, he claims, also has the job advantage as it borders both Chandigarh and Delhi. They have benefited from industrialisation and the Gurgaon boom, says Gurmukh, adding how a working man drawing a salary of 35,000 a month is better off than a farmer who owns 10 acres.Haryana also offers a better market price for alternative crops such as sunflower. It fetches Rs 25,000 per quintal in Punjab while in Haryana it gets Rs 35,000, says Gurmukh.Watch | Why are Indias farmers seething with anger?The crop prices show no signs of increasing but land rental rates are going through the roof and range between 40,000 and 45,000 an acre in the district. With farming becoming unviable, more and more small farmers are leasing out their land instead of toiling on it. These landlords seek a rise of 10% every year regardless of any natural calamity or price crash, grouses Gurmukh. He recalls 2015 when he was forced to sell his export-grade Basmati (PB 1509) to the Food Corporation of India after the prices crashed from Rs 4,500 a quintal in 2014 to 1700 in 2015.Ask Gurmukh why he takes so much land on lease, and he points to his machinery. I have a tractor, a seed sower, a land leveler, a roller et al. I need land to make the most of them. Also, there is the lure of a good crop and the pressure of repaying the debt.Demonetisation dealt a heavy blow to Gurmukh who wanted to repay a crop loan. I had just sold my crop and deposited two lakh in my bank but I could only withdraw 5,000 a week. Somehow the little sums of money I took out were spent elsewhere while the interest on my loan piled up.Gurmukh Singh with daughter Gurpreet Kaur and wife Ranjeet Kaur in his House in Pandriali village in Sirhind district, Punjab. (Ravi Kumar/HT Photo)THE DEBT TRAPIn 2007, Gurmukh took a loan of Rs 5 lakh to build his house. While the house loan was from a bank, most of his other loans are from commission agents (arhtiya or the middlemen) who charge a higher rate of interest than banks. But Gurmukh appears resigned to working with them. Here is the reason: In Punjab, a farmer cannot sell his produce in the open market at the prevailing price. He can only sell it to commission agents under the Agriculture Produce Marketing Act, 1961. A few days back, the Congress government passed an amendment to the act, allowing private players to set up mandis to purchase farm produce. But Gurmukh is yet to learn about it.As of now, the middleman also doubles up as a dealer of seeds, pesticides, and fertilisers. So farmers not only sell their produce to him, but also purchase their inputs from him, often on credit.Milked dry Farmers in the grain bowl of the country, Punjab, are a distressed lot Rs 69,335 crore Rural debt Rs 5.5 lakh Per capita rural household debt 98% Area under irrigation 110 out of 138 blocks are water dark zones (water table dangerously low) 1.6% Rate of agri growth in Punjab from 2004-05 to 2014-15 1.5% Punjabs share of Indias total area FARMER SUICIDES6,926 No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*1,309 Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016No. of suicides between 2000 and 2011*Farm suicides in seven districts between April 2013 and Dec 2016Despite being a farmers daughter and wife, Ranjeet doesnt think highly of farming. No one values the farmer, she says.The couples only offspring, Gurpreet, who is doing post-graduation in English from a college in Fatehgarh Sahib, is now looking forward to a bank tellers course. The young woman, who stitches her clothes herself, may not be sure about her career path, but she is clear that her husband will not be a farmer. No way, she declares. Its too risky. No matter how hard you work, there is no guarantee of profit.Youngsters in the village, she claims, want to either get a job or go abroad. Farming is an option only for the uneducated.Jagtar Singh, Gurmukhs man Friday who works on his land for Rs 1 lakh a year, agrees. In farming, you throw money for six months and then dont know whether you will get it back or not. A salaried job is better.The only person who appears contented in the fields is Harendra Kumar from Motihari district in Bihar, who is here with his team of 10 labourers. We will sow paddy, he explains as he arranges ladoos for a pooja before they begin work. He explains, We pray for a bumper crop, our wellbeing and that of sardar ji.Amen to that."

Nitishs choice was hinged on the premise that Kovind is the first governor of Bihar to be chosen for the supreme seat and a Dalit. By nominating Kumar the Opposition has presented a logic which Kumar cannot dismiss: That Meira Kumar, the daughter of Jagjivan Ram, who is as accomplished in governance as Kovind and more so a Bihari, was much more worthy of the CMs support.Read the story hereOpinion: Presidential election: BJPs strategy to divide Dalits receives boostHas the Opposition walked into the BJP trap by fielding former Lok Sabha Speaker Meira Kumar against Ram Nath Kovind?

The other OBCs and most backward communities were similarly mobilized against the Yadavs broadly committed to the Samajwadi PartyWhat gave Kovinds candidature an extra-edge in the BJPs scheme was the Koli communitys substantial presence in Maharashtra and Gujarat.Read the story hereISROs PSLV-C38, carrying 31 satellites, lifts off from SriharikotaISROs workhorse rocket PSLV-38 blasted off on Friday from the spaceport at Sriharikota carrying the Cartosat-2 series satellite - a dedicated satellite for the defence forces - along with 30 co-passenger satellites.

After a hectic week at work, he was headed towards Anekal for the weekend getaway.""I parked my car and began walking with a friend and his pets. I didn't know that it was a protected forest area, and I didn't mean to go there. I don't remember seeing any board there signaling that to be a protected area. I may have walked about 2 kilometres when this lake opened up before us. This place was gated, but the gate was open because of the temple inside it,"" he recalls.The horror that followed lasted less than two minutes when Potato and Pi ran into the water and Mudit rushed behind them. ""I was concerned about them and tried to get them out of water. That's when I sensed that something had attacked my left hand. I soon noticed a crocodile ripping away at my hand and tried to push its teeth and jaw away with my right hand,"" he says. Mudit was only in 3-ft deep water and on the edge of the lake. Within seconds, he was out of the water as the crocodile retreated. ""I sat on the banks. Realizing that blood was dripping out of my arm, I tore my shirt and tied up the wounded portion with it,"" he says.Mudit called Dr Anjana Reddy, a resident doctor at Hosmat and family friend. She advised Mudit to go to a private hospital near Bannerghatta Road and get first aid before coming to Hosmat.""Two forest guards, who rushed there, helped me. I gave them the key of my car and they dropped me to a private hospital on Bannerghatta Road,"" recalls Mudit.Though the forest department has filed a case against Mudit on charges of trespassing the protected forest area, the family has not been communicated about the same.Mudit's mother Rekha Dandwate says she is proud of her son. ""Imagine he fought with a crocodile and survived. He himself called us at 11.15am and explained what he had gone through. He is positive, he is a fighter. I appreciate his presence of mind at that juncture,"" she says.Mudit's father Sadanand Dandwate, a central government employee, is all smiles as his son is on path to recovery.

His partner in his healthcare startup, Gaurav Prachani, is already working on a custom-made prosthetic hand to be attached to his left hand that has been bitten off by the crocodile.The arm is likely to have buttons near the elbow, pressing which the prosthetic fingers can be moved unlike the conventional ones available.Mudit, a mechanical engineer from IIT Bombay, is looking for a detachable prosthetic hand.""I am thinking of a prototype that can function like a human hand, with the nerves connected to sensors. We are working on multiple solutions. The prosthetic hand can be put in only after 3-4 weeks,"" said Gaurav.According to Dr Priyadarshan K, senior plastic surgeon of Hosmat hospital, who operated on Mudit, there's a German product called Ottobok that works through high-end technology. ""In this bionic hand, electrodes are put inside the elbow muscles. When the muscles contract, the fingers get activated, as the brain senses the muscle movement in fore arm. To get used to this, he has to relearn the movements. This product is expensive, ranging from Rs 8-16 lakh depending on its characteristics. It is costly in terms of maintenance,"" he said."

We parked the car two kilometres away from the temple and started walking. As soon as Potato (his black Labrador) saw water, he ran to take a plunge. Worried about his safety, I went behind him. I did not realise that the lake had crocodiles in it. When I was playing with Potato and trying to bring him out of the lake, the crocodile caught hold my arm.Initially, I did not realise what had happened. But when its teeth started piercing my hand, I got scared and I started to fight back. I punched the crocodile with my right hand on its jaw as hard as I could. I was angry, hurt and scared. I wanted to be alive. As soon its grip loosened slightly, I ran out of the lake as fast as I could, he said. He said he did see some boards at the lake but they were in Kannada and had no visuals.Dandwate, a mechanical engineer and head of Turtle Child Technology, a healthcare startup, added that he took off his shirt and tied it tightly around his hand to prevent blood loss and to remain conscious.My friend and I then sought the help of forest officials. I gave them my car keys and asked them to drive us out of there. They took care of Potato, Pi and my friend. They rushed me to Sagar Hospital. After getting initial treatment, I contacted my friend Dr Anjana Reddy in Hosmat Hospital. I was then shifted to Hosmat, he said.I will start going to office once I am out of here, he added.Family, friends happyDandwates parents, sister and friends had a big smile on their faces as they saw him narrate the incident cheerfully. My son survived a crocodile attack because of the blessings of the Almighty and his dear ones. I am very proud of my brave boy. He did not panic and has been smiling all through, said Rekha Dandwate, his mother. Dandwates parents S P Dandwate, Rekha and his sister Manali rushed to Bengaluru on Sunday evening when they learnt of the incident. His friends recollect that they have been on many trips together. They are planning their next trip after Dandwate is discharged.Friend designing prosthetic armGaurav Parchani, Dandwates friend and colleague said he was working on creating a prosthetic arm for his friend. Though Mudit himself is designing one for himself, I too am designing one which will be as close to a normal human hand as possible. I want to ensure Mudit has no problem and can carry on with his daily chores as comfortably as possible. With him designing one, he will have two, he said. Help from doctors and other experts will also be taken, Parchani said.Doctor speaksDr Ajit Benedict Royan, medical director, Hosmat Hospital said Dandwate will be discharged by Saturday if his tissue culture and other reports come out positive. We want to ensure that he has no other ailment or infection and the swelling reduces. The prosthetic arm will be attached after three weeks when his wounds have completely healed and swelling is not there, he said. The doctors said he was walking around and had also started working from the hospital."

The issue of Central contribution to the revolving fund created to support market interventions for price stabilisation of perishable agricultural commodities was raised during the meeting of Food Supplies and Consumer Welfare Minister SN Patro with Union Minister for Consumer Affairs Ram Vilas Paswan in New Delhi.The Centre has been allocating food grains to Odisha based on the 2011 Census. Meanwhile, population of the State has grown by four to five per cent during the last six years as is evident from the trends of decadal growth rate in Odisha from the Census report.I requested the Union Minister to increase the upper ceiling of Odisha by 15 lakh individuals for coverage of left out eligible population into NFSA fold keeping in view the projected population growth from 2011 to 2017 and more importantly, the backwardness of the State with higher density of Scheduled category people, Patro told this paper after the meeting.The State has been allotted rice for 3,26,41,800 out of States total population of 4,19,74,218 under NFSA in priority household, Annapurna Anna Yojana and Antyodaya Anna Yojana, Patro said.The upper ceiling for the State has been determined at 82.17 per cent of rural population and 55.77 per cent of urban population with reference to the NSS household consumption survey data for 2011-12 available with Planning Commission.Projecting the population figure of the State at 436.50 lakh, Patro urged the Union Minister to fix the upper ceiling for the State at Rs 340.49 lakh against Rs 326.41 lakh fixed by the Centre.Since there is no provision of auto inclusion under NFSA, Paswan said his Ministry is planning to bring an amendment in the Act in next session of the Parliament.Patro further requested Paswan to release the Central share of Rs 50 crore to the States revolving fund created for market intervention to save farmers from distress sale of perishable agri-horticultural commodities, like potato and onion.The State has created a corpus of Rs 100 crore under Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) scheme of the Centre for the purpose. Though Odisha has provided its share of `50 crore, the Centre is yet to release its matching share."

Some had problems with online registration as the GSTN site kept crashing throughout the day while others had to contend with software changes. But none knew how, or how much, to charge?For sweet shop owners in the city, billing was arduous. The GST rates for milk sweets like rosgolla, rasmalai and ghee-roasted sweets like carrot halwa are quite different under the new structure.""We have checked with our tax consultant, but still it is confusing. For instance, milk sweets like basundi, sandesh are coming under 5% tax, but if we choose to coat them with silver foil we would have to pay a tax of 18-20%,"" said Vignesh Kaur of K C Das Sweets. ""Likewise, rosogolla, rasmallai should be at 5%, but if we add kesar it would go up to 18-20%. Then again any chocolate-coated item is taxed at 28%,"" he said.At supermarket chains like Sri Murugan Stores , confusion was more pronounced. ""Tax on snacks like aloo bhujia, potato chips, samosa, kachori is 12%. Now the tax rate for cashews is 5%, but I can't figure out if masala cashew is a snack or a standalone item,"" said Rajarathinam, owner, Sri Murugan Stores.Such problems pervaded all and sundry. For instance, at Landmark Group , which has more than 250 franchisees, billing has been stopped at smaller outlets.""We are yet to figure out the rates for many of the items on the inventory list. Many of our smaller outlets in Kerala and Tamil Nadu have stopped billing. We have advised our franchisees to convert to tally to avoid confusion -- some of them still use local software for billing,"" said CEO of Landmark Group Jerry Mathews.But sales have been excellent despite the problems. ""We have had bumper sales. Usually June is a busy month because of back-to-school sales. But this June, GST clearance sales were higher than New Year, Christmas and Onam sales,"" said Mathews.Heavy sales were also seen at Future Group chain Big Bazaar. ""We sold goods worth more than Rs 10 crore with 1.2 lakh footfalls at 40 outlets throughout India. GST will not be a deterrent to sales at least at the bigger outlets,"" said a spokesperson of Future Group."

Most farmers in the district are dependent on this short-time crop (three-month) for quick money.In the recent years, the income from potato fields had decreased substantially owing to late blight and decrease in rainfall.All these years, poor quality uncertified seeds were blamed for the fungal infection. In the last two years, the Horticulture Department made special efforts to bring certified seeds and provided them for the select farmers. This year, 2,700 tonnes of certified seeds have been distributed in the district.Jayalakshmi, a farmer at Markuli in Shantigrama hobli, said: The growth of the plant is below normal. We are already noticing symptoms of late blight, where leaves get brown.The growth of the tuber is also not on the expected pace, pointed out Papanna, another grower.Those who purchased the certified seeds have also noticed a similar trend in their fields.Kottur Srinivas, district president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, on Thursday, told presspersons: The farmers who spent thousands of rupees on seeds and fertilizers are worried about the loss. Those purchased certified seeds have also experienced the same.The Horticulture Department has also noticed poor germination in some parts because of loss of rainfall.A.B. Sanjay, Deputy Director of Horticulture, told The Hindu , By and large, germination has been poor this year, because of a dip in rainfall. The department had sent teams of experts to study the causes for poor germination last week. However, as of now, there are no symptoms of late blight as pointed out by some farmers. As the name itself suggests, the fungal infection is normally found only after 50 days.This year potato has been cultivated in 13,500 hectares. In some parts, growers have removed the potato, following poor germination, and have cultivated other crops.We are suggesting them some alternative crops for those who have already lost hopes of good yield this year, he said."
5a0b411e9855b76bf13cd794,What became of the Modi-Trump hugfest,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/strategic-insights/what-became-of-the-modi-trump-hugfest/,2017-07-04,"The Indian prime minister and the US president hugged like long-lost brothers. Mr. Modi seemed to have found eternal bliss on literally, the chest of Big Bro Donald Trump. But did anything of clear benefit to India come out of all this bonhomie?Mr. Trump issued nary a word in favour of Indias striving for a UN permanent seat. His woman at the UN is issuing threat after threat to mediate between India and Pakistan. Nor did he address the contentious H-1B visa issue. Nor did Mr. Modi bring up any of these issues, at least in public.Instead, both leaders resolved to tackle radical Islamic extremism, longhand for Islamic terrorism. But even with close to 200 million Muslims back at home, Mr. Modi is not facing any substantive terrorism from them.Mr. Trump, with a much smaller number of Muslims in his country, is surprisingly, no matter all the noise and fireworks, not facing much terrorism from them either. Almost every week, there is a homegrown white or black gunman who blows up a few people, but for Mr. Trump, as well as for most America, that is simply and perfectly par for the course.Any suggestion of gun control is met with a virulently negative response for Mr. Trump himself.But let a Muslim be involved in any violent act, and the whole country explodes in outraged indignation.Mr. Trump does not realize that it is his own policies as well as those of his predecessor, George W. Bush, that have contributed wildly to the growth of Islamic jihadism in the world. It was George W.s excursion into Iraq, primarily to teach Muslims a lesson for 9/11, which he thought would be a walk in the park, that has resulted in the emergence of ISIS and other jihadi outfits.Hush, dont say it out loud, but people say, now very quietly though, that Mr. Modi has his own alleged chequered past vis--vis Muslims. As PM, he has tried hard to correct that image. Then why he is undoing all his efforts now.Consider the Taliban. Can they be considered radical Islamic extremists? From past and current experience, yes. But the US is desperate to deal with them. The Taliban instead is the one spurning the US. Sooner or later, they are expected by almost everyone, including the US, to take Kabul. It is a resigned fact of life.India too then will have to deal with the Taliban or lose any influence in Afghanistan. What is India doing to deal with the Taliban? By painting itself as a country against radical Islamic extremism, is it helping its cause in Afghanistan, an absolutely critical country for its own peaceful existence, or hurting it?The point is why should Mr. Modi get involved in Mr. Trumps battles, when all the latter offers is empty rhetoric. The American Pivot to Asia is practically dead, what with Mr. Trump kowtowing to Xi Jinping of China. Kim Jong-un is least deterred by Mr. Trumps huff and bluster. North Korea has thrown an open secret wide openthat America is a fading superpower, and China an ascending one.Mr. Modi has his own battles to fightwith China, with Pakistan, with Afghanistan. Even if Mr. Trump offers him any assistance, it is practically of no avail because Mr. Trump finds himself in a weak position with respect to China, Pakistan, and Afghanistan. Why then consider teaming up with a loser. India has to forge its own path to secure itself.Mr. Trump asked Mr. Modi to further open Indias markets. What is a colony? A country that exports raw materials and imports finished goods. We, who so rebelled against colonization, seem to have become a colony again. I am not exactly sure what India exports, but the country is flooded today with foreign goods and services, many of them Americanfrom potato chips and cars to arms and universities.The Indian elite and upper middle class is about 100 million adults, roughly the size of America. The American market is almost saturated. Another America opening up is a delirious prospect for Mr. Trump. And Indians love all things American. Soon even Rooh Afza and Tandoori chicken, already displaced by competing American goods, will be offered by American companies.Mr. Trump also wanted less exposure to liability for his nuclear companiesWestinghouse and GE. But Westinghouse is in the toilet, and pretty much so is GEs nuclear division. Fukushima had GEs reactors, but even though GE promises a newer generation of reactors, who would want to lower liability for companies with such a record.In the meantime, the French and the Russians are forging ahead with building reactors in India. The argument goes that the governments of France and Russia offer insurance to their companies if things go wrong, while American companies are private and have to assume liability for themselves. Why then does Mr. Trump refuse to emulate the French and the Russians and offer support to his companies from his own substantial coffers, instead of bullying a poor county like India into assuming more risk?Frankly, Mr. Modi came away empty-handed from his outing to Washington. If any secret deals in favour of India were struck, it was apparent to none. To his credit, other than the empty anti-radical Islamic rhetoric, Mr. Modi too gave away nothing. Nothing lost, nothing gained then.Indo-US relations have been beset by lip service, lots of of lip and little service, and little else. The Modi-Trump bear hug seems to be a continuation of that fine tradition. The lesson for India: keep your best interests in mind and chart your own destiny. No point in being a junior partner of a country already on the fade, and which only promises to fade more with time."
5a06422a9855b76bf13c4c4c,Maximum creativity,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/kochi/2017/jul/03/maximum-creativity-1623772.html,2017-07-04,"KOCHI: The whole world knows that the legendary Dutch painter Vincent Van Gogh cut off his own ear, in a fit of madness, on December 23, 1888. But author MK Harikumar, in his third Malayalam novel, Vangoginu (Surya Books), gives a different angle. According to my research, the painter Paul Gauguin, who was staying with him, had a fight with Vincent over a painting, which one of them had done, says Harikumar. Paul had a sword. He was intoxicated. He swung his sword and cut off Vincents ear. That is what I have written in the novel.What is interesting is that, according to history, Paul left the house the night of the incident and the duo never met again. Adds Harikumar, I dont think Vincent was so abnormal that he would cut off his own ear. Look at his work at that time: he was doing realistic paintings. I dont think a mad man could paint with so much of logic and clarity.Asked how he got the idea to write a novel on Van Gogh, Harikumar says, I like his paintings a lot. He was a realistic painter, yet each of his works repeatedly speaks to us no matter how many times we view it. The painting is an object, yet, it is a living, breathing presence, with an underlying power.Harikumar is especially enamoured of The Potato Eaters. It is a group of peasants sitting inside a wooden house, eating a bowl of potatoes. It is a night scene, but their mood is communicated very powerfully to us, says Harikumar.Another painting which affected Harikumar was called Three pairs of shoes. Each pair represents life, says Harikumar. In one pair, it seems life is still. In another, turned to one side, it indicates a withdrawal from life, while the third pair, of which one shoe is overturned, could mean that the person who wears them has thoughts of suicide.Asked about the qualities of Van Gogh, Harikumar says, Vincent was strongly creative, but weak in other aspects of his life. He had an affair with a prostitute. Then she left him. Thereafter, he became an alcoholic. He was a loner by instinct. In fact, the only sustained relationship he had was with his brother Theo.And it was Theo who bought one work, even though Vincent had an output of 2100 paintings. It is a tragic story, says Harikumar. And to think that his works sells in the millions of dollars these days. (Examples: the painting Irises sold for $53.9 million, while Portrait of Dr. Gachet fetched $82.5 million).Interestingly, in the novel, Harikumar, who has published several books of criticism, writes it like a journalist doing reports about the life and death of Vincent. So, there are interviews with Van Gogh as well as his friends, and a prostitute called Rachel, says Harikumar Meanwhile, when asked about whether Malayalam readers are aware of Vincent, he says, Definitely. In fact, the cutting of his ear is part of a lesson in schools.His birthdays are celebrated with write-ups in the newspapers. And serious readers are all aware of his greatness. Finally, in a clever marketing gimmick, there are ten covers. But it happened by accident. Artist Sabu Puthuparamban showed Harikumar four covers. I said I wanted all four, says Harikumar, the editor of Surya Books. In the end we decided to make 10 different covers. This is a celebration of the greatness of Vincent Van Gogh."

Hailing from the US, my Indian food experience was limited by both ignorance of the various dishes, and price point. Indian food in the U.S. is priced relatively high and often altered to better suit our bland-preferring palates. Adding to that was my general anxiety in asking what exactly an item such as palak paneer is.To celebrate my introduction to the local cuisine, a colleague took me on a mini-food tour. On our way to the first stop of the day, a vendor on a bicycle pulled up beside us with a rusty metal pot sitting on his back seat. She called him over and asked me if I wanted to try some. Inside the pot was a whitish fluid sloshing around, with no protection from the old pot. I asked what it was, and she responded with a word I fail to recollect. A sip of the drink and I got a slight cucumber taste. Its a drink made from curd, she said. I immediately gave the rest of the drink to her.We arrived at Murugan Idli Shop, Besant Nagar in time for lunch. Employees were still placing seats at tables in the far room, so we sat by the front window. Two sheets of banana leaf were placed on our table. Then the food came.A server ladled three globs of chutney onto our leaf, followed by two idli cakes  one plain and one covered in what I would discover to be a red spicy powder surely taken from the center of an active volcano. My colleague also ordered sweet pongal  essentially a kind of rice pudding  to help comfort my buring taste buds. The different chutneys  orange, white and brown  added a savoury, slightly spicy flavor that also helped mask the red powder. The idli itself was surprisingly soft and paired well with the chutney. The meal ended with a hefty serving of onion dosa, which I would describe as a sort of onion flapjack, but Ive never been a fan of onion dishes.Hours later, the two of us stopped at GSS Restaurant for some dinner. I was once again unaware of what exactly she would order. The first dish placed on our table contained what I would describe as six egg-shaped bread pouches filled with potato and onion, and two small bowls of broth. This, I was told, was pani puri. I immediately made the connection between the dish and soup dumplings, a Chinese delicacy which contains soup.On my first attempt to eat the pani puri, the shell cracked and spilled soup down my face. My second attempt was better, and the food was simple but delicious. Afterwards, we were served pav bhaji, a fast food dish originating from Maharashtra, India. The dish had vegetable curry served with two bread rolls still stuck to each other, and a side bowl filled with carrots and onion slices. It was as simple a dish as they come, but once again delicious without the overwhelming spices Id encountered multiple times already.Since then, Ive branched out and tried new dishes, from the simpler aloo methi to Indian Subway (the main takeaway where nearly every sandwich is spicy). Ive tasted the sour drink restaurants call buttermilk, despite the major difference with the substance I knew back home.Most likely my favorite discovery so far is the childrens drink, rose milk. When I read that item on a menu, my first question was why anyone would make a drink out of roses, or how you would even milk a rose. I was shocked to find that rose milk is actually surprisingly sweet and tastes very similar to strawberry milk. Lets just say if you want to get to know me better, lets have a chat over a cup of rose."

When it rains, for instance, I instantly think of ghevar. Now thats a sweet I have often written about. Its eaten mostly in the north in the rainy season. I am greatly fond of it, though I find that not too many share my view on this.So, the moment the sky turned grey a few days ago, I went looking for ghevar. The closest stop was Kaleva, which used to be my favourite sweet-and-savoury eatery at some point of time. I used to be a regular there, but hadnt been to the sweet shop in Gole Market for quite a while. So I decided I would buy my ghevar there, and have a quick lunch of bedmi sabzi (Rs. 62 for a plate with two bedmis) and dahi vada (Rs. 75).This is a great place for a 15-minute lunch if you are in a hurry. Though the place is always crowded, especially at lunch time, food comes in minutes. And you cant linger in any case to contemplate life because Kaleva  unlike similar eateries in places such as Bengali Market  has no seating area; you have to stand at a counter and eat.I enjoyed my bedmi sabzi. The freshly fried bedmis were large and fluffy, and the potato curry it came with was spicy and nicely mashed. What disappointed me was the dahi vada, which I used to love once upon a time. Either my taste buds have changed since then, or their cook has, for I found the vada so hard that I had to leave half of it uneaten.They have the usual lunch menu that you find in north Indian vegetarian fast-food eateries  puri sabzi, chholey bhaturey, chaat, pao bhaji, special thhalis  consisting of dal makhni, shahi paneer, mixed vegetable rice, raita, sweet, salad and pickle  and rice combos (with chholey, sambhar, dal makhni or shahi paneer). There is a small south Indian section, with dosa and vada served with sambar, and you also get the usual vegetable chowmein, hakka noodles and chilli paneer gravy and so on. Their snacks have always been good. You get various kinds of kachoris (khasta, with peas and so on), pakoras, including green chilly ones, and dhoklas.Deliciously crispWhat I really enjoyed was the ghevar, which had just come off the stove. It had a soft malai layer, which added style and substance to the poor old ghevar. Actually, the dish  essentially a mix of ghee, maida and sugar  has to be prepared with great care for the right thickness and its honeycomb-like form. The ghevar that I carried back with me  and it was demolished before I could say rain  was deliciously crisp, despite the humid weather and the malai.Kaleva is essentially known for its sweets. I used to love their fruit kulfis  creamy kulfis frozen in fruits such as mangoes and apples. We were also very fond of a sweet called chak-a-chak  a light, lemon-coloured rasmalai, with tiny rasgullas in it.Despite all these years, Kaleva remains more or less the same (if you forget about the dahi vada). I shall go back for the ghevar the next time it rains. And the sooner, the better."

It is the only vegetable available in the local markets ever since tension gripped this area on Monday, she said. But potato is selling at a premium. Last week I paid Rs 8 for a kilo and today I bought two kilos for Rs 24, she complained.Price of onion is skyrocketing as well. Srinath Ghosh, a resident of the Bhyabla area, said onion used to sell for Rs 20 a kilo before a Facebook post he didnt even see changed his life. Now we are paying anything between Rs 30 and 32. Most of the shops are closed and there is an acute shortage of supply. Whatever little is coming to the markets is flying off the shelves before you can bat your eyelids. Most of the shopkeepers are taking the advantage of the situation, said Ghosh.A Trinamool Congress party office that was ransacked by locals at Mailakhola in Basirhat on Thursday. (Samir Jana)The humble egg is not far behind in the race. Price of a pair of poultry chicken eggs has increased from Rs 10 to Rs 16, said Rintu Sahana, a resident of Mailakhali area.Not willing to be quoted, a district administration official explained the real reason behind the shortage in food at Basirhat. The difference in the demographic character of Basirhat town and that of the adjoining villages is responsible for this inflation, he said.The town population comprises mostly Hindus while most of the villagers are Muslims. Markets in and around the town are heavily dependent on these villages for their daily supply of vegetable, mutton, fish, chicken and eggs. Ever since the violence started, the villagers have stopped supplying farm and animal products to the town people, he said."
5a0dbaa99855b76bf13d115c,Demonetisation and visible hand of market,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/621860/demonetisation-visible-hand-market.html,2017-07-09,"Demonetisation and visible hand of marketKaushik Basu, International New York Times, Jul 9 2017, 23:59 ISTlong term side-effects: Demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policy's impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected. nytIn 1776, Adam Smith described the power of the markets invisible hand. Although some economists have since overstated this power, dismissing the role of government regulation, its true that the market, when left to itself, often manages to meet a societys economic needs in ways that no one fully understands. Its a mistake for the state to disrupt it wantonly and for bureaucrats to try to do its job. And thats just the mistake India made last fall.On November 8, 2016, the NDA government suddenly declared that as of midnight that night all bills in denominations of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 would cease to be legal tender. Demonetisation, as the policy is called, applied to 86% of the value of all currency in circulation. It was a state intervention of historic proportion.The goal, the government said, was to eliminate fake Indian currency notes, force people to bring out wealth they had hidden to avoid paying taxes on it  so-called black money  and help India switch from cash to digital money. To counter the criticism that erupted, the government later pointed to other countries that had adopted similar measures in recent times, including Iraq, North Korea and Venezuela.Nearly eight months later, a lot of data is now available to help us assess what demonetisation has actually wrought. Here it is, in a word: demonetisation failed to do what it was supposed to do, and although the immediate disruption it caused was less severe than feared at first, the policys impact is turning out to be more protracted than initially expected.Very little black money has been caught. The truly corrupt hold their black money not as money at all, but as real estate and bank balances abroad. The government had authorised people to trade in up to Rs 4,000 in the cancelled notes, so some parcelled their Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 bills into small bundles and got multiple agents (money mules) to change them, no questions asked. The governments freshly minted Rs 2,000 notes promptly became the new stash currency of choice.In the first weeks, even months, following demonetisation, there was visible chaos. Soviet-era-style queues snaked in front of banks and ATMs. The informal sector  mostly small traders, farmers and small unregistered businesses, which often dont have bank accounts  reeled from cash shortages.But the immediate damage caused, though large, was not as large as some of us had feared. GDP growth in the last quarter of 2016 was 7% and manufacturing activity continued to grow. On the other hand, there may be greater long-term side effects than expected.The problems appeared unexpectedly, when agricultural products arrived on the market. In January, with cash shortages in full swing, demand plunged and food prices collapsed. By February, potato prices in Uttar Pradesh were just over half of what they had been during most of 2016 (at around Rs 350 per quintal, instead of over Rs 600 per quintal).Tomato prices were less than one-third. Onion prices in May were half of what they had been a year before. The cost of onions in India is notoriously volatile  and often influenced by politics and elections  but the likeliest culprit for this years drop was demonetisation.The outcome was curious: Widespread suffering in the midst of plenty. Incomes crashed and distress mounted among farmers, a group in India already affected by high suicide rates because of mass indebtedness. And the downturn has hit more than the farming sector.The Indian economy was on a good trajectory until last year, and the government deserves credit for that. It had taken major steps to cut the costs of doing business and unify taxes on goods and services. With, in addition, the drop in world oil prices (which meant huge savings for India, an oil importer) and the rise of labour costs in China (which made Indian manufacturing and exports more competitive), there was every reason to believe that the Indian economy would soon get back to where it was before the 2008 world financial crisis: growing at over 9% per year. Instead, Indias growth in the first quarter of 2017 was 6.1%, down from 7.9% in the fiscal year 2015-16.Telltale signsAn economy is a complex machine, and there is no way to be absolutely certain that the cause of all this is demonetisation. But there is a telltale sign: Much of the slowdown originated in the financial sector. Rural loans increased by only 2.5% between October 2016 and April 2017, compared with 12.9% a year before. The rate of growth in overall bank credit declined.The growth in industrial output in April was a paltry 3.1%, down from 6.5% the previous April. In the first quarter of 2017, the construction sector actually shrank, by 3.7%, over the previous quarter.All this augurs poorly for the months to come: as the agriculture sector slows down in response to low crop prices and the credit shortage begins to bite, overall growth will likely fall further. The state-engineered shock of demonetisation will continue to course through the economy.Demonetisation did boost the use of digital money, which is more efficient than paper money. But the government didnt need to put 86% of the currency out of circulation to achieve that. Demonetisation was too coarse an approach, and it accomplished too little while causing too much collateral damage.Indias economy has enormous strengths  such as high rates of savings and investment  and this crisis will pass. But just as sailors heading to sea disregard the winds and waves at their peril, economic policy makers cannot ignore the laws of economics, and intervene in the market with a blunt and heavy hand, without risking shipwreck.(The writer, the C Marks Professor of International Studies and professor of economics at Cornell University, was chief economic adviser to the government in 2009-12 and chief economist of the World Bank in 2012-16.)"

All the girls were rushed to the area hospital for treatment. Three girls were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the hospital as their condition was serious. All the students are said to be stable now.The girls who consumed hostel food in the evening started vomiting around midnight and they were immediately shifted in 108 ambulances to area hospital by the hostel authorities. It is learnt that they reportedly consumed potato and tomato curry with rice for dinner in the hostel mess after which they began to show signs of uneasiness.Parents of the girls, who reached the hospital after learning about the incident, alleged that the students had been complaining about the hostel mess' poor quality of food for a long time but the management ignored their complaints.According to sources, the students of the gurukul are not happy with the hostel mess food and in the past too such incidents have taken place, but of a lesser magnitude, and the matter was kept a secret. Students told reporters that though they have been complaining about the poor quality of food to the school principal, no action was taken to improve the quality.""Worms are found in the food often. We complained about it to the principal many times but he did nothing. The cook always makes unhygienic food,"" a student said.Though the students were rushed to the area hospital for treatment there were not enough doctors to attend them. The hospital superintendent had to request Bayyaram government hospital doctors to rush immediately to help them in treating the girls.Local MLA Shankar Naik, who rushed to hospital after learning about the incident, fumed at hospital authorities as doctors were not available to treat the girls. Joint collector and DEO, who also reached the hospital to take stock of the situation, expressed displeasure over the way the hospital was functioning. They pulled up the hospital superintendent for non-availability of doctors in the hospital during night hours.Deputy chief minister Kadiyam Srihari, who also holds education minister's portfolio, expressed anger over the incident and directed his department officials to immediately cancel the contract of the caterers. He directed district collector Preeti Meena to take steps to provide proper treatment to the girls.The deputy chief minister, who is touring Warangal rural district, also spoke to the hospital superintendent, who informed him that the condition of all the girls was stable and that they would be discharged by evening. He also directed the collector to take stringent action against the persons responsible for the incident.Meanwhile, Congress, CPI and students' union activists gathered in front of the hospital and demanded that the government take stringent action against the gurukul warden, principal and cook. They also wanted the collector to take action against the doctors for staying away from duty.The police have registered a case and are investigating. Food inspectors have collected samples consumed by the students for testing them in labs."
5a0dbd7b9855b76bf13d136b,What to blame for your stomach bug?,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/622010/what-blame-your-stomach-bug.html,2017-07-10,"What to blame for your stomach bug?Kate Murphy, International New York Times, Jul 11 2017, 0:03 IST'People tend to blame the last thing they ate, but it's probably the thing before the last thing they ate.'gut feeling: Most of us experience an ""acute gastrointestinal event"" at least once a year. While such an event may not need any medication, it tends to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. Reading the clues might reduce risk in the future. NYTIt happens like a bolt out of the blue. One minute youre fine, and the next you begin to sweat as crippling cramps move wavelike through your belly. You vomit or have diarrhoea, or both, fearing you wont live to see another day. And then it goes away. Youre back to your old self, maybe after a day or two of binge-watching Netflix, chasing dry crackers with ginger ale.The Centre for Disease Control and Prevention estimates this scenario, known as an acute gastrointestinal event, happens to all of us at least once a year. The bouts, while extremely unpleasant, usually dont occasion a trip to the doctor or require any medication.But such events tend to make us spin our gears trying to pinpoint what made us so miserably sick. While its hard to know for sure, there are clues that might help you determine the source and reduce your risk in the future. People tend to blame the last thing they ate, but its probably the thing before the last thing they ate, said Dr Deborah Fisher, a gastroenterologist and associate professor at Duke University School of Medicine.It takes the stomach around four to six hours to empty a full meal, and then the small intestine takes about six to eight hours to squeeze out all the nutrients and empty into the colon. The remains linger there for another one to three days, fermenting and being formed into what ultimately is flushed down the toilet. The so-called bowel transit time varies significantly from person to person, but gastroenterologists said you can easily find out whats normal for you by eating corn and watching for when the indigestible kernels appear in your stool.Gross, perhaps, but with that baseline, the next time you get sick, youll be better able to estimate when you might have eaten the offending meal. For example, if you throw up something and dont have diarrhoea or roiling further down, it could be that what made you ill was something you ate within the last four to six hours. If you wake up in the middle of the night with cramps and diarrhoea, its more likely something you consumed a good 18 to 48 hours earlier, depending on the results of your corn test.Most food-borne illnesses are caused by viruses or bacteria, such as norovirus, Staphylococcus aureus, campylobacter, salmonella, E coli and Bacillus cereus. So in addition to figuring out the correct time-frame of consumption, also consider what foods are more likely to be contaminated. Items cited frequently on the Food and Drug Administrations food recall list include leafy greens, culinary herbs, melons with textured surfaces like cantaloupe, fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, jalapeo peppers, nut butters, shellfish, frozen peas, cheese and ice cream.Also suspicious are any foods left out for several hours, like the classic potato salad at the family picnic or fried rice at a Chinese buffet.Restaurant food tends to be riskier in general not only because more hands are involved in the preparation but also because the ingredients are ordered in bulk. A fast-food hamburger could have meat from a hundred different cows, Fisher said, and it takes only one with a pathogen to make you sick. The eggs in your two-egg omelette were poured out of a carton so it could have come from 50 different chickens, she said.Similarly suspect are freshly made juices and smoothies which are extracted from pounds and pounds of produce. Just one speck of contaminated dirt in your detox drink could upend your gut. And think of all the hands that necessarily touched the produce from the time it was picked in the field to when it was chopped and crammed into the Vitamix.Lets not forget about germs on your own hands if youre not diligent about washing them with soap and water. Did you eat or otherwise put your fingers in your mouth after gripping the pole on the subway or after throwing a slobbery ball for your dog? Did you put your mobile phone down on the table at a coffee shop  or on top of the toilet-paper dispenser in a public restroom  and then put it up to your mouth to take a call? Germs that make it into your digestive tract dont always come from food.And sometimes your gut distress isnt caused by a germ at all. It could be an overdose of fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, known in public health circles as Fodmaps. These are essentially carbohydrates that, eaten in excess, are not well absorbed in the small intestine and then make their way into your colon to cause all kinds of trouble. They include myriad things were encouraged to eat including broccoli, brussels sprouts, radicchio, asparagus, avocados, mushrooms, peaches, whole grains and legumes.People are trying to eat so healthy these days, but a lot of those things are high in Fodmaps, said Dr Scott Gabbard, a gastroenterologist at the Cleveland Clinic. You could always eat a lot of salad, but on that certain day, that certain combination of fruits and vegetables in your salad was just high enough in Fodmaps that it overrode your systems capability to absorb those carbohydrates and you ended up with something almost like a purging.Gastrointestinal eventsDrugs are also a common source of acute gastrointestinal events. Fisher mentioned the story of an otherwise healthy and active patient who had bouts of GI distress every few months or so. After many tests came back negative, she finally determined it was the ACE inhibitor he was taking to control his blood pressure.A side effect of the drug is that it causes swelling in the intestines so he would get these temporary, partial obstructions, Fisher said. He would vomit and skip a meal and then the swelling would go down. It went on and on until we took him off that drug and now hes fine.Medications used to treat depression, allergies and gastrointestinal reflux can also make you more vulnerable to intense, short duration attacks of vomiting or diarrhoea, or both. Recreational drugs could also be the culprit. Were starting to see more cyclic vomiting syndrome called cannabis hyperemesis because THC content of marijuana now is so high, Gabbard said, referring to psychoactive component of marijuana.Finally, theres stress. Whats going on in your head has an enormous impact on your gut and vice versa. The human brain and nervous system is very intimately mixed with another nervous system that is present in the walls of the intestine, said D Santhi Swaroop Vege, a gastroenterologist at the Mayo Clinic.So instead of something that you ate, it could be youve swallowed your fear, anxiety, anger or sadness and its wreaking havoc on the nerves, chemical secretions and microbiota that keep your bowels operating smoothly. Gastroenterologists as well as psychiatrists said its not uncommon for acute gastrointestinal events to cease or become less frequent after a patient quits a bad job or leaves a bad relationship. Thats why, when making a difficult decision, you might just want to trust your gut."

This staple item is selling for Rs 70-80 in most parts of the city as well as Thane and Navi Mumbai.Citizens have been tweeting to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Devendra Fadnavis to take action. The holy month of Shravan began in north India on Monday. The fasting season according to the Maharashtrian and Gujarati calendar starts July 24. As families abstain from non-vegetarian food during this time, consumption of tomato rises.Traders have no explanation for the increase other than ""unseasonal rain"". They say the situation will continue through August. This is bewildering given that farmers were dumping produce in the streets as tomato rates crashed to Re 1 per kg a few weeks ago.In Andheri market, vendor Umar said, ""We are selling good quality fruit for Rs 100 because we are purchasing for Rs 75 in the wholesale market. This stock comes from Bangalore. The crop in Maharashtra has failed due to excessive rain."" Last week, the largest trader in APMC had cited a slew of reasons including ""demonetisation, farmers' strike and bad weather"".On Monday, buyers in Thane market, Bandra and Andheri restricted themselves to purchasing half a kg. Others chose to avoid tomato. ""The greengrocer cheekily asked me why I did not want to buy tomato since I had bought other vegetables. I retorted that at Rs 80 per kg, he was welcome to keep his produce,"" said Shiuli Banerjee of Malad.Kitchens are forced to explore alternatives. Borivli housewife Rosemary Fernandes recommended that households try vinegar while Maya Mirchandani of Andheri recommended thickening the gravy with sour curd or tamarind pulp. Banerjee suggested lime juice and kokum to add sourness, and gravies thickened with potato and cornflour to tide over the crisis.Prices of onion-tomato have maintained a steady average of Rs 15-20 per kg since 2014. In previous years, the country had seen a biannual spike in rates from March-May and October-December as traders cited ""seasonal shortages"" owing to the vagaries of monsoon. This inexplicable spike has brought consumers' worst fears back to haunt them."

It is strange that political parties in Punjab as well as Haryana shout a lot about this issue, but none talks about efforts to recharge ground water and rain water which are the main source of irrigation.Accusing parties of double speak, he added: paddy cultivation is a major contributor (to water shortage). However, farmers were given free demonstrations, seeds etc during green revolution to grow paddy, and now it has affected ground water. But all talk is about SYL causing water shortage. So in a way, it is double speak by political parties to cause tension among farmers of Haryana and Punjab. He went on to say that the his union believed that Haryana can be given little more water than the existing share from the already flowing canals and hence there is no need for SYL.However, Buta Singh Burjgill, president of Bharti Kisan Union (Dakaunda), disagreed. Punjab is short of water and we cannot share even a drop of water with the neighbouring state. We agree with this statement of Punjab political parties. However, they need to work on ways to reduce this water shortage.We are ready to shift to basmati crop which needs 25 per cent of the water needed by paddy crop and at the same time, we can also grow potato in between. However, we need MSP for both crops so as to switch. This will solve Punjabs water shortage and even the water war can be solved.He too said that SYL issue was being used to make farmers in both states fight among each other. Shingaara Singh Maan, president of BKU(Ugrahan) added, At the moment talk is about 28 per cent canal water and not about 72 per cent of ground water as source of irrigation. The topic needs to be widened beyond SYL canal politics, so as to end this water shortage in the state.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Our two-inch tongue rules our six-feet body. And the stomach takes on the role of a garbage bag, says the restaurateur. While Shettys two aforementioned eateries have been the go-to place for greasy dosas and cheesy pizzas, his new mission is to change the way we eat with his latest offering: Aharveda, located inside Golden Chariot.Aharveda has been decorated in warm shades of yellow with verses from the Gita and vedas painted on the wall and copper chandeliers above each table. The server welcomes us with a Red Roar (Rs 150) drink comprising carrot, beetroot, tomato, mint, betel leaves, coriander and gooseberries. Served at room temperature, the taste is of a Bloody Mary without the alcohol, we joke.Shetty, who started Aharveda, a food science company that conducts sessions of the importance of healthy eating, and using food to treat imbalances, shares an anecdote. We have gone to the moon, in the bargain we have lost our own powers. We understand everything other than ourselves. Picture this, theres a water tank with a faulty hole through which dirty water seeps in. This water goes to all the houses in the building. Every family, sends the sample for checking, pumps it with pesticide and insecticide to clean the water and uses it for consumption. Wouldnt it be wiser if we repaired that hole? says Shetty, who has created recipes that are an extension of his philosophy.Ahar means food in Sanskrit and it is really our medicine shop, says Shetty, offering us a cream of mushroom soup thats light on the palate, but not on flavours. Garnished with mushroom slices and a drizzle of coconut milk, we dont miss the usual onion, garlic or cream. The surprise is the pizza, with its crisp base of tapioca flour and a cheesy topping of cashew nut dust. It has everything and more a vegetarian pizza would have  olives, tomato paste and capsicums. Our eyebrows remain raised as we dig into the Mexican platter (Rs 350) of tacos, made with rajgira seeds and corn, and nachos served with a spicy salsa, guacamole, and a walnut and cashew nut sauce that replaces cheese.The Ahar Veda thali served on silverware has rice rotis, a roasted potato and corn cutlet, besan chura, rasam, cauliflower sabzi and sukka suran (elephant yam) and a serving of kheer. The offering is complete with pickled carrots (dried in-house by Shettys team and made in small batches so it doesnt need oil). The chaas (Rs 90) made from coconut milk is frothy and creamy.Shettys diversion into healthycooking began 10 years ago, when the teetotaller and non-smoker went to the doctor gasping for breath. All my parameters were abnormal, I had high blood pressure, uric acid, blood pressure, diabetes. What does health mean, I asked myself? recalls Shetty, who went on to study naturopathy. I am a second-generation restaurateur and I started working in the kitchen when I was in the seventh standard. So, I understand human emotions when it comes to food. I want my customers to believe that they can counter imbalances by choosing the right food, he asserts.If you head out to Aharveda, do remember, that their last order is at 8 p.m., as according to naturopathy rules, you shouldnt be eating later than that.Aharveda , Andheri West; 40722211/40722212"

This led to a banter in the House and even the chief minister was seen smiling.SP member Shailendra Yadav, however, found the reply absurd. Yadav claimed that out of the 325 legislators of the BJP and Apna Dal, 200 were turncoats who shifted loyalties during polls and such persons were giving absurd replies.In his reply later, the minister said that in UP there were 1,708 cold storages having a capacity of 130.26 lakh MT, which can accommodate 84 per cent of the potato produced. He said 120.29 lakh MT potato have been kept in cold storage this year.

I had stumbled upon the name while surfing the net. It sounded good, for on the menu were all kinds of interesting sandwiches and pasta dishes. But the problem was that I just couldnt find it.The address was 39 Meharchand Market. I found No. 39, but that was not an eatery. I walked up the stairs and knocked at a door, and found it locked. I came down, asked some peoplemost of whom were clueless. Then a good Samaritan asked me to try the back entry through a small lane behind the shops lining the main market. I followed the directions, and luckily found a small sticker that told me I was on the right track. I followed the sign, walked up a steep flight of stairsand finally I was in CJs Fresh.Interesting menuCJs Fresh is a take-away which does deliveries (Phone: 9910501234; email: fresh@cjsfresh.com). Run by a young lady called Chahat Jain, it has an interesting menuwith sandwiches, pasta, pizzas, burgers, fries, milkshakes and desserts. I had done my research, so I knew what I wanted even before I landed up there. I had seen a picture of a bowl of pasta with juicy pieces of bacon on it, so that was on top of my list. Then we had decided to have a vegetable sandwich, and a meaty one.The formercalled Getting Grilled (Rs. 280), comprised eggplant, zucchini, mushroom, cherry tomatoes, rocket leaves, smoked cheese, herbs and CJs secret sauce. The Ham and Cheddar Affiliation (Rs. 349 ) had roasted ham and melted cheddar cheese with aioli and herbs. The Carbonara Crewfor Rs. 349was a bacon, cheese and pasta dish.I got talking to a lady at the counter, and heard that the place was started by her daughter just four months ago. She had studied in the US, and had returned to India full of food plans. She now wants to start an outlet near Chhattarpur.It should prosper, for the sandwiches were excellent. The pasta was superb, creamy and cheesy, as Carbonara is meant to be, and the bacon pieces were juicy and plump and fried just right. I had asked for a wheat pasta preparation, so I felt quite healthydespite all the rich bits that had gone in itwhen I was done with it.Secret sauceThe sandwiches (grilled panini, focaccia or multigrain) were soft and full of goodies. The fillings were fresh, and the cheese had oozed nicely into the ham-and-cheddar sandwich. The veggie one had a burst of flavourswith rockets and cherry tomatoes complementing the smoothness of the smoked cheese. I dont know what their secret sauce is (its secret, so I didnt ask), but it certainly gave a zing to the sandwich.I am quite a burger fiend, so I want to try out CJs burgers one of these days. The descriptions sound good: Twisty Aloo Burger (Rs. 279) has a potato filling with mint mayo, mustard, lettuce, tomatoes, sauted onions and cheddar cheese; the Pork Pack (Rs. 379) consists of pulled pork tossed in sweet chipotle, pickled black olives and mozzarella and Gangsta Lamb (Rs. 399) has a lamb patty topped with a three cheese blend, pine nuts, caramelised onions, lettuce and herbs, in a special hung curd dip.The lady insisted that I try out a slice of their fresh cheesecake. I agreed, and found it delicious, though I thought it was somewhere in between a cheesecake and a souffl. The Cheesecake Monopoly is for Rs. 210, and they have, among other things, a peanut butter and white chocolate cookie coalition (Rs. 120 for two) and Mos Nutella Fried Oreos (Rs. 150 for 5 pieces).I like young people with big dreams, and hope their dreams all come to true. The secret sauce should do its bit."

For years while the price of the aloo went up and down, Lalu survived the ups and downs of political life. He led the Bihar revolution, sending the caste elite to the political guillotine and promising equality for all Biharis. But some became more equal than others and began to sing saala main toh saheb ban gaya.He was always cheeky; like when he declared he would make Bihars roads as smooth as Hema Malinis cheeks. Now Lalus fortunes have run into those erstwhile bad roads of Bihar as investigators accuse him and his family of accumulating benami property. The Yadav patriarch has been the Bihari voters darling shepherd but the voting public no longer offers sheep-like loyalty.His supporters say that under the comic act, Lalu is a political genius, the joker who always aces the political poker game. He was the cowherd prince long before the Sanghs recent gau raksha drive, but now as CBI and ED investigate him, have the cows finally come home for Lalu? For Indian netas, politics is a family business and Lalu seems no exception. Thats why its always appeared that Indias social justice parties were only dispensing family-based injustice. Remember how Lalu once nominated his wife Rabri Devi as CM even as he administered his jagir from jail? That was a case of Bihar being imprisoned in family law.Investigators say Lalu and his children acquired vast amounts of land. Even though he was once son of the soil, and always had happy landings, now it looks as if the ground has shifted under his feet. Lalus tenure as railway minister was hailed by Harvard but it was that very tenure that appears to have derailed the Yadav wagon.Lalu named his daughter Misa after the notorious Emergency era law but is now suffering a family emergency even as son Tejashwi who played cricket for Delhi Daredevils could be caught and bowled. Its the agencies that are pressing charges, but Tejashwis supporters are attacking the press. Lalus most famous photo-op was the picture of him milking cows but hes now accused of milking the system. Even if Lalu survives this latest round of allegations, its time there was an image makeover for the Secular Undivided Family."
5a0b64479855b76bf13ceecf,A taste of two cities,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-mumbai/a-taste-of-two-cities/article19291984.ece,2017-07-17,"The gastronomy of a city hotel can let you in to some wonderful secrets. Of a citys past and its imminent future, of its local flavour and its global mix. On my recent European sojourn, I discovered how contemporary epicurean trends of two cities defined its new ethos. London has finally become a firm Mecca of global epicureanism. A city that was scoffed at for knowing little aside from bangers and mash, fish n chips and, perhaps, chicken tikka masala, has a few surprises under its hat.On arriving at the The Shangri-La London, I was greeted by a swanky gold Bentley, then whisked to the 35th floor of Renzo Pianos looming Shard, the wind vigorously trying to break through the windows.Perched 128 metres high in the tallest building in Europe, with the moon by your knees and all of London at your feet, this was the perfect place to call my own little Shangri La.Yin, yang and LondonWith infinite views of the city, I finally got what its food really stood for  Brexit or not, its one that captures global spirit in the most generous way. The gastronomy at the Shangri-La Londons Tng was the perfect metaphor for the city  featuring its hottest modern European menu with a subtle Asian touch.Much like a performance, the meal began with salmon: beetroot, avocado, wasabi and ponzu paired with a blushing medium-bodied Chateau Plaisance Ros 2016 from Fronton in south west France, a blend of Negrette, Gamay and Syrah  the match complemented the fattiness and texture of the robust fish and ponzu. A prelude to my East-meets-West story of London.As did the wonderfully generous pork: barbecue carrot, barley, basil, potato and dashi paired with the aromatic medium-bodied Gewurztraminer Hugel Classic 2013, a white wine from Alsace, with low acidity diluting the natural salt in the meat and the fruity bouquet simmering the spice in the dish  a balance that can only come from the yin and yang.The very delicate halibut: kohlrabi, miso, chives, parmesan, orange was a multi-ingredient extravaganza, a sweet and sour sensorial experience complemented by the very clean and straightforward Chenin Blanc, Premier Rendez Vous, Jousset 2013 from Loire valley, full of oak and ripe stone fruit.As the sommelier-par-excellence Leonardo Barlondi whispered, the wine pairing is done keeping in mind every single ingredient on the plate and the cooking method. The Chocolate Delice Arctic Roll a humoristic ode to the erstwhile cassata paired firmly with a Hennessy XO.London brings globally-inspired gastronomy (with a nod to the East) to the forefront with all its mysticism and perfect harmony. It recognises the millennial need to be multi-cultural at the whim of a bite. At the cutting edge of creativity with the most magical view of the city, Tng is also possibly the most romantic dining experience in London.Discipline meets decadenceThe Shangri-La Hotel in Paris is perhaps its best kept secret. Tucked away in the quiet, historic 16th Arrondissement, in the erstwhile private mansion of Napoleons great-nephew Roland Bonaparte, it stands up to the classic hotels of the city with the best views of the Eiffel Tower. It is traditional French classical luxury redefined with Eastern hospitality.In a city that scores a high number of Michelin stars , the Shangri-La Hotel Paris extends deep reverence to mixology and gastronomy, the traditional French way with an Eastern discipline. The result  haute cuisine and mixology that endorses Frances deep-rooted tradition of food and wine in contemporary and au courant spirit.Roland Bonaparte was flora-obsessed and had the worlds largest private plant collection with over 25,00,000 specimens, and Le Bar Botaniste is the perfect ode to this legacy. Clment Emery, head mixologist, crafts the most bespoke and artisanal cocktails with plants and herbs. Think Sichuan peppers, tonka beans, even pine cones. On my little whim of tasting a Parisian summer, he created a blend of fresh apricots, mezcal del maguey vida (a distilled spirit made of agave), agave syrup topped with fresh organic lemon juice and lavender bitters. One sip (and a glass later), I had arrived at my destination. Next up, the Bumble Bee, a rosemary-infused cognac with organic lemon juice, honey from Provence topped with Fentimans tonic (the first botanically brewed light tonic water), absinthe and egg-white.Tradition meets modernityIt is an experiment in sheer decadence, but then Emerys cocktails are artisanal and intelligent, much like him. (His degrees in philosophy and french literature may have something to do with it.) I was high on just his clarity of vision of mixology  unusual flavours with balance, exciting and always lip-smacking, with the perfectionism of, well, a botanist. A wonderful tribute to Monsieur Bonaparte. And so French; playing with legacies to perfection.This was followed by a meal at the two-Michelin-starred LAbeille, helmed by iconic Chef Christophe Moret, giving a firm nod to the Napoleonic emblem of the bee (in design) and haute French gastronomy.Ensconced in a beautiful dining room across a secret garden, under the watchful eye of the sommelier, Matthias Meynard, we began our contemporary French odyssey with a delicate royal sea urchin and gold caviar glistening on the palate with Veuve Clicquot Vintage 2008. To heaven and back is perhaps the quickest way to describe the first course. The Cotentin Spider Crab with cucumber, almonds and caviar raised the momentum with a crisp Mosel Riesling Kabinett Josephshfer Von Kesselstatt 2008.The hero of the evening was the John Dory with sauted abalone,kachaand Le Croisic seaweed and salsa verde  crunchy, like spring in your mouth. Aided generously by the Meursault premier Cru Genvrires Michel Bouzereau 2011, you wish this course would last forever. The texture is full of surprises going from crispy to soft to more mature and glazed.A 36-month-old Comt from Haut-Doubs ended the two hour-long foodgasm along with French Alps cherries and Sakura tea, cured sheep cheese, clafoutis and fresh almonds culminating with the Muscat de Beaumes-de-Venise 2015. Trained under Alain Ducasse, Chef Moret sees life bursting in fresh produce, and he breathes a new culinary artistry into it. And it makes me want to sing my own little rendition of Edith Pilaf. With a culture that likes to hold on to its tradition while embracing modernity, LAbeille is what Paris is all about. And perhaps also the ultimate act of creation in France today.The writer is Managing Director Sothebys India and also a gastronome and oenophile. Follow him on @champagneboy75"

A lot, feels Nainital MLA Sanjeev Arya who wants change in the names of some weird-sounding tourist points in the Lake City: Suicide Point, Phansi Gadhera (hangmans bay in English) and Sadiya Taal (decaying lake).Arya plans to send a proposal to the state government for changing these tourist hubs names that evoke an uneasy feeling among tourists.We dont think these names give out a good message to lakhs of tourists who visit Nainital every year. I have sought suggestions from people (regarding new names for these spots) and also asked local activists to apprise me if there are more such (awkward) names in region that need to be changed, Arya told Hindustan Times.The BJP lawmaker said apart from Sadiya Taal, the others were not even registered names. For instance, the name Suicide Point was coined by guides and horse ride operators in the area just to attract tourists. Wed rather promote the spot for its huge potential for adventure tourism, he said.In fact, a few years ago, beautification work of Sadiya Taal took place after which it was decided to name it as Sarita Taal, but it continues to be known as Sadiya Taal among locals and tourists.The MLA has asked the local body to provide municipal records regarding the registered names of these places. I will then pursue the matter with the urban development ministry and (chief minister Trivendra Singh) Rawat ji to change the names, he said.Historian-activist Ajay Singh Rawat of Nainital said apart from the Suicide Point, a place that never existed, the other two spots have immense historical significance and hence their names shouldnt be changed.The name Phansi Gadhera symbolises our freedom struggle as the Rohillas -- who attacked Haldwani during the First War of Independence in 1857 -- were hanged by the British there. If they change the name, they will change history, Rawat asserted.Similarly, Sadiya Taal was called so by locals because it was originally a wetland and associated with the traditional water management system of the hills. Moreover, it is historically important as (the then Kumaon commissioner) Sir Henry Ramsay had introduced potato cultivation at Sadiya Taal for the first time in the region in 1856, so this name, too, should stay, Rawat said.Last year, residents of Chorgaliya (lane of thieves in English), a village panchayat in Nainital district, had launched a campaign to change the embarrassing name of their area."

Based on central government norms, we have decided to distribute Rs 205 crore among farmers in 11 districts, including Burdwan, the worst affected. Nearly 2 lakh marginal farmers will be benefited. The file has been sent to the CM and we hope the compensation will arrive soon,"" said state agriculture minister Purnendu Basu . The beneficiary will be those farmers who have lost 33% and more of their crop to inclement weather.The announcement was made on the day when knives were out for the BJP government over the farmers' killings in alleged police firing at Mandsaur in Madhya Pradesh.Doling out of compensation isn't new in Bengal given that back in March 2015, to ease a crisis in potato cultivation, the state announced that 50,000 metric tonne of the crop would be directly procured from farmers in eight major potato-producing districts at the rate of Rs 5,500 per metric tonne and Rs 550 a quintal.The government then distributed them to schools for mid-day meals and ICDS beneficiaries at the rate of 1 kg per head per week.Till April 21, 2015, 20,000 metric tonne potatoes were procured and farmers were paid. The same year chief minister Mamata Banerjee requested the Centre to waive the crop loans to potato growers for the 2014-15 season and to arrange for fresh loans for the ensuing Kharif season.Since 2011, the Mamata Banerjee government, said sources, had been distributing agricultural input subsidy worth Rs 1,336.43 crore among 32.83 lakh farmers for damage of crops due to natural calamities under State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF).Faced with disquiet in their states, the governments in Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and now, Uttar Pradesh, have also adopted the route, though they have apparently not been able to reign in the crisis yet."

The world of GoT is divided into four landmasses; the focus is on two of them  Westeros and Essos. Everybody is fighting everyone else to gain control of the entire landmass of Westeros, 3,000 miles long starting at the very cold north pole, and stretching all the way down a varied mixture of terrain and ending at the desert-like south. The land is separated physically into three main parts: the icy-cold North, the mid-region, and the hot southern desert. It is politically divided into two  the land Beyond the Wall and the Seven Kingdoms.I had to fill a GoT-sized hole before embarking to Northern Ireland with 16 other journalists the plots and subplots, characters, twists and turns were too many to try and cram before the trip, but one catches on, with the help of the internet. Looking at the trails popularity, I was thinking: Cricket and football are religion to their respective fans; Woodstock draws devotees of rock music and counter culture . Many such destinations have achieved cult status, and vistors here are no less devout than those who undertake yatras to conventional religious sacred spots.This is why special interst trails evoke so much interest in the traveller who is eager to experience something new, something he can relate to.The trail brings alive the story of dragons and queens, princes and villains, a make-believe of epic proportions set in a magical but grisly world that cocks a snook at logic and history. Its a mega tale that grows wild, demanding a huge suspension of disbelief.I wake today to a grey, rainy and cold day in Belfast, the starting point. But even as our coach winds its way along Northern Irelands famous Antrim and Causeway Coastal Route the skies clear up to make way for another bright day  just in time for us to savour the GoT filming locations en route.At the 17th century Ballygally Castle Hotel, we come face-to-face with GOT Door No: 9 (that opens into a restaurant  that depicts the famous battle between House Stark and House Bolton in the penultimate episode of Season 6. This beautiful carved door displays the House crests, Ramsey Boltons hungry dogs and Winterfell Castle.Cakes & GhostsThe afternoon Tea Menu at Ballygally Castle Hotel is a GoT junkies delight  you can order a Jon Snow cake or Winterfell Jaffa cake, Lannister rolls and other GoT-inspired dishes, before you experience the Ghost Room that is up a narrow, wooden spiral staircase. This is where Lady Isabella was confined by her angry husband  when she gave birth to a girl and not a boy  and trying to escape, she falls to her death from the tower window! Her ghost, they say, still hovers around here, a friendly ghost!On to Carnlough harbour where visitors photograph themselves at the harbour where Arya Stark gets stabbed by the Waif in Season 6, episode 7. Who is it who dramatically crawls up those cobbled steps from the sea..? Does that person survive?We move on to Cushendun Caves, in the Stormlands at the mouth of the River Dun. This is where the Red Priestess, gives birth to the Shadow in Season 2, episode 4, Garden of Bones. Mary McBrides bar  the smallest in Ireland  has Door No: 8,  that opens to the toilet!  depicting the Faceless Man, and tells the story of Aryas journey so far.The highlight today, is The Dark Hedges  an avenue of beech trees made famous by GoT as The Kingsroad, where, following the death of her father, Ned Stark, Arya escapes Kings Landing disguised as a boy. Travelling on Kingsroad in the back of a cart with Yoren, Gendry and Hot Pie, all new recruits for the Nights Watch, Arya starts her long and arduous journey north.The beech trees, planted by the Stuart family, in the 18th century, is the approach to the entrance to Gracehill House (that is now being converted to a hotel). At the Dark Hedges at dusk, you will not be alone. The ghost of the Grey lady  a lost spirit from a neighbouring graveyard  will keep you company!Two trees felled in a recent storm here were salvaged and made into ten beautiful doors that are displayed at different location in the area  featuring aspects of the GOT series  that are turning out to be major attractions. But that does not bode well for the surviving trees, whose roots are getting weak with all the newfound traffic on this avenue, and tourists wanting to photograph themselves here. So this will be made into a pedestrian-only avenue, to protect any danger to the legendary beech trees.Medieval FinaleThe next day, we are headed for the undulating County Down, with its little green hills (Drumlins), deer farm, sheep and the Quoile River, also touching a Christian heritage trail passing through Inch Abbey, dedicated to the patron saint of Ireland, St Patrick.Interestingly, corporate groups  including an IT group from India that won the trip in a contest  come here to bond and engage in confidence building activity, including learning to wield the bow and arrow (very useful, post nukedom). Were told the only challenge with the Indian group was controlling their selfie-taking sprees, including one that involved clicking selfies in front of an approaching helicopter! Imagine, getting decapitated at Winterfell, not by the sword but by a helicopter blade!Winterfell aka Castle WardForty minutes by road from Belfast, is the 1,000-acre Castle Ward, overlooking Strangford Lough, now better known as Winterfell of GoT fame, capital of Westeros, the seat of the ruler of the North and the traditional home of House Stark. We are welcomed and given oversized robes with fur collars that envelop you like a tent. How did they stay agile under such a bulbous garment?Ah, the Tower. The backdrop of many an episode, but hey, it looks rather different. Thats because GoT used Castle Ward and its Tower as props that were in turn propped by extensive computer generated imagery (CGI), completely transforming the place into a living, breathing, medieval scene.William, who runs Winterfell Tours, takes us around, reliving certain scenes, playing relevant clips on his ipad even as he explains how the imagery was done.Archery & DecapitationNext, we all have a go at shooting arrows at targets  and losers (who are far off the mark) undergo decapitation by winners, as they place their heads on a log of wood! Shooting an arrow looks very easy indeed but when one actually tries to do it, it is very difficult, having to coordinate vision, arm, aim and what not  it obviously requires a great deal of dedicated practice (Mahabharatas Arjuna, we are told, was an expert archer and his skill is recounted as being illustrative of the art of focus, dedication and practice).This is where the characters Bran, Rob and Robb practice archery in the courtyard with their father, Ned Stark  and Arya, bored with her sewing lesson, abandons her sewing, grabs a bow and annoys Bran by out-shooting him.Audleys Field & CastleRobb Starks Camp, Oxcross, was filmed here at Lecale, bordered by Strangford Lough and the Irish Sea on the north, east and south coasts. The castle originally belonged to a Norman family that came here in 1210.On the grassy clearing before the Castle (or what remains of it) and overlooking the beautiful Irish Sea, all 17 of us in the group are encouraged to fight,  were given (rubber) swords and of course, were already wearing our medieval cloaks, so theres no stopping us as we fly at each other, raging and screaming, pushing and stabbing.Inch AbbeyBack to the coach and on our way to Tollymore Forest we pass through Inch Abbey and Downpatrick Cathedral, the final resting place of St Patrick. The Cistercian Abbey ruins here formed part of the location of GoT and many scenes of GoTs Season 1, Episode 10, Fire and Blood, used Inch Abbey as Robb Starks camp at Riverrun.Tollymore ForestWe drive to the ancient forest where by a brook, Ned Stark and his sons find a dead stag which has gored to death a female Direwolf that has given birth to pups. The Stark children take the pups home. Next, comes the clearing in the forest where the deserter from the Nights Watch finds those dismembered Wilding bodies.We also take a look at the Vampire Tree, a gnarled, ancient tree with its limbs spreading out in crooked directions. Parts of the film Dracula and Frankenstein were shot here, too, were told. The 800-acre forest once belonged to one family, but is now with the government. The forest inspired C S Lewis to write the Chronicles of Narnia; he is said to have spent a lot of time here at the Mourne Mountains and Tallymore Forest, shaping the plot to his story.Banquet & WhodunnitThe action-packed day that began at 8:30 am culminates in an extraordinary dinner, with theatre actors chipping in at The Cuan, a charming Guest Inn run by Caroline and Peter. We are welcomed at the entrance by actors role-playing Jon Snow, King of the North and Tormumd Giantsbane, leader of a band of Wildings and trusted lieutenant of The King Beyond The Wall.Inside, the dimly-lit hall has tables with medieval earthen goblets and stone plates and serving dishes straight out of GOT. As the only vegetarian there, I get a special menu that is simply delicious, potato and blue cheese cutlets with veggies and rich, nut-filled bread slices.All through the dinner, the actors weave in and out, around the tables, mouthing dialogues from GoT, and finally, Queen of the Seven Kingdoms, Cersei Lannister, falls down suddenly, gasping, clutching her throat, and  dies. Who killed her?GoT storyline has many similarities with that of the Mahabharata, and so too, Bahubali the movie seems to have borrowed liberally from Got characters.The GoT plot thickens at every turn, no less complicated with all its palace intrigues, not unlike Greek and Indic epics, that are rich in not just the unbelievable but also in revealing the inticate maze of faith and deception, generosity and greed, compassion and cruelty that are all a part of each ones internal universe. No wonder sages say, truth is often stranger than fiction!"

Aamir, leader of the potato farmers, said: ""The government wants us to store our crop in cold storage. But the truth is that the price our crop fetches us is way less than the cost of keeping them in cold storage.""Yuduvir Singh, another farmer from Agra, said, ""We have been facing a loss for the last 3 years. Anyway we have to throw away our crops  so instead of throwing it there we are disposing them here to make the government understand how dire our situation has become.""Children of farmers who had committed suicide performed a play depicting the hardships that a farmer's family has to face. Pallavi, one of the children, said: ""If the Prime Minister can let the big people get away with debt, then why not us?""Addressing the protest, Rani, wife of a farmer from Tamil Nadu who had committed suicide after being humiliated by bank officials, said, ""The bank officials asked my husband how he was able to buy clothes for me if he was unable to repay his loans. Why is it always the poor who are humiliated?""Former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijaya Singh , who was also present at Jantar Mantar, talked about the economics of the movement. ""The latest policies of the government such as demonetisation have increased black markets that have affected the farmers' sales. They have also introduced plans like 0% import duty on wheat  destroying a major percentage of business for farmers."" He further said that ""This is the time to rise above party politics and support the farmers in their fight for justice.""Raju Shetty, farmers' leader and a member of Lok Sabha, on Wednesday raised the issue in the Lok Sabha and questioned Prime Minister Narendra Modi on the implementation of the Swaminathan Commission report. Shetty, who later walked out from the session, said, ""I do not want to stay in the House when it does not have time to listen to the sufferings of the farmers.""Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav said, ""It is almost like our political representatives live in a different universe. When it comes to voting they think that a farmer can be bought by their false promises.""V M Singh, convenor of the sangharsh committee, plans to take out four more Yatras across the country culminating in Delhi on Gandhi Jayanti. They promise to launch an indefinite countrywide agitation if the government does not respond to their demands by then."

He said small and marginal traders were never subjected to tax before.According to him, the imposition of GST on the sector will make it uncompetitive.CPI(M) leader C P Narayanan demanded that items relating to the disabled people should removed from the GST net.Another CPI(M) member Ritabrata Banerjee spoke about the complexities in the new indirect tax regime which came into force from July 1.Rajeev Shukla of Congress said there was lack of coordination between the Centre and the states on the implementation of GST.Besides the problems facing the textile sector, members also raised issues relating to the floods in Assam and Odisha and farmers' problems.Digvijaya Singh of Congress said the condition of farmers was worsening and farmers' suicides have increased by 42 per cent during the NDA rule.He particularly highlighted the fall in prices of pulses, potato and onion. He has also sought a detailed discussion on the farmers issue.Raising the issue of floods in Assam, Congress member Sanjay Sinh demanded that the government should start relief measures on a war-footing and announce a package after assessing the damage.His party colleague Ripun Bora criticised the BJP-led state government saying it has not prepared any contingency plan for tackling the floods.BJD member Dilip Tirkey demanded special relief package for people affected by floods in certain districts of Odisha, including Kalahandi.Naresh Agrawal (SP) expressed concern over ""vulgar"" and misleading advertisments being aired on television channels.He said there should be regulations to check such advertisements to protect consumer interest.Veteran Congress leader Motilal Vora asked the government to construct good roads along the Indo-Pak border in Punjab saying these were in very bad condition.Another Congress member Viplove Thakur highlighted the plight of women, allegedly being brought to Haryana from different parts of the country for marriage as the state's sex ratio was bad.She demanded that the government should take steps on the issue seriously.Deputy Chairman P J Kurien asked Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs M A Naqvi to take note of it."

They were joined by farmers from U.P., Tamil Nadu and Punjab.Shiv Kumar Pushpakar, ReutersI wish no parent does what my father did to me. At least think about your children before you decide to end your life, said 13-year-old Pallavi Pawar with an unmoved expression on her face and resolve in her voice.It was around a decade ago that Pallavis father, a farmer in Maharashtras Jalgaon, decided to commit suicide, leaving behind his wife and four children. Ever since, Pallavis mother has been working on other farms to make ends meet.Memories flash byI dont remember his face clearly, but there are moments that flash before my eyes. There are memories I have of my father when he was happy, when he didnt show the turmoil brewing inside him. Looking at my mother and sisters today, I think he should have discussed things with his family. There is always a way out, she said.Pallavi was one of the over 40 children and widows of farmers from drought-hit Maharashtra who had gathered at Jantar Mantar on Wednesday. They had joined the ongoing Kisan Mukti Yatra, as part of which farmers have demanded loan waivers and fixing of standard prices for their produce.Children dressed in white narrated tales of personal grief as placards reading Suicide is not the answer, Save our farmers, Farmers, dont commit suicide stood tall.The stories of these families were a grim reminder of how farmer suicides in India might just be numbers for city dwellers, but are harsh reality for children and women living in the rural belt  something they see almost everyday because of government apathy.Dont bargainWhen you buy vegetables and fruits from a farmer, you are quick to bargain for even Rs. 1. What you dont realise is that this Rs. 1 can be the difference between his children eating dinner or going to bed hungry, said Pallavi as she broke down.She continued, You will never know how much the heart of a father pains when he has to disappoint his children everyday; till one day he cannot bear it any longer and decides to end everything.Many such children who have lost their fathers stay at an ashram in Nashik, away from their homes, because their families cannot afford their upbringing.Little did three-year-old Sanju, who was guarding an earthen pot covered with a red cloth and playing with other children around, realise that the pot contained the ashes of his father who had hung himself two weeks ago after local money lenders started threatening him to repay a loan of Rs. 50, 000.Farming is riskySanjus uncle Raghu Ram, who was accompanying him, said that he was too young to realise the gravity of the loss. He couldnt help but point out how Sanjus entire life would be affected by the death of his father, who was the sole breadwinner for their family of eight.Farming is becoming a risky job. We do not want our children to live the lives that we are living. The government should think about the children and their future and do something to save our lives, he added.Eight-year-old Hari from Solapur said that he wants to be an engineer and help his mother escape the life of poverty.My mother tells me that if I study well I can help our family build a big house and buy a car, he said.Farmers from Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Punjab had also joined the protest with sacks of potatoes, demanding fair prices for their produce.We make a profit of Rs. 5 after selling a sack of potatoes. How can we feed our families and afford a basic living with this? The government wants us to store our produce, but the cost of storing is much higher than the return, said Amir, who was leading the potato farmers from Uttar Pradesh.Former CM presentFormer Chief Minister of Madhya Pradesh Digvijay Singh, who was also present at the protest, expressed his support for the farmers and their demands of remunerative crop prices and debt-free farming.

But all we get to see is a picture of the politician in the next days newspapers. Do they visit us to help us or to click selfies with us, he asked.On Wednesday farmers from Uttar Pradesh also raised their issues and said that government is unnecessarily putting financial burden on potato farmers asking them to keep the crop in cold storage without helping them financially. The government wants us to store our crop in cold storage. But the truth is that the price our crop fetches us is way less than the cost of keeping them in cold storage, Aamir, leader of potato farmers from Uttar Pradesh said.The protest was also addressed by a wife of a farmer from Tamil Nadu who committed suicide after he couldnt repay loan. She claimed that his husband committed suicide because he was harassed by the bank officials for not repaying the loan. The bank officials asked my husband how he was able to buy clothes for me if he was unable to repay his loans.

The Indian Express had earlier highlighted how farmers sold potatoes at 20 paise per kg at the Pipli grain market in Kurukshetra district. The situation was almost the same elsewhere in the state, too, as there was no mechanism to support the farmers  who were forced to opt for distress sale  even after a bumper potato crop.Khattar claimed that the government has fulfilled almost all the promises made by the BJP ahead of the Assembly polls. Transparency in recruitment for government jobs has been stated as one of his top achievements. It was painful when the youths had to look for sifarish for government jobs. We have changed that pattern to ensure jobs on merit, he said.For all the latest Chandigarh News, download Indian Express App"

Under the scheme, the premium to be paid by farmers is kept low and the claims are fully settled.Responding to a question in the Rajya Sabha, Singh said the settlement of claims during the two years preceding 2016-17 remained higher because of bad weather (drought). But claims in 2016-17 were less on account of good rains.""If States feel they are burdened to pay their share of premium to private insurers (during good monsoon period when claims are normally less), then we have asked them to set up their own insurance firms to implement the scheme,"" he said, adding that Punjab and Gujarat have evinced interest in this.Replying to another query on the coverage of the PMFBY, the Minister said efforts were being made to bring more farmers under the scheme. Earlier, only loanee farmers were eligible for the crop insurance, now non-loanee farmers are also allowed. Last year, the crop insurance coverage was 30 per cent and it will be increased to 40 per cent this year, he added.Replying to another question on action taken to improve farmers' plight and reduce the number of farmers' suicide, the Minister said the government has revamped the old farm schemes and launched some new initiatives to reduce the cost of production and increase income.Admitting that farmers are in distress because of good production year, the Minister said the government is lending support to farmers through various market interventions to ensure support price to their produce. Farm produce like tur and potato are being procured under the central schemes -- Price Support Scheme (PPS) and the Price Stablisation Fund (PSF) to protect the interest of farmers, he added."
5a071ea09855b76bf13c7d34,A homely pack,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/thiruvananthapuram/2017/jul/20/a-homely-pack-1631342.html,2017-07-22,"THIRUVANANTHAPURAM: Once upon a time there was a food pouch that made its way to schools, colleges and offices. A simple ethnic spread wrapped in broiled banana leaf, pothichoru could easily whip up a wave of nostalgia in every Malayali. Yes, there are city restaurants that provide Kerala meals or a full-blown sadya for that matter, but they lack that homely vibe.And if you crave that familiar aroma wafting out of the organic, green package, there are a handful of homemakers in the city who provide exactly that. It was during my study leave that I came across an online forum discussing pothichoru. I hesitantly ordered a lunch, fully convinced it will be a primped-up version of what restaurants offer. But the food turned out to be totally delightful with traditional dishes like mampazha pulissery and injipuli. And that heavenly smell when you open the banana leaf wrap... now I order it regularly, says Anjali, a student.The demandJaya had no clue of the market when she started making Kerala meal packets. It was her daughter Athira, a techie, who gave her the idea of home-cooked meals at your doorsteps. We put the details on facebook and the very same day I got a volley of orders. Next day, a couple of hours after delivery, I received a string of calls from happy customers. To be frank I was overwhelmed by the response, she says. Its the ever-growing demand that prompted Swapna Rakesh, an established home chef, to offer a few meals daily.With a solid number of followers for her blog and facebook page, she is a known name in the culinary circles. Homemade food is available in mobile apps like pinstove, but its a bit difficult for elderly people to order it through smart phones. I found there is a steady demand for traditional Kerala meals and thats how I started offering it. As of now I have a strong clientele, she says.Wrapped in nostalgiaThe banana leaf imparts a unique flavour, giving it a comfort food edge over meals wrapped in aluminum foil or parchment paper. Jaya believes in preparing the whole meal herself, just the way I cook for my family as she puts it. I chop the veggies the day before and wake up at 4 am to start cooking. There are people who want the food by 11, mostly for long trips. I dont have any helpers in kitchen and I always make a couple of extra meals for the homeless and the hungry, she says. Swapna says you cant fool the customers with homely tag if you are not providing exactly that. There is always a difference between home-cooked and mass produced food, she adds.The spreadCustomers who order pothichoru opt for simple meal packets, the traditional ones, without any fancy dishes. This is what you order when you are homesick. Adding some exotic side-dish will ruin the whole idea, says Hima, a government employee. Jayas meals, priced Rs 100, includes brown rice, tapioca, pickle, chammandi, thoran, avial, fish fry and fish curry. In addition to that there will be either sambar, pulissery, parippu, or theeyal. She charges an extra 30 rupees for delivery and usually customers call and place their orders a day in advance.If my daughter is at home she drives me around for home deliveries. Otherwise I hire an auto and if the place is too far I ask them to come and pick it, she says. Swapnas packets are couple combos, meals that are sufficient for two individuals. Each packet weighs more than 2 kilos. Brown rice, fish fry, thoran, potato roast, chammandi, inji curry, pickle, papad, fried mulaku and omelette are the regular dishes. Thoran keeps changing and then there will be pulissery or sambar. I charge Rs 185 for this, she says. The highlight of Gokuls homely meals is the range of seafood specials he offers. Orders come through the foodie groups online. Our pothichoru is veg and we usually add extra non-veg items including egg. Fish, mussels, prawns, karimeen and crab are offered according to availability, he says.Homely and healthyAll the home chefs insist that they dont add taste enhancers or colouring agents in the food. I use only good quality coconut oil and never reuse it. I also see to it that minimal oil is used to prepare the curries so that the meal is healthy, says Jaya. They usually make around 20 meals a day and dont take bulk orders. I dont advertise much as I cant really meet the demand. People want this because they are convinced of its quality. For me more than a business its an attempt to provide healthy and tasty food, adds Swapna."

More you drink, less you pay",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/bengaluru/2017/jul/22/the-bar-exchange-more-you-drink-less-you-pay-1631844.html,2017-07-22,"BENGALURU: Going out for drinks and dinner with your friends can really burn a hole in your pocket. But what if you found an option where the more you drank, the less you paid? Thats exactly what Bar Bar in Phoenix Marketcity, Whitefield, has to offer. The concept works like this, the more people on the table, the lesser your bill gets. As you order more drinks, the price of each drink goes down - this applies to Indian and imported liquor.While this concept has been tried, tested and succeeded in Pune and Mumbai, it is relatively new in Bengaluru, as the outlet is less than a month old. Whats more, they even have an E-Savings Calculator App, which the team has been working on for 8 months now, and they are finally launching this patented software only in Bengaluru to begin with.The focus is to ensure that the customer is be able to see his savings at every step of the way during the ordering process.Coming to the decor, Bar Bar boasts of rustic interiors, mostly woodwork, a lot of barrels and some dim lighting to set the mood. The outdoor seating area is perfect for a chilly Bengaluru evening out with your friends.The food is better than what one would expect at a watering hole. We were spoilt for choice, and were not disappointed with anything we tried. The chicken wings, though a small portion, were flavourful and cooked just right - we tried the Bourbon Barbeque wings, and licked our fingers till every last bit of sauce came off.The Zucchini Parmesana, rings of zucchini and parmesan cheese fried and served with a dip, is an excellent option for vegetarians and cheese lovers. The seafood is excellent at Bar Bar. We tried the Butter Garlic Chilli Shrimp and the Baked Cheesy Masala Crab - both were fresh, very well spiced and cooked to perfection. For those coming in groups, the platters are the best option.Available in vegetarian, chicken, seafood and pork, these are large and can easily be shared by a group of four. We tried the pork platter, called the Oink Oink Platter, which came with pork made in at least five different ways, and is served with potato wedges and coleslaw. The highlight, for us, was the pizza. Made in a wood fire oven, the crust is thin and crunchy, with a generous doze of mozzarella. We tried different toppings on the same pizza, and can say that this is one of the better pizzas in town. For dessert, we tried the Salted Caramel and Expresso Tart - it was large, soft and sinful. And while dessert and drinks dont always go together, just visiting Bar Bar for a meal alone is also a good option.Coming to the drinks, we loved everything we tried. Bar Bar offers a 750 ml cocktail along with bar snacks for just `750 - ideal for one or two people. Under this, we tried Fruit Loops - a cocktail of tequila, cranberry juice, apple juice, candy and plenty of cut fruit, which was pink, pretty and quite potent. We also tried The Lynchburg - a cocktail made from orange whiskey, Vodka, Triple Sec and Ginger Ale  perfect for those whiskey lovers. The Grapejito  a mojito but with grape juice - is ideal for dark rum fans who are willing to experiment a little. With a wide range of drinks to offer and the stellar deals on offer, drinking at Bar Bar is a really fun experience, which is also not hard on your wallets. The music is lively, mostly pop, hip hop and rock numbers from the 1990s and the 2000s, but they also have the space for live gigs. The staff is courteous and polite, and the service is much quicker than expected.All in all, travelling to Whitefield just to visit Bar Bar, is definitely worth it.Cost for two: Rs 1,200"

""The workers were given a day off to cool down and we arranged a mediation between the contractor , the workers and officials from the labour department. However, no FIR has been registered in the matter,"" said ACP Manish Sehgal.Around 2,000 workers are employed by Leighton India Contractors Private Limited that is constructing the condominium. A construction worker told TOI on condition of anonymity that their basic needs were being long ignored by the contractor and their repeated complaints to Leighton India's management had only fallen on deaf ears. ""The contractor earlier deducted Rs 600 a month from our salaries for meal, which was recently raised to Rs 900 a month. But we are still served the same menu, including a potato curry, everyday. The contractor never offers us even a single non-vegetarian dish,"" said the worker.The workers also alleged that there weren't enough buses to transport them to their camps, despite deduction of transportation charges from their wages. ""Moreover, the contractor only allots overtime duties to their favourite ones,"" said the worker.""We have asked the contractor to provide a non-vegetarian dish to workers at least once a week. Also, the workers said due to the shortage of vehicles, they had to wait after their shifts to go home. So, we have asked the contractor to increase the number of buses from 15 to 20,"" said Dinesh Kumar, deputy labour commissioner, Gurgaon.""We have also instructed the construction company to set up a grievance cell for all labour-related issues and resolve the complaints within 48 hours,"" said SDM Bharat Bhushan Gogia.However, when contacted, Leighton India denied any labour unrest at the construction site. ""There have been some queries with regard to altercations between the workers and their supervisors at the site. We would like to put it on record that those were minor in nature stemming from some misunderstanding and have been amicably resolved between the two parties,"" it said."

No, it’s time to worry",http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/jul/23/eat-drink--be-merry-no-its-time-to-worry-1632299.html,2017-07-23,"CHENNAI: Cigarette smoking is injurious to health but so is the sweetened soft drink, processed foods like noodles and chips with loads of salt and fried snacks that are part of any normal evening. Over the years, the harmful effects of consuming tobacco in any form have become clear to the masses and there has been a fall in the number of people taking up smoking. However, there is an alarming lack of awareness about the effects of fat, sugar and salt on the body, or the addiction that they lead to.We thus have parents who are mortally scared of their children getting addicted to smoking due to peer pressure, but do not hesitate before putting on an extra spoonful of chocolate spread on their toasts; buying them another bottle of cola or its supposedly healthier alternative, packaged fruit juice; or packing noodles and chips for lunch. This high intake of fat, sugar and salt  FSS, as the deliciously deadly trio is commonly referred to  has a significant long-term impact on public health, but there has not yet been any study or survey conducted on the Indian population in this regard.There are, however, enough indicators that reveal worrying details. According to the World Health Organisation, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are estimated to account for 60% of total deaths across all age groups in India. Now, the country has one of the largest number of people with diabetes, figures that shot up from 11.9 million persons in 1980 to 64.5 million in 2015 (study by Lancet released in 2016). Experts say the excess intake of fat, sugar and salt are the main causes for the rising incidence of NCDs like diabetes, cardiovascular diseases and hypertension  these three alone cause an alarming 40% of deaths in India. Much of these are preventable. For instance, the WHO says that as many as 1.7 million deaths worldwide could be prevented every single year if salt consumption is reduced to the recommended level of fewer than 5 grammes a day.From a health perspective, salt, doctors say, is a needless ingredient, as sodium is present in almost everything that we eat. From vegetables to meat and fish, sodium is there in everything we eat. We may add a little for enhancing flavour but most people add a lot more than required. For instance, salt is added while cooking rice in Tamil Nadu, said Dr Milly Mathew, senior consultant nephrologist, Madras Medical Mission Hospital. This extra sodium can lead to hypertension, cardiovascular diseases, kidney problems, stroke, diabetes and many other complications, she said. Diet plays a major role in preventing NCDs, added Dr Mathew.This excess is at its worst when it comes to processed food. In most cases in the West, says WHO, the excess quantity of sodium comes from salt in processed food. This could be true in the case of most in urban India as well. A few food items that Express checked left little for doubt. The smallest packet of instant noodles has 1.424g of sodium. That is about 60% or a third of the daily allowance from just one tiny, 79g packet of noodles that can be termed single-serving only. Similarly, a 100gm pack of potato chips has 0.742g of sodium, while it is 0.946g in the case of another popular potato based snack, aloo bhujia.Processed food, savouries, pappad, pickles, nuts, pizza and other bakery foods are also packed with a high content of sodium, said Meenakshi Bajaj, head dietician at Government Multi Super-Speciality Hospital in Omandurar Estate, Chennai, pointing out how most people end up consuming much more than a days allowance of sodium by eating these foods.The WHO strongly recommends that sodium intake should not exceed 2g (equivalent to 5g of salt a day). Remember that this quantity is for an adult; it is correspondingly less for children based on energy requirement. That is where a small pack of noodles pumps enough sodium into your child, making even the natural sodium in regular food excess. Put another way, this is the equivalent of nicotine tar inside the lungs but without the dark and sticky poisons repulsiveness.Equally dangerous is sugar. There are no studies here to prove that high consumption of sugar has a direct effect on diabetes. However, sugar, both in the form of plain sugar and mixed in food, is harmful to those in pre-diabetic stage and children, said Dr V Mohan, director, Madras Diabetes Research Foundation. The normal diet  vegetables, fruits, milk, and carbohydrates in chapati, rice etc  have the necessary amount of sugar required for the body. Anything above that could be excess, more so in the case of aerated drinks.One cup of coffee or tea will not harm anyone, but consuming soft drinks that are loaded with sugar is dangerous. A 330ml drink of the popular cola contains 33g of sugar. This is one of the leading causes of obesity in children, added Dr Mohan, who is also the chairman of Dr Mohans Diabetes Specialities Centre in Chennai.This is particularly significant in Tamil Nadu where the incidence of diabetes is alarming. In the State, 10% of adults in the rural population are diabetic. It is higher  15%  in urban areas excluding Chennai. In Chennai, 25% of adults above the age of 20 years are diabetic, and about 40% of diabetics are under 50 years old, said Dr Mohan, adding that the number of pre-diabetic persons would be double these numbers.The prescribed limit as per the basic calculation is that a person should consume about 30 calories for each kg of body weight, explained Dr K Kannan, president, Chennai Chapter Cardiology Society of India. A teaspoon of sugar is about 5g, which would give you 20 calories.It thus is no wonder that the bottles of cola that you drink are firmly deposited around the belly, leading to obesity, diabetes and heart diseases before long. Among the FSS trio, fat is an exceptional one as recent research has shown. There have been studies about the dangers of fat, and there is also better awareness when compared to sugar and salt. But what research has proven now goes beyond this layman understanding.When researchers at the University of Washington, Seattle added sugar to different types of dairy products ranging from skimmed to heavy cream mixed with safflower oil, the test subjects preferred the skimmed one the least. It had little or no fat. When mixed in the right measure with sugar and/or salt, fat becomes the X factor that takes the combination to the next level, the bliss point, the palate version of hitting the spot. It also creates an effect similar to any narcotic addiction.Compared to tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of FSS are evident but almost unacknowledged in the country. While there is a ban on advertising tobacco and liquor, there is no such restriction on advertising these FSS-rich foods that primarily target children.There is enough anecdotal information as well as direct conjunctures that raise concerns. But in the absence of scientific data, a policy decision cannot be taken, said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Director General of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).We in India lack good data on the dietary pattern of consumption of fat, salt and sugar, and there is no data available on trans-fat consumption or its level in the blood. This is really a risk, she added. The council is moving towards surveying the dietary pattern of the population for a better understanding of the effect of FSS. That would be the starting point.Death by fats Death by fats Death by fats Compared to tobacco and alcohol, the dangers of FSS are evident but almost unacknowledged in the country.

""The prices of paddy have crashed but the prices of rice have not come down, the prices of cotton have crashed but the prices of clothes have not come down, the prices of poplar have crashed but the prices of plywood continue to remain high, the prices of potatoes have crashed but the prices of potato chips continue to go up, prices of tomatoes have crashed while the prices of tomato sauce continue to rise,"" Hooda said.There are around 433 villages in Mewat and farming is one of the primary occupations in these villages. Being a backward district, the farmers have been battling poverty here.""The Union government has imposed 18% goods and services tax on pesticides, which is a cause of worry for farmers as it increases the cost of the final produce,"" said Sulaiman, a farmer.The farmers also said that they were not paid the full price of their produces. ""While the tomato is being sold for Rs 90 a kilo in the retail market, a farmer only gets 50 paise a kilo in the mandi.

The only source for villagers, who mainly depend on jowar (sorghum) cultivation, is the rainwater flowing down from the hills around. Even the hill stream slowed down due to a dry spell three years ago.A change in the matrix introduced by a 29-year-old college dropout saved the parched village from a crisis. Nasri Chavan suggested that the crops be grown in rows instead of columns. Earlier, when the lines were straight, water from hills could not be retained in the fields. With horizontal plantations the water stayed and the dry spell could be managed.All farms in the village are right at the foothills. Outlets were dug to let water flow from one field to another. Chavan bagged the state government's Krushi Bhushan award for innovative farming. The prize was handed by chief ministerDevendra Fadnavis over last week.""Today as much as 1,800 hectares farms have adopted the practice. Earlier, we could hardly manage to earn Rs50,000 a year, nothing could be saved. Now we get around Rs1.5 lakh purely from jowar cultivation,"" Chavan told TOI.Chavan came up with her own formula of organic fertilizers, adding cow urine, dung, neem leaves and other similar ingredients. ""If horizontal lines saved water, the fertilizers helped increasing the output. I shared the formula with others and some have now shifted to the organic manure. A majority still use chemical fertilizers though,"" she said.""With little income from farming, buying costly chemical fertilizers hardly left any savings in hand. This prompted me to search for an alternative. Using the organic manure doubled the output at 10 quintals an acre,"" said Chavan who tills a five-acre plot along with her father.She is among the seven from Amravati division to have got the awards last week. The division covers Akola, Amravati, Yavatmal, Washim and Buldhana districts.After Sachin Sarde's father underwent a heart surgery, there was no one else in the family to look after the farms. ""My elder brother is physically challenged so I had to discontinue studies and take up farming. Water is scarce in our area and soyabean is the main crop. I took a risk and started cultivating bananas which is a water intensive crop, and succeeded,"" he said. Sarde is also a college dropout from Shirpurjain village of Washim district.Apart from using a sprinkler system through a bore well dug in his farm, Sarde used a select combination of seed sand fertilizers which gave a higher output.Ravindra Metkar of Masla village in Amravati had only one acre of land on which he ran a poultry farm. Using the profits he increased the holding and chicken waste generated from the poultry farm was used as fertilizers. ""I could gradually increase the holding to 35 acres, for a yearly turnover of Rs15 lakh,"" he said.""When I first started farming, I used the fertilizers made out of chicken waste on an experimental basis. The results were evident in the size of plants. I began with cotton and have now diversified to fruits and spices also,"" added Metkar.Cotton and soyabean are the main crop of large part of Vidarbha. Himmat Tappe, tried to venture out in potato and ginger cultivation apart from horticulture. This earned him a yearly profit of Rs15 lakh from 20 acres of land. ""Even during lean times, the profit is as much as Rs10 lakh,"" he said.Laxmi Parvekar from Savana village in Yavatmal shifted to surgarcane, rose and banana farming in this otherwise cotton belt. Banana trees were grown using tissue culture roots. ""The plants bear fruits in 10 months instead of 18 month time taken in other varieties,"" she said.(With inputs from Viraj Deshpande)"

It started in October when Delhi-based queer rights activist Sharma tied up with Chez Jerome, an expert in French and Indian cuisines. The French chef later stepped down and handed the reins of control to Sharma and his Italian partner Roberto.For Sharma running the cafe comes with a responsibility. ""I have to make sure that this cafe is not specifically for gay men because they already have many spaces in the city where they can hang out. They are dominating queer spaces all around the city,"" he said.With a small dance floor under an open sky and seating for around 30 people, the cafe usually opens in the evening. The menu, inspired by French, Greek and Italian cuisines, could compete with any eatery in the city.On offer are a variety of salads, omelettes, pastas as well as thin crust pizzas with traditional toppings and dips. Specialties of the house include Greek chicken potato salad, a delicate mix of potatoes, onions, tomatoes and chicken salami, Parisian salad dressed with fresh lettuce and fresh parmesan and freshly baked breads.But it's not all about food. With events like book reading sessions and trans nights, Sharma wants to sensitise his customers about queer rights beyond Section 377  the Indian Penal Code section that criminalises sexual acts ""against the order of nature"".""Obviously, the cafe is not any NGO but it also not a place where people should only come to enjoy. I want to utilise this space to revolutionise the struggle we are going through in India. The transgenders, lesbians and hijra folks of our community need more such spaces,"" said Sharma.Despite falling under the broader queer umbrella, gay men stand out from others in the trans community. As a result, transgenders don't feel safe even in those places where they should be welcome, he said.Delhi is amongst the few cities in the country where late night parties in five-star hotels welcome people from the queer community. But few trans people make it inside the elite doors. Simran Shaikh, a transgender and senior programme officer at Sexuality Gender and Rights at Alliance India, echoes Sharma and welcomes safer places for the community but associates the profound segregation more with ""class"" than ""gender"".""The segregation among the LGBTQ is only of class and not of gender. The discrimination happens when you are not associated with a particular class of a party. ""I don't foresee any such changes with these cafes and bars. There will still be class differences in particular parties where there might not be trans identified individuals,"" she said.According to LGBTQ activist Harish Iyer, homophobia within homosexuals is ""rampant"". ""It is sad but true. Just because one belongs to an oppressed community (queer) doesn't make them sensitive to everyone else. Gay men rule the roost in many spaces.""I think some gay men have an issue with effeminacy. It is just another form of misogyny that runs deep in our society. Some do so, so that they don't get noticed as gay, in the company of those who look gay,"" the Mumbai-based activist said. Praful Baweja, who is also based in Mumbai and is an activist, hopes that the workshops he has been organising will change things for the better for the community. ""Usually when one is looking for employees in any company, the person wants them to be trustworthy.Praful Baweja, who is also based in Mumbai and is an activist, hopes that the workshops he has been organising will change things for the better for the community. ""Usually when one is looking for employees in any company, the person wants them to be trustworthy.The question of orientation is usually hidden. With workshops we are trying to tell people from the community to not be bothered by their orientation. ""Usually MNCs have a diversity and Inclusion unit where gender issues are addressed, but in smaller companies they may not have such a facility,"" he said.""Through workshops we want to educate even trans people about company structures and how they can contribute in starting small scale businesses. We are also trying to facilitate information of people within the community so that they can connect to each other,"" he added. More spaces like the Q Cafe, they hope, will help in strengthening this connect."

Prices are likely to increase further in coming days, said vegetable traders, adding that monsoon arrived late this year which led to poor crop of seasonal vegetables, while heavy rains later damaged the produce. Tomato was worst hit by rainfall in Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh.Seasonal vegetables hit by unfavourable weather conditions include brinjal, ladyfinger, bitter gourd, colocasia and potatoes.

Another wholesale dealer Kripal said, ""The supply has yet to normalise, hence cost of tomato and other vegetables will increase further.""Vegetables that have become cheaper are those which are grown locally or within the state. There was a glut since the produce could not be sent to other states because of heavy rains, so their prices went down. Also, these vegetables don't have a long shelf life, so vendors are selling them for less.Housewife Pooja Rastogi said, ""The hike in prices of tomato and potato is pinching most as there is hardly any dish one can make without these two. I have started using readymade tomato puree, 1kg of which costs between Rs 70-90, whereas raw tomato is at over Rs 100 per kg.""

Mahindra & Mahindra Managing Director Pawan Goenka during his meeting with the chief minister said that his group was keenly interested in promoting electric vehicles in Punjab.He suggested a scheme to bring in electric taxis to propagate green energy and generate employment in the state. Amrinder said that his government was keen to explore electric vehicles as a replacement for the traditional, more polluting petrol and diesel run vehicles in the state.He pointed out that Chinese energy major Yinlong also recently discussed with him the possibility of launching electric cars and buses in the state. The government was also in talks with Ola for electric taxis, he added.An official spokesperson said that a proposal to launch an Uber-like app for tractors, called Tringo, was also discussed at the meeting. The app would enable owners to rent out their tractors, said the spokesperson. The chief minister responded favourably to Goenkas request for expansion of their tractor units in Punjab and asked the company to submit a proposal.Urging the company to support the states efforts to provide employment to youth, the chief minister offered help to Tech Mahindra in setting up a BPO in Mohali after Goenka said there was huge potential for IT sector jobs. Mahindra & Mahindra was also interested in potato seed development for exports, according to Goenka.The chief minister also reminded Goenka of his suggestion, made to Anand Mahindra in Mumbai, for setting up a defence project in Abohar. Goenka, according to the spokesperson, said the company was exploring the same. The chief minister said the government was also considering the companys proposal to develop the Ranjit Sagar dam resort.Taking forward from their Mumbai talks, the two sides also discussed an Uttar Pradesh-like Dial 100 emergency response system for Punjab to provide prompt integrated emergency services to ensure public safety for all, including those with special needs. The chief minister said the Home and Police departments were studying the proposal.Mahindra groups plans to set up Mahindra world university in Ludhiana also came up for discussion.

Farmers are unable to reap the benefits and consumers are feeling the pinch.As farmers cant sit for an entire day in the market to sell their produce, they sell the harvest in wholesale market at a price demanded by the middlemen.Middlemen get a maximum of 70% and minimum of 50% profit for the tomatoes brought by farmers. Seeing the demand for tomatoes, middlemen and retailers have hiked the prices. Few farmers said middlemen decide the price to a large extent.We toil in fields but the profits are taken away by others. As tomatoes cant be kept for more than three days, we have to sell it at the best available price, said a farmer in Dharwad.We sell a basket of 8kg tomatoes for about `350-`450. We also have to pay for transportation and labour charges. But in the retail market, the same tomato is being sold at `100 per kg. We sell tomatoes to middlemen as they take the entire quantity at one go, he added.Horticulture Department deputy director S B Diddimani said, Vegetable prices go up every year. But this year, the prices have gone too high. They may come down and get stabilised in another 15 days.Scarcity of rain and decrease in sowing areas are the reasons for price hike. Once tomatoes from districts like Belagavi and Kolar start arriving in the city market, the burden of price hike will be eased, he added.The middlemen at the APMC yard say they are blamed whenever the prices go up. Many retailers buy produce on credit. We pay labour charges to distribute the vegetables. We hardly get `50 to `60 profit a basket, they said.Potato farmers in Hassan a worried lotHassan: Potato farmers in Hassan are a worried lot as they incurred crop loss consecutively for five years. Moreover, the growing area of potato by small and medium farmers has been drastically decreased from 61,000 hectares to 10,087 in 10 years. Statistics available with Express show that small farmers who cultivate on less than five acres have switched over to alternative crops like maize and ginger due to crop loss. On the other hand, the farmers who are cultivating on more than five acres have leased out their land to Ginger growers. Horticulture officials are anxious as the certified seeds supplied by the department in 1,266 hectares were damaged due to dry spell.

The reason they cite is illegal occupation of some sheds in the wholesale market because of which several tomato traders have been sitting on a dharna.""We have been protesting for the past six days and met labour minister Gopal Rai on Tuesday, asking that the illegal occupation of our sheds be stopped. However, we have been given no assurances and on Friday, we will go on strike,"" said Anil Malhotra, general secretary of the vegetable traders' association.On Tuesday, about 2,000-2,500 tonnes of tomatoes arrived at the mandi against a normal arrival of about 12,000-16,000 tonnes. Sources said there was a country-wide shortage of tomatoes due to heavy rain in several states and only produce from Himachal Pradesh was reaching Delhi. ""Tomatoes sold for Rs 70-80 per kg in the mandi on Tuesday, which means that in the retail market, one can expect prices to rise to Rs 110 or even Rs 120 in the coming two-three days,"" warn a trader.While the shortfall was expected, the agitation by tomato traders has resulted in an even lesser arrival of tomatoes, said Metha Ram Kriplani, another trader. ""On July 20, APMC issued notices to companies that have illegally occupied seven tomato sheds and two sheds of mausambi. That is a clear acknowledgement that their occupation of the said sheds is illegal. Despite that, no action has been taken against them till now,"" said Kriplani. ""We want our sheds back and want action against officials who have colluded with the encroachers. Unless the encroachment is removed, we will continue with our strike on Friday.""Minister Rai said that he met representatives of both camps on Tuesday and the best solution that he had for this problem was to reallocate the sheds. ""If one camp is claiming that the other has occupied sheds illegally, then this is how sheds have been occupied in the mandi for years. I have spoken to officials as well and now the allotment will be on the basis on payment of market fees. Space will be allocated in proportion to market fees paid. The same exercise had to be carried out with the potato and onion traders as well,"" he added."

Picture by Prashant Mitra Inundation of several roads and bridges is threatening to snap the supply of essential commodities, including fruits and vegetables, to Ranchi and jack up prices in the wholesale and retail markets. Sources in the transport circuit said a bridge over Koel river in Basia, Gumla, went underwater on Wednesday, leaving 100trucks bound for the capital stranded at various locations. Similarly, rainwater flowing over a bridge near Bero in Mandar block has halted the supply of essentials coming from Lohardaga and Daltonganj (Palamau). ""The Ranchi-Simdega road, which extends till Odisha, is out of bounds for traffic since the Koel bridge was inundated. We have suspended all buses (around 30) to Simdega and beyond. At least 100trucks bringing supplies from different states are stranded,"" said Kishore Mantri, the general secretary of Ranchi Bus Owners' Association. Mantri added that vehicular movements on Ranchi-Lohardaga and Ranchi-Daltonganj routes were as badly hit. Suresh Kumar, who drives a bus on Ranchi-Daltonganj stretch, said a portion of a small bridge near Pakhria in Chanho on NH-75 was witnessing erosion. ""Portions of the bridge have become very narrow, leading to long snarls. More rain can snap this link too,"" he said. On Ranchi-Hazaribagh-Patna route (NH-33), a landslide threat has emerged near Chuttupalu valley in Ramgarh after heavy rain loosened boulders. The Ranchi-Bokaro road via Sikidiri and Ranchi-Silli road are also out of bounds owing to flooding of a bridge and road cave-in in Silli two days ago. Sunil Chauhan, vice-president of Ranchi Goods Transporters Association, said consignments from Bengal had remained affected for two-three days. ""Potatoes, vegetables and flowers come from Bengal and other states to Ranchi via Baharagora, and this link has taken a beating. Vegetable prices are likely to rise,"" Chauhan said, adding that roughly 100 trucks brought essential items to Ranchi and more than 50 were stranded. A senior official of a retail supermarket chain said for three days now, they were facing crisis of vegetables. ""Our stocks come from Silli and Gola, but many roads and bridges have been washed away along the route, and there is no supply. In Brambe (on Ranchi's outskirts), where we do bulk procurement, local markets are closed owing to incessant rain. We are somehow managing with vegetables bought from Pithoria,"" he said, adding that almost all their outlets in Ranchi and Jamshedpur were facing the crunch. ""For our 50-odd stores in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, we require 10 tonnes of vegetables a day, but are doing with less than half the stocks."" The humble potato will soon be too hot to handle, the supermarket official warned. ""Potatoes mostly come from Bengal. As per norms, they are first dried after being taken out of cold storage before being dispatched. Heavy rain in Bengal has hit stocks,"" he said. In retail markets, the price of tomato has shot up to Rs 120 notwithstanding the state food and civil supplies department's order to FJCCI to cap the rate at Rs 80. Green vegetables like beans and cauliflower are acting pricey too. Beans are selling at Rs 30 per 250gm while a small cauliflower also has a price tag of Rs 30.

Traders have warned of a further increase in price if their protests continue.Two sections of growers, each accusing the other of having occupied the sheds illegally, have been sitting on dharnas at the wholesale market for a week. The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) had issued a notice to one section on July 20, saying ""it has come to our notice that the following firms have illegally put up their boards at some tomato sheds even as they have no permission from APMC Azadpur, nor has there been any change made by the Tomato Traders Association"". The notice gives them three days after its receipt to remove their boards.""If APMC has issued them notices for illegal occupation , why is the government bent upon reallocation of sheds. We stand by our decision to go on a strike from Monday because we believe that vested interests have prevailed upon the government to take this decision,"" said Metharam Kriplani , a trader.The notice issued by the government, after meetings with both sets of traders on Tuesday, says that fresh allotments of tomato sheds will be made on the basis of the market fee received from individual commission agents in the past three financial years  2014-15, 2015-16 and 2016-17. ""This will be done on the pattern of allotment made for potato and onion trade,"" said a senior government official."

With prices hovering around Rs 100/kg since about a fortnight now, the humble tomato  which is scientifically a fruit but commonly known as a vegetable owing to its rampant use in cooking savoury rather than sweet meals  is giving a fright to the common man. While vendors at some of the local markets claim that the price hike is due to interrupted supply because of the rains, those in the food business are among the worst hit. With tomato prices going through the roof, many are resorting to substitutes like canned puree and ketchup, leading to their dwindling stocks at various departmental stores.Gurleen Singh, owner of Hindusthan Dhaba , said they are bearing a loss of 3-4% at the moment. ""We are hoping that the situation will get better in the coming weeks. If the crisis persists, we will be forced to increase the price of our dishes by `5-`10 on an average,"" he said, explaining that gravy items, especially makhnis, are cooked with fresh tomatoes. However, Rahul Arora, proprietor of Paranthe Wali Galli , said their business remains unaffected as they don't use fresh tomatoes and cook with tomato puree instead.""We get our stock of canned tomato puree and since the price of that has not increased, we are not feeling the pinch,"" he told us. Chef Rangan Niyogi seconded Rahul as he said tomato puree is indeed a preferred ingredient in Indian kitchens. ""Readymade tomato puree is a great help in times of crisis. It can be used for churning out a variety of dishes. Generally, we use fresh tomatoes in numerous Indian dishes, like chicken butter masala, dal makhni, methi saag, aloo dum etc. But, currently I am using tinned tomato puree in place of fresh tomatoes and Kashmiri mirch in place of red chilli powder to make them taste close to tomato. However, in case of tomato chutney, it's not possible to substitute fresh tomatoes. For making tomato or minestrone soup, I am using carrot and tomato puree in place of fresh tomato. While carrot lends the vegetable flavour, tomato puree helps in getting the right taste and colour of the soup,"" he said.According to local vendors, tomato prices shooting up during this season is a common occurrence as rains spoil the stock. Tomatoes that have a shelf life of 3-4 days are hard to stock up at a time not many farmers have access to cold storage. Chef Joymalya Banerjee , however, feels the crisis is ""created"". ""Monsoon comes every year and it's not believable that the entire stock got ruined due to exceptional rains. Yet, there's a dearth in supply. So, if I ask vendors to deliver 5 kilos, they are giving only 2 kilos. This has been happening for the past two weeks,"" he said. The chef added that he doesn't believe in passing the burden on to the consumers. ""Everyone in the restaurant business keeps a buffer. For example, if the making cost of a dish is `10, it's sold at `30. For the loss of a rupee or so, it's not feasible to hike the price of a dish. There was a time when potato prices were hiked to an extent that some biryani makers dropped the aloo from the dish. That was juvenile, as it's not fair to victimise consumers all the time. I will hike the prices only when I can't bear the burden anymore,"" he reasoned.Though tomato prices started coming down on Wednesday and were available at `80 a kilo at some places, online grocery platforms such as Big Basket and Grofers continued to sell the kitchen must at over `100 a kilo. It was `109 a kilo at Big Basket and `110 a kilo at Grofers on Thursday. Cherry tomatoes and the organic variety came at `280 and `172.50 a kilo respectively."

(Prashant Mitra) Ranchi, July 28: A day after a five-storey cold storage crumbled in Kanke block fanning speculation of flawed design and construction, VegFed Jharkhand today filed an FIR against Airtec Cooling Private Limited, the Faridabad agency that built the structure in 2010 and is currently raising an expansion wing. Jaidev Singh, managing director of state co-operative VegFed, said charges in the FIR ranged from negligent construction to possible use of substandard material. ""We have now asked National Farmers Club Co-operative Society (the Bihar agency running the cold storage since 2015) to clear the debris and salvage stocks (of potatoes and corn). As far as I know, they have arranged for a crane and gas cutters,"" he said, adding that the worker reported missing yesterday had been traced to a nearby area and was safe. Kanke thana OC Rajiv Ranjan said the FIR was filed under Sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 409 (criminal breach of trust by a public servant), 418 (cheating with knowledge that wrongful loss may ensue to person whose interest offender is bound to protect), 420 (fraud) and 34 (common intention) of the IPC. Asked who would cover the losses, Singh added that according to their agreement with NFCCSL, the latter should have insured the stocks, which was worth Rs 4 crore. State co-operatives registrar Vijoy Kumar Singh said to fix accountability for the loss, the probe team of the building construction department was expected to submit its report in a day or two. ""The probe will reveal the lapses to facilitate action,"" he said. After the 5,000sqft property on 20 decimal land at Arsande-Sarpanch Toli in Borio, 15km from the capital, collapsed around 2am yesterday, a district official, who had conducted a preliminary inspection of the spot, squarely blamed faulty design and use of substandard materials. ""Pillar thickness should be between 16mm and 20mm, but here it is not more than 10mm. Also, the pillars have no iron skeleton. Similarly, the roof is devoid of iron beams. A thorough probe may reveal more gaps,"" he had said. Chairman of NFCCSL Pawan Kumar, on the other hand, accused the state of dilly-dallying relief. ""The stocks of potato and corn are perishable. The government is neither salvaging the sacks from the debris nor allowing us to do so,"" he said, adding that they had sought help from the NDRF too, but were refused. A district official said the NDRF's job was to rescue lives and not remove vegetable stocks from debris. ""The NDRF was called to inspect the area. The administration has asked VegFed to clear the debris, which in turn has asked the NFCCSL to do the needful,"" he said, adding that guards had been deployed at the cold storage to prevent pilferage."

The protest is against the government's decision to reallocate tomato sheds with a section of traders blaming another group of illegal occupation of these facilities.""About 85-90% of the mandi is likely to be shut. Some commission agents may continue to operate but almost everyone has promised to join in. We informed growers about Monday's strike last week. Trucks that were due to arrive at the mandi on Sunday night or early Monday won't come,"" said Metha Ram Kriplani, a vegetable trader.Last week, after meeting both groups that have been blaming each other of encroachment, development minister Gopal Rai had announced that the reallocation would be done based on the market fees submitted by traders over the past three years.""There is a cartel that needs to be broken. The government had earlier seen a similar problem with onion and potato traders and was successful in breaking those,"" said a senior official. As far as Monday's strike is concerned, he said, it is being done by a small section of traders and the government is not anticipating any severe disruption.The section of traders that has called the strike said the agricultural produce marketing committee (APMC) had sent a notice to the other side, saying they should vacate seven tomato and three mausambi sheds that they had illegally occupied. ""If there was a genuine misunderstanding, why would APMC issue them the notice? It is a clear proof that even the government found those traders in the wrong. In that case, why is there a reallocation of sheds?"" asked a trader.The strike, if it is as severe as traders claim it would be, may impact availability of fruits and vegetables and their price. The city is already witnessing a sharp rise in prices of tomatoes and onions due to reduced supply during the monsoon."

We sample flinty Basque txacolis at ostentatiously trendy pintxo bars. Drink tall, chilled glasses of Mahou, the capitals popular pilsner, with crackly bags of potato crisps. Then, we discover vermouth, heady, herbaceous and deliciously pungent, served with a bright tangle of orange peels. Were hooked.Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankees Spanish song Despacito is the countrys current soundtrack, blasting with equal fervour in clubs and supermarkets, and vermouth is its contemporary drink of choice. Despacito, an essentially Spanish track, has been sexed-up, glossed and accessorised so skilfully that it has become the worlds most streamed music track in just six months, with about 4.6 billion plays across streaming platforms, according to Universal Music. Similarly, vermouth, once proudly provincial, is being downed in bars from London to San Francisco, in its current slick, urbane, updated avatar.At a traditional bodega, sweltering with packed crowds, in Madrids arty Lavapies district, we drink it at the bar standing up, along with Patitas de Calamar, freshly fried squid feet. In the citys cavernous indoor markets, filled with raucous families, we hurriedly down a glass (or three) between buying bushels of juicy cherries, sticky pista nougat and paper-thin slices of Jamn ibrico.From grannys closetAt the immensely Instagrammable Mercado de San Miguel  a glamorous bartender serves it on tap, sliding our glasses across the bar along with a bowl of addictively tart green olives.This used to be the drink of our grandmothers, she says, before attending to a group of excitable Japanese tourists, who attempt to order everything off the menu. The options are sweet and dry. If youre a first-timer, she suggests you go with the sweet version. Served with a splash of soda and twist of orange peel, the drink is bright with an alluring chorus of synchronised flavours. Im familiar with it as a cocktail ingredient  it is essential in Martinis, Negronis and Manhattans  but really comes into its own when treated as the headliner instead of just another spot boy.This is an aromatised, fortified wine, flavoured with botanicals. Manufacturers start with a neutral grape wine, then add alcohol and a signature blend of about 40 or more, often bitter, botanicals, which include herbs, roots, barks, flowers, seeds and spices. The most notorious of these is wormwood, also present in absinthe. (Incidentally, vermouth is derived from the German word for wormwood, which is wermut).Italian originsThe drink was first produced in Turin, Italy, in the mid-18th Century, according to liquor historians (and what a fun job that must be!). Italian and French blends have defined the drink internationally, some of the best known brands are Italian Martini and Rossi, Cinzano and French Noilly Prat. Spain, however, has some very high quality versions. There are those made by established companies, usually in Reus, like Yzaguirre and Miro. There are also seasonal, hyper-local producers making Spanish vermouth, which is lighter and sweeter than the Italian and French versions.You can order yours extra-dry white, sweet white, red, amber and even as a ros. Admittedly, the extra-dry versions take some getting used to; theyre sharp and austere. Dry has a touch more flavour; think of an arid land in spring time. Then comes the sweet variety, reminiscent of a lush, moist, tropical forest.In America, the Quady winery makes Vya, an artisanal version that uses botanicals from India, Albania, Russia, Spain and Morocco. Australian Regal Rogue range marries a Hunter Valley Semillon with native lemon myrtle, desert limes, thyme and elderflower. The Ethicurean restaurant in Somerset has a house vermouth called The Collector, which incorporates 20 botanicals grown in their garden, including bay, rosemary, and yarrow. In London, Mele e Pere, which has been making its own version for five years, even has a vermouthier-in-chief called Ed, who teaches customers how to blend their own for 25 a night.Guide to vermouthAt a bookstore in San Sebastian, I stumble upon Ester Bachs Romagueras Gua del vermut (Vermouth Guide). The lady who runs the bookstore spots me flipping through the Spanish book, and insists I visit Bar Roberto for a drink. This is where I finally learn how to make the perfect cocktail: and it stars vermouth, of course.In the tiny wooden bar, which is standing room only, the friendly proprietor hands me a complimentary gilda, comprising deftly skewered mellow guindilla chillies, anchovies and olive, then pours out a sweet vermouth with a flourish. His bar blackboard lists about 20 varieties, and the shelves behind him groan with bottles from all over the world. He adds ice cubes, bitters, netted orange zest and an olive-laced toothpick. I take a sip: Its like rain in a jungle on a warm summer day.A loyal Roberto customer smiles and says, I have eaten a smoked sardine and drunk a vermouth that has lifted my beret. (Or at least thats what Google Translate Spanish to English says.) Honestly, I couldnt have put it better.Incidentally, vermouthis derived from the German word for wormwood, whichis wermutmost expensive MartiniLast year, a Scottish distillery created a Martini worth 50,000.

Bullied by the Dragon on the east, who constantly threatens war on the flimsiest of grounds. Pestered by the eternal enemy to the west, who is emboldened by the support it receives from the Dragon as well as by its impending victory in Afghanistan.India has a friend in Israel. Other than that, it really doesnt have a friend in the world. But Israel has its own constraints. It is too small. It makes great arms, but of the bits-and-pieces kind. Befriending Israel has allowed India to get on the right side of the influential American Jewish community.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia may not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.But Americas Jews have been unable to prevent America from dumping Israel for Iran. Israel became livid with Obama. But Trump is honouring the Iran deal. And then Israel craves recognition from its enemies, many Muslim nations. Already the Saudis are buddies with Israel. What happens if they recognize Israel, and then Pakistan follows suit?In any case, Israel is too small, too besieged, too far away from India to come to our aid in any substantive fashion in case of a conflict with the Dragon.If the conflict with the Dragon explodes into anything more than a mere skirmish, expect the eternal enemy to jump into the fray. Pakistans media is eerily silent on the friction between us and the Dragon. Now that the generals are fully in charge of the country, they are not going to sit idle in opening a second front. It would represent a dream opportunity for them.So what should we do? Just follow what the expert of realpolitik, Indira Gandhi, did. Kiss and make up with the Russians. Boris Yeltsin admittedly was openly derisive of India. That made Messrs. Rao, Vajpayee, and Manmohan, turn by turn, spurn the Russians for the allure of the US.But what has true friendship with the US got us? Empty platitudes such as natural allies, strategic partners, and little else. Sure we got the nuclear deal, but the Americans, just because their own reactors are defunct and outdated, keep pushing more and more liability down our throats.Trump came to power promising to curb H-1Bs and launch a trade war with China. He has done none of the latter, but has gone after H-1Bs with full force. H-1Bs constitute our major export to the US. Today we have Heinz tomato sauce instead of the earlier-perfectly delicious Kisan, Lays potato chips instead of Indian versions, and Coca Cola and Pepsi instead of Thums Up and Campa Cola.American goods have flooded India, and keep flooding in more and more. India has an upper middle and elite class of 150 million which can afford anything that the 100 million American middle and upper class can. America is saturated as a market. India represents a new America to the Americans. Thats why they drool all over us with idle lip-service.America has not got us what we want  a UN permanent seat. Nor have the British and the French. Yet we keep buying major arms and goods from them. We should close our markets to them unless and until they get us the UN seat. Even so, they will not come to our aid in case of conflict with our neighbours.Thats where Vladimir Putin and Indira Gandhi come in. Putin has been cold to India. He is miffed at us for abandoning him for the West. But Leonid Brezhnev was no easy customer. And Indira was able to bear hug him to save us from the Americans.Our first port of call for any major arms supply should be the Russians. We should consider signing a treaty of friendship and eternal cooperation with them just as Indira did. The effect on the Chinese will be immediatethey will back off. We should buy arms from the West only if the Russians cannot supply them to us.And we should close our market to American goods unless and until Trump sees sense on the H-1B front. Enough of flaky diplomacy. Its time for realpolitik. Enough of having had our eyes glaze over by the allure of America. Russia made not be nearly as cool, but it will come to our aid in times of crisis like America never will.Lets just do what Indira did in 1971 and made India proud of her. By doing so, we will make her proud of us."

KarthikeyanAcute drought owing to failure of the southwest monsoon has left thousands of potato growers on upper Kodaikanal hill in distress.With no rain till July end, potato growers in Gundupatti, Mannavanur, Klavarai and nearby villages on the hill have left their land barren. This has led to a sharp decline in the total area under potato cultivation.A few traditional potato growers, who have little ground water source, have shifted to garlic, which requires less water and maintenance. But they too are struggling to protect the standing crop.The district received 3.06 mm rain in July, 90% less than the normal rainfall of 30.6 mm. The situation was the same in June.Rain water is a must to energise potato crop, which grows on slopes. We should have sown the seeds after the first showers of this monsoon, said S. Sivakumar of Gundupatti village, 45 km away from Kodaikanal town. Periodical showers since sowing are also essential to protect the crop. Shortage of rain will affect size and quality of the potato.Potato cultivation is a costly affair, he added. We had to invest heavily. Seeds are imported from Mettupalayam. The price of a seed bag cost Rs. 5,000. At least, we need 10 bags to raise the crop in one acre.Farmers had a better yield two years ago, with the procurement price at Rs. 25 a kg. We hired trucks and mini lorries in Kodaikanal town to transport potato to the market, he recalled.Sivakumar suffered a huge loss of Rs. 9 lakh last year because of drought. Each farmer had to shell out at least Rs. 1 lakh to raise potato crop. The yield should have been at least 400 bags, each 45 kg, to get reasonable returns. But it was less than 20 kg. The crops withered completely. By this time, sowing should have been over. But it is barren now, he rued.Several acres of land, traditionally under potato cultivation, in Gundupatti remain barren. Not even 10% of the potato growers have raised the crop this year. Similar situation prevails in other potato growing centres on Upper Kodaikanal. The hill station has been reeling under drought for the second consecutive year. Scanty rain haunts Kaunji, another major potato production centre.However, farmers, who have little ground water source in Kookal panchayat, have shifted to garlic. Despite the drought, those who had managed to harvest garlic last year enjoyed good returns. They too are struggling to protect the standing crop today.Talking to The Hindu , Horticulture Officer Shiny Divya said: Farmers may go for sowing till September or even October. Sharp showers in the last 48 hours may cheer them to sow. But delay in rain will affect quality of crop."

It is interesting because it is a country still recovering from a genocide and, this fictional account, is told through the eyes of a UN staffer Joseph.The book is an intimate sketch of a country and its people, and it weaves their history into this narrative seamlessly. For example, you meet the driver Tulong and know that his slowness in responding to answers could come from a cunning. He may not have forgotten that a wrong answer -- like confessing to having read a piece of stray paper or taking an extra serving of watery rice gruel -- once had resulted in days of lashing and being chained to a plank. But Tulongs kindness and capacity for affection have survived the horrors, and he like other Cambodians sees aid agencies as deliverers.Cambodia was one of UNs success stories, says the author. The agency was key in transforming the country, after the Paris Peace Accords in 1991.But Joseph does not deny the historic injustice done to the country by the very same agency, when it allowed Khmer Rouge to represent the country in the UN. The agencys policies where largely driven by the US, says Joseph, who served 20 years with the international agency. Since Cambodia was liberated from the Khmer Rouge by Vietnamese, arch enemies of US at that time, the UN sided with the genocidal group. As the saying goes, my enemys enemy is my friend.One observation the author makes is that none of the people he spoke to, during his decade in Cambodia, ever admitted to being part of the Khmer Rouge regime. They always spoke as victims, he says. But I got the sense that few of them were actually perpetrators of the horrors.There was a man who told Joseph about betraying friends to save yourself. They were served rice gruel twice every day and occasionally, like when there is an anniversary, they are given a piece of potato with it. A seven year old saw a piece of potato fall to the ground and picked it up. He was being watched and, before he could be caught, he dropped it into his neighours bowl. The other boy was locked up and beaten for a week. The author got the feeling that the narrator was the boy who betrayed the other.Knowing that they might have been the perpetrators did not change my attitude to them, he says, it changed my attitude to me. I realised that even you and I are capable of such evil. If we are asked to arm ourselves, and control and abuse our fellow men, we might do it to.The book is mostly written in a light-hearted tone and even has jokes about UN staffers making up mission reports even before boarding the flight to the destination. This is an exagerration, says Joseph, adding with a laugh, it does happen... but not as often.Joseph, who wrote the book to get people to know Cambodia, says that the toughest thing about writing ficiton is to make it interesting. I also keep taking lanes and bye-lanes (turning away from the main narrative) and then I have to keep coming back to the main road, he says. He does this effectively, without breaking away from the central theme. oseph is the son-in-law of former Kerala minister KM Mani. He was reported to have been dismissed from government service while on one of UNs missions. But he vehemently denies this. I was not dismissed, but I was deemed to have resigned... there is a world of difference, says Joseph. He says that he had referred a dated IAS manual (printed in 1988) and believed that he had a leave extension. But the government informed him, much later and abruptly, that his resignation has been noted. In 1992, the leave rules had changed. I was shocked, a tragedy of circumstances, he says."

Kolkata is known for its trademark roll, a sumptuous snack where chicken or mutton pieces sauted with onions and masala are rolled inside a layered and flaky paratha, and served wrapped in thin paper. The snack was conceived by a small restaurant named Nizams near Hogg Market, Kolkata about eighty years ago, arguably as food to be consumed on the go.Initially it was known as kathi roll, because kebabs inside the rolls were charcoal grilled on wooden sticks or kathi. However, over the decades, as the snack became increasingly popular and roll centres mushroomed all over the city, partially cooked meat finished on a tawa started mostly being used instead of kebabs. A large variety of rolls have evolved in the last couple of decades with eggs added to the paratha, and a vegetarian version using potato or paneer as stuffing. The trend of using tomato or chilli sauces in the filling have also become common, much to the dismay of a puritan like me. One of the reasons of popularity of this street food is that it can serve as a utility lunch, evening snack or dinner. You can customise your roll by adding more layers to it, starting from a simple chicken roll and scaling up to the double egg double chicken version.It is fascinating to see a Kolkata style roll being prepared right in front of you. Freshly rolled out layered and flaky paratha is fried in oil on a tawa. For an egg roll, egg is added on the paratha while frying. The filling is prepared separately with meat, onion, optionally veggies like capsicum or cucumber, and a masala  for the last one many shops have their own proprietary versions. Then the paratha is deftly rolled with this filling, and sauces, lime, chopped chillies and dry masala added as per customer specification.In Hyderabad, the Kolkata style rolls have been popularised by Roll Call, that started as a kiosk selling rolls in Madhapur from 2002. They now have roll centres all over the city. Jayeeta Majumdar Singhee, one of the partners at Roll Call mentioned that apart from the authentic rolls from Kolkata, they have also introduced spicy versions like Chicken and Paneer 65 rolls for the local Hyderabadi palate. Overall, they have around 30 variants of rolls with versions like cheese rolls, seekh kebab rolls and reshmi kebab rolls and the rolls are also easy on the pockets priced at `50-100 range. Roll Durbar in Gachibowli, Amantran in Domalguda and Kolkata House in Kondapur are some other places to enjoy Kolkata style rolls."

The new menu, which is for only a month at Smoke House Deli, offers six varieties of meats. There is the one Roasted Chicken and Classic Sauce Supreme and Potato Cake, which is served with potato, mushroom, tomato, cream and cheese. Chicken is juicy, abounding in creamy flavours of mushroom while the skin remains delightfully crisp.The potato cake layered with thin slices and sandwiching cheese and egg oozes, when cut, to compliment the fibrous chicken. Boiled tomato gives the meal an acidic twist. Grilled Rib Eye steak, with beef, is served with carrots and asparagus tossed in butter. The ribs are directly grilled without marination so the mild flavour of the meat is retained. Sauce Robert, a brown mustard sauce, is poured over the beef and the brown sauce tastes sharply of onion and butter, the two primary ingredients of Sauce Robert.The meat is hard and chewy, with a sour cream topping the taste balances out. Now onto the Pan Grilled Quail served with Spaghetti Chicken Bolognaise; expect an attractive presentation. The roasted quail nestles on classic spaghetti. The first bite is smoky and bitter and the taste lingers to turn sweeter. Quail tastes like chicken but the flavour is stronger. Minced chicken tossed in spaghetti and harmonised with zesty red wine makes this delectable.Almost similar in style but distinct in flavour is the Pan-seared breast of Duck and Soya Chilli Noodles that bursts with flavours of chilli and garlic. The tangy orange sauce has been tossed with noodles along with chunks of orange. Over this is placed glazed and juicy duck meat. The salad served to the side has lettuce, barley and duck feet, a refreshingly new combination.Besides the bird variety, Crumbed Lamb Cutlets and Mint Pesto is another surprise because this is the only meat in the menu that is fried in butter and not grilled. Caramalised, juicy and crisp, the lamb is cooked to perfection. Grilled Fresh Pork Chops with Home-made Hash Brown is shallow-grilled pork ribs and is medium-rare. The chewy and salty flavour of the pork meshed well with smokey cake-like Hash Brown. Cost for two: `2,000"

Our friends had called us over, but I  down with a nasty bug  couldnt make it. So they packed for me a big consignment of biryani from Behrouz. You may recall that I wrote about Behrouzs biryani once. It had been delivered home even before we could say gosht, and I remember how I enjoyed their kofta biryani  peppered with little mince balls.The friends generous package carried us over the weekend. And it also reminded me of the biryani that I had eaten just a few days before that  at the Press Club of India.The Club had a biryani festival. And I had some exceptional biryani there. I discovered that the biryani had been catered especially for the club by the Corporate Master Chef of the Clarks Inn Group of Hotels, Sunil Soni, and his able assistant, Junaid, who comes from a bawarchi family of Aligarh.I know biryani lovers are the most quarrelsome group that you can ever find in India, perhaps even more than mango aficionados who can never agree on what could be crowned as the king of the fruit. Likewise, those who like their Hyderabadi kachchey gosht biryani have nothing but scorn for the Awadhi biryani fan club, which, in turn, thinks the Kolkata biryani lovers should get their heads examined. And then there are those who know and love their south Indian biryanis, and shrug and say, Oh these northerners.I think the time has come to judge the biryani not just by its origins, but by the taste. Not everybody who does kachchey gosht ki biryani does it well, and some of the so-called Kolkata biryani outlets in Chittaranjan Park should be told that one potato does not maketh a Kolkata biryani. The true test lies in how good the biryani tastes.And the ones that had been prepared by Soni, Junaid and their men were simply outstanding. I had some of the Hyderabadi gosht biryani and Awadhi chicken biryani. Both were finger-licking good, and that was the unanimous opinion of our four-member household.One reason, of course, was the rice, which was of exceptional quality  long-grained and aromatic, as well as cooked to perfection, which each grain occupying its own glistening space. The meat had been cooked and spiced just right. The rich flavours came from the yakhni  stock  that had been used while the rice was being cooked. And Chef Soni tells me that some stock was also used while the meat  chicken or lamb  was being marinated with spices.The flavours of the biryanis had been enhanced with a touch of pan ki jad, which is powdered and added to the dish, and ittar. And the mildly sweet flavour came from rose petals and plump raisins.I also had the most delicious dessert I have eaten in recent times. Its called gulatthi, and is prepared with thickened milk, khoya, nuts and a bit of saffron. Unlike phirni, it doesnt have rice in it. So the flavours and texture come from the nuts and the khoya. This is a dish that is especially popular in the Aligarh-Rampur area.The biryani at the club was offered at subsidised rates, but Chef Soni (9810380519) and his team can cater for large parties, where a plate of biryani may cost Rs. 400-500, depending on the number of people and other such factors.Now that in every corner of the city you have someone selling some kind of biryani, the dish has been losing its appeal because of the substandard offerings in many of these places. These days, for instance, the moment I see a sign that says Moradabadi Biryani, I am reminded of the flavour of pickle in the rice. And let me tell you its not a happy thought.But this biryani has strengthened my belief that there are unknown jewels still waiting to be discovered. Seek, and we shall find."

The restaurant has introduced a new menu that includes signature Italian dishes and exotic ingredients. For starters, we were served Fungi misti e Formaggi, Chicken crostini and Calamari, acciughe e fritti di Gamberi.Fungi misti e Formaggi is a platter of mushrooms mixed with fresh greens, walnuts, broccoli and cheese. It has the nutty flavour of walnuts, bitterness of blanched broccoli and the earthy flavour of grilled mushrooms, and comes with an Italian dressing. The Chicken crostini has grilled pesto chicken, olives, onions, bell peppers on a crunchy Tuscan bread served with mixed greens. The olives neutralises the cheese. Smothered in a creamy, basil pesto, it brings out the char-grilled taste of the chicken. It serves as a comfort food.The Calamari in Calamari acciughe e fritti di Gamberi is crunchy and chewy. The crispy soft prawns in the platter goes well with the dip. It is served with french fries and salad. To cleanse our palate, an intermediate course of fruit sorbets topped with mint leaves are served. Next comes the main course. The Risotto aifunghi misti e porri has mushrooms blended with leek risotto prepared with truffle oil. Warm and starchy, it is healthy and makes you feel good. It's a dish that you can have during the rains. The Chicken scaloppini has thinly sliced chicken breast with truffle-flavoured mushroom wine butter sauce, grilled mushroom, tomato and buttered creamy spinach.The platter has garlic mashed potatoes and rosemary grilled veggies that includes broccoli, beans and cauliflower. The mashed potato is a favourite. Even people who do not prefer potatoes, would love it. It has a dominant pungent taste of garlic.The Burro di Dory e aranciapan is a fried polenta crusted John Dory fish with lemon couscous, spaghetti of vegetables, tomato salsa and orange butter sauce. The dish is not bad but it did not meet our expectations.The fish looks crunchy but is not. The vegetables in the noodles adds crunch to the dish. It has grainy Mediterranean khus khus. The desserts are the highlight. The Salted Vanilla Cheese Cake is the best of the lot. It looks so colourful and appealing that you don't want to disturb the presentation. Served with ice cream, the cheesecake platter also has strawberry sauce. Most Americans prefer to have the cheesecake topped with this sauce.But, people here might not take to it and, hence, it is served on the side. The Chocolate, Banana crepe is nice. The thin crepe is smooth. It is caramelised right. The chocolate sauce does not overpower the taste of the banana. It is served with almond Praline and Vanilla ice cream. The Strawberry and Chocolate Ganache Tart has crumbs of red velvet. It is buttery. The outer layer of the tart, made of bisuits, adds a creamy crunch to it. Cost for two: `1,500"

RamakrishnaG._RamakrishnaVegetable prices in the city have soared owing to poor rainfall last month and late arrival of loads from other states and districts. While rates of common vegetables and tubers including tomatoes and potatoes increased by 50% in supermarkets in the city, rythu bazaars too witnessed a 30% hike in prices.On Monday, tomatoes price in a Punjagutta-based hypermart was at Rs. 70 per kilo, while the corresponding price at rythu bazaar was Rs. 60 per kilo. The price of tomatoes in the last week of July was Rs. 50 per kilo. Similarly, baby potato was priced at Rs. 45 per kilo whereas it was Rs. 30 per kilo for the regular variety.Vegetables including ladies fingers and beans were very costly on Monday, with the former priced at Rs. 69 per kilo and the latter Rs. 112 per kg. Onion price, however, was at a constant of Rs. 30 per kilo in supermarkets and rythu bazaars.The weekly budget of most households have gone up, thanks to the price rise even as families tried to minimise spending. In July, there was a sudden price rise which dipped marginally in the last week. But again in August, prices have gone up with essential vegetables costing more than their prices in July, said Venkat Reddy, a resident of Rethibowli, who came to shop at rythu bazaar in Mehdipatnam.Homemakers who manage the household budget said that they have had to make do with lesser vegetables to balance out. We end up buying more tubers than fresh greens. It causes inconvenience to ageing parents who need vegetables more than protein rich tubers, said Vanaja Laxmi of New Mallepalli Colony.Farmers, who brought their produce to the rythu bazar, however, said that their returns declined with consumers buying less than usual.There is a shortage of tomatoes and beans due to poor rains. And then with rains, transportation and storage became a problem, said N. Nagamani, a vegetable seller in Mehdipatnam.Due to fall in prices at the procurement end, several farmers had to dump their produce including rich harvest of tomatoes last month, she said.As the month progresses, the prices are expected to dip as more produce will come from other states including Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, agriculturists predicted.Usually the month of August is when the prices dip with fresh harvest coming in. It has not happened so far but soon there will be a fall, said Sarampally Mallareddy from Communist Party of Indias farmers collective."

The appeal will now be heard after two weeks.The sale of garlic through agents had been disputed since the past ten years after the state government's order in 2007 banning agents from selling the spice."

Though July raised the prospects of the fertilizer company achieving normal targets for sale of Factamfos and ammonium sulphate, the failure of rain has held up sales, sources said here.Around 66,000 tonnes of Factamfos and 10,000 tonnes of ammonium sulphate were sold during July. However, sales have been dull during the current month, sources said, indicating that FACTs major sales during the rains took place in the neighbouring States of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka. Considering the present trend, it may be difficult to achieve the target of 60,000 tonnes during the current month, the sources said. The whole of South India has seen a rain deficit of 30 per cent and this has badly affected demand for fertilizers. Usually, Karnataka sees sales peaking in August.The areas where FACT is strong in Karnataka include Hassan, Chikmanglur, Devanagere, Mandya, Tumkur, Mysore and Shimoga. Sources said that potato cultivation in Hassan was down substantially this season because of the weather conditions. July had seen sales of around 20,000 tonnes.Tamil Nadu had shown some promise in July with sales touching 6,000 tonnes.

The production of the table variety of potatoes is also expected to take a 10-15% hit, according to sources from the Vegetable Growers' Association of India ( VGAI ).Nearly 10,000 hectares in Maharashtra yield 1 lakh metric tonnes of rain-fed potatoes annually.""There is major infestation of army worms on all types of potatoes in the last 10-15 days of the dry spell,"" said Santosh Sahane, VGAI technical director. ""The tuberization of rain-fed potatoes has also been affected due to the compaction of soil and low moisture availability. Production of potatoes  table and rain-fed  in the coming months may, therefore, be affected,"" Sahane added. Only Maharashtra and Karnataka produce Kharif season potatoes.Sahane said some diseases tend to affect vegetables during a dry spell. ""Cloudy skies with little rain and improper sunshine increase the incidence of fungal and bacterial infections in vegetables. We see a high incidence of sap-sucking pests in tomatoes, and army worms in almost all vegetables, especially tomatoes and potatoes,"" he added.An agro meteorological advisory issued by the India Meteorological Department suggested several measures that farmers can take against pests and diseases in crops. It said that cloudy and humid weather conditions can lead to various pests and diseases on crops, such as pink boll worm in cotton, sap-sucking pest in vegetables, stem girder beetle and oily spot disease, among others."

The changing climate is also expected to experience negative impact on milk production in the region, predicts the parliamentary standing committee on agriculture in its report tabled in the Lok Sabha on Thursday.The report says that the climate change would surge production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central Uttar Pradesh by 3.46% to 7.11% by 2030, but in rest of India potato production may decline by 4% to 16%.The 31-member committee, headed by Bihar MP and former Union minister of state Hukumdev Narayan Yadav of BJP, also submitted that irrigated rice in north-west India comprising Haryana and Punjab is projected to reduce by 6% to 8% by 2020. Whereas in other parts of the country the loss would be below 5%.Northern India, including Punjab and Haryana, is expected to experience more negative impact of climate change on milk production, the committee has found. It would be higher in crossbreds (0.63%) followed by buffaloes (0.5%) and indigenous cattle (0.4%).The committee noted that studies indicate that changing climate will decrease yields in major crops like wheat, rice and maize. On the other hand, the impact could be neutral to positive in crops like groundnut, soybean and chickpea. More number of generations of insect pests are expected to occur during future climate change periods because of increased temperatures. The committee found that more intense droughts are mainly observed over north and northwest India.The report says that in 2050, it is estimated that maximum and minimum temperature will go up by 2.40 degrees Celsius and 40 degrees C, respectively. Southern peninsula, northwest India and the southern parts of Punjab, Haryana and Bihar will be the severely affected due to the rise of minimum temperature. Apart from this, large shift in monsoon months, reduction in number of rainy days, increase in rain intensity and high frequency of cyclone would further aggravate the problems of agrarians.The committee was also of the considered view that policy of minimum support price (MSP) is promoting farming practices which are not suitable to local biographical and climatic conditions, thereby, causing problems such as depletion of groundwater resources, degradation of soil, and loss of local biodiversity. The report says that absence of an alternative and economically remunerative cropping strategy is forcing farmers to opt for prevailing water-intensive cropping pattern.It has also come to fore that paddy fields and Rumen fermentation are major sources of greenhouse gases (GHGs) in farm sector. ""Studies showed average methane emission of 40-70 kg/ha from rain-fed rice field and 100-180 kg/ha from irrigated rice fields. The nitrous oxide (N2O) emission having high global warming potential ranged 0.6-0.9 kg/ha under lowland irrigated conditions,"" reads the report.The report reads, ""However, the committee is distressed to note that despite efforts being made by the government, private sector dominates in seed production contributing to 50-57% of total seed production of the country. The main focus of private seed companies has been on the high-value and low-volume seeds.""The committee also noted that groundwater level has been decreasing in Punjab. With declining water table, farmers are deepening existing bore wells and shifting from cheaper surface mounted centrifugal pumps to expensive submersible pumps. This is increasing the cost of pumping in the agriculture sector. The report says that the quality of groundwater deteriorates with excess groundwater exploitation due to accelerated diffusion of contaminants from industrial and urban effluents to the groundwater."

5a0dfd419855b76bf13d32e2,Falling in love once again at Kolkata’s Anadi Cabin,http://blogs.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/the-chopping-board/falling-in-love-once-again-at-kolkatas-aanadi-cabin/,2017-08-18,"I left Kolkata for Mumbai a couple of decades back. I keep going back to Kolkata when I can. My family is there after all. Most of my meals there are with family and friends, the most special of those are with my grandmother and my mother. I do eat out in Kolkata when I can but my choices are driven by nostalgia more than anything else.When in Kolkata, I want my phuchka, chop, cutlet, roll, biryani, luchi and mangsho. I couldnt care less about the new Italian or Vietnamese restaurant which might have opened in the city. There is enough time for those when I am away. In Kolkata, it would be the Shirazs and the Nizams, the Flurys and the Kookie Jars, the Bhojohori Mannas and 6 Ballygunge Places that I would go to chasing old memories.These days I also try to visit some of the classic restaurants from central and north Kolkata. Places I might not have visited when I lived in Kolkata as I was a south Kolkata boy then. In the pre-Metro era, there was a Game of Thrones like north-south divide in Kolkata after all. I am talking of the cabin restaurants, the sweet shops, the dishevelled remnants of the old China towns, places which paint a picture of Kolkata to me which is so adventurous and so unique, so full of colour and character and above all, memories.Places tourists and emigrants like to go back to even if those who stay in the city, understandably, seek new experiences.Lets take Anadi Cabin, for example, which I visited during my most recent visit to the city.Anadi Cabin is a Kolkata institution. Its name is synonymous with Moghlai parathas, a dish which despite its majestic name harking back to the Mughals, is something that you get across the humblest of eateries across the city.Anadi Cabin is located at S N Banerjee Road near Espalande. Today it is a bit of an urban legend. With the city expanding, and Esplanade not being as central as it once was, places like Anadi are not as frequented by people from across the city. Everyone knows that it exists but if you ask them how the food there is, reactions will vary from it is overrated to the quality is not the same. Two comments that iconic eateries across India are often subjected to not matter how packed they are with customers. The third epitaph would be, its too touristy!Whether its Paradise in Hyderabad (justifiably I might add), Karims in Delhi, Tunday in Lucknow or Britannia in Mumbai (again justifiably perhaps), they would all be subject to one or all of these judgements by locals.At times it is good to just go by yourself and try out these places in any case. You might actually discover what made them so special. If you are lucky, you will find that they still are.I was quite excited about my visit to Anadi. I had gone there a couple of decades back but in those days I would just go to a restaurant to fill my stomach. I would not go looking for a story. Id been wanting to go there for a while but hadnt been able to in recent trips. This time I managed to convince a couple of friends to join me to Anadi after we had eaten a sumptuous breakfast at Flurys, again on my request.It was close to 2 pm when we reached. The atmosphere inside the small restaurant seemed quite sleepy . The tables inside looked unoccupied. We were the first customers of the day it seemed. The staff at Anadi were divided in their opinion on whether we should be allowed to sit in or whether we should wait. The mood seemed to be, can we chill a little bit more before the day starts?.We were eventually seated after a number of intense parleys among the staff. The place got packed in a matter of minutes. Ten minutes later and we would have had to queue up. I saw the rush and realised why the staff wanted to make the most of the lull before the start. They would, after all, be on their feet till night after that.The seating at Anadi is spartan. There is no air-conditioning, toilets or wifi here. This is a world far removed from the GST and service charge imposing modern cafes, bistros and resto-bars that define new India.As it is in such eateries across India, you are expected to share tables with strangers if alone at Anadi Cabin. The restaurant seemed fairly clean when I was there. The jury is divided on whether it is always so according to comments that I received on social media.Though the restaurant is called a cabin, the waiter told me that this 98-year-old (according to him) restaurant didnt actually have cabins in the past. Cabin refer to partitions made for families to sit in privacy in restaurants during more conservative times in Kolkata. These were later havens for courting couples. Places which had such cabins have done away with them today. Whispering sweet nothings over a shared cold drinks (sic) is not good for business and who has the time and place for romance anymore in any case?There is a counter at the front of the restaurant where they fry the parathas that make the restaurant famous. This dates from a time when open kitchens were yet to be trendy.The tables by which you rest your weary bodies and wait for the parathas, have marble tops. The plates on which the food is served are of white bone china. The restaurant has the sort of distressed look that new restaurants in Mumbai pay designers big money to recreate these days.We had the duck egg (hasher deem) Moghlai paratha which Anadi is famous for. The paratha was served with the traditional, lightly spiced, cubed potato curry and ketchup. There was the mandatory salad, sliced cucumber, carrot and onion.Was the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi over-rated and not a patch on what it was?To be honest, I dont know. My memories of the past are hazy when it comes to Aanadi. I havent had a wide enough variety of Moghlai parathas in Kolkata in the recent past and am not equipped to do a comparative analysis.What I can tell you with surety is that I quite enjoyed the Moghlai paratha at Aanadi and that it made me fall in love with the treasured treat of my childhood days. The parathas was very well balanced in terms of flavour and had a lovely texture  neither too crisp, nor dense or chewy.What is a Moghlai paratha you ask?A Moghlai paratha is a paratha made with maida or refined flour. The flattened dough is stuffed with crushed peanuts, raisins, finely chopped carrots (at Anadi at least) and green chilies, all whisked into freshly cracked eggs. The dough, with the stuffing enveloped inside, is then shallow fried in dalda on a tava and served hot. I doubt if it will taste too good if reheated for having later.The paratha at Anadi didnt have any meat in it as far as I could see. I do have memories of having eaten Moghlai parathas with a sprinkling of minced meat in them as a kid.The other childhood memory that I have of Moghlai parathas is that the adults accompanying one during a Moghlai paratha treat would cut the parathas into cubes so that us kids could eat them easily with a fork. This time my mother or my grandfather or my mama or my mashis, who used to take me out then werent around so I had to cut the paratha into bite sized cubes myself.The Moghlai paratha of Kolkata is a cousin of the martabak of Penang, matabaq of the middle east, the palata (sic) of Myanmar and the baida roti of Mumbai. The base concept for each is similar though the versions differ in terms of thickness, size, stuffing and levels of crunchiness.My friend, Kaniska who accompanied me for the outing and who often visits Dhaka for work, told me that the Moghlai parathas are made crunchier in Dhaka where it is a streetfood dish unlike in Kolkata where it is a part of cabin fare. One theory says that Moghlai Paratha of Kolkata came to the city from Dhaka but in a country with little written food history, these theories are a bit inconclusive.Having tried versions of the paratha across the sub-continent (barring in Myanmar) I would say that the Moghlai paratha of Anadi did Kolkata proud.Aanadi is not a one dish restaurant though. The revelation of the afternoon at Anadi in fact was the kosha mangsho. This is a classic Bengali slow cooked semi-dry goat meat preparation which has mustard oil, onions and garam masala as its base. Like many dishes in the east, the Odiyas, the Biharis and the Assamese make versions of it too.We ordered a plate of kosha mangsho with plain parathas at Aanadi for Kaniskas wife, Manishita, who didnt want eggs. The number of pieces of mutton (goat meat) in the serving was ample. The meat was well cooked and not a single piece was tough or chewy unlike what I have seen in some Bengali restaurants that offer this dish. Some bits of the meat had delightful nibbles of chorbi, the forbidden fat, hidden in them. The thick curry which was wrapped around the meat had a deep and near mystic touch to it which had the three of us in its spell. It was not too high on chilli heat or oil and yet promised an experience that smacked of pomp and majesty. This was definitely one of the best kosha mangshos that I have eaten in restaurants and I have had quite a few for sure!Close to a century of practise and passion showed in what we ate at Anadi you could say and the service was lovely too. My submission is to visit places like Anadi when you visit Kolkata. In a city that loves food, you are rarely going to go wrong."

They have assured me that train services will be restored within 10 days as the flood situation is improving. Road connectivity is being restored now."" Warning traders who take advantage of floods and try to charge more for essential commodities, the minister said: ""We will take stern action against traders who try to fleece customers. I have already discussed it with all deputy commissioners and directed them to punish such traders as soon as possible. To regulate the market, directions have been issued to the Agriculture Marketing Board to ensure adequate supply of essential commodities."" Daimary also directed the board and the Kamrup Chamber of Commerce to provide 5,000 bags of onions to each market in Guwahati. ""From tomorrow, the Kamrup (metro) administration will inspect every market in Guwahati and take action against retailers who try to sell onion at more than Rs 35 a kg,"" Daimary said.

Their contention was that the yard barely had any facilities to support trade.Members of the Bangalore Potato and Onion Traders Association said they had learnt through newspaper announcements that the allotees of the new yard and some traders at the Yeswantpur ward had been asked to shift to the Dasanapura yard from Friday morning. They also said farmers who had travelled from Hassan with their produce were asked to take gate passes from Dasanapura before coming to the Yeswantpur ward.Protesting against this, hundreds of farmers and traders slept on the road outside the APMC yard to prevent vehicle movement and even dumped onions and potatoes on the road while shouting slogans against the government. The protest continued for over two hours leaving motorists stranded.Hundreds of vehicles queued up on both sides of the busy Yeswantpur Road that connects the State highway. People who went to the Dasanapura market say there is nothing there. It is 5 km away from the main road and there is not even a police station. Who will go there? Let them put these facilities in place before asking anyone to shift there, said one of the traders.The police rushed to the spot to manage traffic and asked APMC officials to redress the grievances of the protesters. The traders and farmers decided to cancel their plan to call for a bandh on Saturday after talks with the government."

Since agriculture makes up roughly 15% of India's GDP, a 4.5 to 9.0% negative impact on production implies cost of climate change to be roughly at 1.5% of GDP per year,"" reads the report.The committee said that various studies indicated overall reduction in productivity by 4-6% in rice, 6% in wheat, 18% in maize, 2.5% in sorghum, 2% in mustard and 2.5% in potato besides significant regional variability. Also, the committee has projected production deficit of 33% for cereals by 2015 and of 43% by 2050. Meanwhile, for pulses, the deficit has been projected at 3% by 2025 and 7% by 2050.Consequently, the committee has suggested that enhancing agricultural productivity is critical for ensuring food and nutritional security for all, particularly poor, small and marginal farmers who would be affected the most.Further, the committee found that the total post-harvest losses to agricultural commodities are estimated to be from 6 to 18% and nearly 30% of the agricultural produce harvested is lost due to inadequate storage facilities in the country, including in Punjab and Haryana.On over exploitation of ground water, the committee found that the Central Ground Water Board ( CGWB ) has submitted plan for artificial recharge in 442 over exploited ground water blocks in Punjab, Harayana, Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka, Maharashtra, Rajasthan,Tamilnadu, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh.The report says that as per the ministry of earth sciences, during the period 1901-2010, heavy rainfall events (rainfall exceeding 15 cm in 24 hours) over northern parts of the country show an increasing trend of about 6% per decade. Also, as per 5th IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) report, climate projections developed for India for the 2050s indicate an increase in the average temperature by 2-4C during that period, an overall decrease in rainy days by more than 15 days in western and central India and an increase by 5-10 days near foothills of Himalayas and north-east India.The IPCC has also analyzed that there has been a decrease in rainfall in the month of July but there has been an increase in rains in June as well as August across the country indicating a change in the rainfall pattern.The committee observed that animal husbandry and cattle rearing are important source of income for majority of farmers in Punjab, Haryana and other parts of the country.However, it expressed that national plan on dairying has ignored indigenous varieties of cattle leading to over dependence on crossbred varieties for milk production despite the fact that indigenous varieties of cattle possess many traits such as heat tolerance that can be very effective in future scenario projected for climate change.Mainly focusing on climate change effect on agriculture, the committee was of the view that there will be changes in consumption patterns in coming decades due to increasing rate of urbanization and increased income of households. It has been found that demand for fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meat, poultry and fisheries will increase at faster rate than that of food grains. The need for a climate-resilient approach to agriculture is critical for India where more than 80 percent agriculturists are small farmers and the warming trend in India over the past 100 years has indicated an increase of 0.60C, says the report."

Picture by Swapnaneel Bhattacharjee Silchar, Aug. 19: Karimganj deputy commissioner Pradip Kumar Talukdar today said teams would be sent to markets across the district to inspect whether uniformity is being maintained in prices of vegetables. The prices have shot up immensely following the recent waves of floods. A large number of citizens have alleged that some vendorsraders, taking advantage of the floods, are charging arbitrarily. Talukdar, who held a meeting with administration officials this afternoon on the issue, said a report would be submitted on the basis of the inspection and stern action would be taken against those found to have fleeced the public by overcharging them. Currently, the prices of some of the vegetables are - chilly (Rs 300/kg), brinjal (Rs 80/kg), string beans (Rs 80/kg), tomato (Rs 70/kg), ridge gourd (Rs 60/kg), cabbage, radish, eddoe (all Rs 50/kg), onion and sayote (Rs 40/kg) and potato (Rs 20/kg). These rates are prevalent in most markets, including Chantar Bazar, Nilambazar, Shanibari Bazar and Kaliganj. In some places, the prices fluctuate and are even higher, residents alleged. The general secretary of Chantar Bazar Byabsayi Samiti, Pijush Das, said crops have been damaged across the state because of floods this year, pushing up the prices of vegetables, and it would take some time for circumstances to return to normal. He added that vegetables are being sold at rates equal to other markets in Chantar Bazar market and that vendors here do not fleece customers. Narrating the plight of lower middle class and poor people because of unethical practices adopted by a section of vendors, Abdul Bakkar, a retired grade IV government employee, said people are already facing extreme financial troubles because of the floods and the skyrocketing prices of vegetables/commodities added insult to injury. crisis of having vegetables in the district In summer, farmers of Karimganj district grow vegetables like okra, ridge gourd, bottle gourd, pointed gourd, bitter gourd, cucumber and others.

The prices of tomato, onion and potato have increased in recent months owing to disparity between demand and supply on account of a drop in production because of unfavourable weather, a rise in transport costs, seasonality and supply chain constraints.Why is supply low?While the rise in the retail prices of tomato is being associated with low supply from key growing States, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh and Karnataka following heavy rain in a few regions that damaged the crop and hindered transport as well, onion prices have seen a rise on account of low supply from the southern States.The fluctuation in vegetable prices, which is commonly referred to as seasonal, is associated with the economics of demand and supply. The Centre maintains that seasonal fluctuations in market arrivals have hit supplies. The other reasons for the fall in supply are adverse weather conditions and imperfections in marketing channels. However, the clash of interests between the consumer, the producer and the middlemen is a key factor that policy-makers must urgently address.Where is the problem?For years, the consumer, the producer (farmer) and the middleman have had a clash of interest when it comes to agricultural commodities. While the consumer wants to buy a commodity at the lowest price, the producer (farmer) desires to sell the produce at the maximum price. The middleman, on the other hand, wants to maximise profits. Striking a balance among these stakeholders could possibly address the issue of price fluctuation to some extent. Vegetable producers, especially small landholders, depend on intermediaries to sell their produce. As vegetables find their way to the market, the cost of packaging, grading, transporting and fees, besides the margins of the middlemen, are some of the elements that determine the final price the consumer has to bear.Will better storage help?Agricultural commodities with a short shelf-life are prone to price fluctuation and hence require better infrastructure for marketing.Economists like Prof. M.S. Sidhu at Punjab Agricultural University believe that improved transport and upgraded storage infrastructure will keep a check on price volatility. Indias cold storage capacity at present is nearly 3.5 crore tonnes, which is short by 30-40 lakh tonnes, and it needs to be increased. Besides, cold storages need to be upgraded, equipping them to store fruit and vegetables at right temperatures so that they stay fresh.Also, the high cost of transport needs to be addressed. In the case of perishable vegetables, the government could consider promoting low-cost refrigerated trucks and weigh the option of freight subsidy.According to an estimate, there are 7,000-8,000 refrigerated trucks plying in India, mostly transporting pharmaceuticals and dairy products. Transport of perishable vegetables in refrigerated trucks could be one of the options that would help in better supply and availability of the produce.What about the supply chain?The mismanagement in the supply chain is another reason for the huge gap in prices that growers sell perishable agricultural commodities for and what the consumer pays. Creation of co-operative groups and societies are probably an alternative that could assist in minimising the marketing channel. They can work in tandem across the States and supply vegetables from surplus regions to places where the produce is in demand.Most farmers in India have small landholdings. Nearly 85% farmers are small, who have less than 2 hectares. Cultivation has become unviable for these small farmers, but through cooperative groups and societies even a small quantity of crop produced by the farmer can be marketed. This will stabilise prices and benefit consumers.VIKAS VASUDEVA"

Ushakumari said on Friday that the weekly procurement of potato and cabbage was 90 tonnes and 70 tonnes respectively. Carrot was being procured at 15 tonnes per month. She said the procurement would go up further, as there would be 1,500 Onam markets in the State this year.The aim, she said, was to procure vegetables at 10% higher than the market rate and sell at 30% less than the market price. The Onam markets would have three sections of vegetables  organic, GAP (vegetables produced by the cluster units through Good Agriculture Practice), and those procured from outside the State.K. Jayaprakash, president, Vattavada Cool Season Vegetable Producing Farmers Society, said an average of 50 tonnes of vegetables were being sent daily from Vattavada. Beans was mainly purchased by businessmen from Tamil Nadu. There was a slump in production, though more areas were brought under cultivation, he said. This was because of the long dry spell and delayed sowing. Some farmers lost their crops in cloudbursts. There were also complaints that farmers were not paid promptly after procuring vegetables.Buyers from TNO.K. Mohanraj, a farmer, said he was yet to get his July dues. Mr. Mohanraj said it was true that Horticorp procured vegetables at a price higher than those offered by businessmen.However, we need not wait for long for payment, he said, adding that it was the main reason for selling vegetables to Tamil Nadu businessmen.Earlier, the amount used to be credited to the account of the society in which all the farmers are members. Now the payment is made directly to the farmers account, said Mr. Jayaprakash. He said the Onam procurement would be a success only if the Horticorp and Vegetable and Fruit Promotion Council, Keralam (VFPCK) promptly paid dues."

It is an alarming trend as most of our health indices are compared to those of the developed West. The rising incidence is basically due to Malayalees mindset.We think there is a pill for every ailment, said K R Thankappan, emeritus professor, Achutha Menon Centre for Health Science Studies and the surveys chief investigator.The major NCDs are cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, cancer and clinical lung disorder, in that order.  The incidence of heart attacks among Malayalees is rising. If it was 1.3 per cent in 1993 it has jumped to 3.8 per cent in 2016. It is the lets see attitude whether it is a heart attack or accidents which is proving the bane, said Thankappan.The survey found 69 per cent of the population consumes salt in excess of the recommended5 gm daily. It is for the first time these statistics have come out. Mainly bakery products, especially banana, potato and tapioca chips, and pickles are to blame for the high salt intake, he said.More than three-fourth of the population (77.8 per cent) reported consumption of less than the recommended three servings of vegetables per day, while almost nine out of 10 participants (86 per cent) reported consumption of less than two servings of fruits per day. It also found one out of every four adults surveyed reported current use of tobacco in some form and over 30 per cent reported current alcohol use among males."

With Bakrid preceding Thiruvonam by two days, on September 1, the trade fairs too began slightly earlier this year, aimed at tapping into the demand of the twin celebrations. ""At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market',"" said K V Thomas MP, speaking after launching the Onam Trade Fair set up by Supplyco on the Jawaharlal Nehru International Stadium premises in Kaloor.Thomas said agencies like Supplyco play a key role in preventing the price hike of essential goods. ""There was a time when wholesale traders use to collect goods from FCI warehouses. But most of them would in turn keep the stock in their own godowns, resulting in increasing number of cases related with the hoarding of goods. They later sell these goods in the black market. This prompted the then government to introduce the Food Safety Bill.This helped government agencies like Supplyco play a major role in providing supplies to the common man,"" said Thomas. The MP said the government is taking a favourable stance towards Supplyco godowns. ""Supplyco should use these favourable conditions for the benefit of consumers,"" said Thomas. ""A new programme named Karshakamithram, mooted to attract more students towards agriculture, will be launched in schools soon. One lakh curry leaf saplings will be distributed on September 11.""THE HIGHS AND LOWS OF ONAMKochi: Every year, the weeks leading up to Onam season are marked by the soaring prices of vegetables. This year, with only about a two week-countdown left for the festival, it is not easy to assess the price trend in the market. Some of the essential vegetables are priced high, but the prices of others, which hit an all time high last month, have come down. For instance, the price of shallots saw a record high price of D140 per kg in July. This month, however, it has come down to D85 per kg. The main reason for the price hike in shallots was the drought in Tamil Nadu from where the produce reaches Kerala. Now, the wholesalers are getting more supply from Andhra Pradesh which is reflected in the reduced price, said N Rajan, a vendor in Kaloor market.However, customers complain vegetables sold cheaply in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka become costly when they cross the border into Kerala. The price increases three or four fold when it reaches here, said Prasanth Jacob, a customer. Raw banana costs only D30 per kg in Coimbatore. However, a customer here has to pay a minimum of D70. Likewise, tomato which is available for D15 per kg in Tamil Nadu gets a weightier price tag here, costing D60 to D70 per kg. The other items that witness a hike in price in August are beetroot, amaranthus, beans, cow pea and drumstick. The price of green chilly and carrot have reduced slightly. ""The prices were fluctuating during the first two weeks of August. However, it is likely to go up by the end of this month, added Rajan.The where and when of fairsSupplyco fairs will be organised in all taluks in Ernakulam. Essential commodities, including red chilly, coriander, black beans, bengal gram, tur dal and vegetables will be available at prices lower than the market price. The trade fairs will function from August 20 to September 3, a day ahead of Thiruvonam. ""There will be special festival offers and gift coupons for consumers,"" said marketing manager R N Satheesh. Every customer making purchases of more than Rs 2,000 will be issued a gift coupon for a lucky draw. The first prize winner will get one sovereign gold, while the state-level winner will get five sovereigns of gold. The vegetable stall at Supplyco fair is set up by Vegetable and Fruits Promotion Council of Kerala. Vegetables like carrot, potato and cabbage are brought from Kanthalloor, Vattavada and Munnar. The special programme 'Onathinu Oru Muram Pachakkari', an homegrown, organic vegetable initiative, was also launched in Ernakulam today.Daily marketprice- Retail(August 21)Source: VFPCK.Price in Rs per KgAmaranthus: B23Banana nenthran: B58Banana (njalipoovan): B80Beetroot: B48Bittergourd: B50Brinjal (long): B38Carrot: B48Cowpea: B58Onion: B32Shallot: B85Tomato: B56Snake gourd: B40Beans: B55At a time when the prices of essential commodities are increasing in the general market, the trade fairs really are a boon to the common man; they could aptly be termed 'the people's market'K V Thomas, MPEvery customer making purchases of more than Rs 2,000 will be issued a gift coupon for a lucky draw.

In celebrating Him, the Hindus of the state touch base with an ancient fecundity ritual, one that sees them venerate Lord Ganesha with the very produce of nature that He blessed them with. Food, thus, is one of the hallmarks of Ganesh Chaturthi, and is replete with associated fertility symbolisms.In the prelude to the festival, Lord Ganesha's parentsLord Shiva and Goddess Parvatiare worshipped a day before. Folklore paints a picture of Parvati pregnant with Lord Ganesha, yet another allusion to fertility. ""In Goa, the day is referred to as tay and involves womenfolk observing a fast. In Hindu priest and other such households, the hartalika puja is perfomed,"" noted Goan folklorist Jayanti Naik, says.Intriguing food symbolisms are seen right from this day. To begin with, the fasting diet includes only fruits and milk. Naik says the women eat nothing that is cultivated with a plough. ""This is the tradition pan-India,"" she adds, while explaining that the plough is perceived to be a symbol of masculinity.Lord Ganesha is born on the following day, called chavat, marking the beginning of Ganesh Chaturthi. ""The birth of the benevolent god marks the most important day of the celebrations,"" says artist and culture enthusiast Naguesh Sardesai. And, understandably, food is cooked in plenty.Goddess Parvati or Gauri, who symbolises the Mother Goddess, is given a special nourishing diet to satisfy her 'duvalle' or cravings. It comprises varan, a preparation from at least five leafy vegetables, and moni patolleo. While patolleo are elongated rice dumplings of sorts with a sweet filling, those offered to Gauri have no filling and are therefore called moni.""The food offered to Parvati is bland,"" says Naguesh, adding that salt is added only to the food offered to Lord Mahadev and Lord Ganesha.The rest of the cuisine covers a plethora of Ganesha's favourites, including moongache gathi, khatkhate, ambadayache uddad methi, etc. ""Sweet dishes comprise stuffed patolleo, modakswhich may be fashioned from stuffings of chunna (coconut and jaggery) or punna (chana dal and jaggery)and neureos,"" says publisher and food writer Sapna Sardesai. A payasam is also prepared. ""To the payasam, five grains of tender rice grains taken from new sheaves, are added,"" Sardesai explains.""The tender grains are significant of the new harvest,"" says Naik, adding that this offering of the first sheaves is a thanksgiving for God's bounty. Explaining the fertility symbolism behind the neureos, Naik says, ""Neureos form the female symbol, which is why no matter how many are prepared, it is compulsory to prepare at least one modakthe male symbol.""The following day, pancham, which concludes one-and-a-half days of festivities and sees a majority of Goan Hindu households immersing their respective idols, has a greater variety of preparations in addition to those prepared on the main day. Only the leafy vegetable preparation is excluded.""In addition to gravy prepations like moongache gathi (prepared from sprouted moong) and ros, dry vegetarian dishes are also cooked on this day. For instance, bhendyachi bhaji is made from the local, seven-ridged ladyfingers and ghosalyachi bhaji is made from ridge gourd. A green chilli or bitter gourd raita is also prepared. Deep-fried potato kaapa and ambadayache uddad methi, a tangy gravy made from hogplums, more or less completes the spread,"" says Sardesai.Both Naik and Sardesai make special mention of heet a local version of idlis made in a casing of jackfruit leaves. ""While it is common belief that idlis are a south Indian preparation, Goa has always had its version of it,"" Naik says. Traditionally, heet is dipped in coconut milk sweetened with jaggery before it is consumed.In the evening, after the concluding puja, or uttar puja, is held, two large laddoos of lhayo (puffed rice) are made with jaggery, roasted chana dal, cashew nuts and coconut. One laddoo is offered to Lord Ganesha as a send-off food, and the other to the person who takes the idol for immersion. The puffed rice is, once again, a symbol of prosperity.Thus, the entire celebration, right from the decoration to the food, pays glowing tribute to Nature's abundance and diversity."

Pictures by Hardeep Singh A Ranchi market with over 200 stalls and a community hall, inaugurated on the eve of Independence Day in 2014, is yet to serve its intended purpose with those living in the neighbourhood alleging that the Rs 3 crore building has now turned into a haunted house thronged by drunkards and drug addicts. Spread over 13,000sqft and located behind Harmu Panch Mandir, the triple-storey market complex has 212 shops on the ground and first floor. As many as 180 shops have been allotted to vendors, but they prefer to use them as godowns rather than a retail outlet, while continuing to do business from their old shanties on the roadside. The market, with its dirty walls and dusty floors, bears tell-tale signs of neglect. A local resident said the market had become a den of anti-socials. ""We don't venture anywhere near it after sunset as several drug addicts roam the place taking shelter under the cover of darkness since there are no lights,"" said a woman who lives close by. The market was built by Jharkhand State Housing Board, a government outfit set up to provide houses and shops to the needy on a no-profit no-loss basis. It is now under Ranchi Municipal Corporation. Local councillor (ward 37) Arun Kumar Jha admitted it was not being used, but said he was unable to help. ""The market was constructed after an anti-encroachment drive in the locality. The idea was to allot space to vegetable vendors and others who were displaced in the drive. After the market was conducted and most of the shops allotted, no one used them to sell their stuff. The vendors preferred to use the shops as their godowns,"" he said. Bablu Kumar, a potato seller, said he did not care whether the market was being maintained or not. ""We still run our shop on the roadside as we do not see better business prospects in the market. We use the space allotted by the housing board for storing potatoes,"" he said, adding that he managed by using a battery-operated torch in the absence of proper lighting. Housing board executive engineer Sanjeev Kumar claimed they were no longer in the picture. ""Once shops have been allotted, it is the duty of those who got them to take care of maintenance and lighting arrangements. Out of 212 shops, more than 180 shops have been allotted,"" Kumar said. Board MD Ashish Singhmar, however, said that he would look into the matter soon. ""We will allot the remaining shops soon. We will publish advertisements,"" he said, adding that the board was equally concerned about the prolonged misuse of the market, the foundation stone for which was laid by former deputy chief minister Hemant Soren on November 14, 2011. The market was finally inaugurated on August 14, 2014, by former minister Yogendra Sao."

Fengs 2004 survey of 232 households found that 49% of Zhaba households still practised the tradition.Children in such families are raised by their mother and her siblings in large, six-storey communal houses of yellowed stone on the lush green hillsides, with cavernous rooms too large for much light to penetrate.Raised by womenFathers might provide some financial support.I dont have a husband. Their father lives somewhere else, said 60-year-old matriarch Dolma Lhamo after a breakfast of yak butter tea and tsampa, roasted flour eaten by hand, as she led two daughters out to tend the family potato field.Shopkeeper Pema Bazhu used to share a home with her mother, grandmother, sisters and uncles, but she recently chose to move out and live separately with her husband and two year-old son.Its much more common now to see families living on their own as a unit, she said. Its more convenient, and its better for raising children.Tsultrim Paldzone, 30, explained that when he and his friends were younger, they would snag tokens from girls they fancied on festival or market days, calling cards to be returned that evening during a nocturnal visit to her home.If shes willing, then shell run just a little bit less fast, he laughed.Urban growthCars were uncommon then. He had once walked over 10 kilometres to reach a lovers home, starting before sunset and arriving after midnight.Now no one in the small community  just some 13,624 people according to the latest 2010 census  lives more than a half hours motorbike trip away.Trysts are arranged ahead of time on the popular cellphone messaging app WeChat, and the coy game of token-grabbing has mostly disappeared.Government bureaucracy, too, is making it more difficult for the Zhabas walking marriages. Children born to parents without marriage certificates are not allowed hukou, all-important registration documents that allow them to access health care and schooling.Today, even those who wish to continue with walking marriage resort to paying unmarried acquaintances or strangers to apply for the certificate with them, said Tsultrim Paldzone. The government wont let you just do as you please."

Daddimani told presspersons here on Thursday that the Horticulture University and Nourish company representatives will sign a Memorandum of Understanding for setting up the unit on Saturday.This unit requires a minimum of 6 tonnes to a maximum of 20 tonnes on a daily basis. Considering this, the Horticulture Department has begun encouraging farmers to grow sweet potato. This year, the department set a target of engaging 1,000 farmers in cultivation of sweet potato. By the end of 2018, a total of 5,000 farmers are expected to be identified and brought under sweet potato cultivation.Sweet potato can be grown in red soil or even along with regular potatoes. This crop does not require more water. Besides, it is a good source of several vitamins. This root-vegetable has gained in more popularity in the world and the demand too is increasing. There is ample scope to opt for value-addition of sweet potato and the department is all set to provide advanced training to growers, he said.WorkshopThe programme to sign the Memorandum of Understanding will be followed by a one-day workshop-cum-training event for farmers from North Karnataka. The workshop will focus on scientific growing of sweet potato and its processing.Nourish company will enter into an understanding with sweet potato growers for a period of three years and all the produce will be purchased by the company itself. After purchasing, this root-vegetable would be processed at the new unit. This will solve the issue of marketing the crop. The department will hold regular demonstration on how to grow sweet potatoes, harvest them, and on other technical aspects. This project will increase the financial status of farmers, he noted.High demandHorticulture Scientist K. Ramchandra Naik said that sweet potatoes, which come to the market in different colours, are very healthy and will work as a protection shield in preventing diseases. The sweet potatoes grown in India have a huge demand across the world. The horticulture research unit has developed 125 new breeds of sweet potatoes. In the last two or three years, the demand for sweet potato has increased in the U.S. and the U.K. and the food processing companies there are in search of a region wherein sweet potato is being grown. The growing cost comes up to Rs. 10,000 per acre, but it may fetch him up to Rs. 80,000 per acre, he added."

Growing sweet potato is a profitable venture as it requires less investment and can be cultivated on any soil, he said.He said that according to experts, the districts of Dharwad, Gadag, Haveri and Belagavi had the perfect climate to grow this root vegetable and the government would extend suitable assistance.The Minister said apart from growing commercial crops, farmers should also focus on cultivating crops that have rich nutritional value. There was a need for growing sweet potato and millets in larger areas, he said and added that workshops on sweet potato cultivation were being held across the State to sensitise the farmers.Vice-Chancellor of University of Horticulture D.L. Maheshwaraiah said that according to a survey, 20,000 hectares in North Karnataka was suitable for cultivation of sweet potato and called on the farmers to make the best use of the opportunity.MOU signedA Memorandum of Understanding was signed between the University of Horticultural Sciences, Bagalkot, and Nourish Inc. of Netherlands for setting up a sweet potato processing unit. As per the understanding, the company would be purchasing sweet potato from the farmers for a period of three years. The A grade sweet potato would fetch Rs. 8 per piece, B grade Rs. 6 and C grade Rs. 3."

Vegetables sold include those certified as produced using Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).'Onasamridhi' during the last Onam season had witnessed sale of around 4,800 metric tonnes of vegetables over five days, out of which 3,400 metric tonnes were state's own produce.The `Onathinu oru muram pachakkari' scheme which envisages mass cultivation of vegetables with the participation of 63 lakh families, would address the demand only partially. The department's calculation is that it might require 5,207 MT vegeta bles to run these stalls. To fill the gap, Horticorp has been entrusted to procure 940 MT of vegetables from neighbouring states.""For the mass cultivation scheme under which people could raise vegetables in their backyards, on terraces and in grow bags, we had distributed seeds or seedlings of only around five types of vegetables (ladies finger, spinach, snake gourd, brinjal, bitter gourd and chilli). It was meant to create awareness on safe-to-eat vegetables and to boost consumers' confidence,"" said agriculture director A M Sunil Kumar.Envisaged as part of the Haritha Kerala Mission and implemented with the cooperation of Kudumbashree units, homemakers, students, workers under the employment guarantee scheme, vegetable farmers' clusters, officials and various institutions, the scheme had witnessed distribution of 63 lakh packets of seeds, 45 lakh vegetable seedlings, and more than one lakh grow bags.Whether the scheme achieved its aim of cultivating a habit of us ing safe-to-eat vegetables is yet to be seen. However, the increase in the number of vegetable stalls this Onam is huge. The depart ment had run 1,365 outlets last year. This has been made possible by introducing sale of vegetables in cooperation department fairs, Supplyco fairs and Kudum bashree outlets, the director pointed out.Among the 1,500 stalls to be run directly by the department in association with Vegetables and Fruits Promotion Council Keralam (VFPCK) and Horticorp are 51 eco-shops selling its own brand of organic vegetables 'Kerala Organic', which had hit the market last Vishu . ""All other outlets too will be selling organic or GAP-certified vegetables at a price that is bit higher,"" Sunil Kumar said.Locally grown vegetables will be procured from farmers by Hor ticorp at a 10% higher price, while the farmers will get 20% high price for GAP-cer tified products. At the stalls, the con sumers can buy them availing 30% and 10% discounts respectively. ""Be sides vegetables, the stalls will be selling the fa mous Marayoor jaggery, coconut oil and honey,"" the agriculture director said.The department is hoping to procure 150 tonnes of best qual ity garlic with great medicinal value from Kanthalloor-Vatta vada belt. The area famed for vegetable cultivation will provide a significant volume of cabbage, potato and cauliflower, for which the state has been depending heavily on neighbouring states.Majority of the vegetables to be purchased by Horticorp from other states are the ones not grown in the state. Kerala grows only around 15 types of vegeta bles out of 50 in demand. ""The cultivation of tomato, which was widespread in Palakkad district, has come down, and we need to procure it from outside,"" Sunil Kumar said."

Amid conflicting reports of whether the warden had called up sadar hospital at 2am today for an ambulance which did not arrive, Khunti DC Manish Ranjan claimed the woman had not called up the hospital at all. Instead, she called a local auto driver who refused to go. Deceased Champa Nag of Garamara village of Khunti thana area had enrolled at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya at Kalamati panchayat 17 days ago and was healthy right till last evening, when she played and danced with other girls. Champa complained of stomach ache and then chest pain a few hours after last night's dinner of rice, lentils and potato curry. Whether the hostel warden called up an auto driver or the sadar hospital for an ambulance is not clear as the employee could not be contacted personally. But, what is clear that Champa's condition deteriorated progressively and by early morning, the warden contacted the local mukhiya who took the ailing girl in his car to the nearby health centre, where the nurse on duty advised she be immediately rushed to a hospital. The mukhiya took her to sadar hospital where she died while being treated. Her post-mortem report said she died of cardiac arrest. Khunti civil surgeon Vinod Oraon could not provide any detail of the case, including the girl's age. DC Ranjan claimed they were not at fault as the warden called up an auto, who refused to go at the late hour. However, local sources claimed the warden had called up sadar hospital for an ambulance, which didn't arrive, claiming that drivers tended to steer clear of the hour-long drive through the forested rebel hub at night. However, this claim could not be substantiated. DC Ranjan added that he had ordered a senior nurse be deployed every night at each of the six Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalayas with immediate effect. The nurses will be given dinner by the respective schools. ""We have only two lady doctors in our district. It is practically not possible to provide ambulances and doctors to each school. There are nearly 260 girls' hostels in my district,"" he added."

It is Karnatakas gift to Ooty, said Horticulture Minister S.S. Mallikarjun. The garden would be inaugurated by Chief Minister Siddaramaiah in the coming weeks.Christened Siri Horticulture Garden, Fern Hill, Ooty, it was part of the late Maharajas Summer Palace. For decades, it was used as a parent potato garden that supplied seeds to farmers in Kolar, Hassan, Tumakuru and Bengaluru Rural.Over the last 10 years, under the care of botanists from Karnataka, it has been transformed into an oasis of sorts, with flowering plants such as Alstroemeria or Princess Lilies, Begonia, Orchids and Fuchsia.

Jagadeesh, Joint Director of Horticulture, Lalbagh.Temperate glasshouseThe garden also has a Nilgiri sheep forest and swans aplenty in the lakes and the walking paths. For phase two, the Horticulture Department plans to build a temperate glasshouse, hanging bridges, and chasing fountains.Horticulture expert M.H. Mari Gowda had in the 1940s requested the then Maharaja Jayachamaraja Wadiyar to make arrangements for potato germination and cultivation, as sourcing seeds from Shimla and Jalandhar was becoming increasingly difficult. It was then that the Maharaja invested substantially in the Summer Palace, with a part of the land set aside for growing potato."

Here you can try baked, crispy dumplings and delicate crystal ones that are wrapped around fresh ingredients.Just when we thought that Yauatcha, a London-based dim sum restaurant, had served it all, they introduced four varieties on August 23. These will be accompanied by a potful of jasmine tea or premium beer.In the dimly lit romantic diner, Chicken and Water Chestut Dumpling is served first in a bamboo box. The aroma of minced meat with Thai sauce gives away the flavour even before tasting it.The dumpling, made from potato starch, is translucent and generous with the filling. It tastes mild and flavourful, with the fresh chicken cooked just right to a shade of pink. The dumpling, for want of a better phrase, melts in your mouth.The Olive Crystal Dumpling with yambean and fried tofu looks delightful. The skin of the dumpling is a shade of green from chive. The dumpling tastes of mixed vegetables and the sweet taste of pumpkin.Next comes the Roasted Duck Pumpkin Puff that resembles a miniature bright-orange pumpkin. There are leaves too, of sunflower crest. While other dumplings are soft, this one has a hard cover made from pumpkin paste.The crispy shell cracks easily and spills out duck meat, shitake mushrooms, yambean and black pepper sauce. Again, the meat retains its flavour and there is a thread of sweetness from the pumpkin.The fourth new dumpling is the Crispy Prawn Dumpling, which you could mistake for Adams familys Cousin Itt upside down, but we mean it in a good way. The deep fried prawn wears a unique garnish of vermicelli. The prawn is juicy and the texture crispy. Simply delicious.The restaurant serves their usual condiments of chilli flakes sauce and sweet sauce, and chilli flake sauce with a hint of spicy garlic goes well with the mild dumplings.Desserts are Yauatchas speciality. Red Fruit Fromage Frais, a pistachio biscuit with pistachio sponge mixed with red-fruit campote, served alongside raspberry sorbet and topped with cherries and blue berries is a creamy cheesecake that blends beautifully with the sourness of the fruits. It is a must-try for cheese, cream and fruit lovers.With the jasmine tea by the side, the dim sum fest is a treat."

Whenever I need directions, I stop by a rickshaw. And I get perfect directions to my destination from one of the thousands of hard working men who have left their villages to make Delhi their home.That is why, when I was on my way to Lajpat Nagar in search of a chholey bhaturey wallah that I had not visited ever, I didnt worry. I took the Metro from Rajendra Prasad Road to Lajpat Nagar, and once I walked out of the station at the Lajpat Nagar Metro Station, I jumped on to a waiting rickshaw.I am looking for some special chholey bhaturey, I said to him. Oh, Anandji, he replied, and took me right there.Its nice to know that there are still some chholey bhaturey in Delhi that I have not tried out.Seeing is believingI had been hearing about Anandji for a while, but, as it happens sometimes, I had never gone there. Last week, I thought I couldnt call myself a chhole bhatura expert if there was a much talked of place that I had not been to. So, as I said, I took the Metro.This is a 22-year-old shop in Lajpat Nagar 1. The address is Shop No 3, Krishna Market (Tel nos 011-29817406 and 41326226; owner Bittus number: 9811301302). I was quite impressed by the place  it was spic and span, and had high tables for those who wanted to stand there and have a quick meal. I was there pretty early in the day, so it was not crowded either. There were a few people there, and I was happy to see that they were all eating chholey bhaturey.I asked for four plates  each for Rs 70. The bhatureys were not enormous, as some bhatureys are. This I thought was the right size  neither too large, nor too small. The chholey was superb  and what I really enjoyed was that it wasnt dripping oil, or overwhelmed with spices. It was almost like the good chholey that you get at home, with the perfect balance of spices. There was a nice juicy piece of potato in the chholey, which came with chutney, some pickle and onion rings.The service is smooth, too. I went in, placed my order, paid up, went to the counter where I presented my receipt, and within fifteen minutes, I was out of the place, where my friendly neighbour GPS-wallah was waiting.There are quite a few other items on the menu, too  chholey poori, rajma rice, kadi rice and dal makhni rice, all for Rs. 70 a plate. There is a thali (Rs. 100) and a special thali (Rs. 130). From 4 pm to 8 pm you get aloo samosa, paneer pakora, jalebi and break pakora. They also sell a dal samosa, which I must try out one day.Anandji is also known for its lassi  sweet and salted (Rs. 60/Rs. 40). I had heard about their creamy lassi, too, but I had to hurry back with my lunch. And the food packet in my hand smelled so good that I was dying to dig my teeth into it.I wouldnt like to do a listicle on chholey bhaturey shops  those hard-to-escape lists of the ten or five top chholey bhaturey outlets in town that you see on the Net. My favourites, of course, are those places that have made us happy for years with their fare  Nagpal on the other side of the road, Chacha in Kamla Nagar, Standard in Old Rajendra Nagar and Nand in Sadar Bazaar, to name a few. And I must say Bhatia in IP Extension isnt bad either.But Anandji is somewhere right there, too. I had his chholey bhaturey for lunch and thought this was a place I could go back to. Not just for the dal samosa and the lassi, but for an encore."

When we finally arrived, we quickly realised that we were one of the only few groups of people to be there, despite it being a Saturday night.Irish Pub is quite large, and sports a rugged, vintage look. Although the interiors are are hard on the eyes, nothing exactly screams Irish about it. The music was mainly commercial tracks, which didnt seem to go with the rustic feel of the place.We began with some cocktails. The Inverted Bird, which has vodka, apple, juice, passion fruit extract and an inverted pint of beer, is quite strong with overwhelming liquory taste.If youre in the mood for something fresh and fruity, do give the French Red Head a try, which is a combination of vodka, watermelon and fresh basil. A personal favourite was the Jack Sparrow, which has a good dose of Jack Daniels, banana puree and pineapple juice. Although the combination sounds odd, this is actually a great cocktail with the perfect blend of flavours. The bar menu has a diverse set of drinks, along with all your staples.Coming to the food, we started the meal with Armagh Mushroom Bites, which were basically mini brioche buns with a creamy mushroom filling. Although tasty, it was nothing spectacular.The Mini Chicken Tacos were alright, and the taco shell was slightly stale. There were a few different kinds of fries, all of which looked appealing. We tried the Minced up Fries, that had fries topped with chicken bolognese, cheddar, boiled egg and crispy onion. This is something youd definitely want to try while drinking, although wed have liked a more amount of cheddar to cut through the strong flavour of the bolognese.We got the Sourdough Fondue Bowl next - hollow sourdough filled a three-cheese sauce, served with chargrilled broccoli, smoked sausage, grilled chicken bits and roasted sweet potato. Overall, a good dish, and the secret hero was the roasted sweet potato that went beautifully with the cheese sauce.We started our mains with the Beer Can Roast Chicken  stout flavoured grilled chicken served with roast potatoes and vegetables  and it was average, mainly due to the gamey chicken. The Portofino Grilled Fish had (slightly dry) pieces of fish with lumpy, flavourless mashed potatoes and string beans.The best part of the meal was the Irish House Burger. This tenderloin patty, topped with a jalapeno-cheese sauce, cheddar melts, a sunny-side up egg and caramelised onions served with fries and gherkins was what saved the meal for us. We also gave the Original Italian Spaghetti with prawns a try, which was a traditional tomoto, basil, garlic sauce pasta, but very on-point with the flavours.For desserts, we tried the Irish River Dance (purely for the sake of the name), for which we only had one word  overwhelming. Served in a massive beer glass, this mish-mash of brownie bits, dark chocolate, vanilla ice cream, chocolate truffles, nuts, caramel sauce and fresh lager beer - is for the one hoping to fall deep into a sugar coma. The Nutty Caramel Pie was actually quite good, as peanut butter, caramel and dark chocolate are a combination made in heaven for food.The Irish Pub in Bellandur is ideal for colleagues from the nearby offices to grab a post-work drink and snacks, because the rather unexciting food is perhaps not worth braving the journey for.Cost for two: Rs 700"

(Reuters) Houston, Sept. 2 (AP): President Donald Trump cupped a boy's face in his hands and then gave him a high-five. He lifted a girl into his arms to give her a kiss. He snapped on latex gloves to hand out boxed lunches of hot dogs and potato chips. On his visit to a shelter for storm victims today, the President declared he sees ""a lot of love"" in the wake of devastation left by Harvey. ""We saw a lot of happiness,"" he told reporters after he and First Lady Melania Trump greeted children in the kids' zone in NRG Centre, an emergency refuge for people who were forced out of their homes. ""As tough as this was, it's been a wonderful thing."" It was his second trip to Texas in a week, and this time his first order of business was to meet those affected by the record-setting rainfall and flooding. He is also set to survey some of the damage and head to Lake Charles, Louisiana, another hard-hit area. That interaction was missing from Tuesday's trip to Texas, which was criticised as being off-key for a presidential visit to discuss communities in crisis. In Corpus Christi and Austin, Trump sat with emergency responders and officials who were coordinating recovery efforts with his administration. The event was marked by Trump's impromptu speech to supporters outside a Corpus Christi firehouse - ""What a crowd, what a turnout,"" he said - instead of images of the President consoling victims or walking among the damage caused by the storm. Trump at that time kept his distance from the epicentre of the damage, in Houston, to avoid disrupting recovery operations. Still, critics said he failed to adequately express compassion for the families of those killed in the storm's path or those whose homes were flooded. He raised eyebrows when he predicted his approach would be a model for future Presidents to emulate. ""We want to do it better than ever before,"" he said. ""We want to be looked at in five years, in 10 years from now as, 'This is the way to do it.'"" ""There was a lot of high-fiving about how well this disaster was being handled even as people were on their rooftops hoping to be rescued,"" said David Axelrod, a top adviser to President Barack Obama. ""People need to know that their President is emotionally engaged in their struggle, and part of the obligation or the responsibility of a President, particularly in a media age, is to make that human connection."" Trump later voiced more direct concern for those caught up in the storm. At the start of a speech in Missouri on Wednesday, he said the nation was praying for those in Harvey's path and ""we are here with you every single step of the way"". The President reiterated that support in a tweet as he rode to the NRG Centre in Houston today. At the site, he called the federal, state and local response to the disaster ""fantastic"". ""I think people appreciate what's been done,"" he said. ""It's been done very efficiently, very well. And that's what we want."" More than 17,000 people have sought refuge in Texas shelters, the American Red Cross said earlier this week. NRG Centre opened on Tuesday."

The young male elephant suffered serious injuries in its trunk, sustaining a severe shock. The farmer is absconding and a case has been registered by Lingadhalli Police and Tarikere Range officials. According to G Veeresh, wildlife activist, it was a single tusk elephant. He said, This is the fourth such incident in this region as elephants are electrocuted frequently. More than three leopards were also snared in this area. Even people have died by electrocution.Karnataka Chief Wildlife Warden C Jayaram told Express that seven deaths which occurred in Kodagu district were because of snapped cables. The deaths occurred in coffee estates during heavy rains when visibility was low. These were accidental deaths caused by electrocution. After this incident, we held discussions with ESCOMS so that all the sagging and snapped cables are repaired. Now there is regular monitoring and inspection by both forest and power officials, he said.In cases of deaths due to electric fencing, cases have been booked against offenders, Jayaram added. Compared to sagging power cables, deaths due to illegal electric fencing have come down and they are rare now, he said.However, conservationists disagree and add that the forest department, police and power companies should take strict action against offenders."

But that is what I love doing.While creating a recipe, the most integral part is the choice of ingredients. During the initial days of my career when I was working with world's leading Indian chefs, they always advised me to talk with ingredients, to know what they convey in terms of flavours, understand their behaviour when they are being cooked. To know the ingredient, taste the ingredient, pair it with other ingredients and taste them together to know how they taste together. That is what I have been doing while creating recipes.I have a huge number of vegetarian viewers who follow me and one thing I know is their love for potatoes and paneer but often they arent clubbed together and are always tried in their generic forms like french fries or paneer tikka. I just wanted to make this fun and interesting with use of minimalistic ingredients. I gave it an oriental approach with the Indo-Chinese flavour by using two Sriracha sauce, a flaming hot Thai favourite and Garlic chilli dip and spread, giving a bite of garlic and kick of chilli.The recipe is all about bite sized crispy scoops of baby potatoes filled with the spicy tangy paneer, topped with the garlic chilli dip and spread. The sauces well blend with each other give a wholesome flavour to the recipe with tangy and spicy notes when you bite into the crispy potato and paneer. After the first trial, everyone in the studio loved the results and we finalised this recipe. Viewers have loved the recipe and the recipe has received more than a million views online.Creating recipes is all about instinct and the marriage of flavours in the ingredients. We have received amazing testimonials from our viewers who have tried the recipe. Also, I do recommend all the readers to go by their instinct and not treat recipes as the holy book to go with, always trust your instinct and do put in your views and tastes into the recipe for a much better experience.

It was under these tasks that Tabarruk was distributed among the poor irrespective of religion and caste and sent to the descendants of the royal families once a day for the first 10 days of the month of mourning. The Nawab had left an amount of Rs 12 lakh in 1839 at an interest amounting to Rs 48,000 annually to fulfil all tasks under the Deed.Since then until last year, the traditional community kitchen at Chhota Imamabara would be abuzz with activities preparing khameeri roti, potato curry or dal and sheermal. This year, however, the district administration that has additional charge of HAT said that ""complaints about the curry and pulse starting to rot due to weather"" had brought forth suggestion to alter the menu.""Whatever will be convenient and of good quality will be distributed. There were several complaints about the curry and pulse, which is why it was thought of altering it...The sheermal as a better option is under consideration,"" said secretary of HAT and additional district magistrate (ADM) west, Santosh Kumar Vaish.However, this proposal has sought an angry response from common people as well as royal family descendants.""Not a slightest change will be accepted in tradition when the king had left money for customs to be followed. Who is the administration to change it? Why have they created a budget of Rs 27 lakh which is Rs 5 lakh more than last year and are still trying to cut costs by going for just sheermal?"" questioned Farhana Maliki, president of Begumat Royal Family of Awadh.""Every year, there used to be a meeting of HAT with us descendants 15 days before Muharram. This year, we were not involved and decisions were taken by the district magistrate, ADM west and the officer on special duty. What does this show?"" Maliki added.Vaish said, ""We will have a meeting with the families. A second tender has been put up which will be opened on September 13 for a final decision on the menu."""

The tobacco-to-FMCG-to-hotel-to-agri business major is likely to enter the market with fresh potato  a first-of-its-kind in India  followed by some more fresh vegetables. The company is also planning to launch fruit pulps and juices in order to become top food company in India.Devising the India First strategy for the future, CEO Sanjiv Puri (in pic) said: Currently, we rank No. 3 among the food companies in India with a total Rs 8,000-crore consumer spends and two Rs 3,000-crore plus brands  Aashirvaad and Sunfeast. ITC has always preferred to create indigenous brands for its new businesses that include foods, personal care products and stationary. The two Rs 3,000-crore plus food labels are also indigenous brands, which were created in the last decade.Puri pointed out that going forward, the focus will be on fruit, vegetables and sea foods because only 2%-3% of the perishables are now being processed in the country. We shall bring some food products in the fresh form or in shelf-life-enhancing form. Like, we are planning to introduce fresh potato soon, he added.The company is planning to launch low sugar potato and anti-oxidant potato soon. Besides potato, as indicated by Puri, ITC might come out with dehydrated onion later this year.The Kolkata-based company had created a brand called ITC Master Chef for prawn and blended spices earlier this year. The divisional chief executive of the agri business of ITC, S Sivakumar , said the dehydrated onion could come under the ITC Maser Chef brand. We are planning to launch more food products in fresh, semi-processed and in puree form. We are also launching mango pulp soon. This could be under B Natural brand, he added.The food brands of ITC include Aashirvaad, Sunfeast, Candyman, Bingo, Yippee!, ITC Master chef B Natural, Aashirvaad Swasti Ghee, Mint O, Sunbean and Fabelle. Besides Sunfeast and Aashrvaad, the two other over Rs1000-crore brands are Bingo and Yippee!.Candyman has also crossed Rs 500crore mark in terms of consumer spends. Aashirvaad is alredy No. 1 in branded atta while Sunfest is among the leaders in biscuits.The ITC CEO argued that one of the main reasons to come out with semi-processed and fresh vegetables is to reduce colossal waste in fruits and vegetables in India. There is an annual loss of Rs 90,000 crore in perishables. This can be brought down by devising a proper strategy. Food is a very big opportunity for us. ITC has a very strong agro backend as well as trade marketing network, which is required for this, he added."

The village is protected by the grand Dongurlem hill range and is traversed by the Calem river.The village has the famous water body called Vaigond (Tollem), the majestic Kalanath temple, and the Portuguese-built railway station. Kalanath temple is regarded by its residents as the gram devta (village deity). ""The origins of the village name is attributed to this place of worship. The sons and daughters of Calem believe that the village name has been derived from Kalanath temple,"" says Gokuldas Khutkar of Khutkar Wada.The tribal community, known as Dhangar Samaj, who live in the village, are famous as cultivators of banana, sweet potato and papaya.Calem, which admeasures 1.06 lakh sqm, is bordered by Sanvordem town and the villages of Collem and Dabal in Dharbandora taluka, and Uguem in Sanguem taluka.Calem has seven panchayat wards and 'vadde' (vaddo: singular, meaning traditional village ward) like Khutkar, Thorlemol, Devnamol, Bhat, Ducorkond, Dudhal, Karemol, Khamol, Kuinomol, Khodwamol, Vegregal, Kamdar, Voldem, Mauling, Bondel, Ambemol, Chanimol, etc.Since the past two decades, residents of the village, whose ancestors have been living here since Portuguese times, have been barred from making any renovation or alteration in their respective private properties. Since 1982, under central law, over 80% of the village was declared as a wildlife area. The rules became more stringent in 2004 when the state government's reserve area law came into force.""The rules about wildlife area and protected reserve area was imposed without taking the villagers into confidence as main stakeholders. This has made all construction or repair work impossible. For decades now, fetters have been put upon Calem's development in the name of reserve forest and wildlife protection,"" says Harshal Dessai, a resident of Bondel.Residents' Speak""Calem is blessed by the Almighty. The Vaigond (Tollem) has water even in the worst dry summers of May. The lush green hill, which measures around 3-4km in area, runs adjacent to the grand Kalanath Temple. The hill offers the best site for trekking and rock climbing in Goa. The state government should create employment opportunities by encouraging ecofriendly small scale industries and should also judiciously utilize the 1.5 lakh sqm of government agricultural farm for the benefit of Calem villagers.Krishnanath Naik, resident of Thorlemol WadaOur agricultural village is adorned with natural green cover throughout the year. Besides being a pollution-free village, Calem also prides in its fraternal camaraderie among religions and castes. The shigmo festival in Calem is popular and the festivities commence from Khutkar Wada. The Dessais and Khutkars are the two most important communities in the village.Sudhakar Dessai, resident of Thorlemol WadaSarpanch's Take""Development of Calem must include beautification of Vaigond (Tollem). We also need a modern sports playground. The construction of a railway overbridge near the government high school is essential. The rural medical centre, which has been constructed through MPLAD South Goa funds, will commence operations soon. The state government must denotify private properties classified as reserve forest. It will then boost self-employment as villagers will be able to avail subsidy for the first time.Kishor DessaiHeritage TrailCalem railway station: An important landmark in the village since the Portuguese era. Located at Thorlemol Wada, it showcases Calem to the outside world. The South Western Railway runs trains on this route, but villagers have a grievance that apart from local trains, including the Calem-Vasco train, not a single express train stops at the station. Before conversion from metre to broad guage tracks, the trains operating between Miraj and Vasco would halt here.Kalanath Temple: The centuries-old main temple of the village, situated at Thorlemol Wada, was renovated around a decade ago. It is dedicated to Lord Shiva and it becomes the most frequented spot during the two days of its zatra in the month of January each year. Zalmi is the another temple in Calem.Our Lady of Fatima Chapel: This chapel is over 150 years old. Mass is celebrated here at 7am daily. It is located opposite the Calem railway station at Thorlemol Wada. It is affiliated to Our Lady of Piety parish church in Colem, Dharbandora.Vaigond (Tollem): Situated at Vegregal Wada, this water body is over 600 years old. It is a spiritual spot and the water is believed to have medicinal properties. It becomes a hotspot during the Mahashivratri puja (annual festival celebrated in honour of Lord Shiva).Tiger Waterfall: The scenic spot at Vegregal comes to life only in the monsoon. There is a place called Tiger's Cave adjacent to it, which is believed to measure around 3km and connects Calem to Costi village in Sanguem taluka.Government Primary School: Situated adjacent to the panchayat, the school was set up in the 1970s. It offers education in the Marathi medium.Government High School: The co-educational school from Class V to Class X at Khodwamol caters to around 220 students.Government Agricultural Farm: Admeasuring around 1.5 lakh sqm in area at Kuinomol, the farm caters to Goa's need for seeds and shrubs such as coconut, mango, cashew, jackfruit, vegetables, flowers, etc. While presenting the 2016-2017 state budget, former CM Laxmikant Parsekar had made a proposal to turn this farm into an organic facility. He also proposed using it as a training centre for farmers by using organic inputs for generating organic outputs.Directorate of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services: It caters to the needs of fodder supply as well as providing the services of veterinary doctors to the village cattle. Few years ago, the centre was in the news when stray cattle, which were caught in the state, were housed in its shed.Union Bank of India (UBI): This branch of UBI operates twice a week in the premises of the village panchayat.

Ecstatic after her restaurant turned one year this month, the entrepreneur and IIPM graduate who runs the kitchen along with a bakery under the same name, talks to us about her love for chocolates, being a mompreneur, shopping for therapy and more!Was becoming an entrepreneur always a dream?Well, to be honest no, it wasnt. I was just interested in chocolates  both eating and making them. So, once I completed my hotel management course, I started making handmade chocolates from home. Then as I started getting orders from close friends and a few corporates, it expanded in a small scale and I hired people. After being a part of food and servicing, and realising how it made me happy, I decided to start my own restaurant that catered to a larger audience. But, I think I should attribute my entrepreneurial streak to my mother. She is a businesswoman herself and maybe I acquired that trait! (Smiles)Does the name Kichees have a history?(Laughs) Not really. It is my nickname and, before I started putting a name label for my chocolate business, I was thinking of different names that would reflect me and the business. So, I finally decided to go with Kichee and now thats become the brand!What about the food industry/ food do you love the most?I am not really a foodie but, I love experimenting with food  both in terms of coming up with new dishes and tasting new cuisines/dishes. In that way, the industry has a lot of offer. My husband and I visit different restaurants every weekend to try new dishes from different cuisines. It helps me in keeping myself updated on whats new.Whats your favourite cuisine?I love continental food, pastas and pizzas. Despite being a south India, I dont have the palette for typical south food. But, I can devour pizzas and pastas at any given time! (Quips)Dishes in your menu that you love?Since ours is a fusion restaurant, a lot of thought, research and trials went in, before we came up with the menu. The Chi-Ta  a mix of Chinese food and Pita bread, the Paan Panacotta and the potato paneer boat are some of my favourites. I am sure you wont find this anywhere.A mother, a wife and an entrepreneur  one thing you associate with each role?My baby is two years old now and shes growing along with my restaurant. For me, the last year has been baby time. But, I manage and love taking care of her and the business. I had an arranged marriage and have been married for five years now. But, my husband and I have a lot of common interests. One of which is our love for pizza and pasta! He also helps me with managing the business. This is one thing I have been extremely lucky with  a supportive husband, mother and in-laws.Do you have any childhood memories of the city?I live in Kodambakkam now but, as a child, I was in Tnagar. The locality has changed a lot now. Be it the ever crowded GN Chetty road or any road in Tnagar for that matter, I have seen them change. I studied in Holy Angels schools and used to travel by cycle through those roads. I have photographic memories of those days, which are very pleasant. If I ever plan to open another outlet to Kichee or for my bakery, I will definitely think of opening it in T Nagar. I love Chennai for everything that it is. If I were to relocate to a different city someday, it would be very difficult for me!Shopping or travelling?Shopping! I shop to unwind and relax. My picks are mostly clothes, accessories and anything that would make me happy. I do like travelling, but I dont travel very often. If theres a places I would like to go, it would be Paris, for the different variety of chocolates.Will Kichee become a multi-outlet brand?Well, thats the long term plan. But, I will be focusing on opening an outlet for the bakery soon. Opening another outlet for the restaurant, might take a couple of years. I am also keen on carving a niche when it comes to packaging - of pastries and chocolates.something out of the box and synonymous to Kichees."

(File | Reuters)NEW DELHI: Wholesale inflation rose to a four-month high of 3.24 per cent in August as prices of food articles, led by onions and vegetables, soared.Inflation based on the wholesale price index (WPI) was 1.88 per cent in July 2017 and 1.09 per cent in August 2016.The last such high level of inflation was witnessed in April when the rate of price rise was 3.85 per cent.The government data released today showed that prices of food articles went up by 5.75 per cent in August on a yearly basis, as against 2.15 per cent in July.Vegetable prices shot up by 44.91 per cent in August, as against 21.95 per cent in July.Onion prices witnessed a sharp surge at 88.46 per cent in August, as against a contraction of 9.50 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in manufactured products witnessed a slight increase at 2.45 per cent in August, against 2.18 per cent in July.In fuel and power segment, inflation saw a sharp surge to a near double digit inflation at 9.99 per cent, against 4.37 per cent in July.Fuel inflation shot up as petrol and diesel prices continued to remain high relentlessly on global crude oil rates, while power tariffs shot through the roof on lower domestic production.Apart from vegetables, the food articles that saw rise in prices include pulses, fruits (7.35 per cent), egg, meat and fish (3.93 per cent), cereals (0.21 per cent) and paddy (2.70 per cent).However, potato continued to see deflation at 43.82 per cent and pulses (-) 30.16 per cent.The final print of June WPI inflation remained unchanged from provisional estimate of 0.90 per cent.Data released earlier this week showed retail inflation rose to a five-month high of 3.36 per cent in August due to costlier vegetables and fruits.Also industrial production grew by just 1.2 per cent in July from 4.5 per cent a year ago, bearing the brunt of a dismal show of the manufacturing sector.Last month, the Reserve Bank cut policy repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low.The RBI said it will endeavour to keep retail inflation close to 4 per cent but in the near term, there might be some uptick on account of pay commission payouts and price adjustments post GST rollout from July 1."

There are hardly any buyers for our crop. Since demonetisation, traders are facing cash crunch, resulting in drop of bulk orders from big markets like Delhi and other major cities, Jaswinder Singh Sangha, general secretary, Jalandhar Potato Growers Association, told The Hindu.He said that potato growers have kept the eatables and seed potatoes in cold storage since the last crop season in anticipation of selling the produce at a better price later.But now there are fewer buyers and poor prices. The crop is still lying and now when the new season crop will hit the market (in next few months) the loss of growers would only aggravate, he added.Facing hardships due to demonetisation, the potato seed growers from Punjab have demanded an immediate freight subsidy so that the growers can transport their crop to other States and fetch some returns.Also, the growers have urged the State government to waive crop loans of potato growers besides asking the State agencies to intervene and generate markets at the national and international level.Punjab produces quality potato seed, which is distributed across the country including West Bengal, Gujarat, Karnataka, UP , MP and Odisha. Potato seed is usually supplied from last week of October to mid-December every year."

Onion prices surged a whopping 88.46 per cent in August as against a contraction of 9.50 per cent in the previous month.Inflation in manufactured products witnessed a slight increase at 2.45 per cent in August compared with 2.18 per cent in July.In the fuel and power segment, the WPI-based inflation saw a surge to a near double-digit level at 9.99 per cent against 4.37 per cent in July.Apart from vegetables, the food articles that saw a rise in prices include pulses, fruits (7.35 per cent), egg, meat and fish (3.93 per cent), cereals (0.21 per cent) and paddy (2.70 per cent).However, potato continued to see contraction at 43.82 per cent and pulses 30.16 per cent.The final print of June WPI inflation remained unchanged from the provisional estimate of 0.90 per cent.The sharp rise in wholesale and retail prices in August is likely to make the Reserve Bank of India ponder over the policy rate trajectory for the short- and medium-term. Last month, the RBI had cut the repo rate by 0.25 per cent to 6 per cent citing reduction in inflation risk. The rate cut was the first in 10 months and brought policy rates to near 7-year low."

Especially for procrastinating writers, people who came into writing really late, and writers for whom the real world problem of procuring the daily bread has taken them away from writing. Mary Anne Shaffer is the inspiring writer they should read about. Shaffer wrote her first book when she was 73. It was a story which germinated during an idyllic vacation to a not-very-well-known island, nearly 40 years ago.Are you listening, Procrastination? Due to ill health, Shaffer could not complete her book, and her niece, the childrens writer Annie Barrows had to take her, and the book to the finishing line. Shaffer died before the book was published. That book was The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, the most joyful and uplifting book if there ever was one. Dear writer, trust yourself, you have your Guernsey Literary in you. And you are never too late to start.Elizabeth McKenna is dead, one thinks. She is lost to the war. The second big one. But she lives on in the hearts and minds of her friends and neighbors and the people whose lives she touched. She lived in Guernsey, an island along the English Channel which is part of the United Kingdom, and the only part of British soil that was occupied by the Germans.The war is over now, and the Allied forces have won. The Germans are not there anymore, normalcy is slowly returning to Guernsey and its quaint old-world folks, but things is not quite the same. This is an epistolatory novel, one that is written in the form of letters. The main letter writer of this novel is the lead character, Juliet Ashton. She is a young British writer, and was a war journalist previously. Now that the war is over, she is coming to terms with the aftermath.One day, she gets a letter from a pig farmer from Guernsey, a Dawsey Adams, who had found her address in a copy of a book by Charles and Mary Lamb, which was previously owned by Juliet. This starts a communication with the gentle, mellow folks of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, a society formed on the spur of the moment by the aforementioned Elizabeth McKenna  and which saved the lives of a fair few of the islanders. How? Because Elizabeth and her friends, which included Dawsey, had inadvertently broken an evening curfew, which was imposed by the Germans on the German-occupied Island.An inadvertent-delay-due-to-literary-society-event was not as much frowned upon by the Germans as feast-and-revelry. Juliet exchanges letters with Dawsey and the other members of the society, and slowly integrates herself with the people, their island, their lives, their memories of Elizabeth, and their love of books. Until one day, she sets sail from London and lands up in the island. May all books have a soul like The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society."

When it is de rigeur for engineering graduates to take the software route through campus interviews and land assignments abroad, Naveen Hegde, an engineering graduate from Sirsi, did an about-turn. Naveen decided to return to his village in Sirsi and set up a business that would offer direct and indirect employment to villagers, even if it was in a small way. And thats how his start-up iTOrFood was formed.Naveen HegdeIf returning to his village to do business was risky enough, starting a beverages company where he had practically no hands-on experience was even riskier. But Naveen had set out to do this even before he graduated. He did his own ground work on selling beverages, more specifically natural juices. He assessed the pulse of the market and trends.He also did a survey of the products available near Sirsi. And in 2015 at the age of 23, Naveen turned entrepreneur with iTOrFood, iTOr being an abbreviation for Idea to Reality. It pretty much sums up his own journey.Naveen says, I was not interested to leave my parents alone in the village and go to metros in search of a job. I kept thinking of starting an initiative in my village. I explained my idea to them and they were very supportive.With the backing of his parents, he invested nearly `15 lakh along with a partner and began to produce kokum, lemon, amla and tamarind juices without adding flavours, colours and preservatives at his village Hulgol, about 15 km from Sirsi on Yellapur road.Concentrating on the markets of Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Mangaluru, Naveen has been producing these juices under the brand name Hooglu. It was just meant to be a catchy word, derived from his village name Hulgol and making it sound similar to Google, that is Hulgol + Google = Hooglu.Life hasnt been without challenges. It was tough to initially carve a niche for his products in metro markets. But he managed to market it as a natural fruit juice and healthy drink by cashing in on the growing health consciousness among people.Hooglu products at a small outletWe got help from the Indian Institute of Horticulture Research in Bengaluru. They gave us a lot of technical support. We also got some discounts on machineries under the scheme of National Horticulture Mission and started our unit in a plot in my village. We constructed a 2000 sq ft building for manufacturing. We collect raw material from Sirsi and surrounding areas only to make the beverages, says Naveen.Today, Naveens company has given direct employment to 10 people while another 15 people are indirectly employed in sales through his start-up. The daily production is 2,000 units of juice packs.Recently the company also ventured into making 12 varieties of banana and potato chips. Naveen is focused on building the brand in the three big cities first. He says after that, he plans to expand his business in smaller cities, including Mysuru, Hubballi, Belagavi and others. He feels there is a huge market for natural organic products that are free from artificial flavours and colours. I want to gradually expand my business and become an example for other youngsters who want to go back to villages and tap their entrepreneurial spirit, says Naveen.It is a great initiative of a young boy from Sirsi region. Such entrepreneurs, who start their set-up in industrially backward regions, should be recognised by Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises and the ministry should promote their products Ramesh Patil, President of Karnataka Chamber of Commerce and Industries, HubballiIn agriculture if processing happens at source, farmer can get highest price for his products.

The houses promised by officials exist only on paper, and there are fears that children may drop out of school, choosing a life of drugs & violenceCHENNAI: For someone whose life is built around fish, 10-year-old Sanjay doesnt really like to have them for lunch. Hes a picky eater; he will not finish his food without potato or eggs, complained his mother, Kalaivani. On Thursday, however, Sanjay sat eating lemon rice  no potatoes or eggs, from an upturned orange frisbee, amidst the rubble that was only hours ago, his home.Sanjay lost his home at Nalla Thanni Odai Kuppam near Kasimedu to the recent eviction drive by revenue officials of Ambattur on Wednesday. Around 130 houses in the fishing hamlet were demolished on a single day and residents allege that they werent even given time to recover their belongings.Residents of NTO Kuppam had to sift through the rubble to recover their belongings | P jawaharExpress had earlier reported how the land on which these 130 houses were built is not exactly necessary for a proposed highway. Around 230 families had earlier been evicted in the first phase six months ago, to make way for the Ennore Expressway that was proposed in 2005. A senior official from Tamil Nadu Road Development Corporation (TNRDC) had told Express that the land cleared in the first phase is enough for the highway and this was one of the reasons the remaining residents of NTO Kuppam questioned the need to evict them.But none were ready to hear their arguments and after Wednesdays forced eviction, the hamlet looked as if it were rocked by an earthquake. Clothes, kitchen utensils, toothbrushes, mirrors, and almirahs lay buried under asbestos sheets and bricks.Residents with their prized possessions on the road after the eviction drive by revenue officials | p jawaharNothing. We were able to take nothing out; all my marksheets are buried inside, said 17-year-old Mercy, Sanjays neighbour. Sanjay and his brother Ajay also lost their textbooks in the debris. But I pulled the frisbee out, and some of my other toys, said a proud Sanjay.However, the 130 families have no place to take the broken, torn or bent remains. Land for resettlement of the residents of this hamlet was allocated but not a single brick was laid by the Slum Clearance Board so far at the site three kilometers away.It still hasnt been cleared of weeds and plants. We dont know when the government will begin the work, said Kalaivani. As per the State governments own statement on September 20, the government had only then decided to expedite the tender for construction of tenements.Classified as encroachers, these families cannot raise questions. But these families have been living in the hamlet for at least three generations and kept moving inward due to coastal erosion.Nothing prepared his family for what was to come. First came the oil spill, and now this. After the oil spill, business fell and it still hasnt recovered. We used to make a maximum of Rs 6000-Rs 7000 a month. Now it has halved, said his mother Kalaivani, who sold fish, like most other women in the hamlet, for a livelihood.So, when the government authorities handed them Rs 20,000 per family around six months ago during the first phase of evictions to find accommodation, they used it for food instead. What do we do when theres no income? Besides, how do they expect us to find accommodation for over six months with Rs 20,000? It wont even cover the advance,  said Kalaivani.After the eviction, none of the residents moved. They stayed the night in makeshift tents and some, in the temple, the only structure left standing. It was a bad night as it rained. The rain was heavy last night. We didnt have money to go anywhere else as all our relatives are here only. We took shelter in the temple but I still got wet. Look, I have running nose, said Sanjay. Many of the aayas were crying all night long.None of the nearly 50 students in NTO kuppam will go to school at least for a week or until the families manage to find another house. Around a kilometre away, Jonitha John, Sanjays favourite teacher at a corporation school in Washermanpet, was a worried woman.She had heard about the evictions. The students flocking around her had whispered that Sanjays house has been demolished. Jonitha described him as a street-smart kid brilliant at arithmetic. He loves outdoor activities, she said. She recollected the numerous butterfly cocoons he had brought to class so the entire class could watch it magically turn into a butterfly.However, Sanjay wasnt the perfect student. Ever since his father got arrested a few weeks ago for a petty crime, Sanjay had resorted to hitting his classmates and using violence to solve issues. He was a loner. So we started involving him in lots of group activities, said Jonitha. And things were looking up. She is worried that the break could hamper the progress. There was another boy, Adithya, in the other section. His family also belonged to NTO Kuppam and was evicted six months ago in the first phase. Hes dropped out since, lamented Jonitha.Sanjay said he wants to become a police officer when he grows up. With school no more the priority as he picks out his toys and books from the rubble, one can only hope the sudden tragedy will not further fuel the bouts of violence he exhibits and take him on the footsteps of his father.The rehabilitationAs reported by Express earlier, the State government had promised to build tenements for NTO Kuppams residents in the 2.28 acres of land belonging to Arulmigu Thiyagarajaswami Temple some 3 kms away.

The season's total rainfall for the country is 5% below normal, but it will not make any impact on planting that will begin in a fortnight, he said.Most parts of northwest and central India received deficit rainfall, but farmers in Punjab and Haryana have access to canal irrigation that helps them plant even if rainfall is scanty.Pattanayak attributed his confidence on rabi harvest to an extended monsoon. ""It (Monsoon) is now in withdrawal phase but still not complete, as we are expecting four days of very good rain in some parts of south India,"" he said. ""That is the region where rainfall has been deficit."" A drought assessment report prepared by Mahalanobis Crop Forecast Centre under the agriculture ministry had said that as of August end more than 225 districts in 17 states had less than normal rainfall.Pattanayak, however, said, ""We have to read Mahalanobis data with actual field situation to get a clear picture.""He said the 5% deficit in monsoon rains for the season would not make any impact on food security and food production. ""The occasional dip in vegetables will be there depending on local and seasonal condition, but we are quite comfortable in onion and potato production,"" Pattanayak said.Mahalanobis data is largely dependent on satellite-based remote sensing indices, rainfall data, soil moisture estimates, crop sown area and irrigation statistics, which are used for drought warning and assessment.""We are in a very good position as far as agriculture sector is concerned, contrary to the popular impression that is being carried out that we had a deficit rainfall,"" Pattanayak said. ""This monsoon, deficit has been only 5% for the country and in parts  south peninsular, north-west and central MP  it has been more than 5%.

According to the officers, ""purse"" means a bag for just the cash. My bag had my raincoat stashed in it. So it did not qualify for passage, so what if there were forecasts of a light shower. My friend had come armed with umbrellas and was promptly issued a retreat order. We did find a man who had started storing helmets, bags and suchlike in a heap for a price on the pavement near Gate 1, but he did not inspire confidence. So we trudged back to the parked car to deposit it all. This meant we were about 10 minutes late for the match. Truth be told, the entry was seamless and the seats (we were behind the goal at the north end) had more legspace than at the refurbished Eden Gardens. But even as England unleashed one attack after another at our end, we were frustrated at not seeing a single conversion. At half-time, my friend's son moped: ""So unfair! Couldn't they score at least one in the first half so we could see it up close?"" A fellow spectator seated in front turned and quipped: "" Ekta goal toh hoyechhey ekdom shurutey (They scored one at the start)."" Really? So Chile was trailing? How would we know? There was nothing where we were sitting to indicate what the status of the match was. When the second goal was scored (at the other end since the teams had swapped sides), we noticed youths rushing to the lowest steps on the aisle and looking up to the upper tier. I followed them and spotted a giant screen upstairs showing the live feed of the match. There was no other semblance of a scoreboard elsewhere. As an Eden regular, I could not help but contrast the experience. Eden has three scoreboards since 2011. One is the giant electronic score board at the High Court end which shows both the score and the live feed. Another is the old manual one over C Block, right of the clubhouse. There is a third scoreboard over J Block, left of the clubhouse, which was turned from manual to an electronic one with a smaller screen last year. So anyone seated at any corner of the stadium or walking in at anytime can easily grasp the match situation. It also helps that the Calcutta police allows binoculars. Even if a second giant screen cannot be installed at Salt Lake stadium, multiple digital score lines on the edge of the upper tier should be. A little more variety of food would also be welcome. All one gets are popcorn, potato chips, fruit cake slices and pizza (the stalls closest to us soon ran out of pizza) which is inadequate especially where there is a double header, like again on October 11 and 14. The gates open at 3pm and the second match ends close to 10pm. So spectators would need more than titbits. Realising this later in the evening, the food stall employees started to mix muri with sauce, sprinkled with peanuts and packed it off for a neat Rs 50 per container. It was so hot that I had to rush to buy a water bottle. Each ticket holder was entitled to a free water pouch which was long exhausted. Finally, a word on the washroom. While it was impressive to find sanitary fittings of a top-notch brand in the ladies' toilet, it would help if someone checks if the latches of all the doors can be fastened!"

So, people I know and dont know, and who are fond of food, often give me tips about where to go for a particularly crispy kachori or juicy kabab. Some days ago, a young foodie who runs a cab service sent a message across  that I should try out Jung Bahadurs kachori.The name rang a bell but I couldnt place it right then. Later, I recalled that there was a Jung Bahadur kachori-wallah in Nai Sarak whose crispy kachoris I had eaten and enjoyed. But we called him Dinesh Kachoriwallah.I went back to Nai Sarak sometime last week  and found that the kachoris are still being sold from the roadside. I ate some, but was told that they have a main branch now in Maliwara.The address is 1104 Maliwara, Gali Paranthe Wali, Chandni Chowk (Phone numbers: 99114-01440 and 98916-98995). From the Chandni Chowk Metro Station, move towards Paranthe Wali Gali. At the T-junction turn right, and you will find the kachori shop on your left a hundred yards ahead.This is a very popular kachori place, so the turnover is high. That means the kachoris are freshly fried, which, of course, is what the dish is all about. Right in front of you, in bubbling hot oil in a huge kadhai, you will see the kachoris being fried. Then they are served with a potato curry, which is topped with a helping of kachaloo strips. One kachori is for Rs. 20, and two are for Rs. 35.The kachoris and the curry are transported to the Nai Sarak counter for those who find it easier to get there. This is at the mouth of Katra Jamun. If you move from the Town Hall towards Nai Sarak, you will see the kachori stall some 200 yards down the road.I enjoyed the kachori, even though it was a bit too hot for me. The kachori was fresh and crunchy, and what was nice was the fact that it had been well stuffed with a dal paste. The potatoes had been mashed well in the sabzi, and the kachaloo added a tangy taste to it. Some chutney was served with it, along with slivers of ginger and green chillies.Side helpingJang Bahadur  these days known as JB  serves you the kachoris with the potato sabzi on top of it. If you want, you can ask them to break open the kachori for you, and to then add the curry. Thats one way of eating it, allowing the potatoes to mix well with the kachori. I ate it like that, but I prefer to have my kachori whole  nice and crispy  and I enjoy biting into it with a side helping of potatoes or pumpkin, or whatever it is served with it.JB works well for those who like kachoris spicy and hot, for even the dal pithi stuffing has its share of chillies. I like an occasional hot kachori, and quite enjoy the different tastes that the kachoriwallahs excel in.It was nice to have gone back to an old friend. Hot or not, its a kachori."

5a14d10a9855b76bf13e82ef,A plate of goodness,http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/a-plate-of-goodness/article19874354.ece,2017-10-17,"Food is an integral and essential part of all our celebrations in life. Be it child birth, marriage, festival or death, a set of special dishes are served in a thali. Over the years, it has become an essential part of every occasion. The salivary glands know the usual suspects and start working beforehand. But with changing demographies and increasing demand to consume cuisines of different cultures, thali is losing its purity and original charm. An element of shock and awe has crept into the ritual.Now Chef Kunal Kapur is rediscovering these traditional thalis through Utsav: Thalis of India on Living Foodz channel. Thali is unique to Indian cuisines and is found nowhere in the world. The bigger purpose of serving a thali is to have a complete nutritious and wholesome meal including vegetables, lentils, dry and gravy dishes. It is aesthetic and pleasing because of the play of colours and textures, says Kapur during a conversation in Delhi. Excerpts:What prompted you to take this journey?It is about discovering people, culture, food and beliefs through thalis. Usually they are associated with taglines like Punjabi or Gujarati, vegetarian or non-vegetarian with the word unlimited added to them. That is not what is being explored. What we are discovering are thalis, typically done in various communities, on special occasions and festivals like Holi, Deepavali It endeavours to explain what goes into making a thali and why only certain dishes make the cut .What would be special for Deepavali?On Deepavali, a typical baniya thali will serve lots of sweets  five to six varieties like ghiye ki burfi, pista ki lauj and a number of snacks like chaat, samosas, kachoris. In the main menu, dals and mooli ke kofte are served. The number of sweets in the thali reflect the social status of the family.A Punjabi thali on Deepavali will be sumptuous and vegetarian with many dishes prepared with potato and badis and will include parantha and kulchas, and kheer for dessert.What do thalis tell us about a particular culture or community?Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value. The Chettiar community were predominantly vegetarian. Being traders they travelled a lot, specially to South East Asia and over a period they started eating meat. So the Chettinad thali has non-vegetarian dishes and has a lot of spices from that region like kalpasi which is found in Malaysia and Thailand.Thalis tell us about the belief of the people. Varanasi thali is satvik without onions and garlic and is prepared fresh and has no canned ingredients. It is not too spicy and neither tamsik nor rajsik, nor heavy to ensure that it does not make one lazy or aggressive. The spirituality of the city comes through this thali.The Bodo thali is simple comprising local produce like pork and rice. It includes jute leaves which is more bitter than karela. The reason for its inclusion is the geography of the place. Thick with vegetation, people face lot of insect bites and are prone to become sick. So their thali includes ingredients with medicinal properties like jute leaves. Likewise, the Malwani thali has a strong presence of seafood because of the regions proximity to sea.How are thalis associated with places of worship?The belief system of a community flows into its food. In Udupi, there is a Krishna math and all Udupi residents are Krishna bhakts. They are strict vegetarians. No one is allowed inside the math kitchen. While everyone is served in a plate there, devotees seeking a favour from the deity are served food on ground. They eat like this, till their wish is granted.Are thalis under threat?As we are moving ahead, lots of our dishes are dying away, like pickles. Thalis too are vanishing as it is difficult to procure and prepare with most opting for what is offered by eateries. The show is trying to bring about an awareness regarding thalis and documenting them for future research and study. It definitely adds to ones knowledge. I did not know that in a Kashmiri Pandit thali no garlic or onion is used yet it has meat dishes.As a reputed chef, what are your takeaways from this journey?I have added vastly to my knowledge about local and regional cuisines. In Udupi, I tasted mattu gulla huli. It is sambar made out of green brinjals which comes from a particular village in the region, Mattu. It was tasty and the brinjal which had soaked the entire flavour of sambar did not disintegrate.I learnt how to make rice beer in Bodo which is consumed by men and women after a certain age. Since their thali has beer, it has no desserts. I had never heard of bichhu booty ka saag. A local saag grown in Kumaon, its leaves have a lot of thorns and sting like a scorpions bite. Made with care, it tastes out of the world.I discovered new styles of cooking. A small community called Pathare Prabhu in Maharashtra uses thande tel ka tadka for pomfret fish dish. This entails using oil along with other condiments but it is not heated. What is unique about them, is that there is no restaurant serving their food. Interestingly, they prepare and serve thalis with eight to 20 items, and is high on seafood on festivals and when the son-in-law is visiting their home. All this learning has become part of my kitchen vocabulary. I will take elements from these and tweak my dishes accordingly. I found rosella leaves or gongura grow in plenty in the north east and it can be used as salad leaves.(The show airs every Monday and Tuesday at 8 p.m.)Somewhere the thali stands for nutrition, at other places signifying a belief and for some it has medicinal value"
5a1515979855b76bf13eac8b,National Institute of Ocean Technology in Chennai's deep-sea mission  moving in top gear,http://www.newindianexpress.com/cities/chennai/2017/oct/17/national-institute-of-ocean-technology-in-chennais-deep-sea-mission--moving-in-top-gear-1676054.html,2017-10-17,"CHENNAI: Oil and natural gas have been extracted from the seas for decades, but ores and mineral deposits on the sea floor, which have the potential to change the face of economy, have still been elusive. But Indian scientists are making steady progress and an integrated mining system is under development for demonstration of deep-sea mining of polymetallic nodules (manganese nodules).The Government of India has an area of 75,000 sq km in the Central Indian Ocean Basin (CIOB) for carrying out survey and exploration of these potato-shaped, largely porous nodules, found in abundance carpeting the sea floor. A rough estimate says that polymetallic nodules in the site allotted to India by International Seabed Authority (ISA) is about 380 Million Metric Tonne (MMT), with 0.55 MMT of Cobalt, 4.7 MMT of Nickel, 4.29 MMT of Copper and 92.59 MMT of Manganese.NIOT-developed crawler to be usedfor deep-sea mining; (below)manganese nodules dredged fromCentral Indian Ocean BasinSpeaking to Express on the sidelines of a special thematic session on Deep Ocean Research, M Rajeevan, secretary, Ministry of Earth Sciences, said the Union government had signed a 15-year contract with ISA for exploration of polymetallic nodules, which expired this year. Now, another five-year extension has been given for India to develop and demonstrate a workable deep-sea mining technology.National Institute of Ocean Technology (NIOT) in Chennai has demonstrated the technology on a pilot scale and further research is going on at full pace, he said. Rajeevan added it was the biggest ocean engineering challenge, considering these nodules are to be mined from a depth of 6 km in an ultra high-pressure environment.NIOT director Satheesh C Shenoy was confident that his team will crack the complex technology. Deep-sea Technologies and Ocean Mining Group of NIOT have already developed the crawler, which weighs 12 tonnes and a soil tester that will determine the characteristics of soil on the seabed where the crawler is deployed. Currently, our team is developing the pumping system. Different components are being tested and will be integrated shortly. We hope to realise the full technology a couple of years down the line, he said.The idea is to have an integrated mining system where a crawler-based mining machine collects, crushes and pumps nodules to the mother ship using a positive displacement pump through a flexible riser system. It is expected that multiple mining machines will cover the mining field during large scale commercial mining operations. The challenge is that the heavy crawler has to be lowered to a depth of 6 km using a conducting cable, which should transmit data as well as hold the crawler steady. Any mishap can sink the mother ship, Shenoy said.Rajeevan Nair clarified that India has permission to explore, but not commercially mine the minerals. No country has the license to do deep-sea mining, but when the time comes, India should be ready to take advantage. India already has the technology to separate the minerals from dredged nodules. The Institute of Minerals and Materials Technology in Bhubaneswar has done lot of work on it.Indias Test Mine Site (TMS) is about 6,000 km away from Indian coast deep inside CIOB. Initially, National Institute of Oceanography (NIO), Goa had done close grid bathymetric (study of underwater depth of lake or ocean floors) surveys in 1.5 million sq km and identified manganese nodules deposits, of which 75,000 sq km was given to India for exploration and development of sustainable mining technology. NIOT director says what the scientists are developing may not be the final technology. We can only develop an operational product, but it is for the industry to fine tune further to suit their bill, he added.Who regulates sea floor mining?To regulate sea floor mining, in 1994 the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea spawned the International Seabed Authority, an independent treaty organisation. It has jurisdiction over seabed outside exclusive economic zones that surround nations shorelinesWhat are polymetallic nodules?Manganese nodules are lumps of minerals ranging in size from a potato to a head of lettuce. They are composed mainly of manganese, iron, silicates and hydroxides. The greatest densities of nodules occur off the west coast of Mexico (in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone), in the Peru Basin, and the Indian OceanPotentialA rough estimate says that polymetallic nodules in the site allotted to India by International Seabed Authority (ISA) is about 380 Million Metric Tonne (MMT) with 0.55 MMT of Cobalt, 4.7 MMT of Nickel, 4.29 MMT of Copper and 92.59 MMT of Manganese"

Cuphead released only two weeks back, by an indie developer  but the quality of the game and its difficulty made it instantly rise to success. Heres a description of Cuphead (and also why it is so great).A little like Mario: In that it is a platformer with a character who wears red clothes. Most of the enemies even resemble those in Mario. But unlike Mario, there are no power-ups to incentivise you on the way up.1930s graphics and music: Imagine this cartoon youve watched as a kid  with its background score, and violent graphics. Cuphead is exactly that  theyve excelled in bringing the old-world charm with meticulously hand-drawn backgrounds, characters, movements and reactions! The jazzy music inspired by greats perfectly fuse with the storyline, and theyve got the extra grainy effect to make it a completely immersive retro.No childs play: The graphics and music may appeal to kids, but this the toughest platformer Ive seen around. The main run-and-gun missions are so ludicrously fast-paced, that it would take extreme concentration and strategising to get past it (or local co-op).The side missions are no cakewalk either  they are all boss-fights with some imaginative enemies, making your constant failures a little less disappointing. The game is so demotivating, that when it gave me a D+ on my first mission, I was thrilled.Quirky: The choice lyrics of the in-game music are made to let us know whats happening in the story. The characters around the environment are very weird, a flower throws its petals to wear Cuphead down, there are frogs with boxing gloves, and a bouncy ball who wants to kill you by jumping on your head all the time, amongst others. In that aspect, the game is reminiscent of Earthbound (an old Gameboy game).Its clear from Cupheads success that this is what gamers are looking for now! It is painful to lose all the time with this degree of difficulty, but the experience is worth the agony and the keyboard-breaks.Anusha GanapathiTwitter @quaffle_waffle(This economics graduate spends her leisure time preparing for the zombie apocalypse)"

A flat screen TV lay smashed on the ground nearby.Daesh (IS) used to broadcast their productions here for residents to watch -- footage of their battles, punishments, and anasheeds (Islamic hymns), said Shoresh al-Raqqawi, a 25-year-old Raqqa native and Syrian Democratic Forces fighter.The SDF ousted the last remaining IS fighters from Raqqa on Tuesday and while most of the forces had withdrawn, Raqqawi stayed behind as part of a small unit helping to clear rubble from streets and remove mines.The only sign of movement on Saturday in the heavily-damaged neighbourhoods around Raqqas famous clock tower was by bulldozers and a handful of white SDF pickup trucks.Raqqawi recounted how IS members working at the kiosk would stop young men with cell phones and erase the songs on their devices, replacing them with Islamic anasheeds.Daesh also used to bring young children here, give them sweets, potato chips, and biscuits, and make them watch the videos and listen to their songs, he added.- Behemoth administration -For years, IS has operated a sophisticated and multilingual media machine, complete with online magazines, radio broadcasts, and social media campaigns highlighting its military prowess and gruesome tactics.It often used minors in its propaganda output to ratchet up the shock factor, boasting of child soldiers that it called Cubs of the Caliphate.While IS media continue to operate from elsewhere following Raqqas fall, there has been a shift in tone, with the narrative nostalgically recalling the caliphate.On Saturday the names and logos of ISs many outlets could be seen emblazoned on a tattered, greyish banner near the media kiosk in Clock Tower Square: Al-Bayan Radio, Al-Hayat, Al-Furqan, and Al-Naba pamphlet.The group used the channels to publish grisly footage online of the punishment and even execution of alleged opponents, including Western hostages or those accused of being spies.But while most of the world could look away, Raqqawi and fellow SDF fighter Khalid Abu Walid were often forced to watch these practices live.They would whip and hit people so hard, said Abu Walid, 21, telling AFP how shops and streets in the roundabout would shutter and residents would gather around to watch whatever punishment was being doled out.All roundabouts in Raqa had media points like this, Abu Walid said.Torn IS papers can be found on almost every damaged Raqa street, providing clues to the behemoth administration that the jihadist organisation once ran there.One dusty card features a table recording the number of times its owner received zakat, or charitable offers, from others.Another document details the handover of the hisba -- or police office -- from one manager to another.On Saturday, a unit of foreign intelligence officers dressed in military gear and thick neon orange gloves could be seen inspecting a home near Raqas infamous Al-Naim roundabout.They are searching suspected IS headquarters, which they heard about from residents who escaped the city, an SDF fighter accompanying them said on condition of anonymity because he was not authorised to speak to the press.They are looking for bodies, identification cards, and other intelligence."

A total of 69 species of butterflies belonging to 54 genera and five families were recorded from the study area. Family Nymphalidae was the most dominant among the five families with 22 species, followed by Lycaenidae, comprising of 19 species, the paper titled A study of butterfly diversity in Singur says.Five of the species found in Singur are rare and to be protected under the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972. They include species like the Tree Flitter, Striped Albatross, Pea Blue, Common Indian Crow and Danaid Eggfly. The other interesting species found here include the Zebra Blue, the Common Banded Peacock and the Indian Skipper.The paper, authored by researchers Pritam K. Dey, Arajush Payra and Krishnendu Mondal, was published in June 2017 in the environmental journal e- planet . The study was carried out from March 2015 to November 2016, and most butterflies were observed between 8 a.m. and noon.Detailed study in futureThe presence of 69 species of butterflies in Singur points out that the butterfly diversity of the region is high. This is a preliminary study. More detailed studies in future can bring out more species. What is striking about Singur is that the area is not only rich in butterfly diversity but also in the diversity of frogs and birds, Mr. Dey said.Researchers found butterflies in the rice and vegetable fields of the area, as well as in bushes and shrubs along railway lines and National Highways.No forested landSingur has no forested land and the area is known for rice, potato and vegetable cultivation.Mr. Dey said that more intensive studies on different ecological parameters that can help access diversity of Singurs fauna are being planned.The presence of so many species of butterflies has provided a great deal of joy to the farmers who had waged a long battle against the Communist Party of India-Marxist (CPI-M) led West Bengal government against the acquisition of 997 acres of agricultural land for Tata Motors Nano car plant in Singur.While our struggle was aimed at the return of the land acquired for the proposed car plant, we are happy that it has helped the environment of Singur. There would have not so many butterflies had the car plant been operational, said Mahabdeb Das, a farmer who was at the forefront of the land acquisition struggle. He was pleasantly surprised to learn about the butterfly diversity of the region.On August 30, 2017, the Supreme Court quashed the Left Front governments acquisition of 997 acres of land for the car plant in Singur. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee returned the acquired land to farmers on September 14, 2016."

But Chennai generates more than 5000 tonnes of domestic waste every day. Where will all the waste go?People love complaining about the ever-growing, towering landfills but dont do anything to stop the mess from growing bigger.Almost three weeks in, the waste segregation campaign launched by Chennai Corporation to bring down solid waste has failed to gain traction. Thirty-five-year-old Raja*, a conservancy worker from Zone 10 thought his work would become easier after the corporation launched it on October 2. However, he is yet to sift through remains of last nights sambar rice (a biodegradable waste) to retrieve an empty packet of potato chips (non-biodegradable).Very few people have started segregating waste. Most leave the unsegregated waste outside and arent available so we cant even tell them to start segregating waste, Raja tells Express. Even when segregation is done, it isnt done carefully. Lakshmi R, a resident of Guindy, has been taking down only the kitchen dustbin when bio-degradable waste is being collected. However, she admits that empty oil, masala and noodles packets also go into the dustbin. I think about disposing of them separately, but its inconvenient, she says.It is very clear the two dustbin system hasnt debuted in the majority of the households in the city and the most recent initiative taken by the corporation might fizzle out. Zonal officers have also been observing a lack of enthusiasm. We have given residents a three-month grace period. After that, we will stop taking waste from households which dont comply, said a senior official from Solid Waste Management (SWM) department.Signs of hopeJoseph Jagans kuppathotti.com, a doorstep service which collects recyclables, has managed to attract around 40,000 households who regularly segregate their waste. Going to the local scrap shops is an inconvenience for this time-crunched society. So that is where we come in, he says. The families which subscribe to kuppathotti.com have a two dustbin system which helps them easily send the non-biodegradable waste to be recycled.These 40,000 families might seem like a drop in the ocean of the city which has a population of 7.1 million but it shows that the system is sustainable. Kurien Joseph, a professor at the Centre For Environmental Studies, Anna University, deems the two-dustbin system essential. Around 80 per cent of the waste generated can be either composted or recycled, he says. With public cooperation, waste which reaches landfills every day can be brought down to around 1000 tonnes.In Manali, where waste segregation was first introduced as a pilot project, the number of public dustbins came down from 267 to 68. This clearly shows the amount of waste generated will comprehensively come down.Giant dump yardsThe Kodungaiyur and Perungudi landfills have been in existence for almost three decades. With a combined total area of more than 400 acres, these landfills are also more than 20 feet tall.A senior official from the SWM department says that incinerators are imminent and that waste would have to be burned to reclaim the land. We have been planning to reduce the area occupied by the two landfills and a sacrifice has to be made, he said.The two landfills have both been known to generate leachate, which pollutes the groundwater of nearby areas. The Corporation also plans to launch waste to energy plants in both landfills. The energy generation might not be great but something is better than nothing, said the senior official.Need for penaltyThe Corporation says the domestic waste of those who dont comply after the grace period will not be collected. However, activists believe people shouldnt be let off so easily. MB Nirmal, the founder of EXNORA, an organization that began talking about waste segregation almost three decades ago, believes in spreading awareness through local welfare bodies. However a penalty should be levied on defaulters, he says. Segregating waste just makes the job of the conservancy worker easier  is a common misconception which stops people from taking the initiative.However, in addition to saving Raja the trouble of sifting through last nights sambar rice, it can also stop the mounds at Perungudi and Kodungaiyur from growing bigger."

When she did find a vendor with a relatively fresh stock, she was stunned by the price that the he asked for.Rath wasn't the only one to go through such an ordeal.Rumours of a cyclonic storm hitting the state not only emptied vegetable markets, but also saw prices soar. The most affected were the smaller shops. Tomato prices rose to Rs 50 to 60 a kg from Rs 40 earlier, while cabbage was selling at Rs 50 a kg compared to Rs 30 a kg last Monday. Prices of potato and onion also witnessed a sharp rise to Rs 15 and Rs 40 compared to Rs 10 and Rs 30 earlier.""I prefer fresh vegetables and buy them daily. However, it seems that my practice came heavy on my family and me. It has been raining for the past two days and the vegetable shops have nothing apart from cabbage and potato,"" said Rath, a homemaker.Old Town resident Sushil Hota faced a similar predicament. ""Such rumours of cyclones affecting daily markets, mainly in October, have become a yearly practice. I was aware of the situation, but failed to stock the essentials, so had to suffer for that. I had a tough time finding tomatoes at the market,"" said the schoolteacher.Small vegetable vendors in the city suffered the most because of the hoax as they failed to provide bare essentials even to daily customers.""I bought vegetables from the wholesale market, but the prices there witnessed a dramatic rise. I was forced to get the vegetables at much higher prices and sell them,"" said a vendor at CRP Square.On Wednesday, the regional meteorological centre here traced a deep depression over the Bay of Bengal and predicted heavy to very heavy rain for the city.""We rigorously monitored the system and never stated that it would intensify into any cyclonic storm. The system moved to neighbouring Jharkhand on Saturday and weakened gradually into a well-marked low pressure. Rainfall in the city will stop, and it will be the same for the state from Sunday,"" said Met director Sarat Chandra Sahu."

Customers have cut down on their purchase, said Venu Naik, a vegetable seller in Sainikpuri. The effect of rains in grower regions continue to affect prices.For instance, at the Bowenpally vegetable market, the arrival of hybrid variant of tomato had nearly doubled since the start of the month, accompanied with a three-time price increase. The variant was selling for a maximum price of Rs. 48 per kilo in the wholesale market. In retail markets however, the price was about Rs. 75 per kilo.The local variant of tomato is selling over Rs. 65 per kilo while the wholesale price stands at about Rs. 32 per kilo.Different pricesWhile potato and onion prices did not register a high, the cost of carrot continue to remain higher than its price last month.

Borewells too have dried up. Three months ago, he sowed seeds of korale (browntop millets). I have invested hardly Rs. 2,000 to grow korale. The yield is expected to be around 4 quintals worth about Rs. 12,000, he said.As it was the first time he chose to cultivate millets, he limited it to only one acre. The millet is rich in fibre and many growers keep a major portion of it for personal consumption. When this correspondent visited Mr. Jayannas farm on Friday, Korale Raghu of Sira taluk, who is known for cultivation of korale millet in Tumakuru district, was interacting with local farmers on the importance of millets. Korale cultivation is cost effective. With minimum investment, farmers can register maximum returns, he said. He grows korale millet on 17 acres of land.Earlier, G.V. Raghu, project director of Organisation for Resource Development and Environment Rejuvenation, said: Farmers in the hobli were cultivating potato and maize. Owing to long-time mono-crop cultivation, the yield had come down. Now, hundreds of farmers have grown ragi and they are happy with the yield. His NGO has been engaged in educating farmers on the importance of millet cultivation. Similarly, many have grown foxtail millet, little millet and green gram.V.G. Bhat, District Development Manager (NABARD). said: With the view of holistic development, the bank is encouraging cultivation of minor millets in parts of drought-prone taluks. The bank is happy with the response from the farmers. The bank has spent over Rs. 9 lakh for starting farmer-producer organisations, besides expenses on training, providing seeds and fertilizers."

Most families here have five to six children.Describing a regular day, Hemanti says she and her friends eat rice gruel in the morning, have rice with pulses and a seasonal vegetable for mid-day meal at school, and rice gruel again for dinner, sometimes supplemented with guda (a local shrub eaten raw). Only the mid-day meal sees variation, mostly in the form of papad and pickles on Saturdays, fruits three days a week, and eggs once a week.Shiv Nath Singh, a student of Class 3 in Hemantis school, has not gone to school. Mother Rukmani Devi remains silent when asked why. Putting plain rice before him for lunch, the 40-year-old says potatoes cost Rs 10 a kg. We cant get potatoes daily. We have pulses, but we only cook them sometimes.Ask what they consider a good meal, and she breaks into a laugh. Yahi sab na bhaat, daal, sabzi (Its all this only rice, pulses, vegetables). Once in a while, for a feast or a family function, villagers buy chicken or mutton.PDS doesnt provide more than 150-250 gm of rice per person per day on a ration card (see box). With their large sizes, families struggle to feed mouths. In the open market, rice of similar or lower grade costs at least Rs 22 a kg, while 2.5 litres of kerosene that they are also entitled to under PDS comes for Rs 75. Families cant afford these rates, and even buy their ration in bits and pieces as they never have enough money to buy in bulk.As per the October 2017 figures on the Jharkhand governments portal, 2,212 people in Karimati are under the PDS. Villagers claim almost every household has one members Aadhaar linked to their ration card.After Santoshis death, officials suspended the licence of the PDS dealer and Block Supply Officer for failing to ensure uninterrupted ration supply to her family, despite non-matching of Aadhaar. On October 21, Jharkhand Minister for Public Distribution System and Consumer Affairs Saryu Roy annulled an order by Chief Secretary Rajbala Verma to delete ration cards not linked with Aadhaar.***************I know families in Karimati who just scrape through, says Sudama Kachhap, a para-teacher heading the Upgraded Primary School. Santoshi used to be his student.Kachhap says Santoshis mother had promised to send her to middle school. But she didnt They are just so poor, he says.Even in this village of mainly daily wage labourers and farmers with small fields and poor yields, Kachhap adds, there was no family in as pitiable a state as Santoshis. Agar is gaon mein koi antim vyakti ya antim parivar hai, to yahi hai. Inse buri sthiti kisi ki nahin hai (If there is that last man or last family in this village, they are the one. Nobody is in as poor a condition as them), the 40-year-old says.(Express Photograph by Ratan Lal) (Express Photograph by Ratan Lal)As part of his duties, Kachchap also supervises the mid-day meal at the school.For the allocated Rs 4.13 per child per day, a mid-day meal is supposed to provide 450 gm of calories and 12 gm of proteins to children at the primary level. Children in middle school (Classes 6-8), are entitled to Rs 6.18 per day, for 700 calories and 20 gm proteins. Additionally, at Rs 4 per child per day, egg or seasonal fruit is given to the students on Monday, Wednesday and Friday.If the school remains closed for, say, four days, more than 90 per cent children would have eaten only rice those days, says Kachhap.The rations for the mid-day meal are sourced from the PDS block godown. The cost of the cook, appointed locally, comes out of the money allocated for children. Kachhap says the money is too less, going by the prices of eggs and vegetables that they have to buy from the open market, but they manage.There is another reason Kachchap is closely linked to Santoshis case. Till September last year, this para-teacher was also the Booth Level Officer (BLO) of Karimati, responsible for ensuring that villagers got themselves enrolled in Aadhaar, and got ration cards made. But, following an order that para-teachers should not be engaged in non-teaching works, his name was struck off.Read | Jharkhand starvation case: Girls family heckled out of village, now back homeHowever, since Kachchap knew the people, he continued to do the work. We have got complaints against him and are inquiring, says Jaldega Block Development Officer (BDO) Sanjay Kongari, referring to charges that Kachchap took money to get ration cards made. Kachchap denies the allegations.Hirawati Kumari, 17, claims he demanded Rs 1,600 from the family for a ration card. Her father Chhotu Ram died 18 months ago and her mother Keriyo Devi sustains the family working as a help in houses or through odd jobs in fields, earning around Rs 50 per day.Without a ration card, the family depends on the PDS Chhotu Rams elder brother gets. Giving a break-up of what it costs to buy from the market, Hirawati talks about last Wednesday when the family got 10 kg rice from the haat for Rs 22 per kg. Mother took an advance from a person she works for. She will now work four-five days without any reimbursement to pay back. She spent an additional Rs 30 to buy 3 kg of potatoes.Its a week later, and the family of four is left with only some rice, potatoes and guda. Hirawati says they have run out of sugar, tea and kerosene.She is lucky though, the 17-year-old amends. Thanks to her enrolment at Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya, 7 km away, where she studies in Class 8, she gets regular food. These schools were set up to ensure quality education for girls, predominantly from SC/ST, OBC and minority communities, in difficult areas, and admit children after a test. Hirawatis younger siblings, aged 10 and 4, depend on help from relatives.***************At Karimatis anganwadi centre, K D Chaudhary, the in-charge of the Jaldega Community Health Centre (CHC), is holding a health check-up camp. That is another thing Santoshis death has brought to Karimati. Chaudhary admits he does not remember the last time such a camp was held in the village, though a mobile medical van does the rounds every three-four months.Accompanying him is Dr Binod Oraon, the single man responsible for 174 primary schools and 132 anganwadi centres in Jaldega under the Rashtriya Bal Swasthya Karyakram. It is an initiative under the National Health Mission for early intervention for children from birth to 18 years to cover 4 Ds  Defects at birth, Deficiencies, Diseases, and Development delays.Ask when he last visited Karimati, and Dr Oraon tells you to do the math. There are 365 days in a year. You add 174 and 132. Plus, there are several other issues to be looked into. How many times can I come in a year?Chaudhary is despondent about what he has seen so far at the health camp. Alcoholism is rampant. Their livers are weak, eyes are damaged, many have lost their senses. Jaundice, Hepatitis, TB There is severe lack of awareness, he reels off.As for malaria, the official cause of Santoshis death, Chaudhary says it is common, though not endemic. In fact, no malaria deaths have been reported from here in the last few years.***************Its easy to slip out of the net, like Santoshi and her family did. BDO Kongari claims it was technicalities that led to their name being taken off PDS list.Koylis husband Tatya, who also went by the name Tetwa, had a ration card. A few years ago, the government policy was changed when it was felt that ration cards should be in the name of women heads of the family, as they were more sincere. Ideally, in Koylis case, Tatyas name should have been replaced by Koylis. But, somehow, it got transferred to the name of Balmati Devi, Tatyas mother. The problem is that Balmati died 10 years ago, he says.In 2016, the Point-of-Sale (PoS) machine system was introduced, for biometric identification through Aadhaar of ration card holders. It required the Aadhaar number of at least one member of the family to be linked to their ration card. Both Koyli and Gudiya had Aadhaar since 2013. But nobody from the family got their Aadhaar linked to the ration card, as a result of which Balmatis name finally got deleted, says Kongari.Right to Food Campaign activist Tara Mani Sahu, who had raised the issue of Koylis ration card when Santoshi was alive, says, I tried to raise the matter at the district level, but nothing happened. We also get constant complaints about beneficiaries getting less than entitled ration. Dealers cut 1-2 kg, giving one or the other reason.There are also cases of members of families left out of ration cards. In the case of Lal Card holders (see box), the amount of ration a family gets will be less, points out Sahu.Kongari, however, maintains that the process of Aadhaar seeding with schemes has been smooth, and that nearly 100 per cent of the work is done in his block. New people will be added, but for all the programmes using direct benefit transfer (DBT, cash being transferred into accounts), Aadhaar seeding is almost complete, he says.But some villagers complain about MNREGA payments being irregular. Dupatti Devi worked under MNREGA a year ago and should have got over Rs 3,500. But she has got just Rs 800, she claims. Her husband Bideshi Baraik, she says, is a pagla  a euphemism for a chronic alcoholic in these parts. With four children to support, Dupatti is desperate. Only I know how I run my house, she says.District Supply Officer Nanki Ram admits there are problems. But we are trying to put in place a system where beneficiaries get payment without middlemen. Some names may have got left out. We are launching campaigns to get them enlisted, he says.PDS minister Saryu Roy says, What I mentioned in the order (annulling the order of the Chief Secretary), the same thing has now been said in a circular of the Government of India. It is very clear-cut (that non-linking of Aadhaar should not be used to deny benefits).Further, Roy says, he has asked the department to provide him month-wise and reason-wise break-up of the 11.3 lakh ration cards deleted after the PoS system was introduced. In the same period, the department has added nine lakh beneficiaries. I want to be sure that any deserving candidate has not got his name struck off, he says.***************Among the villagers, Santoshi or Koyli find no sympathy, with the people backing officials assertion that she died of malaria. Aaj ka jug mein koi bhookh se mare hao (Does anybody die of hunger in this day and age)? questions a woman.With Tatya unable to work, Koyli and Gudiya support the family through odd jobs at Lachragarh, or collect wood from the jungle and sell it at Rs 30-Rs 40 per bundle. The day-long task of picking up the twigs, bundling and selling them fetches only a little more. Labourer jobs, for around Rs 200 a day, are few and far between.None of the villagers was around to witness Santoshis slow descent to death, Gudiya recalls. Koyli had not been going to work. There was no rice for 15 days and, in the last eight days, the family went without a meal. Let alone rice, there was no salt, sugar, kerosene, not even a match-stick.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

The new interlocutor will be expected to find some headway towards finalising a solution before the Supreme Court hears the case again.The issue has come to the centre stage of controversy after the Supreme Court's indication that it may be dealt with by a five-judge constitution bench, to ascertain that, if Article 35A relating to special rights and privileges of the citizens of the Jammu and Kashmir is ultra vires of the Constitution or if there is any procedural lapse.The issue has triggered controversy after a plea was filed by Charu Wali Khanna, a lawyer and former member of the National Commission for Women, challenging Article 35A of the Constitution and Section 6 of the Jammu and Kashmir Constitution which deal with the ""permanent residents"" of the state.The plea has challenged certain provisions of the Constitution which deny property right to a woman who marries a person from outside the state.The provision, which makes such women from the state to lose rights over property, also applies to her son.The matter is a hot political potato in Jammu and Kashmir with the mainstream regional political parties, like ruling Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), main opposition National Conference, and separatist leadership clearly warning that any change in status quo over Article 35A invite serious repercussions.While on the other hand, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government at the Centre and as a coalition partner in Jammu and Kashmir, has been historically against any special provisions to Jammu and Kashmir."

His officials asserted the constraints could be easily ironed out given that the same alliance was in power at the Centre and in the state.""The only thing needed is political will for greater public good,"" a senior AAI official said on condition of anonymity. ""If initiatives are taken, the common people will also understand the situation and the solutions.""Patna airport is suffering from an acute space crunch that is hindering its expansion. The present length of the runway in Patna is just 7,000ft; a minimum 9,500 feet is necessary for safe landing by bigger aircraft. Also, of the existing runway, only 6,409 feet is available during landing and take-off because of location constraints, including structures like the state secretariat's clock tower, the Delhi-Howrah railway line on the southern side and a busy Peer Ali Path (Airport Road) to the north.Because of the short length only seasoned pilots who have previously landed and taken off from Patna are allowed here, to reduce chances of any mishap. An Alliance Air jet that crashed in Patna in July 2000 killed over 50 people.""Land is available close to the airport,"" an AAI official said. ""Hundreds of acres of land is locked in huge campuses belonging to the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), Research Complex for Eastern Region and Central Potato Research and Central Potato Research Institute. Why can't these be shifted? Patna needs a good airport.""Another AAI official said that with the metro rail slated to come to Patna and good quality tunnelling machines available, the railway line on the southern side could be taken underground, freeing the land for airport expansion.""And why not relocate the secretariat clock tower, which lies in the aircraft approach funnel? It is just a vestige of the British era, when very few people had wristwatches. With latest techniques, it could be easily removed elsewhere or its height lessened,"" an AAI official said.The officials added that the Peer Ali Path could be closed and given to the airport so that it could expand a bit in that direction too, solving all the issues related to parking and terminal building.""If we get the identified land, we'll be able to increase the runway length to 12,000 feet. The cost of relocating other government institutions will still be much less than building a new airport for Patna,"" an official said.Meanwhile, the central and the state government are looking towards the Bihta air force base and issues related to construction of a terminal building for public use are being sorted out."

Farmland, the brand under which the firm will market fresh fruits and vegetables, has been initially introduced in New Delhi.For starters, four variants of potatoes have been launched under the brand. However, according to the firm, the brand will begin diversifying into other fruits and vegetables from the next quarter.ITC will also begin introducing the brand in other metro locations. The four introductory products are naturally low sugar potatoes, potatoes with natural antioxidants, baby potatoes for special dishes and French fry potatoes. The next product likely to be launched under the Farmland brand is branded apples.We are introducing potatoes in Delhi. It will be available in seven metros in the next 12 months, said S Sivakumar, group head - agri business and IT at ITC, adding that Farmland potatoes will be available in about 1,000 stores in Delhi over the next 2-3 months. The company will not rely only on large organised retailers and e-commerce but also focus on distributing Farmland products through neighbourhood stores.The total market for table potatoes in India in terms of consumer spend is valued at Rs 70,000 crore with consumption in metros and mini-metros alone close to Rs 5,000 crore, which is what ITCs Farmland potatoes range will address in the first phase, ITC said. Farmland products will be sold at 10-15 per cent premium over local prices.FMCG major Ruchi Soya (RSIL) has announced that it will offload a majority stake to global private equity firm Devonshire Capital.ITC plans to work with the Indian Council for Agricultural Research - Central Potato Research Institute to build the buzz of nutritional benefits of potatoes and dispel some of the myths around it, the company said in a statement. It claims that the value-added potatoes that they are launching are naturally low in fat and sugar with fat content below 0.2% and sugar level below 2% respectively"
5a52f7be9855b770e037c29f,Value destruction: UP farmers gift potatoes to cold stores,http://indianexpress.com/article/india/value-destruction-uttar-pradesh-farmers-gift-potatoes-to-cold-stores-4918275/,2017-11-02,"Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran) Farm labourers planting potatoes at a field near Hathras in Uttar Pradesh. (Express Photo: Harish Damodaran)Pradeep Chaudhary alias Guddu has seen the potato trade going through periods of mandi (slack). But never has this 47-year-old witnessed bekadri (value destruction)  the term he uses to describe the situation in the last one year, since the Narendra Modi governments decision to demonetise all Rs 500 and 1,000 denomination currency notes.For about a month before notebandi happened on November 8, potato was selling at Rs 500-700 per bag of 50 kg (or Rs 10-14/kg). By the month-end, prices had crashed to Rs 300-350 and further to Rs 175-225 during February-March, when the new crop was being harvested. And strangely, they havent recovered from those levels, even as the season is over and planting of the next crop is almost complete, says Guddu, owner of Om Sheet Grah Pvt Ltd, a cold storage unit at Sadabad town in Uttar Pradeshs Hathras districtFarmers in these parts  the stretch from Aligarh, Hathras, Mathura, Agra, Firozabad, Etawah, Mainpuri, Kannauj and Farrukhabad in southwest UP accounts for roughly a fifth of Indias total potato production  plant the tuber during mid-October and early November. Only 15-20 per cent of this crop is sold at the time of its harvesting towards February-March. Farmers keep the remaining 80-85 per cent in cold stores  where the potatoes are maintained at 4-5 degrees Celsius  and make staggered sales through the summer and monsoon months.This time round, probably 99 per cent of the potatoes were put into cold storage, given the low prices and lack of buyers during harvest time. Farmers thought they would realise better rates later in the season, notes Guddu. But it hasnt worked that way. Currently, the normal large (mota) potatoes are being sold from cold stores at Rs 200-225 per bag (Rs 4-4.5/kg). The medium gulla tubers are fetching just Rs 90-100 a bag (Rs 1.80-2/kg), while being even lower, at Rs 50-60 a bag (Rs 1/kg), for small kirri potatoes.But the farmer isnt the only loser. Guddus cold store can stock up to three lakh bags of potatoes. 90 per cent of this would normally have been disposed of by end-October, with the air-conditioning, too, shut with the winter arriving in the second half of November. This would allow for maintenance over the next two months and enable storing of the new crop from February.The current year, though, has been different. On October 31  when the season technically ends and cold stores cannot run without obtaining renewal licences from the state horticulture department  Guddus unit was saddled with unsold stocks of 80,000-odd bags. Most cold stores have anywhere between 25 to 35 per cent of last seasons potatoes that farmers have kept and are not re-claiming, adds Guddu.Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran) Old potatoes being dumped outside a cold store unit at Sadabad in Uttar Pradesh. (Express photo: Harish Damodaran)The reason for farmers not taking back their stored potatoes is simple. Cold stores charge around Rs 110 for every bag, whether it is kept for one month or eight months. Besides, they finance farmers to cover their cost of harvesting, grading and bagging (Rs 45-50), loading (Rs 3) and transport from the field to the store (Rs 20). In many cases, the credit  usually at 1.5 per cent interest per month  extends even to the bardana or jute bags costing Rs 22-23 each.If the borrowed money with interest is also included, we have to pay Rs 200 or more on every bag to the store owner. If the price we are getting does not cover even that, why take back the bag at all? asks Puran Singh. This 60-bigha (12-acre) farmer from Tambka village in Mathura districts Mahavan tehsil still has 700 out of his 2,000 bags harvested during March lying at Susheela Cold Storage in Agra. Even on the remaining 1,300 bags, the money realised from sales, at Rs 125 to Rs 225/bag, has gone entirely to pay the store owner, leaving him with nothing.The cold stores will eventually recover their Rs 110 charge and also much of what they have lent to farmers with interest. For the farmer, a price of Rs 200 per bag (Rs 4/kg) may pay his liabilities to the cold store, but will not even cover cultivation costs, contends Chaudhary Pushpendra Singh, president of Kisan Shakti Sangh, a farmer advocacy organisation.He reckons the total cost of cultivating potatoes at over Rs 10,000 a bigha, which, at an average 40 bags/bigha yield, translates into Rs 5 per kg. If to this, another Rs 4 is added towards harvesting, bagging, transport and cold storage costs, the farmer will just about start making money at a price of Rs 9/kg. The breakeven goes up further by Rs 2/kg if land is leased at the existing rates of Rs 4,000 per bigha. For potato cultivation to be profitable, the farmer has to get about Rs 15/kg. Right now, he cannot afford to even buy new seed potatoes. Most farmers this season have used their last years stored crop as seed, points out Singh.But why are prices continuing to rule low even now, when cash has supposedly returned with the Reserve Bank of India printing new notes? This is a business that always operated on cash. While the notes may be back, you are still not allowed to make daily withdrawals or deposits of more than Rs two lakh. These restrictions, plus the fear of being tracked by the income tax department, have made traders wary of buying and stocking up produce, explains Guddu.The effects of it are being felt in places such as Hathras. This district alone has about 150 operational cold stores, handling an average of two lakh bags each. At last years average realisation of Rs 400 per bag (Rs 8/kg) for all varieties  including gulla and kirri  the value of this entire produce would have been Rs 1,200 crore. But at Rs 150 per bag (Rs 3/kg), the same 3 crore bags from a single district would be worth Rs 450 crore.If this calculation is extended to other potato-belt districts, you can imagine how much value destruction has taken place in the last one year. And the loser is not just the farmer, but also those who sell and provide services to him, observes Pushpendra Singh.For all the latest India News, download Indian Express App"

Britain has been increasingly grappling with its pending departure from the EU, and for Nim's, the impact of Brexit is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple. NYTBritain is increasingly grappling with the bewildering economic consequences of its pending departure from the European Union. For one company, Nim's Fruit Crisps, in Sittingbourne, England, the effect is measured in the soaring cost of pineapple.Nim's dries fruits into snacks served up like potato chips, operating out of a former metal shop in this industrial enclave east of London. One of its best-selling varieties uses pineapple from Costa Rica that is shipped in by an Amsterdam-based trading company.The pineapple is priced in euros. Since Britain's decision to leave the European Union - widely known as Brexit - the British pound has surrendered nearly 14 percent of its value against the euro on fears that trade will be disrupted.Confronting higher prices for pineapple, the company's founder, Nimisha Raja, recently brought in a machine to replace three workers who used to peel fruit by hand. ""I had to cut costs somewhere,"" she said.She could be speaking for all of Britain.In the 16 months since the referendum that set Brexit in motion, the British economy has weakened in the face of a confounding array of uncertainties. Thrift is the order of the day, along with worries about multinational companies' paring their investments in Britain.Last week, the picture appeared to brighten, as official data showed the economy had expanded a tad more than expected between July and September. The growth of 0.4 percent for the quarter, which bested expectations of 0.3 percent, reinforced the market's assumptions that the Bank of England will lift rates when it convenes on Thursday, using a presumably stronger economy as the impetus.But some economists fear such a move is premature given Britain's fragile state. Many focused on plunging retail and car sales as a harbinger of trouble.The drop in the pound has lifted prices on goods ranging from Italian olive oil to Chinese-made electronics. The rate of inflation reached 3 percent in September, the fastest pace in five years. Consumer spending has dipped during the past year while consumer credit is rising - a combination that often ends badly.The Brexit referendum prompted negotiations through which Britain and a jilted Europe are supposed to hash out their future dealings. But the talks have proved acrimonious and largely futile. This has heightened concerns that a two-year deadline on negotiations could pass without a deal, subjecting companies that trade across the English Channel with unsettling ambiguities about future rules. The Bank of England has been warning banks to prepare for that very eventuality as one possible outcome.With the boundaries of commerce unclear, some companies are reassessing the appeal of centering operations in Britain, the former seat of a global empire that increasingly looks like an island nation.""Clearly, growth has slowed quite sharply over the last several months,"" said Peter Dixon, a global financial economist at Commerzbank AG in London. ""There is a sense that companies have been postponing investment.""Britain now stands as one of the world's weakest major economies, even as Europe, Asia and North America enjoy relatively robust growth. During the first nine months of the year, the British economy expanded at an annualized rate of only 1.3 percent.Absent a deal, global banks are confronting the prospect that they could no longer use their London office to serve customers across the Continent. Many have been scouting spaces in financial centers that are firmly within EU territory.Citigroup has outlined plans to set up a trading operation in Frankfurt, while applying for a backup license in France. Goldman Sachs recently leased expanded office space in Frankfurt.In the West Midlands, an industrial reach of England that includes Birmingham, foreign direct investment dipped slightly in the year after the Brexit vote, according to a recent assessment from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce.The chamber pinned the blame on ""uncertainty caused by the outcome of the EU referendum,"" which was ""delaying investment decisions, a trend echoed in other areas of the U.K.""Chamber representatives have been turning their attention beyond the EU in pursuit of fresh investment. A delegation recently returned from Turkey. In planning future visits, the chamber is especially focused on cultivating business with members of the British Commonwealth.""It's a rewinding of history, overtly looking for trade with Commonwealth countries, rather than with Europe,"" said John Lamb, a chamber spokesman. ""We really are starting to look at markets in the post-Brexit world.""Time itself has become a threat. As negotiations yield headlines about sniping within Britain's governing Conservative party, each week that passes absent clarity amplifies pressure on companies to shift people and operations to Europe.""We can't see how investment particularly, but also consumption, will not be affected,"" said Kjersti Haugland, chief economist at DNB Markets, an investment bank in Norway. ""How can you go ahead with big investments when you don't know what framework will result?""For Nim's Fruit Crisps, the variables of Brexit have advanced British self-sufficiency.Previously reliant on a supplier in Belgium for most of its fruits and vegetables, the company has in recent months found domestic suppliers for every needed variety except pineapple, limiting its exposure to the vagaries of exchange rates. Today, Nim's buys apples, parsnips, cucumbers and a range of other crops from British farmers.The fall in the pound has also made Nim's products cheaper outside Britain, bolstering its exports, which now make up more than half of total sales. Nim's snacks are sold in Germany, France, Italy, India, Israel and - soon - Saudi Arabia.""What I've learned is that Europe isn't the only market for us,"" said Raja, whose Nim's business card identifies her as TheBoss.Yet as she seeks to complete a deal putting her crisps on the shelves of a major British supermarket chain, Raja worries that the needed volumes will exceed the capacities of Britain.""I suddenly have to find 100 tons of apples,"" she said.She is scoping out farms in Poland, even as she worries about the value of British money in a world shaped by Brexit.""I have to keep my margins tight,"" she said."

Photo: Pradeep Gaur/MintNew Delhi: When Prime Minister Narendra Modi voided almost all of Indias cash last year, Kuldeep Mishras savings were turned into worthless paper. The vegetable wholesaler was forced to spend hours in bank queues and his business suffered for a month.Still, he voted for Modi in state elections soon after and plans to do so again in a national poll due 2019.Wealthy people had black money and it all came out, Mishra said in a market in Sahibabad in Uttar Pradesh, one of Indias poorest states, using the local term for cash stashed away to avoid taxes. We have never had a better prime minister than Modi.Mishra, 49, says sales rebounded in a month, though official data show Indias expansion slowed to a three-year low in April-June, more than six months since the shock cash ban. Growth has also been affected by the disruptive roll out of a new sales tax, yet voters like Mishra are expected to vault Modi to power in his home state of Gujarat next month.Theres no single reason for Modis enduring popularity. While critics point to the Hindu nationalist agenda of his Bharatiya Janata Party as key to its electoral success, others say demonetisation fortified Modis reputation as an authoritative leader and undermined the oppositions attempt to paint him as a suit-boot government that favours the business elite over the poor by moving to make it easier to buy farmers land and hire and fire factory workers.While many accept that the move has dampened consumption, they believe it has dampened conspicuous consumption that was fuelled by black money and tax evasion, said Reshmi Khurana, Singapore-based South Asia head for Kroll Inc., a risk management firm that advises foreign investors. It did boost his image in the sense that hes being seen as decisive and willing to take bold action, even if it ruffles the feathers of entrenched stakeholders.The view is echoed by Vinod Kumar Gupta, a businessman in Uttar Pradeshs Ghaziabad district, who said Modi has the courage to take bold decisions. He has become a stronger leader, hes making India stronger, said Gupta, 73. His commitment to the nation is not doubted.Key testGujarat will be a key test, where voters will be called on to weigh Modis personal popularity against his policies, which have disrupted Indias vast informal economy that mainly deals in cash and creates the largest number of jobs. While India lacks adequate employment data, surveys suggest that Modis far from creating the 10 million jobs a year needed to keep up with his young and rapidly expanding workforce.The election in Gujarat, held on 9 and 18 December will follow the 9 December vote in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh, which Modi is expected to wrest from the main opposition Congress party. The positive opinion polls are partly flattered by the fact that the Congress party and its leader Rahul Gandhi have failed to offer a compelling alternative.Rahul Gandhi is not very strong, he doesnt speak well and he lacks knowledge, said Shamshad Mohammed, a potato seller who said demonetisation pummeled the economy without stopping corruption.Though viewed as a landmark anti-graft move by the masses, many businesses viewed demonetization as an ineffective way to tackle endemic corruption, said Krolls Khurana. Modis also facing stinging criticism from within his own party, with a former BJP finance minister saying the government has made a mess of the economy.Aware of this change in mood, Modi has been countering with emotional and combative speeches, defending demonetization and himself as a champion of the poor. In a series of speeches last month, he said the Congress party tried to stall Gujarats growth during the years that he headed the state, from 2001 to 2014.He packaged demonetisation as a pro-poor and anti-rich move by projecting that he was going to take away black money from the rich and distribute it to the poor, said Arati Jerath, a New Delhi-based author and political analyst. As economic distress set in, his stature has diminished.She reckons Modi is benefiting from a lack of credible data to assess the full impact of demonetisation on the informal economy and the Gujarat elections will reveal sentiment on the ground.Milan Vaishnav, director of the South Asia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that any upside to demonetization will come only in the long-term, through greater digitization of the economy, shrinking of the informal sector, and a wider tax base.Back in Uttar Pradesh, several old men sitting in the shade near tethered water buffaloes said demonetisations harmful impact was over. Discussing the previous evenings news that India had moved up the World Banks ease of doing business ranking, they said they would continue voting for the BJP.Its not that all of Modis policies are good, said Mahendra Singh, 76, a retired factory worker. But well give him another chance in 2019. Bloomberg"

All my concentration was only on clicking the photograph.The photograph taken on State Highway 9 in Jhargram district of West Bengal was awarded the Sanctuary Wildlife Photography Award 2017, felicitated by a Mumbai-based wildlife photography magazine Sanctuary Asia on Sunday.Titled 'Hell is Here', Sanctuary Asia, on its Facebook page, described the incident with a caption: ""In West Bengal, this sort of humiliation of pachyderms is routine, as it is in the other elephant-range states of Assam, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tamil Nadu and more. India is the world's stronghold for the Asian elephant and boasts over 70 per cent of the global population of the species. But this achievement rings hollow as vital elephant habitats and routes continue to be ravaged, and human-elephant conflict escalates to a fatal degree. ""The award is an attempt to raise awareness about the treatment of pachyderms in the country, Sanctuary Asia editor Anirudh Nair told the New Indian Express. ""By awarding the photograph, we wanted to raise awareness on the practice of violence against elephants in West Bengal and in other parts of the country, he added.Human-elephant conflict is rife along the elephant corridor in Bankura and Jhargram districts of the state. While villagers complain that 40-50 strong herds of elephants destroy their ripe crops and smash their homes, their retaliation has traditionally been violent.Crackers are bursted and fires raged to ward off the herds but due to this practice, the elephants get more enraged and cause even more damage to the public.Hazra said, The calf may not have been intentionally set on fire by the villagers living in the vicinity of the elephant corridor that stretches from southwestern West Bengal up to Saranda forest in Jharkhand, but bursting crackers and throwing fireballs on elephant herds has been a common practice in this part of West Bengal.In a separates comment to the Sanctuary Asia Facebook post, Mainaz Mazumdar, from Baroja village of Bankura district in West Bengal said, Our village is frequently invaded by such wild and unruly animals that come all the way from dalma range of forests. The fault, of course, lies with us. Because of heavy habitat destructions (in this case the forest) the elephants are coming down onto the settlements. This has been a great problem over the years.When the horde of elephants comes near to a village the respective forest office hires people to drive them back to the Jungle. These people are locally known as Hulia Party. They use strong and loud firecrackers, big and bright lights, harpoons, tin drums to make noises to scare them off, torches and bow and arrow. There is no controversy that these poor creatures suffered greatly at our hands. But it is also true that they wrecked havoc on these poor peasants that are entirely dependent on agriculture. They wasted paddy fields, potato fields, fields of wheat and so on. Many farmers committed suicide because of these damages. But worse still, they killed innocent people too.The silver lining amongst all of this gloom is that now the forest department has reclaimed their senses and built deep trenches along the perimeter of the jungle fenced with electrical wire. That electrified fence won't kill them but it's strong enough to repel them. We left much of the worse behind us, Mazumdar added.a"

I would need capital for that and hence want to sell my paddy crop soon. As there is not much support from the state government on this front I might end up selling the paddy at whatever price would be offered in the local market,"" he told The Telegraph while sharing his expectations from the third agricultural roadmap of Bihar that would be released by President Ram Nath Kovind on Thursday.He wants the government to take care of the marketing aspect of agriculture produce on a priority basis for the welfare of the farmers.Nitish Kumar, another farmer from the same district who had set a world record in potato production in 2012 by achieving a productivity level of 72.9 tonnes of potato per hectare, too echoed Sumant and said: ""Marketing of produce is the biggest challenge facing Bihar farmers. The roadmap should take care of this aspect.""Nitish also underlined the need of timely delivery of the benefits that are part of the roadmap.Sanjiv Kumar, a progressive farmer from Hajipur in Vaishali district, had a mixed opinion about the two agricultural roadmaps that have been implemented so far.He said: ""While a lot of pro-farmer works were done in the first roadmap (2008-12) the second one (2012-17) got entangled in red tape. One hopes that the latest roadmap would keep farmers in the centre and would minimise bureaucratic interference in the delivery of the benefits.""Rajkumari Devi of Anandpur village in Muzaffarpur district too appears to be a disappointed soul.""The two roadmaps promised a lot to the farmers but the percolation of benefits on the ground has not been very effective. Farmers do get fertilisers, seeds etc on time and several of them also started mechanised farming due to the support announced by the state government, but procuring the subsidy for these items really becomes a tough ask for them,"" said Rajkumari, who is popularly called Kisan Chachi by the locals in the north Bihar district for helping them in doing scientific farming.Amid these voices of concern, there is a silver lining as well for the state government - evident from the assertion of Devendra Yadav of Basopatti in Madhubani district.""Farmers have gained a lot after implementation of the two agricultural roadmaps. My paddy crop could survive the flood fury this year as I had followed the advice of agriculture department officials who extend their services on a regular basis,"" he said.Confronted with the voices from the ground, agriculture minister Prem Kumar said: ""Steps are being taken for timely procurement of crops in a very transparent manner. Farmers facing any problems on this issue should approach us and their problem would be solved at any cost.""Reacting to the farmers' refrain over non-delivery of extension services, the minister said special steps were being taken to ensure presence of field officials in villages and soon rosters would be made for this purpose.The agriculture minister is also planning to hold an interactive session with farmers after the release of the roadmap and this would be used for collecting feedback from the stakeholders for effective implementation of the works that constitute the roadmap."

Pictures by Sudeshna BanerjeeShe came to CK Block, where her in-laws live as a joint family, as a new bride 24 years ago. Her brother-in-laws son Shashank, then just three years old, was devoted to her, because, among other reasons, Chachi was a fabulous cook.My school friends wanted to come home just for the food she would rustle up. She knew Marwari food and she would also make ravioli and risotto. She would cook Dum Pukht Biryani actually in a pot, says Shashank Agarwal of his aunt and now business partner Sarika Agarwal.The aunt-nephew duo started with a small health food joint as a franchisee for a year opposite Bengal Tennis Academy. But that did not work. People wanted a fulfiling meal. So they have now opened Studio Cafe at the same spot. Opening a cafe was always my dream. I told Shashank: Just give me a carpenter and a painter, I will do the rest. I purchased everything for the decor.Studio Cafe is a combination of a studio on the first floor and a cafe downstairs. The first floor is let out for parties for which the catering is done by the cafe. In the weekends, we host workshops, says Sarika.On the ground floor, the cafe is a 45-seater, part of which is designed to be let out separately. We have planned our menu like a delis, incorporating dishes from Continental, Thai and Chinese cuisine, says Shashank.A highlight of the food served is the option of avoiding flour in the list of ingredients used. Even our pizzas and pastas are wheat-based though we can make normal versions too in case a guest insists on it. Pizzas are all thin-crust.Similarly, their risottos are made with barley, oats or quinoa, instead of rice. Our Panini sandwiches are wheat-based too.In some dishes, she has given a Marwari touch. Our paneer fritters are wrapped with papad, Sarika smiles.Her teenaged son Krish loves parking himself at the joint when he is hungry after tennis lessons. He loves the mojitos, smoothies and hot chocolate that they make here, Sarika smiles. We also keep protein shakes for gym-goers and kids favourites like potato wedges.Why avoid wheat: Some experts believe that giving up not just gluten, but wheat altogether, could lead to weight loss and health benefits. Aside from some extra fiber, eating two slices of whole wheat bread is really little different, and often worse, than drinking a can of sugar-sweetened soda or eating a sugary candy bar, cardiologist William Davis writes in Wheat Belly.Dish of our pick: Chicken Malay Laksa, a thick gravy dish with a touch of lemongrass that is proof of its Far East origin. It has babycorn, broccoli, beans, zucchini and chicken underneath a forest of crisp rice noodles placed in a heap on top.Spot that caught our eye: A cosy alcove for two where a pair of lovers can snuggle. Not for plus-size individuals though."

Officials say the calendar has changed. Earlier, the yearly report card used to be presented in November because Nitish Kumar's government took oath in November (even the Grand Alliance government). ""Now it will be in July because the NDA II government took oath in July after the collapse of the Grand Alliance government,"" said an official wondering if Nitish wants to disown his tenure in the Grand Alliance government. Nitish started the tradition of releasing an annual report card first in 2006 when he completed a year in power with the BJP. But last year the function to release a report card was cancelled in view of a train accident in Uttar Pradesh.Missing in action RJD chief Lalu Prasad talked about huge dharnas across the state against demonetisation on November 8. But on November 8, both Lalu and his son Tejashwi remained at home, as RJD and Congress leaders protested at Gandhi Maidan. ""The two biggest faces in the RJD abstained from their own party's function. Laluji might have received information that the size of crowds was not what he had expected. That's why he went off to Hajipur,"" said a BJP leader gleefully. RJD leaders in Patna are fuming. ""State party president Ram Chandra Purbey does not have the appeal to draw crowds like Lalu and Tejashwi can,"" said a senior RJD leader, insisting that the two should have participated in the event.The astrologer case After astrologer Shankar Charan Tripathi's appointment as national spokesperson of the RJD, some newspapers highlighted his ""murky"" past, giving JDU leaders a chance to attack the RJD. The development frustrated RJD leaders one of who even cribbed before a friend in the BJP how Lalu was making appointments in the party without knowing the person's background. The BJP leader told him that the same astrologer had been lobbying to enter the BJP for the past eight months but was dropped like a hot potato when the party got to know of his background. An old-timer recalled how Lalu had once called a press meet to say central agency officials were harassing RJD workers from Punjab. ""But those workers later turned out to be narcotic smugglers,"" the RJD leader said.Isolated After releasing Tejashwi Yadav's photograph with a girl, JDU spokesperson Sanjay Singh finds himself isolated, even within his own party. While BJP leader C.P. Thakur and Madhepura MP Pappu Yadav disapproved of the act, senior JDU minister Shrawan Kumar expressed his ignorance about it. ""Shrawan is very close to chief minister Nitish Kumar and there is an attempt by the JDU to show as if Nitish was ignorant of what his spokesperson did,"" said an RJD leader."

Most of the big cities has BJP mayors, but even the garbage has not been removed in the past 10 to 15 years, the SP leader said.Except for picking up brooms (as part of the Swachch Bharat Mission) I dont think the BJP has any direction, he said.Stressing that his government had completed the Agra- Lucknow Expressway in 23 months, Mr. Yadav said that it was now the responsibility of the present dispensation to construct the Purvanchal Expressway.This is the responsibility of the government. They will get funds from the Centre. Niti Aayog is also cooperating with them. They (BJP) were saying that they will connect Varanasi and Ayodhya, but they should at least start the work, he said.Mr. Yadav said that if expressways and mandis (wholesale markets) are made, the State will develop and farmers will get good rates for their produce.If dairies such as Parag and Amul come up, it will improve the rural economy. If laptops are distributed it will take the country ahead on the path of Digital India, he said.Improving relationsTo a question on the possibility of entering into an electoral alliance with the BSP, the SP president said, We are trying to workout an alliance... our relations are not bad with anyone... we are in the forefront to improve relations.His remarks came after BSP supremo Mayawati on Friday said her party favoured joining hands with secular fronts in the Lok Sabha and State polls, only if it gets a respectable number of seats to contest.On the law and order situation, the former Chief Minister said that the people of the State know that the BJP government has failed on this front."

While the showers are responsible for pulling down prices of a handful of vegetables , it has adversely affected the stocks of others, thereby burning a hole in consumers' pockets.Over the last few days, prices of cabbage and cauliflower have dropped sharply, thanks the low-pressure triggered rain. Wholesalers have resorted to distress sale to clear the cabbage-cauliflower stock damaged by the rain.But buyers are not so lucky when it comes to other vegetables. Prices of some staple vegetables have remained consistently at or above Rs 50/kg. This is bit unusual if you look at previous years. By this time last year, vegetable prices nosedived sharply.According to sources, rain has delayed harvesting of winter vegetables in Bengal, forcing the state to depend on other states. Consumers, subsequently, are bearing the price burden. ""Most of the winter vegetables we are now getting is coming from outside. Peyajkoli (Scallion), which is coming from Karimpur in Bangladesh , remains pricey. Tomato from Purulia has just started arriving. So, tomato price is likely to crash in two-three days,"" said Kamal Dey, Koley Market vendors association president and Bengal government's market task force member.But the showers have spelt doom for potato. After last year's bumper crop, this year was predicted to be a lean year. But the untimely rain can make it far worse. ""So, potato prices might shoot up unusually,"" said Dey.But what is most striking is the gap between wholesale and retail prices. ""Around 20% is the reasonable gap between wholesale and retail prices, if you take into account transportation cost, waste and local market levy by trading associations. But in case of most of the vegetables, the difference is between 60% and 80%,"" said Anubrata Chatterjee, an agro-retail economist.The government should put up a board at every municipal market to publicize wholesale prices so that a consumer knows whether the retail vendor is asking for too much, advised Dey. An aware consumer can always bring down the price of vegetables at a reasonable level.Last week's rain has hit the prime vegetable producing districts like South 24 Parganas, East, Bankura, Hooghly and Howrah hard. In South 24 Parganas, 8,242 hectares have been affected, followed by East Midnapore (6,984 hectares), Bankura (4,380 hectares) and Hooghly (1,544 hectares),"" said an agriculture department officer."

""There are trollies full of potatoes as villagers are offering to sell potatoes at as low as Rs 2 per kg. After the state government failed to provide any relief, farmers had dumped potatoes in Mohali last month. With no solution in sight, many farmers plan to dump potatoes in the rivers in the coming weeks,"" said Harinder Singh , general secretary of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal).Jang Bahadur Singh Sangha, secretary general of Confederation of Potato Seed Farmers (POSCON), suggested the Centre should have intervened after the crisis began after demonetisation. ""The solution lies in concrete steps such as setting up Potato Board , involving think tanks for long-term policies and getting rid of randomness in policy so that initiatives to export potatoes can work. The international community is expecting from us, but archaic steps like fixing minimum export price hold the farmers back.""The bad run for potato farmers started last year as 70% of the crop was pushed into cold storages and potato seed buyers from West Bengal did not turn up.

(Reuters)Vast swathes of both sides of Punjab have been blanketed by smog in the past few weeks, with the pollution affecting normal life and transportation. Schools on the Indian side were closed for three days earlier this month while the timing of educational institutions on the Pakistani side was changed because of the smog.The smog has been blamed on a variety of factors, ranging from the widespread burning of crop stubble, dust from construction sites, emissions from industries and coal-fired power plants.The phenomenon has now assumed regional proportions and it engulfs the areas from New Delhi to Lahore and beyond. You will agree with me that the problem is essentially scientific and economic and cannot be tackled through other means, wrote Sharif, who is being projected as a potential prime ministerial candidate by his PML-N party for Pakistans general election next year.I firmly believe that it is in the interest of the people of both Punjabs to make a collective effort towards identifying technologies and business methods that may eliminate the need to burn rice-stubble and help control smog formation, he added.Sharif, 66, said the smog was affecting public health, especially the elderly and children, and agriculture, as it has delayed the sowing of wheat and damaged potato and other crops.The governments of both sides of Punjab had very close links though these were hit by the tensions that followed the 2008 Mumbai attacks. In the past, the two sides organised joint sports events and a large number of people from the Indian state visit Sikh shrines in Pakistan every year.This is not the first time Pakistans Punjab, the countrys most prosperous and populous province, has suggested that the two sides of Punjab should work together to tackle pollution.We have imposed a ban on stubble burning in Punjab (Pakistan) & hope @capt_amarinder takes similar measures.

Regional director, International Potato Centre Peru, Mohinder S Kadiyan said, the centre is working in many parts of India and the objective is to encourage farmers for growing potatoes so that they become economically independent.He said that the farmer who grows more potatoes will be awarded. Agronomist Dr Sushma Arya said this is third project in Nachna area in three years. Earlier the project was carried out in Didhu area.Farmers had grown potatoes and the yield and quality was good.Scientists informed that the quality of potatoes grown here is better than Gujarat and Punjab. Once the farmers are trained, they can grow potatoes on their own and earn more profit."

But, owing to heavy rain in Nasik, farmers have been unable to harvest the crop and supply it to Karnataka, resulting in price rise. The situation should return to normal in a week to 10 days, he said.In retail chains, onion was selling at Rs. 50 on Thursday.

However, this year, the crop from Karnataka has almost stopped reaching the markets and now Karnataka is dependant on other States.There is hope that supply will stabilise by the new year when Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh harvest it. A good yield in these States is likely to ensure onion rates below Rs. 40 by new year.This year, sowing of onions was delayed by a month due to delayed monsoons.

A kg of good quality onions now costs Rs 65-Rs 70 in Bengaluru's retail markets Decreased supply and increasing demand have sent the prices of onions and shallots (small onions) soaring, say farmers and traders. Even shallot prices have doubled; they range from Rs 160 to Rs 170 in the open market. Such a steep hike has not been witnessed in many years, say some farmers from North Karnataka, which is a major onion-producing region.On an average, Bengaluru markets receive 80 to 100 truckloads of onions daily. Now only 20 to 25 truckloads of onions are being supplied from Hubballi and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which is one-fourth of the daily requirement, according to an office-bearer of the Bangalore Onion Traders Association . As a result, a kg of onion which was available at Rs 30-40 just a week ago now costs Rs 70. And in another one week, it may cross Rs 80, fear traders.In the wholesale market, onion prices are up by 25% in the past five days at Hubballi APMC, Asia's largest wholesale market for onions. Modal prices have been hovering at Rs 3,000-Rs 5,000 per quintal depending of the onion quality, due to a delay in arrival of the fresh kharif harvest.North Karnataka districts, including Dharwad, Gadag, Koppal, Belagavi and Raichur, were meeting 75 per cent of Karnataka's onion demand. The state gets the remaining 25 per cent from Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra.""Normal supply of onion is possible only after farmers take up rabi cultivation and after resumption of road communication, which may take another one or two months,'' said Wahab Mulla, general secretary, Onion and Potato Merchants Association M K Patil, a senior horticulture officer said the prices of onions are expected to stabilize as the Centre has decided to impose a minimum export price (MEP) of $850 per tonne on onions to increase domestic supply and check rising costs. They have also asked public sector body Minerals and Metals Trading Corporation (MMTC) to import 2,000 tonnes of onions in order to check prices in local markets.Market sources expect a further increase in onion prices as the supply from North Karnataka is unlikely to be resumed soon. Other vegetables whose prices have shot up during the past couple of days include carrot, coriander leaves, cauliflower, cabbage, beans and tomato."

(Illustration: C R Sasikumar) India has had a very long take-back experience of glass bottles for beer and soda-water. (Illustration: C R Sasikumar)Movie buffs will remember the iconic 1967 Hollywood movie, The Graduate, in which Ben, played by a very young Dustin Hoffman, is given career advice by a friend of his parents at his graduation party. Plastics, he is told, there is a great future in plastics. Fifty years later, the spread of plastics bears out the accuracy of that prediction. But our message today would be, plastics are all pervasive and very convenient but we need to worry about food safety, design for recycling, and safe management of non-recyclable plastic waste to ensure environmental protection.Plastic is a synthetic polymer, deriving its name from the Greek word plastikos, which means fit for moulding. It was invented in 1869 by John W. Hyatt, responding to a New York firms offer of $10,000 for anyone who could provide a substitute for ivory. The subsequent 150 years have seen chemical companies develop many new polymers and many different types and grades of plastic.This inexpensive, light, and versatile product enters our everyday lives in numerous forms ranging from bread wrapping, magazine and invitation covers, and packages of many ordinary consumption items at one end and also as part of television sets, refrigerators, cars and aircraft at the other. The problem is that plastic does not decay. It sticks around in the environment as deadweight. Recycling of plastic is, therefore, extremely important, and waste management systems and product design explicitly need to facilitate plastic recycling. Worldwide, only 14 per cent of plastic is collected for recycling, while the rest stays in the environment causing pollution both on land and in the ocean.As regards food safety, consumers need to understand which plastics meet the criteria. Among the many choices available, while PET (Polyethylene Terephthalate) and HDPE (High Density Polyethylene) are generally considered safe in not leaching any chemicals, there are concerns with regard to PVC (Polyvinyl Chloride) which need to be addressed. The Plastic Waste Management Rules 2016 Sec 4(b) explicitly state that only virgin plastic is to be used for storing, carrying, dispensing or packaging food stuff which is ready to eat or drink. However, enforcement remains a challenge.Recycling of plastics is not always economically and/or technically feasible. Composites like roofing sheets, bonded rubberised coir mattresses, etc are really difficult to recycle when the components are hard to separate. The solution lies in instituting extended producer responsibility laws under which their take-back and disposal by manufacturers should be mandatory.Plastic sachets used for packaging of snack-foods like potato chips can also not be recycled. These sachets are composed of three to seven thin layers of different plastics glued together to keep air and water vapour out and retain odours and freshness. These could be recycled if all the layers were thermoplastic (like polythene and polypropylene) which soften into lumps and granules upon heating. They become non-recyclable because of an inner layer of thermoset plastic (nylon or polyester) which does not soften on heating but chars instead, blocking the filter screens and requiring the shutdown of heating equipment every few minutes. Even plastic-coated paper cups and/or stationery pose problems for recycling.Appeals to snack-food packagers to use recyclable multi-films are often countered by the argument that the new (non-recyclable) material extends the shelf-life for snack-foods from six months to one year. But should we want one-year-old biscuits or chips at the cost of a city littered with uncollected food sachets? Moreover, the cost of collecting and transporting this light fluffy waste to an energy-recovery plant exceeds any possible gain from energy recovery.Section 9(3) of the Plastics Waste Management Rules 2016 requires the phase out of non- recyclable multi-layered plastic by March 2018, while Section 17 requires manufacturers, producers and users of non-recyclable packaging to either pay municipalities for the cost of managing such waste, or arrange to take it back and manage its disposal themselves.India has had a very long take-back experience of glass bottles for beer and soda-water. Shopkeepers would give a discount on new purchases if old bottles were returned. In the US, there is a printed refund value (different for every state) of 5 to 10 cents for return of aluminium cans, glass bottles, PET bottles and containers of soft drinks. Unfortunately, hardly any Indian city has actually taken advantage of our highly beneficial Rule 17. Municipal corporations can ask all major snack-food brands to provide the city with equipment for shredding snack sachets into 2-4 mm tea-powder-like flakes and for transport of the shredded flakes to hot-mix plants. In our October column, we had highlighted how plastic waste can be used for strengthening roads by adding such flakes to hot stones to form a baked-on polymer primer coat. The excellent bonding with added bitumen gives 2-3 times longer life to tar roads.PET bottles have enjoyed high recycling value for making into flakes and then fibre, after removing bottle caps, rings and labels, and sorting by colour. Here too purity of the collection stream is the key. At one time, almost all PET bottle-waste from around the world ended up in China. Some years ago, US anti-dumping duty on Chinese T-shirts and knitwear made from recycled PET-based fibre caused a crash in the price of PET bottles for waste-pickers in India. It remains to be seen what will happen with the recent cutback on PET bottle imports by China.PVC was one of the earliest plastics to be invented, but is now banned in many cities, states and even countries. It is used in water pipes, wiring cables and also beverage bottle labels, flexes, etc. It contains 57 per cent chlorine by weight, which like other chlorine-like (halogenated) plastics, releases deadly dioxins and furans when burnt. The National Green Tribunal has now asked the Ministry of Environment to consider and pass rules phasing out short-life PVC.Major short-life PVC items like PVC hoardings and banners, flex and posters are almost invariably burnt in the open in Indian cities and contribute heavily to air toxicity. These items are largely imported from China which has banned their use in China but allows the same to be produced and exported to countries with lax environmental rules.Another troublesome waste is expanded polystyrene, known more generally as thermocol which is a brand name. This is widely used by packaging industry for packing large items like TVs and tiny ones like cell-phones. Though theoretically recyclable as polystyrene, here too its light weight makes collection and transport for recycling and even take-back uneconomical. The West and Far East have solved this problem by switching to wonderfully creative and recyclable alternatives: Moulded papier-mch, folded cardboard, expanded paper, bubble-wrap, air bags, compostable peanuts for loose-fill packaging and much more.The plastic menace for Indian cities is compounded because of their generally poor state of solid waste management and the poor infrastructure for sewerage and stormwater drainage. Developing eco-friendly consumption habits such as avoiding disposable catering items and using washable cups and plates instead, will make a difference, but plastics will continue to play an important role in our lives. A sustainable way forward is to minimise consumption of disposable/single use plastic items, create awareness about the use of appropriate grade of plastic for different purposes, and emphasise the importance of recycling and reusing plastic.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

For the past 22 years, he has been a BJP voter.However, this time, Mr. Patel says, he will change his voting preference because the party has done little for farmers.In this area, we have always voted for the BJP but not now. We farmers have been ruined by this government. They are only concerned about some industrialists, an angry Mr. Patel says, standing on his farm on the Morbi-Rajkot highway.The main issue is the poor prices of cotton and groundnut for the past three years.For the past several years, we are not getting remunerative prices; so farming has become a burden. Today, cotton fetches Rs. 800 to Rs. 900 per 20 kg, while our production cost is almost Rs. 1,000, if we include labour and input costs, he says.Farm distress is emerging as one of the important factors in the Assembly elections in Gujarat. The State is the largest producer of cotton and groundnut, which take up the largest cultivation area. In the current year, cotton has been cultivated on 26.41 lakh hectares and the expected production is 1.25 crore bales. Groundnut has been grown on 16 lakh hectares and 26 lakh tonnes is expected.Paresh Ujaria, a farmer with about 1.5 hectare of land and local Youth Congress activist, says farmers in the cotton belt are in distress. The prices of seeds, pesticides, fertilizers, power and labour have gone up. Today, one labourer charges Rs. 300 a day, while prices of our produce have stagnated for the past several years, making farming a loss-making proposition, he says.Babubhai Vasoya, a 52-year-old farmer at Thebachda village near Rajkot, echoes the same sentiments. I want to ask Modi [Prime Minister Narendra Modi] where is the Rs. 1,500 [per 20 kg] for cotton that he promised in 2014? In 2017, we are not getting what we used to get in 2011-12, when cotton price was Rs. 1,200 to Rs. 1,300 per 20 kg, Mr. Vasoya says.Gauravsinh Jadeja of the village says farm distress is sweeping across the region. Similar is the situation in every district of Saurashtra. You go to Jamnagar, Amreli, Bhavnagar, Botad and you will see poor farmers crying for better prices for their produce, he says.In North Gujarat, farmers face a similar predicament as they are not realising remunerative prices for potato, a major crop in Banaskantha, Patan and Gandhinagar.Farmers are forced to sell potato at Rs. 2 to Rs. 3 a kg against their production cost of Rs. 5 and cold storage costs. They need at least Rs. 10 a kg to make a little profit, says Ramanbhai Patel, a farmer and cold storage owner from Deesa in Banaskantha."

Express file Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Express fileFive major wholesale markets in the state, including Punes, are likely to see a major change in the way their board of directors are elected. Instead of elections to pick the board, the state government is likely to appoint senior officials as directors to run these markets. These five markets  the wholesale markets of Vashi, Nashik, Kolhapur and Nagpur, besides Pune  receive around 30 per cent of the commodities arriving from other states and have substantially large turnovers. Vashis is the largest wholesale market in the state and, besides Maharashtra, records arrivals from Gujarat, among other states. The move to appoint senior officials as directors is part of the new model Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Act circulated by the central government in March this year. The Act specifies markets with more than 30 per cent arrival from other states as markets of national importance.State governments have been asked to give their suggestions and objections to it and adopt it as they deem fit. The Act has numerous other provisions to improve the performance of wholesale markets and help farmers realise better value for their produce. The government has formed a special committee headed by the director (marketing) to study the matter and submit a report. The report, it is learnt, is in its final stages after which it will be put before the Cabinet for approval.APMCs for long have been the hub of politics. In Maharashtra, the Congress and NCP have traditionally controlled these markets with the ruling BJP having a thin presence in them. Earlier, the state government had mooted the concept of expert directors, who would be political appointees on these boards. Majority of those appointed, it is said, were close to the BJP. The present move, many say, is another government move to wrestle control of these markets.Officials say the move will free the markets from political interference and allow for better implementation of schemes. Meanwhile, most traders say the move will not affect the functioning of the markets. Rajendra Shelke, president of the Vashi markets onion and potato traders, said trade would go on unhindered. This is purely a political move and will achieve nothing substantial, he said.Jagdish Apshunde, a director of the Nashik market, however, said the move will have its pros and cons. An upright officer will be able to run the markets better but if power is concentrated in the hands of a corrupt officer, the market will go for a toss, he said.For all the latest Pune News, download Indian Express App"

Traders said tomatoes cost Rs. 40 per kg due to shortage in supply, while onions were at Rs. 35 per kg. Rising prices of both vegetables over the past four weeks has inconvenienced both consumers and sellers alike, traders said.Officials at the APMC said both crops were hit by unseasonal rain, pushing the wholesale prices of tomato to between Rs. 30 and Rs. 40 per kg, and to between Rs. 50 and Rs. 60 in retail outlets. Onion prices, too, went up, selling in retail for Rs. 50 to Rs. 60, depending on quality and location. With the onion crop severely hit in Karnataka, the neighbouring State is depending almost completely on supply from Nashik. Of the 300 trucks of onions entering Bengaluru APMC, over 250 are from Nashik.Ashok Walunj, former director, onion and potato division, APMC, said supply has improved since Wednesday. Around 245 trucks of onion arrived on Thursday and Friday, pushing prices down. Were expecting a fresh stock of onions on Monday. This will bring down the rates further. Within a weeks time, rates will regularise to Rs. 15 to Rs. 20.Tomato, which usually costs between Rs. 18 to Rs. 25 per kg, was being sold at Rs. 45 per kg at the APMC on Friday. Shankar Pingle, former director, vegetables division, APMC, said. Usually, the tomato season starts by mid-October, bring prices down. This time, the tomato crop has been affected by rains in Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh in September. During the same time last year, tomatoes cost Rs. 10 to Rs. 15 per kg.Anil Rai, who is among the top tomato dealers in the market, said, On an average, 100 trucks would come to the APMC, each bearing 10 tonnes of tomatoes. This would be distributed across Mumbai Metropolitan Region. However, no supply at all from Karnataka has affected us the most. Whatever is coming to the market is from nearby districts including Nashik, Pune and Satara, but it isnt enough. As per APMC records, the vegetables division received around 40 vehicles of tomatoes on Friday.Mr. Rai added that as the tomato crop cycle is of 90 days, farmers have sown again and this produce is expected in the next 15 to 20 days. This will bring down rates further."
5aeb22da9855b7179ad71987,"From Plate to Plough: Agri-futures, like China",http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/from-plate-to-plough-agri-futures-like-china-4968066/,2017-12-05,"(Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh) (Express Photo by: Gurmeet Singh)In November, prices of most major kharif crops crashed below their respective minimum support prices (MSPs), triggering farm distress. One of the many reasons behind this situation is that planting decisions of our farmers are based on last years prices, rather than the prices expected at the time of harvest. Signals indicating future prices are largely absent as agri-futures have been decimated by excessive controls and regulation. It is time to think afresh and resurrect agri-futures in India.In 2003, the Atal Bihari Vajpayee governments decisions to allow futures markets in India  after a long gap  was hailed as a big and bold step towards better price discovery for farmers. This, in turn, was supposed to help farmers take informed planting decisions. In the initial years  2003-2007  agri-futures did show promising growth. But around 2007-2008, they were hit by the global food price crisis. Agri-futures picked up momentum again and peaked in 2011-2012. However, since then, there has been heavy government intervention in agri-futures with higher margin requirements as well as absolute suspensions, resulting in their near collapse.Chinese agri-futures have had a contrasting trajectory. The agri-futures market was introduced in the early 1990s in China. It struggled for a decade, but thereafter Chinese agri-futures had such a robust growth that by 2016, it was at the top of global chart, crossing the 1,000 million mark, dwarfing Indias 20 million contracts in the process.What lessons can India learn from China in order to promote its agri-futures and help its farmers in better price discovery? Very briefly, China experimented with several things, including inviting experts from the Chicago Board of Trade in the US, rationalising commodities and exchanges by closing down trade in many items and focusing on a few farm products, especially the less sensitive ones. However, to understand Indias story better, we need to look at the perceptions and actions of three key stakeholders: Policy-makers, regulators (FMC/SEBI), and commodity exchanges. A pre-requisite for the development of a agri-futures market is to have a stable policy environment.The government, including the regulator, should provide a favourable environment for the futures trade to flourish. Commodity exchanges have to invest in designing appropriate contracts for business development. Abrupt interventions, with frequent changes in stocking restrictions on private trade, have reduced the prospects of agri-futures in India. We collated information about various interventions related to margins and suspensions since 2003 and found that suspensions of agri-futures, as well as high margins, have been targeted more towards commodities that are perceived as sensitive in the common mans food basket (See graph). For example, tur, urad, rice have been suspended for more than a decade now. High margins for sensitive commodities, for example, 100 per cent for potato (August 2014), 95 per cent for chana (June 2016) and 70 per cent for sugar (September 2016) reflect the governments intention of blocking their futures trade.So, if one has to develop agri-futures in India, the first lesson is to stay away from sensitive commodities (for example, common rice, wheat, most pulses, and even sugar), at least for some time, till futures gain momentum and some depth. It would be prudent to focus on less sensitive commodities like oilseed complex (oilseeds, meals, and oils), feed (maize), cotton, basmati rice and spices. Once markets are developed and the regulator has a higher degree of comfort, the country can diversify to other commodities in the agri-futures portfolio. This is what China also seems to have done. The largest volumes in agri-futures have come from oilseeds. This points to the significance of the regulators role: Giving a clear direction in terms of the choice of commodities, and then staying the course by adopting a stable policy with minimal interventions.Second, for the government to be assured that speculators are not rigging markets, the regulator should allow only delivery-based contracts, at least till markets deepen. This is another lesson from the Chinese experience: All agri-commodities traded at the Dalian Commodity Exchange are physical-delivery based.Third, like its Chinese counterpart, the government of India should encourage state trading enterprises (STEs) to trade on the agri-futures platform. This will boost the governments confidence in agri-futures as it will have ample information from its STEs. In China, STEs, the China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO) for example, have a major presence in the agri-futures markets. COFCO is directly administered by Chinas State Council and is the largest food processor, manufacturer and largest exporter and importer in the country. It trades in agri-commodities like soybean oil and meal, palm oil, cotton and sugar in the futures market. Indias STEs like the MMTC, STC, PEC or even the FCI can participate on the agri-futures platform in a similar manner, helping it to deepen.Lastly, it has to be recognised that developing agri-futures is as much the responsibility of the regulator as that of commodity exchanges, and both need to work in harmony for the benefit of various stakeholders, especially farmers who need useful information about future prices for their products while they are planting those crops. Can the Narendra Modi government take bold decisions to revive the legacy of the Vajpayee government and scale new heights in agri-futures, say 200 million contracts by 2022? Remember, China crossed the billion mark in 2015.For all the latest Opinion News, download Indian Express App"

KCNA/via REUTERS North Koreas leader Kim Jong Un is seen during the inspection of a potato flour factory in this undated photo released by North Koreas Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) in Pyongyang December 6, 2017. KCNA/via REUTERSNorth Korea says a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has become a matter of when, not if, as it continued to lash out at a massive joint military exercise between the United States and South Korea involving hundreds of advanced warplanes. In comments attributed to an unnamed Foreign Ministry spokesman, North Korea also claimed high-ranked US officials, including CIA Director Mike Pompeo, have further confirmed American intent for war with a series of bellicose remarks.Pompeo said Saturday that US intelligence agencies believe North Korean leader Kim Jong Un doesnt have a good idea about how tenuous his situation is domestically and internationally.The Norths spokesman said Pompeo provoked the country by impudently criticizing our supreme leadership which is the heart of our people.The large-scale nuclear war exercises conducted by the US in succession are creating touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula and series of violent war remarks coming from the US high-level politicians amid such circumstances have made an outbreak of war on the Korean peninsula an established fact. The remaining question now is: when will the war break out, the spokesman said.We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it, and should the US miscalculate our patience and light the fuse for a nuclear war, we will surely make the US dearly pay the consequences with our mighty nuclear force which we have consistently strengthened.The comments were carried by the official Korean Central News Agency late Wednesday, hours after the United States flew a B-1B supersonic bomber over South Korea as part of a massive combined aerial exercise involving hundreds of warplanes.South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff said the Guam-based bomber simulated land strikes at a military field near South Koreas eastern coast during a drill with US and South Korean fighter jets.Through the drill, the South Korean and US air forces displayed the allies strong intent and ability to punish North Korea when threatened by nuclear weapons and missiles, the South Korean military said in a statement.B-1Bs flyovers have become an increasingly familiar show of force to North Korea, which after three intercontinental ballistic missile tests has clearly moved closer toward building a nuclear arsenal that could viably target the US mainland.The five-day drills that began Monday involve more than 200 aircraft, including six U.S. F-22 and 18 F-35 stealth fighters.North Korea hates such displays of American military might at close range and typically uses strong language to condemn them as invasion rehearsals. It has been particularly sensitive about B-1B bombers, describing them as nuclear strategic although the planes were switched to conventional weaponry in the mid-1990s.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"

Earlier, the vegetable was being sold at a steep Rs. 35 to Rs. 50 per kg. The arrival of 76 trucks and tempos laden with tomatoes from Nashik, Pune, Satara and Karnataka on Friday helped increase the supply in the APMC and significantly lower the price.

The suicide comes at a time when West Bengal has witnessed a bumper potato harvest for the second year running.The deceased, Golak Bijari Ullal, had taken loans from the Cooperative Bank and moneylenders to grow potatoes on his 20 bigha plot.A resident of Muzaffarpur village in Harimkhola, Golaks son Tarakhnath Ullal said: We have a debt of Rs 5 lakh We had grown potato because the crop had been doing so well. While some of the crop was destroyed because of the untimely rain there were months when there was no rain. But the potato crop itself has done well in the state and thus, the prices plummeted. We couldnt even recover our investment.On Friday morning, finding his fathers room locked, the family called the police. My father did not open the door. The police broke the door and found him hanging, said Tarakhnath.BJPs OBC Morcha state president Sapan Das, who hails from Hooghly, has paid a visit to the family. Blaming the Trinamool Congress government for the death, he said: Farmers are in trouble if crops dont do well they are in trouble even when crops do well. The bumper crop has made the price of potatoes drop. While the market price of potato is substantial even now, farmers dont get this priceThe state government buys the crop from farmers at Rs 6 per kg While the current market price is Rs 8 per kg, the farmers are investing the same amount in the crop So, they are not making any money Middlemen from the ruling party buy the crop at a lower price from farmers and sell it at a higher price. Farmers are thus pushed to commit suicide, he alleged.Pal maintained a healthy price for the farmers is Rs 14 to Rs 15 per kg. The government buys 40 kg of potato for Rs 120 It should instead buy 10 kg at this price, he said. In case of wheat surplus, the crop can be processed and stored. This is not the case with potatoes, as it is perishable. There arent enough storages, which the government is supposed to build. And even when storages are built, these are taken over by TMC workers and middlemen, alleged Pal.Bengal is one of the largest producers of potato in the country with main cultivating areas in Burdwan, Hooghly and Aram-bagh. During 2016 state polls, the Left had raised the issue of farmer suicide. According to CPM, 200 farmers have committed suicide in the last three years in Bengal, with 116 such cases in Burdwan.Kisan Sabha state secretary Amar Haldar said the main cause of farmer suicides is debt. The government has not made the markets easily accessible to farmers. The Left Front used to give a subsidy to farmers for crop cutting. This has been removed by the Mamata government. Moreover, the production cost of crops has increased  prices of seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, electricity have increased. The fertiliser subsidy has also been removed.For the first time in 50 years, potato farmers dont have water to irrigate their crops. The crops fail, farmers go to moneylenders and are then unable to pay off their loans, he said.In 2015, 12 potato farmers had committed suicide in Bengal. A bumper harvest of 120 lakh tonnes in 2014-15 led to a similar crisis, resulting in the price of potatoes falling to Rs 3 to Rs 5 per kg. While in 2012, Bengal was not among top five states in terms of suicides, by 2013, it contributed to 9.7 per cent of all suicides. Unlike Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, where the cities recorded highest number of suicides, Kolkata recorded 360 out of a total of 14,310 suicides in 2014, with most suicides taking place in rural Bengal.Despite repeated attempts, Agriculture Minister Ashis Banerjee was not available for comments.For all the latest Kolkata News, download Indian Express App"

It was an issue of hot debate in newspapers and media yesterday that a meeting between former Pakistan high commissioner, former minister of external affairs of Pakistan, former vice president Hamid Ansari and former PM Manmohan Singh was held at Mani Shankar Aiyar's house. The meeting had run for three hours and the next day he called me ""Neech (low-born), the prime minister said.This is an issue of serious concern that when Pakistan has become a sensitive issue for the country then what was the reason to hold a secret meeting with Pakistan when the polls are being held in Gujarat. Former director general of Pakistan army Arshad Rafiq has insisted that Ahmed Patel should be made CM of Gujarat. Former army director general intervenes in Gujarat election. They held meeting with Pakistanis at Mani Shankars house and on the very next day of that meeting, Gujarat, backward community of Gujarat, Modi and poor people of Gujarat were insulted. Is it not an issue of concern for the country? Congress must answer what suspicious activities they are doing. They must answer the country, added Modi.PM Modi, who had to cut short his speech due to bad throat apologised before the public and affirmed that he would return soon to talk to the people of Palanpur. The prime minister was campaigning for BJP candidates: Lalji Prajapati from Palanpur, Mavji Desai from Dhanera, Shashikant Pandya from Deesa, Mavjibhai from Danta and Vijay Chakravarti from Vadgam.He asserted that the BJP had been defeated only in these five seats of North Gujarat in 2012 state assembly polls and asked the people to not only win the constituencies but also each and every polling booths.In 2012, entire Gujarat was with Modi, but only these five assembly seats in Banaskantha did not remain with the BJP. Are you in aguish with that or not? Do you want to settle the score this time or not? In these five assembly seats, whether there are Congress candidates or any devious person whoever is brought by them, I want to win all the polling booths in these seats. I want that the lotus must bloom (BJP symbol) in all the polling booths. If lotus blooms in all the polling booths then no power of the world can defeat the BJP, said Modi.Taking a jibe at Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi , PM Modi said, This region, which was infamous for its dust-storm, has now become famous in the entire country for its potato cultivation. You people know potatoes are cultivated in farms with hard labour in farms, but that fellow (Rahul Gandhi) says potatoes are grown in factories. Bring him here and make him understand that potatoes farming need hard labour.""When you shout Modi..Modi who do you see- the Prime Minister or Aapna Narendrabhai (our Narendra bhai). If you see Aapna Narendra bhai, that it means you still remember me and if you see the Prime Minister, then it means I am forgotten. I am fortunate that wherever I go for the poll campaign in Gujarat, people feel that Aapna Narendrabhai is here not the Prime Minister, PM Modi added."

""The next day, a statement was made that Modi is 'neech'.""The charge of a Pakistan hand in allegedly destabilising or influencing the election takes the bitterly fought election to a new low afterwith his ""neech"" reference to Modi and the PM's call to voters to avenge the insult.The alleged meeting between Pakistani leaders saw Modi attack Congress in what came across as a bid to play the polarising card by sticking a ""pro-Pak"" label on Congress.Modi said the 'secret meeting' lasted three hours. ""This is an issue of serious concern. We suffer a lot due to Pakistan's actions, and you (the Congress) conducted meetings behind closed doors?"" Modi said. ""You should've had an official of the Government of India in the meeting, and informed the government about what transpired."" He had earlier accused Rahul Gandhi of ""hugging"" the Chinese ambassador at the height of the Doklam stand off.Modi called Aiyar's comment ""an insult to the 125 crore people of India as well as to the post of the PM"". Aiyar was suspended from Congress following his comment. He later apologised for the remark.Earlier, Modi had said, ""One Congress youth leader Salman Nizami is campaigning for Rahul Gandhi... He said on Twitter that Rahul's father (Rajiv) and grandmother (Indira) had sacrificed their lives, while his great grandfather (Nehru) was a freedom fighter... Then he (Nizami) went on to ask that Modi should answer who were his father and mother. Do we use this language in public discourse? ""He called Indian armed forces rapists, and further said in his tweets that 'ghar ghar se Afzal niklega'. Do you want Afzal in every home?"" Modi asked.Modi urged people to vote for BJP and acknowledged that voters of this region did not support BJP during the previous assembly polls. ""In 2012, entire Gujarat was with Modi, but only these five assembly seats in Banaskantha did not remain with the BJP,"" he said. ""Are you not in anguish because of this? Don't you want to settle the score this time?"" Hinting at Dalit rights activist Jignesh Mevani's independent candidature supported by Congress, Modi said, ""In these five assembly seats, whether there are Congress candidates or any dubious person brought in by them, I want to win in all polling booths.""Modi lampooned Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi saying, ""You people know that potatoes are cultivated in farms with hard labour, but that fellow says potatoes are grown in factories. Bring him here and make him understand that potato farming requires hard labour."" ""Earlier, would there not be curfew during Ganesh festivities, Ram Navami and Uttarayan? But now don't Hindus and Muslims do businesses together?"" said Modi."

The introduction of potatoes and the resultant increase in productivity dramatically reduced conflict both within and between states for some two centuries, it says. The researchers, who examined 2,477 battles fought in 899 wars over a 500-year period, drew two key conclusions. The first is linked to the declining value of land on which potatoes are grown.Land value fellAccording to the study, the value of the land on which potatoes were grown fell with advances in productivity. Populations were able to feed themselves on ever smaller amounts of land.Conflicts declined when the value of the object for which one was fighting decreased, the study says.Increases in farmers incomes, often due to much bigger and more reliable harvests, boosted tax revenues for the state, providing added governmental stability and thereby helping to buy the peace, the report states.To risk losing these resources  for workers and for political leaders  represented a financial danger that states were less and less willing to risk, resulting in a decline in peasant revolts and civil wars, the study said.It had become too expensive to engage in combat.The analysis does not detail the impact of specific wars or conflicts but says that most of those studied took place on the borders of modern-day Austria, France, Russia and Turkey. Others were in the Near East and North Africa."
5b509b259855b708a7cccd3d,Winter rain to delay state potato harvest,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/kolkata/winter-rain-to-delay-state-potato-harvest/articleshow/62028568.cms,2017-12-12,"Hooghly: The surprise showers over the last two days have taken a toll on the early variety of potato in vast stretches of West Midnapore, Bankura and Burdwan, forcing farmers to sow seeds afresh. The delay in sowing, along with a projected drop in the total acreage of potato this season, may lead to a supply crunch because the new variety is likely to reach the market earliest by March, instead of February. The notun aloo selling in the retail market now at Rs 25-30 a kilo are those from Punjab and Uttar Pradesh.Potato grower Chandranath Jana from Bankuras Jaipur said: I took a loan of Rs 10,000 from the rural cooperative to cultivate the tuber on a bigha (one-third acre) of land. The saplings have now all gone under water. The cooperative wont sanction loans unless I repay the earlier one and I now have to borrow from elsewhere to sow the seeds.A rough calculation of the input costs (seeds and fertilizer) and labour shows that a farmer needs Rs 10,000-12,000 per bigha to grow the tuber  costlier than sowing paddy. Yet, farmers took the potato route after incurring loss in the aman paddy because a substantial part of the crop was wasted while harvesting during the downpour. The damage of the early variety of potato will affect the sowing of the regular variety, particularly in the areas of Chandrakona and Garbeta in West Midnapore, Jaipur, Sonamukhi and Bishnupur in Bankura, and Jabalpur and Kalna in Burdwan.However, these are only a portion of the areas that cultivate the early variety. Many farmers in Hooghly and Howrahs Udaynarayanpur didnt go for the early variety sowing after the November rain. The untimely rain has damaged the crop in parts of the entire 4.25 lakh hectares. It didnt have any major effect in Hooghly, which alone produces one-third of the crop. However, the sudden rise in minimum temperature will delay the sowing of the regular variety (jyoti). If it persists, the total acreage of the tuber may fall by 25,000-40,000 hectares this season. Potato needs the chill by December-January for better productivity, said Pradip Majumdar, agro-expert and adviser to the chief minister.The saving grace for consumers is the 17.5 lakh tonnes of potato available in cold storages that can feed Bengal of 5 lakh tonnes a month for the next three months, till the new crop arrives in March. Patitpaban De of the West Bengal Cold Storage Owners Association said the monthly output from Bengal was 7 lakh tonnes. Des claim puts a question mark on the steady supply from cold storages till March, leaving a gap of 15 to 20 days in February when people wont buy the last lot of the stored tuber while the new crop will take some more time to reach the market. Potato, thus, may get expensive for a fortnight at the end of February. But Bengal farmers wont be able to make the fast money. Instead, potato traders from Jalandhar and Amritsar in Punjab, and Farukabad and Agra in Uttar Pradesh are likely to take advantage of the supply crunch."

Breaking it down, the Consumer Food Price Index has slipped into a deflation by 1.05% in May, 2017 from inflation of 7.47% in the same month a year ago. Further, segregation of the data shows nothing but distress being felt by farmers. Prices of vegetables year-on-year fell by 13.44% at the retail level while on a measure of the Wholesale Price Index, prices of veggies fell by over 18%. The situation for pulses growers is even worse with the sub- index falling sharply by close to 20%. With potato prices dropping by whopping 44%, the growers are in real crisis.Ironically, the rural stress has not come about because of drought or any other natural cause, but in a year of plentiful farm produce. Good monsoon last year and a similar weather outlook this year should normally bring smile on the faces of farmers. Instead, they are in distress. Whatever the government may claim about the ill-advised demonetisation, it too has left a trail of disruption in the farm mandis. While the loan waivers may win some reprieve to states, the solution lies elsewhere. The terms of trade must improve in favour of farmers and they cannot be left to the vagaries of the market which is distorted by the hoarders, middlemen and even the governments at times. The governments announce year after year increase in the Minimum Support Price, but makes no adequate arrangements for procurement with the result that the produce rots in the open in the mandis.On the other hand, with private sector operating at much below its existing capacity, the industrial output could grow by a modest 3.1% in April, telling a different story of distress. Indebtedness of large volume has not only been a problem for the borrow-ers but more for the public sector lenders which are not able to resolve the mess of the non-performing assets. Under such a scenario, the only option left is to drastically reduce the policy interest rates by the Reserve Bank of India with the CPI inflation slipping much below the target of 4%. Instead of making it an issue of one-upmanship and autonomy, the Monetary Policy Committee of the RBI should see reason and go for a rate cut without any delay."

But how far should healthy eating stretch?A close relative of mine had some rigid ideas about eating certain types of food and believed that he had made the best choice, which became a habit over a period of time. After he got married, his wife cooked according to his taste and requirement and all went well until one day he complained of mouth ulcers.That day, lunch came with a special kind of greens to treat mouth ulcers, along with a detailed account of the hea lth benefits of the herb. Notwithstanding the unpleasant taste, he had to devour it to achieve the expected results! That was the beginning of his health capsule.Health problems of various degrees are common in every household, and he or the children would occasionally complain of stomach upset, sore throat, cold, etc. The lady of the house, keen on restoring the family's health, started her research on home remedies. She came up with a list of vegetables, fruits, herbs and spices that were ""good for health"" and helped relieve many problems. She made the healthy eating strategy a routine, whether or not there was any issue!Bittergourd was cooked to check blood sugar. Banana stem, considered good for kidney stones, was used, while fried plantain and potato curry that were starchy and lead to gastric problems were avoided. As detoxifying agents, salads became a must. Since oily and fatty food raised bad cholesterol, steamed and boiled food was regularised. To maintain a stable BP and heart condition, a low-salt diet and use of garlic was introduced. Buttermilk/curd (Lacto bacilli) was compulsory after every meal to avoid stomach infections.To augment weight loss, vegetables with more water content like, cucumber, ash gourd and chow-chow made silent entry into the kitchen. Many other unfamiliar ""healthy vegetables"" became more familiar! Now, health mattered most than the taste! If someone had anattack of cold, the entire family was served pepper-jeera rasam!Oats pongal, millets idli and ragi dosa, occasional rice idli/dosa and cereals with low-fat milk were in the breakfast menu. A generous use of herbs and spices in every dish was incorporated for their special properties like healing, alleviating gastric problem, nausea, allergies and to serve as antacid.Evening snacks comprised a bowl of mixed fruits and nuts. Green tea was a forced favourite drink of the family. The entire range of ""healthy foods"" was stocked for the whole year. This revolution happened amid the initial, timid resentment from the rest of the family!During one of our visits to their house, we were baffled seeing him eat something which he had condemned as ""cattle feed"" long ago. Then he exclaimed, ""Every meal in this house is a medicine. I eat this for digestion and weight control. In this house we seldom eat 'tasty'... sorry 'unhealthy' food""!"

All we have to really do is kindly breathe, eat and excrete because most of our needs and jobs are taken care of by machines and the rest by electronics and the help we employ.Just when we are ushered into that idyllic world of doing nothing, there is an official declaration that most of the health problems of the present age stems from our sedentary lifestyles. So being the quintessential couch potato with matching chips alongside is no longer the most favourable position to be in. Those people who have pledged that they will not budge from their comfort zone for love or money will have to think again.These days, even momentarily opened doors and windows happen to be ushering in winged creatures which are mostly mosquitoes. They breeze in and hum around our ears, settle on the exposed portions of our bodies and merrily quaff on our life blood.As a rule, we humans do not resent the resultant itching or the sharing of half a drop of blood if it were not associated with a host of diseases. So we started using sprays, lights, coils and repellants with negligible results. Then, the brainier section of mankind invented the mosquito bat. All we have to do is place our thumbs on the button to activate the electrified battle-ready weapon and brandish it around ourselves and vanquish the bloodsuckers that dare to venture into our orbit. If we are lucky, our success is celebrated with some fireworks and we can slip back into indolence till the next beastly pest flies along.Initially, the conscientious Samaritans were hesitant to indulge in conscious ""himsa."" It took a few gurus and their disciples to use the implement in full public view to put across the message that the insects were probably wretched souls seeking liberation so that they could move on to higher planes. Then on, no one seems to have any compunction about using their bludgeons blissfully. On the contrary, they feel secure when they have one such racquet beside them.The users of the bats will vouch for the fact that their arms have been strengthened while protecting themselves from some dreadful diseases. More enterprising batsmen and women also manage to burn a few calories when they scout for victims in the vicinity of their homes. In fact, a couple of engineering students have started working on the sports model of the bat which can keep scores of hits and misses quite on the lines of Pokemon Go!Now that the power and position of the haloed bat has been established, the day is not far when the mosquito will be declared as an endangered species. True blue users of the bludgeon will understand that one of the sovereign duties of a desi is to safeguard the cesspools, potholes, garbage piles so that we have a never ending supply of offerings to the ubiquitous bats that each one of us possesses. After all, is it not our duty to protect our protector?"

Weather will remain dry the rest of the time.Moderate to dense fog is likely to occur at isolated places on December 13 and 14. Weather is likely to remain dry for the next two days. Maximum and minimum temperature is expected to hover between 16 and 21 degrees celsius and 5 to 12 degree celsius respectively. Maximum relative humidity is expected to remain between 78% and 90 % and minimum between 42% and 68 % during these days. Farmers sowing the gram crop are advised to use 36 kg seed per acre. They should treat the seed in termite-infested soil with Dursban 20 EC (chlorpyriphos) @ 10 ml per kg seed. Under December sowing, transplanting of gobhi sarson is more profitable than direct sowing, say experts. Farmers have also been advised to use 60-day old seedlings of gobhi sarson (GSL-1), 35-40 day old seedlings for gobhi sarson hybrid Hyola PAC 401 and 30-35 day old seedlings for GSC 6.As clear weather is expected during the next 3-4 days, wheat crop cv. PBW 658 and PBW 590 should be sown. Farmers are advised to spray weedicides. To control gulli danda weed, farmers are advised to spray leader, safal, Marksulfo 75 WG (sulfosulfuron) @ 13 g/acre in 150 litres of water.They are also advised to treat wheat seed with 13 ml Raxil Easy/Orius 6 FS by dissolving it in 400 ml water or 120 g Vitavax Power 75 WS or 80 g Vitavax 75 WP or 40 g Seedex 2 DS/Exzole 2 DS per 40 kg seed, using seed treatment drum to control loose smut and flag smut of wheat. Farmers have been warned against treating seed a month before sowing as it hampers germination.They should manage rodent pests in wheat crop sown with Happy Seeder by burrow baiting with 2% zinc phosphide twice at an interval of 10 to 15 days after sowing of crop (a week before or after irrigation) during this period. Farmers are also advised to spray magnesium sulphate in deficit soils where the wheat crop is 24 to 25 days old.They are advised to conduct regular surveillance of their fields for late blight of potato and if symptoms appear, spray the crop with Indofil M-45/Markzeb/Kavach @ 500-700 g in 250-350 litres of water per acre. For judicious use of pesticides, follow DSS for management of late blight of potato. If there is curling of leaves, farmers should uproot plants or damage infected plants. To control rust in pea, spray 500 g of Indofil M-45 in 200 litres of water.

The Jewish community in the city will be celebrating the festival of lights till December 20.The eight-day-long Jewish festival began by lighting the first candle of Hanukkiah on Tuesday evening.A prominent member of the Jewish community, Ezra Moses, said, The main part of the celebration is the lighting of the Hanukkiah candle, which has nine candles in it in the synagogue as well as at individual homes. We light one lamp along with the central head candle on each of the eight days. By the end of the week, all nine candles are lit.We spend the rest of the days in prayer and by feasting on sweets like halwas, doughnuts, custard and exchanging gifts. Some families even play games with dreidels and sing festive songs, he added.Speaking about the significance of the festival Moses, added, Over 3,000 years ago, the Romans had adulterated the pure olive oil used by the Jewish community in the synagogue in an attempt to force them to worship the king and other idols. The Jews found enough pure olive oil to burn their holy lamps for a day. This light, however, miraculously kept burning for eight days. The festival of lights commemorates this miracle that strengthened the faith of the community in our one God.While this is one of the two biggest festivals for the Jewish community across the world, it has a special significance for the community here as it marks the 138th anniversary of the only synagogue in the cityWith a population of 1,800 Jews, Thane has around 40% of the countrys Jewish community and the Gate of Heaven Synagogue was inaugurated during this festival over a century ago, which makes it special for us. We will be having special prayers at the synagogue on Sunday to observe this celebration, Moses said."

Vishal Srivastav Leader of Opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary at a press conference in Lucknow on Wednesday. Vishal SrivastavLeader of Opposition in the state Assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary on Wednesday accused Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath of provoking and instigating opposition parties and asked him to be mridubhashi (soft-spoken). Chaudhary targeted Adityanath over his statement in the Assembly on Tuesday, when he had indirectly mentioned Congress president Rahul Gandhi speaking about aloo ki factory. Adityanath had said that there is a leader, who does not even know that potatoes are grown on fields, not in factories.While Adityanath had also said that many in the Opposition do not even know the difference between aloo and lauki or mango and sugarcane, Chauduary said, Aap to vipaksha ko khud uksate hain bharkate hain mridubhashi ho jaiye (You provoke and instigate the Oppositionbe a sweet-talker).Chaudhary said that he had raised the issue (of potato farmers) even during the previous Samajwadi Party regime. Lag sakhta hai aloo ka karkhana, said Chaudhary, while pointing out that potato farmers are facing acute crises due to extremely low rates of their crop in the market. He said that the anger of farmers is increasing. Replying to Chaudhary, Deputy Chief Minister Keshav Prasad Maurya said that the state government had taken steps to help potato farmers soon after it had come to power. He added that apart from allowing and promoting export of the crop, farmers were also given exemption from mandi fee and the government had even purchased the crop. He said that the state government has decided to include potato in the midday meal menu of state schools.Congress Legislative Party leader Ajai Kumar Lallu, meanwhile, raised objection to the comment made on the statement of Rahul Gandhi but Treasury benches as well as the Speaker pointed out that no specific name was taken at the Assembly. As the Opposition went on to raise the issue of potato farmers, Adityanath said that his government has worked to give protection to all farmers without any bias. He said that while his government has announced support price for potato farmers for the first time, a three-member committee was also formed to solve their issues, apart from giving them other benefits. The chief minister said that for the first time, potato farmers were given permission to export their produce and orders have been issued to include potato in midday meals as well.Adityanath said that his government kisano ke hiton ko puri tarha se sanrakshan karegi (The government will protect the interest of the farmers in every possible way).At this point, Samajwadi Party MLAs staged a walkout, calling the government kisan virodhi (anti-farmers).Later in the day, Congress Legislature Party leader Ajay Kumar Lallu demanded discussion on the deaths of children across the state especially in Gorakhpur and staged a walk out over the issue. He said outside the Assembly that he demanded a discussion on the issue of childrens death in Gorakhpur and other districts, but was denied it. The Congress leader said that he would again raise the issue on Thursday.Chaudhary as well senior BSP leader Sukhdev Rajbhar also raised the issue of incorrect information being given by officers in reply to questions asked in the Assembly and requested action in the matter. Parliamentary Affairs Minister Suresh Khanna promised to order an inquiry into the matter and take appropriate action against the guilty officers.Meanwhile, the Uttar Pradesh Repealing Bill, 2017 was placed in the Assembly on Wednesday. In the written statement of objects and reasons for presenting the bill, Law Minister Brajesh Pathak maintained that, On the recommendation of the central law commission and Ramunujam Committee constituted by the central government, it has been decided to repeal those Acts, which were notified by the central government during Presidents rule in the state and during the British Rule before Independence and have become obsolete and useless.

The committee, sources said, has been given four weeks to examine demands made by various religious groups in this regard and submit a report.This comes days after Chief Minister Siddaramaiah asked the minorities commission to look into demands from various political and religious leaders who have sought minority religion status in the Lingayat and Veerashaiva faiths. This is also an indication that the government is in a hurry to draw curtains on this issue, which is considered a political hot potato with polls round the corner.According to sources, the committee comprises Kannada Development Authority chairman S G Siddaramaiah; Jawaharlal Nehru University Kannada Language chair Purushothama Bilimale; University of Mysore political science professor Muzaffar Assadi; former backward classes commission chairman C S Dwarakanath; journalist Sarjoo Katkar and litterateur Ramakrishna Marathe.The Veerashaiva and Lingayat camps, comprising leaders from the Congress, have been at loggerheads over the issue. The Veerashaiva group comprises veteran Congress leader Shamanur Shivashankarappa, his son and Horticulture Minister S S Mallikarjun and Municipalities Minister Eshwar B Khandre. They hold that Veerashaiva and Lingayat are the same and that the separate religion should be christened Veerashaiva-Lingayat. Veerashaivas say their religion predates 12th-century reformer Basavanna, revered as the founder of the Lingayat faith. Veerashaivas revere a pantheon of holy men.The Lingayat camp, led by Water Resources Minister M B Patil, Mines and Geology Minister Vinay Kulkarni and Higher Education Minister Basavaraj Rayareddy, argues that Veerashaiva and Lingayat are radically different, and the religion must be called Lingayat. This group says it goes by the ideals of Basavanna.BJP state chief B S Yeddyurappa said his party will side with the All India Veerashaiva Mahasabha, whereas JD(S) supremo H D Deve Gowda has accused the ruling Congress of creating a divide among Veerashaivas and Lingayats.Watch DH video series on Lingayat religion row."

Picture by Amit BhelariPatna: Before leaving for Ranchi for the verdict in a fodder scam case, RJD chief Lalu Prasad on Friday stuck to the vegetarian diet prescribed by his astrologer Shankar Charan Tripathi, who is also national spokesperson of the party.After an olive oil massage and a bath, Lalu soaked in some winter sun at his home, 10 Circular Road. At around 11:30am, Tripathi's SUV arrived. ""Do you know that on his suggestion only I have quit non-vegetarian food? I have become vegetarian now,"" Lalu told The Telegraph.Half an hour later he asked for lunch. His personal helper Azgar brought the food and kept it on a table. Lalu asked another person to keep fanning with a piece of cloth to keep the flies away.Lalu's lunch comprised saathi rice dal, a brinjal, potato and palak dish, a pumpkin preparation, tomato chutney, raw tamarind chutney, coriander and kundru. He rounded off the meal with fried green chana with a dash of salt.Saathi rice, from a paddy variety mainly grown in the Champaran region which becomes ready in 60 days, is considered auspicious in most north Bihar districts, including Lalu's native Gopalganj.Lalu ate heartily, using a spoon and leaving a bit on the plate as is his habit, and also asked RJD national vice-president Shivanand Tiwari to have lunch but he declined politely. Lalu's wife Rabri Devi was sitting next to her husband.Asked if he had any prediction for Saturday's judgment, Tripathi said: ""No, prediction at all, he is the sun who gives light to everyone.

Just drink your lemon tea, you have half an hour left. At 3 pm, Lalu got into his SUV. Younger son Tejashwi Prasad Yadav followed, after touching the feet of his mother."
5b236aa39855b7429b317fcf,Changing Ethos Of Christmas Lunch,http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com//city/goa/changing-ethos-of-christmas-lunch/articleshow/62227339.cms,2017-12-24,"When you hear people saying its the season to be jolly, you undoubtedly know that it is Christmas time. Apart from the decor, cribs, carols, midnight mass, sweets and presents, if there is one much looked forward to festive tradition, it is that of the scrumptious Christmas lunch. Since Christmas and year-end festivities usually draw together family members who may be spread far and wide, the lunch is almost always a rather elaborate affair, sometimes going well into tea time.Recalling Christmas memories of her younger days, homemaker Nirmala Fernandes says, Back then, the Christmas lunch spread was akin to a feast spread, featuring a range of traditional delicacies such as pulao, sorpotel, sannas, beef or pork roast, beef stew and sometimes a whole chicken or suckling that would be roasted, she says, adding that the platter of Christmas sweets, which doubled up as dessert, was what they looked forward to the most since many of the items would be prepared only during the festive season.Of late though, the western influence seems to have heavily dominated festive eating habits. An increasing number of people today opt for items such as stuffed turkey, roasted duck, leg of lamb, pork belly, along with their accompaniments such stuffing, sauces, salads and steamed and sauteed exotic vegetables to be the highlight of the lunch.Kirit Maganlal of Magsons Superstore, which caters to such requirements on a pre-order basis, says that the trend, which is as recent as about five years, has numerous takers. Earlier, such meal choices were restricted to five-star venues. Now, however, their affordability and the ease of availability means that more people are able to enjoy these choices, which would otherwise be considered exotic, Maganlal says. Ask him about the clientele for these offerings and he says that opposed to the view that it is mostly the foreigners settled in Goa who opt for their ready-for-the-table, pre-cooked meal offerings, almost 80% of those who place orders with them are Goans.Talking about this western influence, Raia-based Fatima Moniz , who conducts cooking classes, says that closer to the season, she mostly gets demands for classes for stuffed chicken, leg of ham, salted tongue and other such delicacies. We anyway have the added advantage of the food legacy left behind by the Portuguese, which has become an important part of our cuisine, she adds.For chef Vasquito Alvares , the raging trend this year is the honey-glazed whole leg of lamb.As for the many Goans settled in the West, Christmas is a time for going back to the roots of sorts. David DSouza, who resides in Canada and manages the popular page dedicated to Goan food titled Traditional Goan Foodies on a social networking site says Christmas lunch for them is about heartily tucking into traditional favourites such as potato chops, sorpotel, roast beef, chicken xacuti, pulao and salad. In fact, in the run-up to Christmas, sorpotel has emerged as a hot favorite on the page. While many Goans are seeing what folks in the West are doing and adopting those food trends, we Goans, who are away from home, miss our traditional foods and are sticking with those."

He has now become the poster-boy of defaults.The liquor baron was not wise about his activities during the days of default, Gopinath said, referring to him as a political football, who borrowed money when the Congress-led UPA government was in power.Without naming political parties, he pointed out that one party was disgruntled that Mallya was allowed to leave the country, while the other blamed the former for not taking adequate action against him for defaulting.He also acknowledged that Mallya is a poster boy for loan defaults, and hence, both parties politically find him too close for comfort.Politicians from both parties have been seen socialising with Mallya, and have been witness to his overindulgent habits including Formula One races, and IPL matches, yet they accuse each other, Gopinath pointed out.Reiterating that Mallya is not a victim of any political conspiracy, Gopinath once again said he has become a hot potato for all, which has led him to be politically abandoned.Gopinath was critical of the fact that Mallya fled the country and hinted that he should have paid back his dues using the wealth from his other companies.I think he should have acted sooner by mobilising funds from his other liquor companies and rescued Kingfisher Airlines. But it was too late, he said, adding that if competitor Spicejet could be saved, Kingfisher could have also been saved.While speaking about the factors leading to KFAs indebtedness, Gopinath conceded that the money required for the acquisition of Air Deccan could have been one of the factors, but underscored that Mallya was forced to buy the low-cost airline to make it eligible to fly overseas.A domestic airline would not be allowed to fly overseas unless it has completed five years of local operations, which discriminated (against) Mallya. It was to favour Jet. Since he was competing against Jet Airways at that time, and wanted to fly international, he bought Air Deccan to overcome the five year rule, Gopinath said.He (Mallya) asked the government to relax FDI in aviation, which at that time barred foreign airlines investing in Indian carriers. Jet opposed it and the government did not allow. But when his airline (KFA) was grounded, hastily this policy was changed and the government permitted Indian carriers to get up to 49 per cent equity from overseas airlines, Gopinath said.Gopinath also said that the luxury airline business model introduced by Mallya was not fit for the Indian market. In his latest innings in the aviation sector, Gopinaths Air Deccan started flights under the UDAAN scheme which aims to improve connectivity between smaller towns and larger cities."

(AP Photo/File) Airstrikes target Islamic State positions on the edge of the Old City. (AP Photo/File)The morgue in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul was where atrocity met bureaucracy. Here was the processing point for the victims of the machine of butchery that the Islamic State group created during nearly three years of rule in large parts of Iraq and Syria. Every day, the doctors and staff witnessed the worst of what the militants were capable of inflicting on human beings, constantly fearing they could be next.Yet the morgue men of Mosul found ways large and small to defy their captors by honoring the dead as best they could. Some days, up to 100 bodies would stream into the facility. They included the mangled casualties of bombardment or fighting between the militants and the U.S.-led coalition and Iraqi forces. Others had suffered the grotesque punishments that IS dealt out to those it considered criminals.The records kept by the morgue contain monstrous details.One Excel sheet documents more than 1,200 people who were shot in the head, a likely sign of IS executions, between June 2014 and January 2017, a period covering most of IS rule. Thats an average of 11 a week. Among them were 16 boys and six girls under the age of 14. It notes 12 women stoned to death, the IS punishment for those suspected of illicit sex. It also lists 95 people who were beheaded and 50 men and boys who died from a fall from a height, likely hurled from rooftops, the sentence for those suspected of being gay.In general, it was forbidden to return these victims bodies to their families. Instead, they disappeared into mass graves. The records are not complete, and thousands are known to have been thrown directly into mass graves without ever coming to the morgue.Here is a look at some of the men of Mosuls morgue and how they tried to keep hold of their humanity amid relentless brutality.RESCUED FROM MASS GRAVESRaid Jassim, the chief medical assistant at the morgue, arranged the meeting in a parking garage at night. You brought her? the businessman asked. Yes, Jassim replied. The man broke into tears and hugged him in gratitude. Jassim then opened his cars trunk so they could pull out the body of the mans wife.Jassim and other staffers tried to do this whenever they could, sneaking bodies out of the morgue to return them to their families and keep them out of mass graves. They had to do it secretly, cutting off electricity to turn off the morgue security cameras. In this case, the woman had been killed on accusations of spying.The 48-year-old Jassim recounted how IS fighters slaughtered two captives right in front of the morgue staff, decapitating one and shooting the others. Jassim himself was given 30 lashes for smoking, a crime under IS, and he was severely beaten after he refused to forge a death certificate for a fighter.In 2005, Jassim had been overjoyed to get a government posting at the morgue. The pay was several times more than what hed earn in a government hospital. He was a graduate of a medical institute, a two-year diploma after high school, and had gone on to serve as an army nurse.But now he has been left scarred, unable to sleep without taking several valium every night. Pressure, pressure, pressure, he said. I always expected them to come at any moment and kill or behead us.LESS THAN FOUR MINUTESA 35-year-old medical assistant, Sameh al-Azzawi tried to help families by sewing the heads back on the bodies of those IS decapitated. This was strictly forbidden by the militants, so al-Azzawi did it in secret at night, working quickly. He got to the point he could stitch a head back on in four minutes.But he stopped when one day an IS fighter discovered a body with the head sewn back on and threatened to decapitate whoever did it. Al-Azzawi, a father of three, graduated from a medical institute in Mosul in 2008 and worked in a hospital for several years before being assigned to the morgue in 2012.The time under the Islamic State group has left him a broken man.He found one of his cousins among the bodies arriving at the morgue _ IS had shot him in the head for allegedly feeding information to the Iraqi government. Al-Azzawi later tried to escape with smugglers, hiding in a truck under boxes of potato chips, but he was caught and had to sign a statement acknowledging that he would be punished by death if he tried to flee again.After that, the terror wrecked him: Anything they ask for I do without complaint.BURYING THE TRAUMAThe senior examiner at the morgue, Modhar al-Omari could only watch helplessly as the victims of the Islamic State group flowed in and the militants imposed their terror even on the morgues staff. Our profession as doctors is all about humanity _ respecting life, he said. They were doing the exact opposite.The 43-year-old veteran doctor and surgeon was well known among his staff for his calm. He was used to wearing suits, but under IS he was forced to wear the Islamic garb of shortened pants and a long beard that the group said was the style of the Prophet Muhammad.His job was to sign off on the cause of death for victims brutalized corpses. As a forensics doctor, he also had to investigate the crimes of the living _ like signing medical examinations of whether women accused of adultery were virgins or not.He got some revenge by passing on information. He secretly told the government in Baghdad when several senior commanders were killed in airstrikes.But he says he has never cried for the dead.You cant talk or explain. You just keep it inside, he says. If I cried, Id cry every day for every single body.For all the latest World News, download Indian Express App"
5b2e7c049855b72640115e51,Diabetes: A father sues to curb junk food in India...,http://www.deccanherald.com/content/650246/diabetes-father-sues-curb-junk.html,2017-12-26,"Rahul Verma's son was born gravely ill with digestive problems, but over years of visits to the boy's endocrinologist, Verma saw the doctor grow increasingly alarmed about a different problem, one threatening healthy children. Junk food, the doctor warned, was especially dangerous to Indians, who are far more prone to diabetes than people from other parts of the world.One day in the doctor's waiting room, Verma noticed a girl who had gotten fat by compulsively eating potato chips. He decided he had to do something. ""On one side you have children like my son, who are born with problems,"" said Verma, ""and on the other side you have children who are healthy and everything is fine and you are damaging them giving them unhealthy food.""Verma, who had no legal training, sat late into the nights with his wife, Tullika, drafting a petition in their tiny apartment. He filed the public interest lawsuit in Delhi High Court in 2010, seeking a ban on the sale of junk food and soft drinks in and around schools across India.The case has propelled court-ordered regulations of the food industry to the doorstep of the Indian government, where they have languished. They have outsized importance in India, population 1.3 billion, because its people are far more likely to develop diabetes - which can lead to heart disease, kidney failure, blindness and amputations - as they gain weight than people from other regions, according to health experts.Since 1990, the percent of children and adults in India who are overweight or obese has almost tripled to 18.8% from 6.4%, according to data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. The International Diabetes Federation projects that the number of Indians with diabetes will soar to 123 million by 2040 as diets rich in carbohydrates and fat spread to less affluent rural areas. ""We are sitting on a volcano,"" said Dr Anoop Misra, chairman of a diabetes hospital at Fortis Healthcare, one of India's biggest private hospital chains.In the years since the court ordered the government to develop guidelines to regulate junk food, the case has encountered ferocious opposition from the All India Food Processors Association, which counts Coca-Cola India, PepsiCo India and Nestl India as members, as well as hundreds of other companies.Subodh Jindal, president of the association, said in an interview that junk food was unfairly blamed for diabetes and obesity. It was overeating, not the food itself, that has caused the problem, he said. The government this year took a significant step that public health experts believe will help combat the rise of obesity. It partially implemented a tax on sugar sweetened beverages, instituting a 40% tax on such drinks that are carbonated, though not on juices made with added sugars that many children drink.But so far, the regulations to ban sales near schools sought by the court in Verma's case have led to naught. As the case has played out on Twitter and in newspapers, some schools have voluntarily stopped serving junk food.Verma, 42, quit his job as a corporate marketing executive after his son's birth in 2006 and set up a foundation in 2007 to help families like his with sick children. At one point, though, Verma begged the judge to let him withdraw the petition.But Chief Justice Dipak Misra refused. Instead, spotting a senior advocate, Neeraj Kishan Kaul, in the courtroom, the judge ordered him to act as the pro bono lawyer for Verma's case. As Kaul, 54, approached the bench, he recalled, he joked to the judge, ""You've got the wrong guy. I like junk food.""Scientists searched for genes that predisposed Indians to diabetes, but did not find them. Instead, a growing body of research suggests that Indians' body type - one that is smaller but with more abdominal fat - may be responsible.Being born to a malnourished woman - a common phenomenon in India - may also increase the odds of developing diabetes.Dr Chittaranjan Yajnik, a diabetes specialist, and Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, are among the researchers exploring a theory that Indians evolved what Yajnik has called ""a thin-fat"" body type over millenniums as a way to survive famines when monsoons failed.In the 1990s, Yajnik began following the pregnancies of hundreds of women in villages outside Pune, a city in western India, and tested their offspring as they grew up.Compared with infants in Britain, Indian newborns were about 1.5 pounds lighter but had more abdominal fat and higher levels of certain hormones in their cord blood, he found, suggesting a predisposition to diabetes.Yajnik said he believes Indians' susceptibility to diabetes may have emerged as their diets changed with rising affluence - and that their bodies, attuned to scarcity, couldn't handle an overload of food. Although obesity and overweight are far less prevalent in India (24%) than in Canada (60%), for example, adults there are just as likely to develop diabetes as in Canada, a New York Times analysis of data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation found.Insatiable hungerIn the years since Verma filed his suit, sales of packaged foods have increased 138%; fast food 83%; and carbonated drinks 58%, according to Euromonitor International, the market research firm. Coca-Cola Co's chief executive James Quincey, in an interview earlier this year, said that he expected the Indian market to eventually become the company's third largest in sales, up from sixth.Coca-Cola and PepsiCo have announced plans to invest billions of dollars in the Indian market. They have also said they plan to increase their offerings of drinks with less sugar and more fruit.Sanjay Khajuria, a Nestl India spokesman, said the food processors association, which opposed Verma's case, had ""taken into account inputs received by the association from its members,"" and declined further comment. He also noted that the company has joined other companies in India to restrict advertising directed at children younger than 12 to products with a certain level of nutrients. A Coca-Cola spokesman referred questions on the lawsuit to the food association. PepsiCo India's vice president of sales, Harsh K. Rai, also declined to comment on the lawsuit. He said the company has stopped advertising to children 12 and younger.In early 2015, the food authority in the Health Ministry finally recommended regulations to the court, including some limitations on the sale of junk food around schools. The judge ordered the recommendations carried out within three months. Instead, the food authority appointed yet another committee.Agarwal, chief executive of the food authority, insisted his agency is finally ready to start adopting new rules early next year for labeling healthy food with a green light and those high in fat, sugar and salt with a red light. But he said taxing junk food and banning it around schools were long term goals. ""There is no point in confronting industry on these issues,"" he said.Verma was emphatic that someone needs to continue the fight; he is just not sure that someone is him. He is convinced the unending legal battle gave him high blood pressure.His former partner on the case, pro bono lawyer Kaul, said India needs more than Verma to make change happen. ""You need a movement to fight the inertia of the system,"" he said, sipping a can of Coke."
5b2e14fc9855b74d9fcd36ce,Paika revolt in NCERT book,https://www.telegraphindia.com/states/odisha/paika-revolt-in-ncert-book-196251?ref=odisha-new-stry,2017-12-26,"Basant Kumar MohantyNew Delhi: The NCERT has decided to include Paika rebellion of Odisha of the early 19th century in Class VIII history textbooks.The move has led historians to raise demand for inclusion of content of other regional rebellions in history books.In a written reply to a question in Lok Sabha, minister of state for human resource development Satya Pal Singh said that 'Paika Bidroha' of 1817 would be included in Class VIII history textbook of the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).The rebellion was led Buxi Jagabandhu, a commander of then Khurda king, against the British. It is one of the earliest resistance movements by the people of Odisha against colonial rule. Of late, this historical event has become a political hot potato for both the BJP and the BJD in Odisha. Chief minister and BJD chief Naveen Patnaik has written to the Centre to declare the rebellion as the first war of Independence.The uprising of 1857 is popularly known as the First War of Independence though the government has not officially granted any such status to it. Upasana Mohapatra, the great granddaughter of Buxi Jagabandhu, has joined the BJP at a function in Bhubaneswar in October in the presence of petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan.Her father late Lulu Mohapatra was a Congress leader till his death last year. Earlier on July 20, the NDA government organised a function here to celebrate 200 years of the popular uprising.To a question by Congress leader Mullapally Ramachandran, the junior HRD minister said other than the 'Paikas', ordinary peasants, landholders and salt-makers had all risen in unison against the British during this period making it a popular movement. ""Later, in 1857, we see a movement or uprising of similar nature though on a much larger scale. Therefore, from a historical point of view it can be said that the 'Paika Bidroha' had set an example for the classes as well as the masses in India to follow later on as and when circumstances so warranted,"" the minister said.""Therefore, considering that this is one of the beginnings of popular uprisings against the British in India, it has been decided to include it as a 'case-study' in the Class VIII history textbook of NCERT, which deals with the 1857 event,"" he added.Case study in NCERT books refers to small boxes describing certain significant events of the past.However, historians demanded that the NCERT should have included text on other such uprising of that time like the Poligar rebellion of Tamil Nadu of 1799 and the Santhal rebellion of 1855 in present day Jharkhand.A few years ago, some scholars from Tamil Nadu had demanded that Poligar rebellion be declared the first war of Independence. When the matter was referred to the Indian Council of Historical Research (ICHR), the council said the demand had no merit.""It is a good thing that students will get to know about rebellions taking part of various parts of the country. But contemporary rebellion of all parts of the country should be included in the books,"" Saradindu Mukherjee, a member of the ICHR said.A faculty of history from Jawaharlal Nehru University said NCERT books earlier used to avoid giving texts on events having regional significance, but gave importance to developments of national scale. ""Now the decisions to include and exclude texts are taken under political pressure,"" the faculty member said. Sources in the NCERT said a panel took the decision to include Paika rebellion in the textbook without much debate. There is no specific policy on what to be included or excluded.Despite efforts, NCERT director Hrushikesh Senapati was not available for comment on the demand for inclusion of other revolts."
